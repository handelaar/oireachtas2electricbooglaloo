      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will report on the outcome of the Attorney General's examination of the constitutional implications of the Crotty judgment on the Single European Act for other international treaties.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The scope and application of the judgment in the Crotty case are at issue in proceedings currently pending before the High Court.  In these circumstances it would not be appropriate, as yet, to arrive at final conclusions as to the implications of the judgment.  As I have already indicated, I will be in touch with the leaders of the other political parties in the House, once the examination has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Taoiseach's reply that the Attorney General has not completed his report, or that he has not completed his report but that the Taoiseach wishes to keep it confidential at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A little of both.  He has completed his own assessment in so far <Col N="2114" /> as it is within his capacity to do so, but the McGimpsey case is current and may affect the final outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach at this stage rule out the possibility of the need for a second referendum arising out of the Single European Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give an assurance that adequate control exists in this country over secret and security services and that he is regularly kept informed of the activities of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility for ensuring that adequate control exists in the security area rests primarily with the Ministers concerned who keep me informed to the extent that is appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach confirm that the Ministers concerned are the Ministers for Justice and for Defence and that there are no other Ministers involved?  Secondly, arising from the activities of a secret service from another jurisdiction elsewhere on this island, would the Taoiseach tell the House if there is, within this State, an equivalent secret service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the other part of my question, the Taoiseach <Col N="2115" /> referred to the Ministers for Defence and for Justice only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that an elite group are operating within the secret services or the security services of the State which have, among other things, the power to change their number plates at will?  Given the fact that there must be a certain amount of discretion, would the Taoiseach tell the House how democratic control and accountability are maintained with regard to these services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any doubt about this, I want to make it absolutely clear that the only security services in this country are a matter of public knowledge, financed through Departmental Estimates and totally under the control of the two Ministers mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach in respect of each of the following (1) Mr. Bertie Ahern, TD, Minister for Labour, (2) Mr. Vincent Brady, TD (3) Mr. Michael Smith, TD (4) Mr. Joe Walsh, TD (5) Mr. Seán McCarthy, TD (6) Mr. Ger Connolly, TD (7) Mr. Terry Leyden, <Col N="2116" /> TD (8) Mr. Pat the Cope Gallagher, TD (9) Mr. Denis Lyons, TD (10) Mr. Frank Fahey, TD (11) Mr. Noel Treacy, TD (12)  Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, TD and (13) any other members of the Government, the special consideration which justifies their continuing membership of local authorities and health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the continuing membership of the bodies in question arises from concern to avoid causing any untimely disruption of the important business of local administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach cannot find suitable replacements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach discussed with any members of his Cabinet or any Ministers of State the likely timing of their resignations from local authorities, or has he secured from them any commitments that they will obey the standing principle of this House which the Taoiseach himself announced on 3 March last and said applied to this Government?  That was that Ministers and Ministers of State should, as soon as conveniently possible after their appointment, relinquish their membership of local authorities unless there was a short period of their office as members of a local authority still outstanding or, alternatively, unless there were some special considerations.  Clearly, there is not a short period of their term of office on local authorities outstanding.  Therefore, the question must arise in relation to each of them of what special consideration applies.  Special means special to each of them and not special to members of the Taoiseach's party when in Government. Does the Taoiseach abide by a constitutional convention?  If he expects other people to abide by it, he should do so himself on this occasion and root these members out of the local authorities.</P>

Beidh ar mhná tí sa Ghaeltacht a thuilleann deontais ó mo Roinnse faoi Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge an coinníoll sin a chomhlíonadh.  Tá scéal dá réir curtha chucu.</P>

An nglacann sé leis freisin go gcuirfidh sé seo isteach go mór ar an scéim sin, go gcuirfidh sé faitíos ar a lán de na mná tí aon bhaint a bheith acu leis an scéim, agus go bhfuil a lán acu chun éirí as má dhéantar é?

An nglacfaidh sé leis nach fiú méid chomh beag sin a chur ar fáil, nach mbeidh sé in ann mórán oibre a dhéanamh leis agus go bhfuil bóithre i gContae na Gaillimhe a bhféadfaí iomlán an airgid seo a chaitheamh orthu chun caoi cheart a chur orthu, tá siad imithe chomh dona sin?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to have a reasonable prospect of success, any approach to the European Communities seeking a contribution to the International Fund for Ireland would require to be made on a joint basis by both the Irish and British Governments. Despite lengthy discussions on the issue and repeated efforts on our part, the British Government have been unwilling to consider the matter until agreement is reached on the Community's overall budgetary arrangements.  In the light of <Col N="2123" /> the agreement reached at last week's Council in Brussels, it is my intention to raise this issue with the British authorities at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to welcome the Minister back after his illness. I am glad to see him back and well again. I am grateful for the Minister's reply and I am glad he has changed his mind about going ahead on his own and looking for support for the EC.  There is only one way to get support for the EC International Fund and that is jointly with the British Government and he should impress that on the British Government. Application should be made next week because the fund is doing a lot of good and is giving the people of the North of Ireland a lot more confidence in the Anglo-Irish Agreement than are this Government.  Therefore the more money there is in the fund the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are concerned about the case of the Guildford Four where there is evidence to suggest that there may have been a miscarriage of justice.</P>
      <P>The British Home Secretary, in response to my representations and the representations of others, has ordered a police inquiry into new evidence which has come to light.  I understand from the Home Secretary that he will decide in the light of this police investigation what further action to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Guildford Four have already spent 13 years in prison, even if the Home Secretary, when the findings of the police inquiry are announced &mdash; it has taken quite some time to do so &mdash; then refers the case to the Court of Appeal it would take at least another year before coming before the courts.  Since those people were imprisoned extensive evidence has come to light, including the confessions of the actual bombers who are now in prison, which demonstrates their innocence.  In these circumstances will the Minister make direct personal representations to <Col N="2125" /> the British Government to request clemency for these prisoners, particularly in view of the outcome of the Birmingham Six appeal?</P>

To take up the point raised by Deputy Gregory, I wish to ask the Minister if the Home Secretary does not see fit to grant clemency to the Guildford Four, will the Minister express concern to the Home Secretary that this State has reservations about the Guildford Four's case now being dealt with in the Court of Appeal, as an alternative to clemency, having regard to the manner in which the Birmingham Six case was dealt with.  As an alternative to the Court of Appeal reexamination of the Guildford Four case will he suggest to the Home Secretary as the second best alternative to clemency, the establishment of a separate judicial tribunal to re-examine the entire Guildford Four case together with all new evidence that has now become available?</P>

      <P>We want to see the mandate of the Special Representative renewed and will do what we can, during the current session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva to ensure that this is done.

We are among the nations in the United Nations seeking to activate the United Nations in a positive way to renew and indeed strengthen the mandate of the UN special representative in the area.

If such a position is represented at the meeting referred to in the questions, will it be the Minister's position to say that Ireland will support the continuing presence of the United Nations representative?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 16 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>In a statement to the Dáil on 5 November last, the Government expressed support for the Esquipulas II Agreement of 7 August 1987 and called on countries with links to and interests in Central America to lend constructive support to the peace efforts of the Central American States and themselves to make an effective contribution towards achieving peace.  This is also the public joint position of the Twelve.  We greatly welcome any development facilitating implementation of the agreement, one of the important provisions of which is the cessation of outside aid to irregular forces or insurrectionist movements in Central America.  Therefore we share the view of the President of Costa Rica that outside military aid to insurgents in the region should cease.  I intend to avail of the opportunity provided by the forthcoming ministerial conference of the States of the European Community, Central America and the Contadora Group in Hamburg on 29 February and 1 March, at first hand, to welcome the progress the Central American States have already made and to urge them to fulfil, unconditionally and without delay, their outstanding obligations under the Esquipulas II Agreement.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for outlining our Government's explicit commitment to the Arias plan, which is the spirit of this House, or the consensus that the Minister has indicated. At the forthcoming meetings in Hamburg on 29 February and 1 March, will the Minister be suggesting that the request for food aid by Nicaragua be met by the Community?  I further ask the Minister &mdash; because I am aware that his <Col N="2131" /> office, that of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and of the Taoiseach have had a message conveyed to them from the Nicaraguan Ambassador in London specifically requesting aid in the form of 3,000 metric tonnes of dried milk &mdash; if that request will be met by the Irish Government, directly or indirectly, through the Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for Community aid.  Nicaragua already received substantial aid from the Community &mdash; in fact, they received 21 per cent of all European Community aid to Central America, and rightly so.  We made a contribution towards that aid.  I will certainly be suggesting or pushing that if the need outlined by Deputy M.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 28, 38 and 52 together. We have confirmed, through diplomatic channels, that the British Ministry of Defence are considering ocean dumping as one of the options for disposing of the decommissioned nuclear submarine <i>Dreadnought</i>.  However, in response to our inquiries the British authorities have informed us that no decision as to how the vessel is to be disposed of has yet been taken by them.</P>
      <P>We have made a <i>démarche</i> to the British authorities indicating that we are totally opposed to the idea of disposing of the <i>Dreadnought</i> or its reactor at sea and have sought an assurance from them that this option will be ruled out.

      <P>There are a number of options open to us.  We have taken the initial step of lodging a protest to the British authorities.  Under the EURATOM Treaty we can take action as well &mdash; there are specific provisions contained in Articles 34 and 38 of that treaty which give a role to the European Commission in the matter.  We are considering having recourse to these articles.  That is another avenue that is being pursued.  We would deplore any development of this kind &mdash; that is, the dumping of massive amounts of toxic substances in the ocean &mdash; anywhere in the world but particularly <Col N="2134" /> anywhere adjacent to our waters.  We are not the only country involved.  Every coastal country, particularly those of western Europe, is involved and we are seeking ways and means of mobilising their support.</P>

The British authorities are signatories to EURATOM treaties and there is legal action the Commission can take under EURATOM agreements.  All these matters are being investigated at present.  The precise legal liabilities to which the British Government may leave themselves open internationally are being investigated.  That is the most fruitful line we can follow, apart from making protests which we have done.  The important thing is to use whatever legal mechanisms are there under international law to prevent this dumping from taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The embassy in London visited Miss Shanahan and brought to the attention of the Home Office the matters she asked to be raised concerning her conditions of detention.  It would appear that there has been some improvement in her conditions. The embassy have recently visited Miss Shanahan a second time and have, as a result, raised further matters concerning her conditions of detention. The embassy will be actively following up these matters.</P>
      <P>With regard to Miss Shanahan's bail application, it is not the practice of my Department to act as bailperson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned that, in the absence of any real evidence against her, Martina Shanahan is already six months on remand and <Col N="2137" /> according to her solicitor will most likely remain on remand until next September at the earliest, that while she has been tried and convicted by sections of the British media, she is 23 hours a day in solitary confinment and is regularly denied even her one hour's exercise, that all this could have a most detrimental effect on her mental and physical state and will militate against her getting a fair trial?  In view of all that, does he not agree that her bail application offers her the only real hope of preparing adequately to defend herself at her trial? Is there not anything he or his Department can do to assist with that bail application, which will be coming up on 29 February and which is so vital if she is not to remain in the harsh and inhuman condition of solitary confinment for perhaps another year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Embassy in London have taken a particular interest in Miss Shanahan's case and in the case of her colleagues.  An official has been assigned full time to ensure that Miss Shanahan gets proper treatment.  She is very appreciative of this attention and for the improvements she has been granted by the British authorities, improvements to which she was entitled and which we secured for her.  The question of acting as bailsperson is another matter.  Up to now we have not done this and we would be creating a very dangerous precedent if the State were to offer itself as a bailsperson. All we can do is what has already been done most effectively, that is, to detail an official in the embassy to take a particular interest in a case, to regularly visit the people concerned and to see that they get the rights to which they are entitled.  Some people were not getting their basic prison rights until the embassy intervened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to two sets of representations.  On what date was the most recent representation made on behalf of Martina Shanahan and what was the nature of those representations? Is the Minister aware that while there was some easing of her prison conditions <Col N="2138" /> following initial representations, during the last three weeks, conditions have reverted to the way they were previously? Is the Minister also aware, as Deputy Gregory said, that Miss Shanahan is now 23 hours a day in solitary confinement, and, some days, 24 hours a day when she is deprived of her exercise rights?  Will the Minister agree that that is unacceptable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that any treatment of that kind is unacceptable. However, in case we are getting our lines crossed, I should like to say that there was a specific visit from the official of the embassy, who has been assigned a particular role in this respect, to Miss Shanahan on 3 February.  At that meeting some of the matters raised by Deputy Shatter were mentioned by Miss Shanahan and are being pursued by the Irish Embassy with the British authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a letter dated 8 February and, on the basis of the information in it, I ask the Minister to make additional representations in this matter. I am aware that Deputy Shatter and others interested in the case may have a copy of this letter, which is from a brother of Martina Shanahan, in which he quite clearly states that conditions have deteriorated further.  For instance, the concession she had to watch television has been withdrawn and on some occasions her daily exercise is stopped. On the basis of her human rights, I ask the Minister to make additional representations on her behalf as it now looks as if this girl will spend one year in solitary confinement before she is brought to trial.  According to the information I received from her solicitor, Gareth Pierce, the trial will not take place until September when, because of her state of mind, she will not be able to defend herself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last visit from the embassy official, Mr. O'Reilly, was on 3 February and there was a previous visit on 3 December when these matters were raised which are now being taken up with the British authorities.  I agree that this <Col N="2139" /> case requires constant attention because it appears that, on the slightest pretext, privileges are withdrawn.  At the minimum, Miss Shanahan should be subject to ordinary prison regulations.  I will take this matter up immediately with the embassy and find out what has happened since the visit on 3 February.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Miss Shanahan wrote to me from Risley Remand Centre and I should like to confirm what other Deputies have said, that after the initial visit there was an improvement in her conditions but that the situation has deteriorated rapidly in recent weeks.  Miss Shanahan's concern, at this stage, is to know what response the Irish Embassy received to its representations to the Home Office.  Was there any acknowledgment by the Home Office that she was receiving treatment which went beyond the level normally given to a woman prisoner in Britain?</P>

She said she had been well looked after as a result of a previous visit by the embassy official but that matters had now deteriorated. We are currently taking up this matter with the British authorities so that she will be accorded her rights, to which she is entitled.  In case there is any suggestion of neglect, I want to assure the House that there are very good relations between the embassy and Miss Shanahan and she is very appreciative of their efforts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that when an Irish national is brought before the courts in England for allegedly being involved in an offence which results in him or her being kept in these type of prison conditions, the judicial process should take place as rapidly as possible? It is unacceptable that someone should be held in this way even for six months &mdash; let alone a year &mdash; and I ask the Minister to consider making representations to the British authorities with a view to expediting her trial.  He should also protest at the length of time it is taking to process this matter to the stage of a trial. I suggest that in this jurisdiction it would not normally be tolerated that someone was so held in prison for what appears to be a projected period of at least one year prior to their case coming to trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Passport Office provides a good standard of service to the Irish public.  Last year we dealt with 185,000 applications, most of which were processed within a week. This level of service was maintained even at the height of the travel rush in May and June when reduced air fares to holiday destinations led to a significant increase in demand for urgent passports.</P>
      <P>The operation of the Passport Office is under constant review and work procedures, equipment and office layout are being continually reassessed in an effort to promote efficiency and enhance the service to the public.</P>
      <P>In line with this ongoing process of improvement, I have taken the following steps, first the introduction of a new telephone system which incorporates extra lines, a queuing system and, for after hours callers, a taped message setting out the basic requirements for applicants; second, a major structural alteration of the public waiting area in the office. These renovations which are currently nearing completion will provide larger and more comfortable accommodation for members of the public and, third, an updating of the office's computer system to take account of technological advances since the introduction of the system some ten years ago.</P>
      <P>In addition to the foregoing, talks have been held between representatives of the Irish Travel Agents' Association and officials of my Department on how to increase public awareness of the need to apply in good time for passports.  This is very important.  Over 60,000 leaflets have been distributed to members of the ITAA and other interested parties, whose co-operation I very much appreciate in this regard.  Plans are also in hand to launch in the very near future a publicity campaign in the national press and television to encourage the public to apply in good time for passports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in the previous years, I will monitor closely the level of applications and <Col N="2142" /> should the need arise I will arrange for extra temporary staff to be employed.</P>
    <P>I would point out that except in cases of genuine emergency, passports are not available on demand.  In order to avoid a last minute rush and the risk of not having their passport in time, I would appeal to those intending to holiday abroad this year to check that they have an up-to-date passport and, if not, to apply in good time by post when they will get immediate action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of a references to the possibility of an eventual European army having been made in connection with recent decisions on closer Franco-German co-operation in defence matters. Such co-operation does not affect us. Defence issues are outside the scope of the political co-operation to which we and our European partners are committed. In the Declaration made on ratification of the Single European Act the Government reaffirmed Ireland's policy of military neutrality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that while France and Germany are teasing out the prospects of a European army outside of NATO, in some years time that European army will emerge within the EC?  Is that not a natural development in the longer term?</P>

      <P>All I can give the Deputy and the House is the factual position which is that France and the Federal Republic of Germany have established a <Col N="2144" /> joint security and defence council.  They are in the process of setting up an experimental joint brigade based in Germany. That is strictly a bilateral matter between France and Germany and it is not a Community matter in any shape or form.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out one of the anomalies of Question Time. Question No. 9 was taken with No. 46, yet in regard to Question No. 45, the related question in my name, No. 17, was not taken.  I thought those questions were akin but it seems it does not work the other way around.  The purpose of Question No. 47 is to ask the Minister whether he is aware that the <i>Sunday Nation</i> published in Kenya on 17 January last had an article which said that, &ldquo;...demands ban on killer soap manufacture&rdquo;. Included in this article is an exhortation to people in the consumers' association <Col N="2145" /> in Kenya and individuals to write to Mr. Albert Reynolds, TD, Minister for Industry and Commerce, Kildare Street, Dublin, protesting about the fact that Ireland, which is a friendly country as far as the writer of the article is concerned, is exporting to African countries something which they would not use themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister is not aware of it.  Does he not think it is appalling that the major Sunday newspaper in Kenya carries this article about a friendly country like Ireland &mdash; a country which they looked to for a lead, a country to which a considerable amount of our aid goes and where there are 2,000 Irish citizens living.  This article extended to over two pages and contained the name of a Minister of the Irish Government, protesting about some of the goods we are exporting there.</P>

I regret, a Cheann Comhairle, that you sought to disallow that on the basis that a debate will be taking place in the House tomorrow.  The debate taking place in the House tomorrow is of no interest in regard to the subject matter of this question because it was asking that something be done about postponing the announcement to be made tonight.

The Minister of State at my Department for European Affairs Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, also attended in Brussels.</P>
      <P>I have had the agreed Overall Compromise paper laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, together with the draft Conclusions of the European Council.  It was accepted in Brussels that the latter are deemed to be adopted unless certain agricultural elements included are changed by a qualified majority at the Foreign Affairs Council on 22-23 February. It is a foregone conclusion that this will not happen but until after that meeting these detailed points must, strictly speaking, be described as draft conclusions.  The Overall Compromise paper sets out the agreements reached on the key questions discussed in Brussels last week.</P>

    <P>Before going in detail into the Conclusions of the Brussels Council, I should like to warmly welcome the outcome. The success of this Council was an important step for Europe and could legitimately be described as an historic breakthrough.  It provides the institutional and financial framework by the implementation of what has become known as the Delors Plan &mdash; for the completion of a Single Market for the whole Community, comprising 320 million people, by the year 1992.</P>
    <P>Success at the Brussels Council provides a new plateau for development in Europe from which we will all benefit. As Europe develops, Ireland progresses. Estimates of the effect of the Single Market on the European Community, published by the Commission, indicate that the member states of the Community will together gain by between £80 billion-£90 billion on the completion of the Market, as a result of greater market efficiencies.  The Brussels Council provides secure financing for the Community. Within this framework it underpins the future of European agriculture, by providing a firm financial basis for the CAP and it contains key mechanisms in accordance with the cohesion articles of the Single European Act to bring the less favoured regions, including Ireland, up to the overall Community level of prosperity.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Brussels Council, the structural funds will be doubled in real terms over the period to 1992 for the regions in greatest need of structural <Col N="2264" /> reform, including this country.  This will mean a substantial increase in resources. At present Irish receipts from the funds are about £300 million a year.  The guideline which has been entered in the records requires the Commission to ensure that GNP <i>per capita</i> in the member state will be a criterion to be taken into account in determining the least prosperous regions for which a special effort will be undertaken.  Ireland will be included in these regions.  The precise effect of this requirement in money terms is impossible to calculate at present but I can assure the House that it will be substantial &mdash; running into hundreds of millions of pounds by 1992.</P>
    <P>The new basis agreed for contribution to the Community's own resource budget will save Ireland about £20 million in 1988.  This is about 7 per cent of our total contribution.  This saving will rise to about £25 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>On cereals, despite considerable pressure to set a lower quota or production limit, the Council agreed that there should be no penalty up to a limit of 160 million tonnes which is about the current level of production.  A new system of set aside for which there will be 50 per cent EC recoupment will be introduced.  It will be available for 20 per cent of arable land for not less than five years.  The land may be put into fallow grass or used for forestry or other purposes not involving the output of products in surplus.</P>
    <P>In Irish terms, these gains are substantial. They must, however, be considered against the likely effects for this country of the elimination of internal frontiers, and the effect of the new and tighter budgetary disciplines, as they affect agriculture.  Our concern must be to make sure that the central states do not gain disproportionately in comparison with those at the periphery.  The aim must be that Europe and Ireland together will make substantial gains from the implementation of the plan now given the go-ahead in Brussels.</P>
    <P>I will now go in detail into what was decided at Brussels, taking first the increase in own resources agreed there. These will now be within a global limit of <Col N="2265" /> 1.2 per cent of Community gross national product for payments from the Community budget and 1.3 per cent for commitments.</P>
    <P>These resources will be provided through a significant change in the way in which member states contributions are determined.</P>
    <P>Contributions at present are based largely on VAT, with each country last year paying 1.4 per cent of its VAT base.  The problem with this system is that it gives anomalous results, since the VAT base varies quite a lot between countries as a proportion of GNP &mdash; from 42 per cent in Italy, to 62.5 per cent in Ireland and 70 per cent in Portugal.  GNP is generally accepted as a good measure of prosperity and ability to pay, so that those with a high VAT share have been paying more than their fair share.</P>
    <P>A straight switch to using GNP as the basis for contributions would have solved this problem but would have involved unacceptable increases in contributions for some countries.  The compromise reached is a rather complex one which removes the major anomalies.  The 1.4 per cent VAT contribution will be retained, but the base on which it will be charged will be limited to 55 per cent of GNP.  That means that Ireland will not be charged 1.4 per cent of its full VAT base, since this VAT base is about 62 per cent of GNP but will be charged only on a lower notional VAT base equal to 55 per cent of GNP.  Ireland will save about £20 million in the current year as a result of this change, rising to about £25 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>In addition, the extra resources being provided to the Community over and above the 1.4 per cent VAT will be charged on the basis of GNP.</P>
    <P>The intention is to have the necessary legal decisions adopted by the Council of Ministers by 31 May next, in order for it to be finally approved, after ratification by the national parliaments before the end of 1988, with retrospective effect from 1 January 1988.</P>
    <P>This will give a much more equitable distribution of the burden over the years to 1992.  A further improvement on the <Col N="2266" /> existing situation is that henceforth the correction of budgetary imbalances, primarily the British abatement, will be carried out in such a way that the amount of own resources available for Community policies will not be reduced.  It is envisaged that the system will be reviewed again before 1992.  There will be a further saving of £6 million to this country in regard to the British abatement.</P>
    <P>The Brussels negotiations had major implications for Irish agriculture.  The Commission proposals were designed to put a strict limit on agricultural expenditure and contain production around current levels.  Clearly we could not oppose reasonable limits in the agricultural area.  From the outset we were, however, determined to ensure that the Common Agricultural Policy would remain effective and continue to provide a realistic support base for Irish agriculture. In this we were successful, as the arrangements agreed demonstrate.</P>
    <P>The critical issue was the base figure for agricultural expenditure.  If this were seriously inadequate then the policy as it applied to all sectors &mdash; including the beef and milk areas &mdash; would be in jeopardy. This figure has been fixed at a level &mdash; 27.5 billion ECU &mdash; which takes reasonable account of current policy needs. Given the possibility of an increase in expenditure on agriculture in future years at a rate equivalent to up to 80 per cent of the increase in Community GNP, this should provide a secure, even if tight, base for agricultural expenditure.  This is particularly the case when account is taken of the fact that special and adequate provision has been made for the disposal of old stocks and that the cost of this disposal will fall outside the guideline figure.  Special provision has also been made to cover exceptional increases in agricultural expenditure due to fluctuations in the dollar or a failure on the part of other world producers to match the discipline of the Community or to meet their international obligations.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for dealing with production increases were, in the case of most sectors, largely worked out in the Agriculture Council.  That Council had, <Col N="2267" /> however, been unable to finalise the cereals issue and this became an important topic in our discussions at this Summit, as it had been also in Copenhagen.  In the end, we reached agreement on a Community limit of 160 million tonnes &mdash; or 5 million tonnes higher than that proposed by the Commission &mdash; and on a system which provides for more limited penalties on excess production than those proposed by the Commission or included in the Copenhagen compromise.  While accepting that some restrictions in this sector were inevitable and, indeed, at Community level necessary for the overall viability of the CAP as a whole, we were determined to avoid a threshold or penalty system which would marginalise Irish cereals production.  We also agreed to the set aside arrangements to compensate farmers who opt out of crop production and so reduce the danger of production overruns.  In the case of the level of aid likely to apply in Ireland, the Community would contribute 50 per cent of the cost of the programme.</P>
    <P>Finally on cereals, we adopted resolutions calling on the Commission to negotiate in the GATT to secure a solution to the problem of cereal substitute imports and to propose measures to encourage the incorporation of cereals in animal feed.  Thus we can reasonably look forward to action internally and externally to create a better balance between cereals and substitutes.</P>
    <P>The measures to contain production in the other sectors went through more or less in line with the majority view of the Agriculture Council.  These arrangements do not, of course, involve additional measures in the beef or milk sectors, which account for some 75 per cent of Irish production &mdash; although they do involve some reduction in the compensation for suspended milk quotas after 1988-89.  They involve a settlement of the deficit problem in the sugar sector in a way that is favourable to the Irish sugar industry.</P>
    <P>All in all the agricultural negotiations have been concluded satisfactorily from our point of view.  The important thing is <Col N="2268" /> that the basis of the CAP has been secured and we can hope to see an end to the constant sniping against the policy from critics within and outside the Community.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the detail of the meeting, the amount to be provided for the structural funds, by way of commitment, will be doubled by 1993 in comparison with 1987 &mdash; reaching a figure of 13 billion ECU in 1992 in comparison with 7 billion ECU in 1987.  Within these totals, the contributions for the less developed regions will be doubled by 1992, with a special effort being undertaken for aid to the least prosperous regions, among which Ireland will be included.</P>
    <P>A further very important element is, under the detailed conclusions, that the percentage rates of assistance from the funds will be differentiated in favour of the less developed regions.  Within these regions, the rate could be up to 75 per cent compared with the previous maximum of 55 per cent.  This means that where in general, we have hitherto had to match Community finance by national finance on the basis of £1 for £1, for the future £1 of eligible national expenditure will be matched by up to £3 from the funds.  This will ensure that we can take up the moneys available, while still pursuing the Government's programme to restore order to the public finances.</P>
    <P>I cannot conclude without paying tribute to the magnificent efforts by the German Presidency to bring the Council to such an eminently successful conclusion. Chancellor Kohl in his capacity as chairman of the meeting missed no opportunity to accommodate widely divergent views, and to press for agreement. In his efforts to reach consensus, he was ably assisted by Foreign Minister Genscher.  Both leaders gave extraordinarily effective leadership and a stimulus to the meeting.  At the same time, the success would not have been possible without the will of the assembled Heads of State or Government to reach agreement.  It was clear to me that every Prime Minister present was willing to make a contribution, in the interests of the Community, to agreed conclusions. <Col N="2269" /> The work of President Delors and his colleagues from the Commission and of the Commission and Council officials in making suggestions and finding agreed formulae really showed extraordinary political skill, dedication and commitment. After 17 hours of virtually continuous meeting on the day and night of the 12 and morning of the 13 February &mdash; following a very full meeting the previous day &mdash; those around the table made it clear that they were not prepared to accept defeat and finally reached consensus on those aspects of the Delors Plan before them for decision.</P>
    <P>It was a meeting at which the European ideal was paramount, and each participant was agreeable to yield a little so that the people of Europe might gain greatly in future years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach concluded by saying that the meeting of the European Council was one at which each participant was agreeable to yield a little. Having examined very carefully the document which the Taoiseach laid before the House I am not at all convinced that each was prepared to yield a little.  It seems that some yielded more than others and the Taoiseach was one of those who yielded most.  The results of the Council fell a good deal short of what many of us felt entitled to expect on foot of the commitments entered into under the Single European Act.  In June and December of last year the European Council failed to discharge its obligations to the people of the Community, and last week it finally arrived at an agreement which still leaves us with cause for worry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been agreed that expenditure under the Community structural funds will increase by 76 per cent between now and 1992.  The clear political commitment of the member states during the negotiation of the Single European Act was that expenditure would be doubled by that date.  It appears that there is a further undertaking for further increases in 1993, but reading the documentation, all of the references are to appropriation commitments and not to appropriations for expenditure.  In fact, it very much <Col N="2270" /> depends on the course taken by the individual member states as to whether the result on the ground will turn out to have brought about that increase in expenditure. The undertakings, as far as they are given, involve an undertaking to double the commitment appropriations. If the intention is to double the actual expenditure on the ground, why is the language in the final agreement couched in such evasive terms?  The Taoiseach should not have accepted that kind of equivocation because it leaves a doubt as to the real nature of the commitment.</P>
    <P>The Council also decided that agriculture expenditure in the Community should not increase at an annual rate greater than 80 per cent of the rate of growth of GDP within the Community. The expectation is that GDP will grow in nominal terms by about 5 per cent per annum over the next few years, with real growth being at around 1½ to 2½ per cent. On this basis real growth in agriculture expenditure would be between .5 per cent and 1 per cent.  If nominal growth in Community GDP turns out to be 4 per cent or less, agricultural expenditure could decline in real terms, even at a time of increase in real expenditure in the overall Community budget.  That augurs badly for a country as dependent on agriculture and agriculture based industry as Ireland.</P>
    <P>We should remember that when we speak of agriculture expenditure we are speaking of matters which affect our farming community intimately on a daily basis and about matters which affect the very substantial proportion of our people who derive their living from processing and marketing agricultural products and from supplying inputs and services to agriculture and the processing industries. The decision of the European Council will make life more difficult for these people.  It will also put even greater pressure on cereal growers and milk producers and on those who depend on those categories for their living.  Those sectors are already feeling the pressure of greatly reduced margins and that kind of pressure on expenditure in the EAGGF will accentuate that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2271" /> I agree with the Taoiseach that the measures that have been taken in the definition of the base figure for agricultural expenditure are to be welcomed. That covers the main concerns we have in relation to that definition.  We have cause to note with some satisfaction that the question of the disposal of old stocks has been set apart from the definition of the base for expenditure.</P>
    <P>Defective as the agreement is in some respects, it has achieved one of the objectives set out by the Commission and one to which we all subscribe.  It has averted what we all expected to be a major financial crisis in the financing of the Community this year in a way which has brought a welcome element of certainty to the financial arrangments of the Community for the next four years.  The Commission and the German Presidency are to be congratulated on having achieved at least this objective in the face of obdurate resistance and obstruction by the Governments of some member states, and notably by the UK Government. Looking at the content of the agreement and the measures that have been put in place, I can see no reason why the European Council could not have agreed on all of this last year and spared us the displays of brinkmanship, the political tensions and the uncertainties which have been so much a feature of Community activity over the last eight months in particular.</P>
    <P>As far as the agreement on the Community structural funds is concerned, I regret that we did not have an unequivocal doubling of the funds by 1992.  On the other hand I welcome the fact that it has been agreed that the activities of these funds should be concentrated on the less well off regions of the Community, in Ireland, in Spain, in Portugal and in Greece.  In the case of the European Regional Fund it has been clear ever since that fund was set up some 13 years ago that the dispersion of its resources throughout the Community seriously impeded its ability to reduce the disparities in living standards, income per <Col N="2272" /> head and in levels of development between the regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the Commission have had an honourable record of attempts to secure a more equitable and more efficient use of resources with a view to reducing those disparities.  The Council of Ministers over the years have gone some way to taking account of the need for positive action by ensuring that smaller and poorer member states benefit from fund resources to a degree that is disproportionate compared to their population or their GNP.  The fact remains, however, that so far the fund has not had the effect which it was originally intended to have.  I hope these measures which have now been agreed by the European Council will give it a positive impetus in that direction.</P>
    <P>Broadly similar considerations apply in the case of the social fund and in the case of the agricultural structures fund.  In each of these cases this country has a greater need than our more prosperous neighbours for assistance from these funds.  In the one case our unemployment rate is higher than that of other member states and in the other, our higher dependence on agriculture and our need to expand and develop the value added to farming output by processing operations mean that development capital is of crucial importance to us.  The Community have gone some way to meeting our need in each case.</P>
    <P>The commitment to economic and social cohesion contained in the Single European Act means that there is a need to adopt an even more vigorous policy of what might be called positive discrimination in the allocation of resources from these funds in our case and in the case of the other less prosperous regions of the Community.  The European Council agreement on the concentration of resources in the poorer regions is to be welcomed as a very significant step and a substantial change of direction.  We must now prepare ourselves to use these extra funds to maximum advantage.  Under the present agreement, which provides for a 76 per cent increase in the resources of the Structural Funds by 1992, the allocation <Col N="2273" /> to Ireland, it appears, stands to be doubled to a level of approximately £600 million per annum.  We should take heed of the fact, emphasised by Commissioner Peter Sutherland last weekend, that allocations under these funds are not automatic. We have to produce projects which are worthy of support and which produce a return.  In any case, it is in our direct and immediate interest to do so.</P>
    <P>Allocations from these funds require a corresponding allocation from national resources, so we must make sure we get value for money both for the national contributions to qualifying projects and for the Community's contribution.  This means we have to be very discriminating in our choice of projects.  We should ensure that we have on stream a sufficient number of fully worked out projects to use the maximum possible allocation we can secure from these Funds, and planning should begin now.  We need to have several years in advance a properly worked out plan as to how we are going to use these extra resources to increase employment and generate income further downstream growth in our economy. Again, Commissioner Sutherland pointed out last weekend that we, in common with other member states, have wasted both Community and national funds in the past and that we cannot continue on that path.  Unproductive uses of national and Community funds do not simply disappoint our own people or result in the underachievement of our objective, but also put in question the solidity of our case for continued Community funding.</P>
    <P>The EAGGF is one of the areas to which we should pay particular attention. It appears that the agreement reached last week includes a provision that the assistance available to Ireland from the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and the EAGGF could be as much as 75 per cent. The document speaks of a maximum of 75 per cent and a minimum in any case of 50 per cent.  The document does not explain in what circumstances that maximum of 75 per cent would apply.  If it were applied, for example, in relation to livestock headage grants it could make <Col N="2274" /> a very substantial difference compared to the present situation.  To give only one example, it would be possible for the Government here with a constant level of national expenditure to double the combined amount of Community and national expenditure on these schemes. As they are at present a total expenditure of £1 million requires £0.5 million from national resources matched by £0.5 million from Community resources.  If the Community contribution is increased to 75 per cent, a national expenditure of £0.5 million will attract Community expenditure of £1.5 million, thereby doubling the total amount involved.</P>
    <P>The question would then arise for us as to whether we would use these extra funds to extend the coverage of the scheme by extending the disadvantaged areas or by using the extra funding on increasing the headage payments in existing areas or a combination of the two.  I believe that within the kind of parameters we are talking about, if this is an area which would attract 75 per cent Community funding, there would be room to do some of each.  In other words we could both increase the coverage of the schemes by extending the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas and at the same time provide for some increase in the level of headage grants paid in the designated areas.  That change, if indeed it applies in relation to these schemes, could open up a substantial prospect of a real incentive to do something we very urgently need, that is reverse the decline in our cattle breeding herd and lay the foundations for future growth, an area where the very timid and halfhearted schemes the Government have been attempting to cook up for the last six or eight months, now stalled, I understand, in the financial institutions, do not even begin to address the problem.  Perhaps this measure could address the problem in a significant way.</P>
    <P>I wonder if I am reading the Taoiseach correctly when I get the impression he is saying he does not intend to pursue this prospect.  Toward the end of his speech, speaking of this possibility of increasing the rate of recoupment to 75 per cent, <Col N="2275" /> the Taoiseach's conclusion was: &ldquo;This will ensure that we can take up the moneys available, while still pursuing the Government's programme to restore order to the public finances.&rdquo;  That objective is laudable enough in itself but I hope that does not mean the Taoiseach is indicating that none of the benefit of any extra recoupment would be passed on or used in the way I have indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach says that is not what he means.  I take it, therefore, that he is agreeing with me and I look forward to seeing the measures being put forward by the Minister for Agriculture that will convince me finally beyond any shadow of doubt that that is the case.  In that connection the Government have given no indication of any real concern in relation to this whole question of the disadvantaged areas, their extension and their reclassification.  We in Government submitted a proposal to Brussels on this whole matter.  I have seen no evidence that there has been any follow-up &mdash; I was going to say any energetic follow-up but I have seen evidence of no follow-up whatever by the present Government or the present Minister for Agriculture and Food except I understand that the Government put a revised proposal to Brussels last November. Again, the Minister for Agriculture and Food so far has not seen fit to tell anybody what it contains, whether it makes any further proposals for the designation of new areas or whether it makes any different proposals for reclassification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I have been able to find out is that it is rumoured that dairy cows would be entirely excluded under the revised proposal, a move I would utterly resist and against which I strongly advise the Minister. Of course, we just do not know because the Minister has refused to give details or any information in answering questions in this House on the matter.  It is just not acceptable that the Government and particularly the Minister for <Col N="2276" /> Agriculture and Food should be fainthearted about or, as it seems, downright uninterested in this matter when the Community is showing an increased concern with the problems of its less developed regions.  This, it seems to me, above any other moment should be the time when we should be pressing forward with schemes of that kind.</P>
    <P>In the context of an increase in the availability of Guidance Fund moneys, I would like to know whether there would be any improvement in the accountability of the Commission for its decisions on the allocation of funds to these projects. No satisfactory explanation has been given, for example, as to why such a small number of our aquaculture and mariculture projects have been assisted by the Fund notwithstanding the fact that our coastal waters are widely regarded as the most suitable location in the Community for projects of this kind.  We are entitled to know what the Government are doing about that, if, indeed, they are doing anything.</P>
    <P>In the cereal sector Irish producers are already in serious difficulties.  The disastrous harvesting conditions of 1985 and 1986 left cereal producers very deeply in debt when they needed several successive good harvests and firm prices to have any real prospect of trading themselves back into a position of any soundness.  The harvest of 1987 was only moderately good and this winter's wet weather has delayed sowing and the waterlogged condition of the land will delay spring sowing further. That is far from an auspicious start to the year.  We already have a co-responsibility levy of 3 per cent in the cereal sector. The decisions of the European Council will impose an extra levy which will be deducted at harvest and will be refunded only if production in the Community does not exceed 160 million tonnes.  If production exceeds that level the levy or a portion of it will be retained.  Again, if production exceeds that level, the price at the beginning of the following marketing year will be reduced by a corresponding percentage and the same procedure will apply in future marketing years.  In addition to that, it has also been decided <Col N="2277" /> to reduce the monthly increments in intervention prices from November through until May.  All of that would put downward pressure on cereal prices and make cereal growing a less and less viable proposition in our conditions.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the combination of all these factors will make life extremely difficult for cereal producers.  I sincerely hope that we will not find ourselves in the position where cereal production in this country falls so far that we will produce only a small proportion of our feed requirements because, in that case, we would be very much in the hands of the import channels that are available into this country and, as we know from past experience, our location and a number of other factors have always meant that prices tend to be higher in this country than elsewhere.  A reasonable level of domestic cereal production is important to us in terms of stabilising and bringing our cereal prices into a reasonable relationship with those of the other member states competing with us in pig production, poultry production and increasingly in milk and beef production where modern feeding methods require a much higher input of cereals than has been traditional.</P>
    <P>Taken together, all of the measures decided on by the European Council may very well resolve the Community's overall problem in relation to overproduction of some cereals but it will do so without giving any consideration whatever to the supply position in individual member states and particularly in Ireland.  We are a deficit market for grain and in view of that a reform of the system, based on quotas and national quotas, would have been much more in keeping with our interests and the requirements of the markets.  Indeed, it could be argued that a quota system would be far more suitable for the Community as a whole and could be a much more sensitive instrument of market management than the measures agreed by the European Council.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the overall decisions in relation to agriculture expenditure will inevitably put further pressure on milk producers.  The super-levy system <Col N="2278" /> is already biting deeply into the returns of Irish dairy farmers, notwithstanding the margin of preference which Deputy Austin Deasy secured for them while he was Minister for Agriculture.  The situation of milk producers with smaller quotas can only be described as dramatic. In the past few weeks I have met a succession of small dairy farmers from the midlands whose quotas, including flexi-milk, are in the region of 10,000 gallons to 15,000 gallons.  They found in their December statements from their co-op that not alone were they not going to get an income for the month of December but that they actually owed the co-op money on foot of the super-levy, and, not only that, but that there was no prospect whatever that they would be in a position of having any net payments in to them from the co-op until the beginning of the next milk quota year.</P>
    <P>The expenditure measures that have been taken offer absolutely no hope of any relief for those milk producers and they will find that pressure on them will only increase and that life will become more difficult.  The Taoiseach mentioned that the European Council agreed on a reduction in the compensation for suspended milk quotas after 1988-89.  I am not sure what the total effect of that is in terms of the Irish dairy sector.  I do not believe it is very large but that will be another area where margins and the possibility of making an income are going to be restricted, particularly in the context of the guidelines that have now been put into operation for total agricultural spending.</P>
    <P>The Council agreed on measures to take land out of cereal production.  As I understand it, a payment of some £67 per acre will be made to cereal producers who take a proportion of their land out of production and leave it fallow and a payment of £33 per acre will be made for land taken out of cereal production and turned over to grass production.  I gather further that it is expected that the national contribution to the cost of this measure will be in the region of £6 million. That again is another in a long list of areas where the Government have <Col N="2279" /> missed an opportunity.  There are a great many possible uses for good tillage land in the production of crops or products which are not in surplus.</P>
    <P>The European Council's decision clearly allows the use of set aside land for beef or lamb production although, as I have said, with a lower payment.  They also appear to contemplate, and the Taoiseach mentioned this, its use for forestry production.  There are a great many other uses that reasonable tillage land can be put to.  One I would mention, in particular, is the production of malting barley.  That is the sector where the Community do not have a surplus, where there is a firm market and where we can produce a good quality product to be sold in other Community countries, particularly in Germany.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Agriculture and Food was pressed to include such an alternative use of land taken out of feed barley, feed wheat or milling wheat production but I cannot see any evidence of any effort on his part to press this issue. Much of that land could be suitable for the production of soft fruit where there is a potential for developing here a market which would substitute for imports into the Community from third countries. Horticultural production, to mix the metaphor, would be another fruitful area for consideration.  Outlets could be developed there which would not in any way create a burden on the Community's financial resources.  The production of ornamental shrubbery is another possible area which could be considered.  So far as I can see, the Government have failed utterly to get across any of these potential uses to our Community partners.  Of course, it is not too late.  Grass and forestry have been mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I have said about the set aside programme recognises the fact that the European Council have agreed on the measure but I think I should point out that this measure in itself creates the danger of a renationalisation of agricultural policy.  There is a range of rates of payment and a scale of Community financing of these payments with the rate of Community financing declining as the rate of payment increases.  This is an area where the more prosperous member states can have an advantage if they wish to use it.  There are clear dangers in this from the point of view of those of us who favour truly common prices.</P>
      <P>One of the major disappointments of this European Council meeting is the fact that it appears to have made no progress whatever in taking the most obvious and practical step towards strengthening the European monetary system, that is, the integration of sterling into that system. There is no indication of any systematic pressure on the UK Government to take this step.  I believe our Government should be leading a movement in this direction since Ireland is the country which suffers most inconvenience from the fact that sterling is not part of the EMS.  I fully understand that the Fianna Fáil Party in Government always seem to have difficulty in handling Anglo-Irish relations but this matter is too important to allow sensible policies to be impeded by ancient prejudices and complexes.  It is a time for determined action and the Government should now be lining up allies among the member states in favour of a measure which would be, even in terms of the national interest of the UK, a very sensible step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was appalled to find in the documents which the Taoiseach gave us a reference to the continuation of these compensation arrangements for the UK.  I know that arrangement goes back quite some time and that the arrangement that was in place up to the last European <Col N="2281" /> Council meeting was negotiated at Fontainebleau first by the Minister for Finance and then by the Heads of State and Government.</P>
    <P>During that whole discussion we made it very clear, that is, those in my party directly involved in the negotiations, that we did not believe there was any objective justification whatever for this kind of refund or rebate.  I am disappointed to see that after quite an amount of effort, the other member states have still allowed themselves to be seduced by this particular idea.  There is no foundation whatever for it.  It is based on the proposition that the only measure of benefit from membership of the European Communities is what goes in through the budget and comes out on the other side of the budgetary process.  There are many in the EC who must know that that is only part of the picture and for some member states indeed only a very small part of it.</P>
    <P>We must look at what the conclusions of that European Council mean for the future.  Although, as I have said, they show a number of deficiencies, they nevertheless put the Community firmly on the path set out in the Single European Act.  We must prepare ourselves for what that involves.  In this connection Commissioner Sutherland today has suggested the creation of what he calls &ldquo;an action committee for 1992&rdquo; that would be composed of members of the Oireachtas, representatives of the trade union movement, of the farming and business communities and so on, to put together the wisdom and initiative in all of those groups to take all the various steps and to prepare ourselves for the day we will have a truly common market without boundaries in the European Communities. I commend that initiative because it would be one of the ways in which we could use the talents available in our society to ensure that we get the benefits and make the contribution to the Community which the Single European Act has opened up.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="2282" /> and Food on the part they played in the successful outcome overall to the EC Summit last week.  The agreement reached was the best that could have been achieved by any Government in the circumstances.  There were times over the past two days when it looked as if once again the EC political Leaders did not have the will to overcome their national interests and look towards the greater Europe promised and envisaged by the Single European Act.  For most of the Summit it appeared the Leaders were bogged down in the minutiae of grain tonnage rather than moving one iota towards the implementation of the commitment to economic and social cohesion in Europe in five years time.</P>
      <P>Thankfully a major disaster was averted at the eleventh hour.  By and large there were several positive features for this country agreed at the Summit. The new funding arrangements have been guaranteed up to 1992.  Agriculture has been reformed within a maintained Common Agricultural Policy which must go a long way towards giving security to farmers.  Finally, Ireland will undoubtedly benefit from the doubling of economic aid to poorer countries through the Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that at this Summit, as with all others, the overwhelmingly technical nature of the farming negotiations normally take precedence over greater political developments within the EC and between the EC and the world at large.  We rarely have an opportunity in this House to debate issues other than the day to day issues of particular packages and in this respect we miss out on not having a Foreign Affairs committee. In recent times there has been a major change in the thinking of many countries within Western Europe which have an association with the European Communities, countries such as Austria, Switzerland and Sweden which have negotiated trade arrangements with the EC.  Some of these countries operate under the umbrella of EFTA.  They are now reappraising their position, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the EC and as the Single European Act is being implemented.  When the EFTA <Col N="2283" /> countries met in December they urged the creation of what they called &ldquo;a single European economic space&rdquo; which would afford them many of the advantages of a common market without the responsibilities of agriculture.  They are, individually and collectively, reappraising their attitude to the EC.  In my view there is a real possibility that Norway will reconsider its decision to enter the EC and may lodge an application shortly. Furthermore and notwithstanding its treaty obligations on neutrality, Austria is reported to be considering applying for membership in the early nineties.</P>
    <P>The new relationship being considered by some of these EFTA countries pales into insignificance by comparison with the reappraisal which West Germany seems to be making with its Eastern partners. There appears to be a growing orientation within that country towards increased economic association with the members of COMICON, especially with its near neighbour, East Germany.  This growing West German enthusiasm to look east can be explained by the greater political <i>rapprochement</i> between the two Germanies and the greater liberalisation of the Russian economy by Mr. Gorbachev. There are reports that the COMICON countries are on the point of completing negotiations to have diplomatic relations with the EC for the first time.  The big fear for this country and for the EC would be that West Germany's enthusiasm to develop its eastern contacts and markets would lessen its commitment as the biggest and wealthiest partner within the EC.  In my view it is extremely important that this trend would not lead to a change in the balance of power within the EC.  Furthermore I recommend that the Government involve themselves in political contacts within the wider European context so that we should not lose out in any new alignments.</P>
    <P>We should also begin at this stage to look at the implications of the internal commitments we have undertaken to implement the Single European Act. With four budgets to go until 1992, what <Col N="2284" /> preparations are the Government making to equalise the VAT rates within the EC.  It appears there is a proposal to have two standard rates of VAT in each country, (1) from 4 per cent to 9 per cent and (2) from 14 per cent to 19 per cent. This proposal will have major revenue repercussions in Ireland.  We, together with Denmark and France, are the EC countries most dependent on indirect taxation. When this revenue dependency is considered in conjunction with Ireland's excessively high income tax rate and excise duties, the Irish are in effect being retaxed over and over again.  It must be recognised that the Department of Finance will not of their own accord rectify our tax structure under the Single European Act for 1992.  I ask whether the Government have begun to consider how they will equalise our VAT rates over the next four budgets?  I do not think they have begun to consider this.  I recommend also that the Government begin addressing this problem if we are to be in a position to benefit from a single European market in less than five years.</P>
    <P>There are other matters arising from the Single European Act which the Government should begin to address in a co-ordinated fashion at this stage, for example, the opening up of the banking industry in Ireland and the effect that would have.  This would open up EMS funds and interest rates to the business community here.  However, I wonder if this country has begun to do anything to attract foreign banks here in five years time?</P>
    <P>With the prospect of a cohesive market of 320 million people in Europe the time has also come for this country to reassess its attitude to foreign languages if our young people and industrialists are to maximise the benefits in 1992.  At present we spend £160 million on teaching the Irish language and £150 million on teaching English.  This compares with £40 million a year being spent on French, £3 million on German and £2 million on all the other languages.  How can we expect to sell on German, Spanish and other markets in five years time and to get the benefits of the Single European Act if we <Col N="2285" /> do not spend money now on teaching the languages of these markets to our business people?</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to deal with the next European Summit at Hanover when the Taoiseach, we are told, is due to nominate Ireland's next Commissioner.  I hope that above all else we will have learned the lessons of the past few years. I hope, that unlike past experience, the Taoiseach will nominate our new Commissioner in plenty of time so that he can negotiate a good portfolio and pursue the real possibility of securing the Presidency of the Commission for Ireland, a smaller country, in the next couple of years.</P>

      <P>That the Delors package, according to Commissioner Sutherland's assessment and that of the other Commissioners, has, by and large been achieved as the outcome of the summit is something which we must welcome.  I should like to put on record the concern of my party at the total lack of preparedness of this Government to avail of the benefits of the increased and enlarged structural funds.  It is simply no use for any Taoiseach to announce in this House, <Col N="2286" /> as if it were a type of personal achievement, that the structural funds are to be enlarged to the tune of 100 per cent when we are no longer in a position to make maximum use of what that means.  The reality now is that, for the first time in an integrated and a much better policed way than previously was the case, access to these enlarged funds will be given only to those countries that can provide and table detailed integrated programmes as distinct from proposals, which was the experience with regard to the Social Fund and, to a much greater extent, the Regional Fund.</P>
      <P>This Government, tragically, have no proposals for local government reform. They have, tragically, no proposals for any kind of regional structures which by definition will be the mechanism which will enable people to qualify for and benefit from regional and structural aid directly and immediately.  While there has been a debate over the past two years, since the tabling of the Delors package by the Commission with the Council, I think in 1985, no work of any substance that I am aware of has been done by the Government in the area of gearing up to benefit from the integrated regional aid which we can only get under the new enlargement of the structural funds.  I would invite the Taoiseach at a suitable opportunity to correct my information if it is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak with some experience, having been involved with the Social Fund during my period in office, when it was of critical importance to large sectors of industry in our society.  It is quite clear from the Taoiseach's comments and those of the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dukes, that excessive dependency is now being focused once again on the agricultural sector.  I remind the House that 16 per cent of the labour force is involved in agriculture and by the time 1992 comes probably less than 10 per cent of the labour force will be directly involved in agriculture.  When we joined the Community in 1973, 26 per cent of the labour force was directly involved in agriculture and the norm of the European level is somewhere of the order of <Col N="2287" /> between 6 per cent and 9 per cent.  We need to look critically at how the benefits of the enlarged market can be applied to resolve the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I know the Taoiseach felt the necessity to be brief but tragically the statement makes no reference to the fact that there are 16 million unemployed Europeans within the Community of 320 million. That is twice the total number of active farmers in the entire Community and no mention has been made of them in this or any of the statements made so far in this House.  Unless the enlargement of the structural funds which will in part be paid for by the European taxpayer can be made relevant to those who are unemployed in our society &mdash; many will be coming out of agriculture because of the change in structure &mdash; we cannot be happy with the outcome of membership of the Common Market as it was known when we joined it, the European Community as we now refer to it.</P>
    <P>I shall give a more specific illustration. There will be many claims &mdash; indeed, I already heard the President of the IFA, with the outstretched láimh looking for extra assistance for farmers on Saturday afternoon last when the announcement was made &mdash; for the increasing of disadvantaged areas, of headage payments in this or that area.  I would remind this House of a statistic that I came across in recent research.  Just under 10 per cent of total unemployment in population terms in this State, occupies less than 0.4 per cent of the land mass of the State, concentrated in pockets or ghettos of unemployment of unprecedented proportions. I am referring to the greater Dublin area between Tallaght and Clondalkin. Unless we can provide an integrated programme through the structural funds to address many of the structural difficulties of those people, the report that the Taoiseach has given to the House and the possible benefit to the Community at large will have no relevance to these people.</P>
    <P>We within the Labour Party welcome the fact that some degree of logic has <Col N="2288" /> been introduced into the Common Agricultural Policy without destroying its base, which is a very good achievement after much difficult negotiation.  I recognise and pay tribute, not so much to the summit but to the achievement because I think that the Taoiseach would agree that the bulk of the work was done in previous councils.  Nevertheless, finally we have got some degree of rationality built into the CAP.  We have finally dealt with the problem of own resources in a manner which is much more equitable because of its references to GDP and GNP rather than the VAT base.</P>
    <P>There are many positive things which have come out of this summit.  The Taoiseach is to be congratulated, as are the other Prime Ministers and Heads of State who were involved in this summit.  I urge, on behalf of the 16 million unemployed Europeans, which figure is likely to go closer to 20 million by the year in which the internal market is completed, that unless we make a reality out of the provisions for cohesion which were built into the Single European Market, we will not be able to give any degree of comfort to the Irish voters in relation to the outcome of this summit.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make is specifically in relation to availing of the benefits of the structural funds in so far as this can affect and improve the situation for people living in the greater Dublin area, or any urban area.  I repeat that what we need is a structured regional approach to availing of these funds.  I listened to the briefing which Commissioner Sutherland gave to the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC meeting this afternoon that some kind of coherent action programme should be initiated on a collective basis involving the social partners and the Oireachtas on this issue. Commissioner Sutherland spoke in terms of the forthcoming internal market which is, as Deputy Kennedy has mentioned, four budgets away and that is a very short timetable for those involved in this House.  He said that at present, in a survey published in the British <i>Independent</i> newspaper in terms of those business communities and people within the <Col N="2289" /> business community who are aware of the completion of the internal market and its implications for their businesses, 78 per cent of French businesses were aware of the market, 57 per cent Spanish, 18 per cent West German, 5 per cent UK and, allowing for some degree of extrapolation which would be reasonable, it is probably true to say that less than 10 per cent of Irish businesses are aware of the full implications of the completion of the internal market.</P>
    <P>Already we have been informed that of the 300 barriers identified by the Commission in terms of directives or areas that need harmonisation, 70 have been completed, 124 are now agreed in principle, subject to approval, and 100 remain outstanding.  Of these 100, many are of a non-contentious nature, or of a size or implication that is not significant. Despite many of the comments that have been made in different journals and by different people, the fact that the Government have now succeeded in getting agreement at the Brussels summit will bring us very close to the deadline of 1992, if not into 1993 or 1994, but very close in terms of how this economy will reap the full benefit of the advantages of the completed market.  Unless there is an integrated programme approach prepared for now and detailed in terms of an integrated programme for Dublin, for example, and a road structure that enables us to transport the kinds of goods and services that we are capable of producing in this economy, we shall miss the boat.</P>
    <P>I urge the Taoiseach, his Government and the Minister for Industry, and Commerce, who is present, not to be mesmerised by the obsession of so many people in this House with the immediate benefits to the agricultural community that this measure can bring about, but to recognise that simply announcing a doubling of the structural funds of itself will be of no value unless we are in a position to respond.  Quite frankly, on the evidence I have obtained from Government sources to date, I do not believe we are sufficiently prepared to put in formal applications of a kind that <Col N="2290" /> will maximise, to the tune of 75 per cent, access to these funds to which the Taoiseach referred.</P>
    <P>In that regard there should be some enlarged role for the committee on secondary legislation and for the Members of the Oireachtas in this area where there is a consensus.  It is something that the Government could usefully consider.  We have enough issues of domestic concern on which we are divided and on which we argue with each other, but here we have an agreement within the context of an enlarged Community.  Somewhere in the middle of the next decade we will, without doubt, run the risk of missing the boat if we do not respond now to something that has taken two and a half years to put in place.</P>

      <P>Before referring specifically to the outcome of the talks in Brussels in regard to the Regional and Social Funds, with which I propose to deal, I propose to comment briefly on the remarks made by the Taoiseach with regard to his talks with the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. It is incomprehensible that at this point in time the British Prime Minister would not be aware of the very deep concern and anger that is felt by the people here, North and South, with regard to events recently concerning both the Birmingham Six and the Stalker-Sampson affair.</P>

      <P>Níl ach cúpla focal le rá agam.  Creidim gur ábhar tábhachtach é agus nílim chun aon rud a rá a chuirfeadh isteach ar na ráitisí atá ar siúl idir na hAirí agus Mr. King i láthair na huaire.  What I particularly want to say is that despite the anger and the incomprehension that exists in relation to the attitude of the British Government at the time in relation to the Birmingham Six and in relation to the Stalker Sampson Affair and the matters which have piled on top of that in recent days, it should go from this House that the <Col N="2291" /> question of scaling back in any way on security co-operation between the security forces both in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland should not arise.  That is a matter which should be beyond any question of negotiation.  It is a matter which concerns the life and limb of citizens, North and South, and should not be a matter for negotiation or scaling back.</P>
      <P>In relation to the EC Summit itself, what I have to say is that The Workers' Party have consistently argued that the Regional and Social Funds are potentially the most important instruments in the economic development of this State in terms of our membership of the EC.  The moneys allocated to these funds have never been adequate to meet the demands made on them, although it has to be said that Ireland has received a higher than average positive response to applications for funding, especially from the Social Fund.  The Regional Development Fund in particular could be of major economic benefit to Ireland because of the freedom to put such funds into production areas of our economy, such as the food processing industry, technology etc.</P>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Quinn with regard to the structures that are needed in order to ensure that these funds are used productively and are not frittered away is an important one.  The question of a foreign affairs committee has been raised yet again with regard to development in the EC and the need for a forum where a continuous debate could take place with regard to foreign affairs matters including the EC.  However, a foreign affairs committee on its own would not be adequate to deal with the kind of discussions that are needed with regard to developments that are to take place in the EC over the next three to four years.  So I will watch with interest the proposals, if any, that come from Government with regard to how the structures will be put in place to make the best use of the increased funding that has been won from the recent summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, there can be no doubt <Col N="2292" /> that the outcome of last week's EC summit, particularly the decision on increased social and regional funding for Ireland, was disappointing.  Any attempt by the Taoiseach to suggest otherwise is simply an effort to put a gloss on the outcome.  The proposed increases in the Social and Regional Funds for Ireland are quite inadequate and considerably below the level of funding that was promised would automatically flow from this country's ratification of the Single European Act.  I find it extraordinary that the Taoiseach should have consented to this shortchanging of Ireland by the wealthier members of the EC.  The Workers' Party have always believed that a doubling at least of structural funds was necessary to protect this country from the full impact of the completion of the internal market by 1992.  We have argued that, given the failure of Irish capitalism and successive Irish Governments to develop our economy and industrial infrastructure, particular measures were needed now to ensure that Ireland did not fall even further behind the wealthier countries of the EC.  This need has been recognised by many other people.  Only last week the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Maurice Doyle, speaking in Strasbourg and quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 11 February, stressed the need for the Community to devote more resources to the poorer member states and warning that Ireland did not join the EC to become what he called the Appalachia of western Europe. He said that economic and monetary integration would not necessarily improve the lot of the poorer countries and Irish concern about integration represented a real fear that the achievement of economic and monetary union could actually result in the further impoverishment of the less developed countries on the periphery of the Community.</P>
    <P>It was for these very reasons that we argued in the debate on the Single European Act that prior agreement on the extent of the increase in funding for the Social and Regional Funds should have been a pre-condition of ratification of that Single European Act.</P>
    <P>During the referendum campaign on <Col N="2293" /> the Single European Act we were assured by supporters of the Single European Act that the total allocation for the Community's Regional and Social Funds would be doubled and that Ireland would be entitled to the same percentage of the enlarged sum as it had received in previous years of the smaller sum.  This was the proposal made by the President of the EC Commission, Mr. Delors last year, but since then consistent efforts have been made by the wealthier EC countries to water down these proposals. If the commitment contained in the Delors proposals had been honoured, Ireland would have stood to get more than £860 million.  But it appears that the Taoiseach has settled for something less than £600 million.  It is significant that in his speech to the House here today he has not even attempted to put a figure on what he has accepted. Indeed it also appears that even this decision is subject to agreement being reached at the next EC summit on agricultural issues.  Of course it is by no means certain that agreement will be secured on these issues.  It is hard to believe that at a time when we need more financial assistance than ever the Taoiseach should have settled for such a reduction on what we had been promised, and that he should now be trying to pass off this failure as a great victory for this country.  Indeed, on the basis of the figures I have quoted, we are losing something like 30 per cent of the money promised both in terms of the Delors Plan and the promises made in this House by the supporters of the Single European Act when it was being debated here.</P>
    <P>It can now be seen that the advice we gave in the debate on the Single European Act that a firm, unambiguous commitment on the extent of the increases in structural funding should have been a pre-condition for ratification of the Single European Act was sound, political sense. Supporters of the Act told the public and this Dáil that this was a needless safeguard, but the Brussels summit has told us that the size of the Regional and Social Funds is regarded simply as a <Col N="2294" /> matter of trading and bargaining between the wealthier powers in the EC.  The outcome on that basis has been a deplorable failure of this Government.</P>

    <P>The draft regulations originally proposed to raise these limits, so as to fix the maximum single deposit at £3,000 and the maximum loan at £1,500.  In fact, in June last the Seanad considered the draft regulations and passed a motion approving the draft on the basis of these limits. However, since last June, I have further considered this question of the limits and as a result consider that the limit for a <Col N="2296" /> maximum single deposit should be raised to £5,000 and maximum loan to £2,500. These are intended merely to reflect realistic present day values and are not in any way intended to change the nature of the societies concerned from mutual help bodies or to permit them to carry on business in a commercial sense; that was never the purpose of these bodies and it is not intended now.  The Seanad has approved the revised draft of the regulations.</P>
    <P>In view of these increases the regulations will also require specially authorised loan societies to have supervisory committees.  In this way there will be an extra degree of supervision for these societies now that they will have the power to handle much larger sums of money.  I also intend to raise the monetary limits applying to all other friendly societies in regard to certain types of assurances under mutual self-help schemes and benefits payable from these. These limits were last set in 1966 and on reviewing them it was considered that more realistic limits should now be provided. It is proposed to increase the maximum benefit assurable to a member and to which a member is entitled to £10,000 and to set a similar limit on the amount a member may dispose of, on his death, by nomination or distributable when a member dies intestate.  The maximum amount payable on the death of a child would be £1,000.  Once again, these changes are not intended to permit any change in the mutual status of friendly societies.</P>
    <P>The regulations will also provide additional safeguards for members by requiring proper accounting and auditing procedures in all friendly societies.  As the amounts of money handled by friendly societies has grown over the years, provisions are included in the proposed regulations requiring each society to keep proper accounts, to retain the accounts of the six most recent years, to present accounts at each annual general meeting and to have the accounts audited each year by a properly qualified auditor.</P>
    <P>I now ask the House to approve the draft regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these regulations. I know it was intended to introduce them a long time ago.  As the second last Minister for Industry and Commerce I have a certain familiarity with them.  I realise it is very important to the societies concerned to have their limits raised.  The societies were virtually in a state of suspended animation because they could not function at the old limits.  It is regrettable that it has taken so long for the administrative machine to introduce these regulations. However, I compliment the Minister on doing so at this time.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he might consider amending the legislation to provide that the limits shall be calculable on the basis of a formula relating to the CPI which would be automatically raised each year on the basis of a statement published by the Minister in, say, <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  In that way they would be raised in line with this year's base by 3 per cent this time next year, presuming that is the rate of inflation.  Obviously we could not use different levels of inflation, for example, one person quoting the ESRI and another person quoting the CPI.  Somebody would need to say what rate of inflation is being used and the obvious person to do that is the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day.  I suggest that might be one way of dealing with the matter.  I realise that would require amendment of the Principal Act which is not what we are dealing with now but I ask the Minister to consider asking his officials to look at this matter.</P>
      <P>I know there is an immense amount of resistance to the idea of automatic indexation.  I recollect this being discussed in regard to limits for fines when we were in Government.  There are some offences in respect of which the overall limit for fines has not been altered since the 1870s.  I have suggested on a number of occasions that they should be automatically recalculated each year in line with the movements of the CPI.  This would mean the date on which they were first set or, if they were set anew, there would be such a formula operating from the date on which they were set anew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount <Col N="2298" /> of resistance to this from a variety of quarters, possibly because of a fear that there will be a lack of precision at any given time by any given judge sitting in any given court as to what were the limits on that day.  One can hardly expect judges to have to take out calculators and work out the consumer price index since the last maxima were set.  The solution would be the publication of a statement each year by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> which could be referred to by judges and other people in this area.  This would maintain the sense and purpose of the original decision of the Oireachtas.  Perhaps the Minister could consider that suggestion and discuss it with some of his colleagues.</P>
    <P>Another rather more serious matter which concerns me is the supervision of these societies.  This concern extends to credit unions.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the credit union advisory committee and their work.  I had some contact with them, particularly when in office, but also out of office.  I know they are very concerned about the level of supervision of credit unions.  They are worried that, at some time in the unforeseeable future, there might be a collapse of a credit union which could do immense damage to the whole movement and reflect on well known credit unions in a most unfortunate fashion.</P>
    <P>I note that, under these regulations, we are, for instance, deciding that the specially authorised loan societies should have supervisory committees.  I imagine that the same people who are supposed to be overseeing the credit unions will have to oversee whether or not this requirement is properly complied with or operated.  I note also that the regulations will now provide that all friendly societies will have to have proper accounting and auditing procedures.  Again, the question arises: who will enforce that requirement? Presumably, it will be the same people who are already overworked, understaffed and unable to deal fully and adequately with their responsibilities with regard to credit unions.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister, in fighting for more staff &mdash; and I speak from <Col N="2299" /> experience here &mdash; for this section is having to base his case on what might happen if he does not do what is sought. If he does get the extra staff there is one thing certain: he will get absolutely no credit for having done so.  Nobody will thank the Minister for having got extra staff for some supervisory body simply to avoid an accident that never occurs. Because, until an accident actually happens, nobody will appreciate the need for extra staff.  Probably people do appreciate the need for staff, for instance, at present in the area of insurance supervision where there have been two very serious collapses of insurance companies. Whether or not these collapses could have been foreseen or avoided by even more rigorous supervision than has applied to date is difficult to ascertain. One would accept that they certainly made the case for a substantial amount of supervision and overseeing by the Department.</P>
    <P>That raises the question of who is to pay for better supervision.  It appears to me that in the first place supervision, whether for credit unions or insurance companies, is in the interests of the entities themselves and, in the second, in the interests of the community as represented by the Minister.  If there is to be extra funding provided I would contend the first call should be on the societies who are being supervised, that they should be asked to pay some form of levy to provide for a better system of, if you like, supervision or quality insurance in regard to the product they are selling and that, in the second instance, obviously &mdash; as there is also a public interest involved &mdash; the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Finance should put up some of the money.</P>
    <P>I recollect raising this question when I was in office.  I am not too sure how far I pursued it, probably not very far, for a variety of reasons, there being many other things on my plate at the time.  As far as I can remember it was argued that there would be some impropriety involved in the Department of Industry <Col N="2300" /> and Commerce financing their supervisory operations by imposing a levy on the people who will be supervised, that in some fashion this might interfere with the arms length relationship that should exist between the supervisor and the supervised.  On reflection I do not accept that argument.  I would ask the Minister if he would, first, acknowledge that his Department are short of staff for supervision in this area and, if he does, would he agree that a levy to finance additional staff &mdash; perhaps on a £ for £ basis, for every £ subscribed by those being supervised, the Department would put up £1 extra &mdash; would constitute a good investment in ensuring that the valuable service provided to society by the friendly societies, by the credit unions and all these other voluntary organisations in the financial area, would be underpinned by a better system of quality insurance.  I ask the Minister to examine that.  However, these are all, if you like, points on the side.  The main issue is the approval of these regulations with which I heartily concur.</P>

      <P>I do not have any specialist knowledge in this area.  Nevertheless I am aware of concern expressed from time to time about how the lending societies or companies operate and the way in which at least some appear to go out of existence when there is any attempt made to have their books examined.</P>
      <P>I welcome the regulations and indeed the provision contained in the relevant Act requiring a motion to be introduced in this House to pass these regulations because it affords Deputies an opportunity to speak on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerning the actual implementation of the regulations and the supervision of the new procedures which will be required of the societies, like Deputy John Bruton, it appears to me there is not much point in requiring them to do certain things unless there is a procedure under which we can check that they are being followed correctly.  In the course of his remarks the Minister referred to the requirement that their books should be <Col N="2301" /> audited each year by a properly qualified auditor.  When replying perhaps the Minister would indicate what he meant by that.  I know there are people who qualify as accountants.  Perhaps there is a similar qualification in relation to auditors. In many cases &mdash; and I have come across some &mdash; people who have qualified as accountants will not necessarily be those who will carry out an independent examination of the accounts involved. Would the Minister indicate to the House whether such an auditor is required to be independent of the body whose books he is auditing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The auditor will be independent of the society, one recognised by the auditing profession and by the Minister under the provisions of the 1963 Act.</P>
      <P>I should say in regard to the suggestions raised by Deputy John Bruton, that we shall have them put into the machine and continue where he left off.  For the information of the House I might add that the supervision of building societies will shortly be transferred from the section to the Central Bank which will take some of the pressure off the supervisory staff.  We shall re-examine the position when that transfer has been effected.</P>

    <Title>Valuation Bill, 1987  [  Seanad ]:   Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill now before the House, which passed all Stages <Col N="2302" /> in Seanad Éireann prior to the Christmas recess, is a further step in the modernisation of the valuation code.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the rateable valuation assessed on properties under the Valuation Acts form the basis for the computation of rates and, as such, play a significant part in the system of local authority financing.  Rates revenue from commercial and industrial property amounted to £175 million in 1987.  It is, therefore, important that the valuation system be operated in a cost effective and equitable manner.  Efficient and flexible procedures for the listing of properties for valuation, determining valuations and the hearing of appeals must be available.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the existing code is rooted in mid-19th century legislation, the Valuation Act of 1986 being one of the few valuation statutes in the 20th century. During the passage of that Act, Members of both Houses expressed the view that far more radical changes were required. In response the then Minister for Finance explained that this was a major undertaking, that the Valuation Acts were being reviewed and that further legislation of a more comprehensive nature would follow later.  The proposals in this Bill represent very positive progress in the modernisation process.</P>
      <P>The examination of other aspects of the legislation is continuing and my objective is to introduce a single modern statute at the earliest possible date covering all aspects of valuation for rating purposes. I am sure that the House would welcome such a development and I will be glad to have the views of Members on the nature and content of such a statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is, first, to establish a Valuation Tribunal to hear appeals against rateable valuations determined by the Commissioner of Valuation in the course of first appeals to him.  This will replace the present system of appeal to the Circuit Court; second to introduce continuous revision of the valuation lists throughout the year in substitution for the existing single annual revision; third, to provide for the valuation of public utility undertakings on a global basis and the apportionment of the valuation <Col N="2303" /> between the functional areas of local authorities and fourth, to provide for the delegation of functions by the Commissioner of Valuation.</P>
    <P>I will now explain the background to the measures proposed and the consequences. First, the Valuation Tribunal: under existing law a first appeal against a valuation can be made to the Commissioner of Valuation.  His determination can then be appealed to the Circuit Court but it is now proposed to establish a tribunal to hear such appeals. Valuation appeals raise complex questions about technological developments, returns on investment, diverse uses of property, commercial practices and market trends, issues which are best decided by a specialised tribunal. Members of the valuation profession, both in the public and private sectors, and the rating authorities strongly support the establishment of a specialised appeal authority.</P>
    <P>The new Valuation Tribunal, to be appointed by the Minister for Finance, will consist of persons with professional competence and business experience in the area of property valuation and law. The intention is that the chairman and deputy chairmen will have legal qualifications. Determinations of the tribunal may be appealed to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the tribunal will issue written judgments setting forth the reasons for the determinations and that such reports will be available within a short period.  If the volume of work so demands, the tribunal may act by divisions and the question of sitting in different provincial centres can be considered also.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the second measure proposed in the Bill, the introduction of continuous revision of valuation.  At present listing and revision of property valuations works on an annual cycle.  The Valuation Office issue the valuations of listed properties to local authorities for publication on a statutory date, 1 November each year.  The process of appeal then begins together with the listing of properties, <Col N="2304" /> including new property for first-time valuation, for the following year's revision. Such requests for revision, which must be submitted to the Valuation Office by 14 February, average 60,000 per annum and form the largest part of the workload of the Valuation Office.  All of these requests have to be submitted during the same short period, and subsequently valued by a specified date, compelling both local authorities and the Valuation Office to operate within an inflexible system.</P>
    <P>Under the system of continuous revision now proposed, a ratepayer, a local authority or an officer of the Commissioner of Valuation may, at any time during the year, seek a revision of the valuation of property entered in the valuation lists or the inclusion of new property on the lists.  The commissioner will appoint persons from among his staff to investigate the requests for revision.  The revision work, in virtually all cases, will be completed within six months of receipt of the request.  However, it is necessary to allow for some flexibility in the residue of cases where the availability of documentation or other complications cause unavoidable delay in determining a valuation. The results of revisions will be incorporated in a list of valuations issued by the Valuation Office to rating authorities at quarterly intervals.  For rates purposes, the relevant valuations will be the latest ones available when a local authority meet to strike the rate in their rating area.  The commencement date of continuous revision will be fixed by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>Continuous revision will promote greater efficiency in operating the valuation system, and will also ensure that revisions can be quickly and regularly entered in the rate books.  I am confident that the change will be welcomed by local authorities and the professional valuation bodies.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the global valuation of public utility undertakings and the apportionment of such valuation across local authority areas.  The term &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; is applied to concerns such as the Electricity Supply <Col N="2305" /> Board which supply services to the public on a national or regional basis.  These undertakings consist of a number of main production units, such as an electricity generating station, but, in producing and distributing the service, they comprise a wider network of lines, pipes, cables or wires which are necessary to get their products to the consumer.  These &ldquo;appendages&rdquo; are an integral part of the undertaking and must therefore be included in the valuation.  Unfortunately, existing legislation does not readily permit the valuation of all such property. The only way in which the property of a public utility, such as the ESB, can be valued is to have every single item of property, which is widely distributed throughout the country, listed by each rating authority.</P>
    <P>The global basis of valuation, which will look at all the property of an undertaking, gets around this problem.  The global valuation will be based on an estimate of the effective capital value of the undertaking as a whole.  The Bill also provides that the global valuation may be apportioned by the Commissioner of Valuation across different local authority areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill provides for delegation of functions by the Commissioner of Valuation. Under the present legislation the commissioner has virtually no discretion to delegate any of his functions.  For instance, there are about 4,000 first appeals each year but each of these must be personally determined by the commissioner. Many of the appeals could be handled by the senior valuer staff in the Valuation Office if the commissioner had authority to delegate the authority to his officers in appropriate cases.  Delegation of functions, as proposed, will improve the operational efficiency of the Valuation Office and will enable the commissioner to concentrate on the more complex valuation cases, the management of the Valuation Office and the very necessary review of valuation legislation to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the detailed provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 defines the terms <Col N="2306" /> used.  Section 2 provides for the establishment of a Valuation Tribunal to hear appeals against determinations of the Commissioner of Valuation on first appeals.  Details of the constitution and procedures of the tribunal are given in the First Schedule.  The decision of the tribunal will be final subject to a right of appeal to the High Court on a question of law.  The tribunal will be established on a date to be fixed by ministerial order. Appeals already lodged and pending before the Circuit Court at the time of the establishment of the tribunal will not be affected.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for continuous revision of the Valuation Lists throughout the year.  A ratepayer, a local authority or an officer of the Commissioner of Valuation can seek a revision of the rateable valuation of property at any time. The Commissioner of Valuation will issue the results of revisions at quarterly intervals to local authorities.  The owner or occupier of any property listed for revision will be so notified by the rating authority which will also notify him of the outcome of the revision and his right to appeal against it to the Commissioner of Valuation.  The section also provides for appeals to the Valuation Tribunal against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation on first appeal and sets out the procedures involved.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the valuation of public utility undertakings on a global basis by the Commissioner of Valuation. The global valuation will be based on an estimate of the effective capital value of the undertaking as a whole.  The section also provides that the global valuation may be apportioned by the Commissioner of Valuation across different local authority areas on a basis to be fixed by ministerial order.  Any undertaking valued on a global basis will have the right of appeal to the Commissioner and the Valuation Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the procedures to be followed in the case of an appeal to the High Court on points of law arising from decisions of the Valuation Tribunal. Section 6 provides that the Commissioner of Valuation may delegate any of his <Col N="2307" /> functions under the Valuation Acts to any officer of the Commissioner.  Section 7 provides authority to set fees in respect of appeals to the Commissioner of Valuation or to the tribunal or in respect of an application made to the commissioner for the fixing of valuations.</P>
    <P>Section 8 empowers the Minister for Finance to prescribe the form of various documents required for the purpose of the Valuation Acts.  Section 9 contains the usual provision for the payment of expenses incurred in the administration of the Act.  Section 10 enables the Minister to deal by regulation with any unforeseen administrative difficulties which may arise in bringing the Act into operation. Any such regulation must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Section 11 provides for the laying of certain orders and regulations by the Minister for Finance before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 12 gives the short title of the Act.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule deals with the constitution, membership, terms and conditions of office, staffing, powers and procedures of the Valuation Tribunal to be established under section 2.  The Second Schedule relates to the property of public utility undertakings for the purpose of global valuation under section 4.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is part of an ongoing process in updating the Valuation Acts.  I looked recently at the Valuation Act, 1852, which was passed on 30 June of that year.  There has been a move to try to update these Acts and it is essential and urgent to do this so that there is one comprehensive Act in which all the other Acts are consolidated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech was detailed and helpful and I am sure many people will find it not just interesting but relevant.  I agree with some sections of the Bill and I disagree with others.  Section 2 refers to the establishment of a Valuation Tribunal which the Minister says will be welcomed by members of the valuation profession, both in the public and private sectors, <Col N="2308" /> and also by the rating authorities.  While that is true, there is no doubt that at least an equal number &mdash; of the people to whom I have spoken &mdash; of valuers and members of local authorities are very much in favour of allowing the appeals to remain within the province of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>I have come across many cases where the Circuit Court judge either resides in the area or has been in regular communication with it and, because of that, is better suited to make a totally independent decision regarding the valuation of a particular property.  I will not go into individual cases but I was an interested spectator &mdash; I had nothing to do with the case &mdash; at a court hearing regarding valuation of a business premises.  The Circuit Court judge knew the area very well. He listened to the views of the expert valuer and to the very fair case put forward by the Commissioner of Valuation He made the correct decision in coming down in favour of the person appealing the increase in valuation. Although the premises had been compared to others in the locality the judge took local factors into account as he knew the area so well.</P>
    <P>The setting up of an appeals tribunal may be beneficial in certain instances but when a decision is made by the Commissioner of Valuation to increase the valuation on a property and that decision goes before the Valuation Tribunal, the person's only recourse, if he is not happy with the tribunal's decision, is to appeal on a point of law to the High Court, if I understand the position correctly.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any objections to the Circuit Court making decisions on valuations.  I have not heard anybody say that the cost is onerous or that particular judges have been unreasonable. If a person is not entirely happy with a decision of the tribunal he should be able to go before the Circuit Court on a point of fact as distinct from a point of law.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, going back over the years, as the Ceann Comhairle is well aware, there were many criticisms about the decisions made by An Bord <Col N="2309" /> Pleanála.  The position has been well regularised and An Bord Pleanála are now an independent body.  The local authority decide whether or not a person gets planning permission.  If they decide he is not to get planning permission he can then appeal to An Bord Pleanála. In that instance the person deals with officials all the time.  The ordinary man in the street, whether or not he likes courts, at least feels he gets an open hearing in open court and everything is done above board.  The decision is reported in the local newspaper.  Everyone can see what decision was taken and it can be published.  That is a good thing. It is the right of the citizens of Ireland to go before a court and have their cases heard.  As the Minister is aware, I am a solicitor but I am not saying that with any particular interest because I have rarely been involved in evaluations.</P>
    <P>If people are aggrieved by An Bord Pleanála decisions on most occasions they feel they did not have a proper opportunity to put forward their viewpoint whereas in court, whether they are good witnesses or bad witnesses, and whether or not their counsel are good, at least they feel they have the opportunity to put their views forward in an open public forum.  I notice that the Act specifies that there will be a continuous review.  That is of importance and it is relevant.  The Minister said the average number of appeals was 60,000 per annum.  That is a huge number of requests for revision.  A continuous review will avoid that sort of situation occurring.  It will be of benefit to many people who, for one reason or another, do not get their applications for revision in by 14 February; they miss out and must go on to the next year.  It is welcome and it will be of benefit to the local authorities, to the Valuation Office and to the people concerned, the ordinary citizen who has a grievance about his valuation at a particular time.  That is to be heartily welcomed and I commend the Minister on taking that approach to it.</P>
    <P>During the past 18 or 19 years I have had a great many dealings with the Valuation Office and I would like to put <Col N="2310" /> on record that I have received unfailing courtesy and co-operation from the staff of that office.  This Bill came before the Seanad before Christmas.  Most public representatives I met have spoken of the efficiency and courtesy which they receive from that office.</P>
    <P>One of the matters referred to in the Bill is the question of global valuations but we can deal with that on Committee Stage.  I do not know exactly how this will be worked.  There is a reference to the ESB and to having their pylons included as appendages.  I would like that to be more precise but again we can deal with it on Committee Stage.  When we speak of a global valuation for the ESB I presume that will also apply to Bord an Móna, the IDA and all the semi-State bodies.  If we are speaking of a global valuation for the ESB and if the ESB's valuation is increased, that means their rates are increased and they have to look for the cost of the increase somewhere else and it will fall on the ordinary consumer. Similarly, in the case of Bord na Móna the increase will fall back on the consumer.  I will not dwell on this matter further because we can discuss it on Committee Stage.  I should like to put the Minister on notice that it is something I would like to have closely examined. Perhaps when the Minister is replying he might touch on the point as to whether there will be increases because that will be of interest to many of our semi-State bodies and the services which they provide.</P>
    <P>Another item which is of interest to me is the question of State properties.  An example of this is Portlaoise Prison.  The grant in lieu of rates to Portlaoise Prison was reduced by 10 per cent last year and this meant that, because they had not increased their rates Laois County Council suffered a loss of 10 per cent.  The reduction of 10 per cent was made by the Valuation Office.  I would like to know more about that.  Did it happen across the board?  If so, quite a number of counties suffered a loss in their incomes?  They were expecting to get a particular income from some Government Department but there was a 10 per cent reduction which <Col N="2311" /> I presume applied across the board in all counties.  I would like the Minister to examine that situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House this evening strikes me as somewhat like a man who requires a serious operation.  He goes into hospital for the serious operation and instead of having it the surgeon decides that he will cut his toe nails.  We need more comprehensive legislation to tackle the whole question of valuations of big buildings and to have an examination of the structure of our local authorities and their findings carried out.  This legislation is basically what that is about.  It is to raise finance from different valuations of property around the country.  Sooner rather than later we will have to tackle the whole question of funding local authorities on a proper basis.  In the towns and villages throughout Ireland at present, shopkeepers, people who have a small office, people who have a small industry, have their rates increased every year while their incomes are decreasing.  Our local authorities depend on the grant from the Department of the Environment and on income from rates paid by shopkeepers, owners of offices, industrialists and semi-State bodies.  We must remember that many business people are facing serious problems.  If one visits a licensed premises, a small grocery shop or a butcher's shop one will see how they are suffering.  Their income has declined in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he intends introducing comprehensive consolidating legislation to cover the area of rates and I consider that essential.  However, even more important than codifying existing legislation is the need to prepare a proper workable valuation system.  When in Government we tried to get local authority funding on a proper footing by introducing water charges, refuse charges and so on.  Those charges proved highly unpopular and we paid the penalty at local and national level for our efforts to introduce them.  The Minister, whom I am sure was a member of a local authority, must be aware of the problems local authorities are facing.  Slowly but <Col N="2312" /> surely they are grinding to a halt and unless we make a determined effort to resolve the financial problems of those bodies they will cease to exist.  They do not have the funds to carry on.  The big question we must face is, where will local authorities get finance from?  We must deal with that issue soon rather than later.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that a vast amount of work remains to be done by local authorities and that staff are being let go due to a lack of finance.  We should tackle the issue of local finance in a comprehensive Bill dealing with valuations.  On a recent radio programme I heard criticism of the condition of the roads in the Minister's county but that is only one of the problems facing local authorities.  It is essential that the Government in power should have adequate legislation to raise revenue for local authorities.  The Valuation Office have many experts available to prepare the necessary legislation, if the Government request them to do so.  The roads in my constituency, particularly in County Laois, are impassable.  Cars are being damaged and many elderly people have been injured when driving over potholes.</P>
    <P>Most people accept that something will have to be done to give proper funding to local authorities.  If we continue to place an intolerable burden on those liable for rates &mdash; shopkeepers, owners of offices and industrialists &mdash; we will have many more people going out of business. We are all aware that the sheriff has called to many business people and seized their goods because of their inability to pay their rates.  In rural Ireland in the fifties, particularly in Counties Offaly and Laois and along the western seaboard, the population of many villages declined and many houses were boarded up.  People left their homes because they could not meet their rates bills.  I recall that people removed the roof off their premises so as to avoid liability to rates.  If we continue to place heavy rates burdens on business premises and industrialists we will have them boarding up their windows again.</P>
    <P>I can recall reading a very good book by John Healy, <i>No One Shouted Stop</i>, <Col N="2313" /> which dealt with life in rural Ireland.  Mr. Healy has moved on to other areas such as culture and art and appears to have lost his understanding of what is happening in rural Ireland but he did a great service in publishing that book.  Somebody will have to shout stop now.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very interesting treatise but I hope the Deputy can assure me that it is entirely relevant to the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in that shopkeepers and business people are finding it difficult to meet their annual rates bills.  In County Offaly in 1985 rates were increased by £1 in the pound.  In 1986 the increase was 5 per cent; in 1987 it was 5 per cent and in 1988 it was 3 per cent.  The number of people paying rates is getting smaller but the amount they have to pay is getting greater.  Many people are unable to pay their rates.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister cannot solve the problem overnight but it is imperative that he should look at the system urgently. Some years ago a review of agricultural land was commenced.  The information gained from that review would be of enormous benefit to officials in the Valuation Office.  I understand it was the first review for more than one hundred years and that it was almost complete.  I suggest to the Minister that he should press for the completion of that review and pass on the relevant information to the Valuation Office.  I am sure that the records in that office are older than those in any other Government Department.  Any new information would prove of enormous benefit to that office.</P>
      <P>I accept this Bill, with the reservations I have outlined, as part of an ongoing review.  I look forward to the comprehensive legislation which is promised. I hope that the question of local authority funding will have been decided before that legislation is introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party welcome this legislation with a number <Col N="2314" /> of reservations.  The Minister indicated in his speech that the whole subject of valuation was linked with the very important question of the system of local authority funding.  That system is slowly eroding and grinding to a halt.  The Minister said that his Department are examining the whole question of comprehensive legislation and its early introduction. This must proceed with the greatest haste.  All local authorities are experiencing a major crisis of funding. The city council of which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I are members are conscious of the constraints on the development of services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>That remark is lost on me.  I hope the promised legislation will arrive in the House in the near future. It is essential that any comprehensive legislation should tackle the problem caused by agricultural land not being rated for the purpose of local authority funding.  It is a pity the Minister did not refer to the collection of outstanding agricultural rates.  I understand the amount to be collected is in the region of £20 million.  That money could be raised and handed over to local authorities to assist them in the carrying out of essential works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the weekend I had the opportunity, in company with Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla, the Leader of The Workers' Party, to visit the Waterford constituency and particularly the west Waterford area. In the course of our visit we met the county manager, Mr. Hurley, with whom we had a very useful discussion.  It was brought home to us how difficult it is for a county manager to deal with the onerous job of running a rural area at local authority level when a percentage increase in the rates yields only a fraction of what the same percentage would yield to a manager in an urban district or corporation area.  It is a major difficulty for a man such as Mr. Hurley, who is outward looking and progressive in his ideas, to tackle the various problems throughout <Col N="2315" /> the county.  There are major difficulties in giving to the rural local authority an effective means of raising money locally. The fact that agricultural land and buildings are not subject to rating creates a major gap in local authority funding and this must be addressed without delay.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains many innovative and useful proposals.  It develops the transition from the use of court as a primary source of appeal to the tribunal.  This will help the efficient running of the huge number of appeals made on an annual basis.  In the Circuit Court in Dublin it was always a sight for the curious to see the assembly of hundreds of litigants and their valuers, advisers and lawyers.  It was an annual event when days were set aside for the hearing of appeals.  It would appear that they were being discharged and disposed of at an almost breakneck rate.  One wonders whether the litigants, having being heard in public and adjudicated upon, left the environs with a sense that justice had been done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision enabling the chairman of the tribunal to delegate functions. This is a useful and important development.  There is no reason the technical and more mundane work cannot be undertaken by deputies of the chairman.  In using the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; I am conscious that it is a generic reference. One would hope that in the constitution of the membership of the tribunal fair and reasonable recognition would be given to women.  Perhaps I should use the term &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not at all worried about the fact that we are transferring this kind of work from the courts to the tribunal.  I am a little concerned at the provision which states that the chairperson of the tribunal must be a lawyer.  I wonder whether this is desirable in this area of valuations and technicalities.  I accept that there will be references from the findings of these tribunals to the High Court on points of law and I appreciate that the expertise of a lawyer would be helpful in drafting and codifying judgments.  I mean no disrespect to the current chairpersons of the Employment Appeals Tribunal but I feel <Col N="2316" /> it is not always desirable to require these people to be lawyers.  Certainly it is not an absolute necessity in this type of technical work.  There is nothing to stop a chairperson or any members of the tribunal seeking advice from an expert.  I wonder whether it is fair to experts in other fields concerned with valuation and revaluation that they will be automatically excluded if they do not have a legal qualification.</P>
    <P>The concept of ongoing listing of valuations throughout the year is useful. One wonders why it has taken so long for this provision to reach the Statute Book. The legislation of 1852 and 1860 forms the bedrock of legislation in this area.  It is incredible that we have waited so long for a simple proposal.  I welcome the fact that the Minister can draft regulations for the purpose of making the transition from the court to the tribunal.  The legislation proposes that any such regulations will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for their consideration.  That is a very good idea and it is a point we always argued for.  Regulations made by Ministers should be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas for consideration.</P>
    <P>I have reservations in relation to this question of the global valuation of public utilities.  It is a welcome concept, the idea of centrally assessing and then apportioning down through the local authorities their entitlements with regard to utilities that are national in their spread.  Why is that restricted to public utilities and semi-State bodies?  Why are those in the private sector excluded, those who have multioutlet facilities and who employ the type of utilities highlighted in the scheduling in the Bill?  It is unfair to single out those in the public sector only for this kind of attention.  The Minister should say why larger firms and facilities that employ the same type of utilities as the public utilities highlighted in the Schedule are not included in the scope of this Bill. I think the word &ldquo;global&rdquo; is a misnomer in relation to the national valuation process. If the idea is to be employed it should apply across the board to all multi-outlet facilities.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain how this <Col N="2317" /> scheme will operate.  In 1977 the Government abolished local domestic rates and promised that the rates support grant would fully compensate local authorities for any loss of revenue but the rates support grant has been proportionately and systematically eroded by central Government and local authorities have been experiencing financial difficulties since that decision.  Therefore, I am extremely cautious and anxious in my reception of the notion of further direct interference by central Government with the local authority fund raising activities.  I want an assurance from the Minister that there will not be Government interference with the liability of public or private outlets so that we will not find that the rates to be raised from these utilities will be decreased in a year or two for a political reason, with a resulting loss of revenue to local authorities.  This point must be dealt with emphatically by the Government at this stage.  We want a clear unequivocal assurance that there will not be a future erosion of funds to local authorities from these large public utilities should the scheme be employed as is suggested here.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a welcome improvement but it only helps to highlight the very major problems that exist for local authorities with regard to the outdated rating system we have with its major loopholes. I hope the Minister will, as he undertook in his introductory speech, ensure the introduction of comprehensive legislation without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their very positive detailed contributions. Obviously both Deputies have legal experience and are in touch with many of the problems that valuations and revised valuations create.  The main purpose of the Bill is to ensure that there is an updated modern consistent valuation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the word &ldquo;global&rdquo; as a misnomer.  To an extent it may be, but we are using the word &ldquo;global&rdquo; as an all embracing word encompassing all types of structures, <Col N="2318" /> parts, subsections, locations of all properties and ancillary equipment to be valued.  We want speedy effective decisions from the valuations tribunal and we want them to be specialised and consistent on property matters.  The new system will save time and expense.  There should be no need for an appeal from the tribunal to the Circuit Court.  On a point of law there may be an appeal, but the tribunal itself will have a lawyer as its chairperson and the deputy chairperson will have legal qualifications.  We are confident that with this type of expertise the people involved in the tribunal will understand the legal implications, will have a basic knowledge of the law of valuations and will be in a position to make consistent valuations based on all the information at their disposal.</P>
    <P>This will contrast with the present inconsistent haphazard system.  The present system is very cumbersome and it does not allow for fluid decisions to be made quickly.  It places undue pressure on the Valuation Office, on the Commissioner of Valuation and on local authorities, because the timescale within which they must operate and adhere to decisions is very narrow.  It also creates much frustration for property owners who are the victims of revised valuations or who are the subject of revision of valuations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright referred to the survey of agricultural land.  I presume he was referring to the classification of land for farm tax purposes.  As the House knows, the Government decided to terminate the farm tax some time ago, to ensure that farmers would be taxed on factual income like everybody else in the country and to ensure that there is equity in the tax system.  The Government have been working hard over the past year to ensure that the taxation burden can be eased and spread right across the board so that there is total consistency in the application of the tax laws, that whether a person is employed by someone or is self-employed, the basic thrust of taxation will be equitable and will give similar allowances across the board.</P>
    <P>The amount of classification done so <Col N="2319" /> far under the farm classification system has not been too large.  The inspectors had begun with the bigger farms and they had completed the classification of holdings above 150 adjusted acres before the work had terminated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright and Deputy McCartan queried the global valuation structure, who it would affect and how it will be done.  The Commissioner of Valuation will request the undertaking, that is the property, utility or whatever, to produce schedules of all its fixed assets and will further ask for all information pertaining to original cost, replacement cost, age and all other details.  The commissioner will then assess the effective capital value of the undertaking as defined in section 4 (4) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The rateable valuation will be derived from the effective capital value in accordance with section 4 (2), that is, the effective capital value multiplied by 5 per cent, giving the net annual value.  The net annual value so derived will be reduced to the comparable level of rateable valuations generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright queried whom the global valuation will affect and Deputy McCartan referred to the private sector. I visualise no escape clause for any utility, semi-State, public or private, as a result of this Bill.  As far as we will be concerned it will first apply to the ESB only, because they are a utility affected by major valuations. As they provide a major service to the nation they obviously have a large number of installations and properties right across the nation.  In their case the contribution in lieu of rates made to the Department of the Environment will be cancelled and paid to local authorities via rates instead.  No increase in rates is envisaged for the ESB.  Taking the global valuation of the ESB properties, all their installations and services including lines pylons, poles and all the other items they utilise in carrying their services right across the nation will be taken into account.  Taking the total valuation and apportioning it down to the area of each functional local authority, rates will be <Col N="2320" /> paid to each local authority based on the level of service being given in that area by the ESB.</P>
    <P>Hereafter the global valuation can then be extended to other bodies later by ministerial order and it is hoped, once the trial period is over and the system comes into operation, that it will be fairly simple to come up with a new order, put it together, have it processed and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and passed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright queried rates on Government property.  Government property is statutorily exempt from rates. He queried whether rates were paid by the Government on the various properties they own.  He talked about An Bord Pleanála.  A Government Department or agency do not have to apply for planning permission under the law.  It is at their discretion depending on the level of service they hope to provide in any area whether they apply for planning permission. They are exempt if they so wish from the planning laws.  A similar situation exists pertaining to rates. However, a contribution in lieu of rates is paid by the Government via the rates on Government property Vote at present.</P>
    <P>The contribution has been held constant over the last few years and the reductions involved have been spread uniformly across all local authority areas. If there is a reduction in the contribution made in the Government rate Vote at any time that reduction is spread right across the board and no local authority is victimised or is the sole victim of any consequent reduction.  The rates or the Government property Vote and the rates support grant amount to £200 million per annum, a hefty figure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright raised the financial position of local authorities.  While this is outside the scope of the Bill and not really relevant to it even though the valuations that will be and have been assessed by the Valuation Officer will help to create funds for local authorities, the Minister for the Environment is at present conducting an in-depth assessment of the financial position of all local authorities <Col N="2321" /> and he will be reporting to the Government later this year on this matter.  We await that report with interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan in a very good contribution raised a number of points to some of which I have already referred and replied.  He talked about the tribunal and the legal position.  The deputy chairperson we hope will be a person with legal knowledge as will be the chairperson, and the tribunal will normally work in divisions of three people.  It is not intended that both the chairperson and the deputy chairperson should sit in the same division.  On the contrary, the deputy chairperson will be a genuine deputy chairperson, acting and active in his or her own division, taking the chair in the place of the chairperson.</P>
    <P>I hope I have answered many of the questions raised in the Deputies' excellent contributions.  This is a very important and progressive Bill, and we must take into account the fact that over the years there have been major advances in technology and storage of information. We are confident that this Bill will create the opportunity for global valuations, individual valuations, to be done right across the country, and that through proper information technology it will be possible to have consistent decisions, up-to-date information and on the spot apportionment of valuations of all utilities right across the board in each local authority area, thus ensuring an equitable contribution by these utilities to each local authority for the services they give within each local authority area.  I look forward to Committee Stage.  We will be only too delighted to answer any queries raised at that time and I know the House will be more than anxious to ensure a very good contribution then.</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to compliment many of the previous contributors to this debate on the manner in which they put forward their views on the 1988 budget which we are now discussing.  Sometimes I feel it is a pity that the public cannot hear and see Members from all sides of the House as they put forward their views on important matters from time to time in Dáil Éireann.  In March 1987 when we were debating this Administration's first budget I could not have imagined the very considerable progress this country was about to make during the remainder of 1987, taking it through to our present deliberations.  In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> published by Fianna Fáil for the 1987 general election the Taoiseach said in his introduction:</P>
      <P>The great benefit that can come from this general election is the restoration of confidence by the people in their future, the restoration of a belief that the economy can be restored by better management; that more employment can be provided and the burden of taxation can be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite severe international economic <Col N="2323" /> difficulties in 1987, our economy performed exceptionally well.  We know that in 1987, our economy grew by 3 per cent. This was a much better performance than many of us thought possible.  Manufacturing output increased by 9.3 per cent in the first nine months of 1987 as compared with the first nine months of 1986. This increase in manufacturing output clearly reflected itself in exports which in the first 11 months of 1987 increased in volume terms by 18 per cent as compared with the first 11 months of 1986.  In a recent business poll carried out by Irish Marketing Services for the magazine <i>Business and Finance</i> published on 4 February 1988, 90 per cent of the chief executives of Irish industry, then polled, felt that this was a good budget.  I understand that this type of business support is unprecedented. The business community, therefore, have clearly stated their confidence in the broad thrust of the Government's economic and fiscal policy as enunciated by the Taoiseach and his Ministers since coming to office in 1987.</P>
    <P>I believe also that 1988 can be a year of very substantial achievement in our economic development when inflation is expected to fall again to between 1½ per cent and 2 per cent.  We can also look forward with some confidence to a further lowering of interest rates and lower energy costs.  These very important developments, together with Fianna Fáil's prudent and careful management of our public finances, should further enhance our manufacturing export opportunities.  A well organised and professionally managed economy will help to ensure that our goods and services exported will be more competitive.  It is clear that this economy will never die on its export performance.  This is one of the few means whereby the nation's wealth can be increased, thereby presenting an opportunity for the creation of real, lasting and sustainable jobs.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister for Finance on his outstanding performance to date.  I want also to congratulate him for the manner in which he drafted and presented the 1988 budget.  He has shown <Col N="2324" /> that it is possible for a Government, no matter how difficult times may be, to set financial targets and to achieve them. The 1987 current budget deficit at £1,180 million was £20 million inside target and Exchequer borrowing has been shown to have been £72 million inside target.  This is an outstanding achievement by the Government.  In his budget address on 27 January last the Minister indicated that the current deficit, in terms of gross national product, of 6.8 per cent was the lowest since 1980 and that Exchequer borrowing of 10.3 per cent was the lowest since 1977.  I should like to refer to some of the measures introduced in the 1988 budget.</P>
    <P>I welcome especially the Government's decision to introduce a package of special measures for the tourist industry by allocating a sum of £4 million for this purpose.  Following the Government's very successful efforts to boost tourism in 1987, the renewed commitment to the tourist industry will undoubtedly benefit the national economy. We need to take a much closer look at what this country can offer the visitor as opposed to what we cannot offer with any degree of certainty.  Unfortunately, we cannot, for example, offer an unlimited amount of sunshine.  However, we have an exceptionally clean and healthy environment at this time by comparison with most other industrialised countries. Our environment is a national asset which should at all times be protected and enhanced.  In so doing, we will have a very valuable asset which, in the years ahead, may well become a very marketable item within the international tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The reduced access fares to Ireland by sea and air will undoubtedly benefit the industry as it seeks to draw more and more visitors to Ireland each year.  The question is: can those now engaged and working in the tourist industry further improve the performance of the industry and can they meet the new challenge posed by the Government's absolute commitment and belief in their industry? I think it is fair to accept that only those working within the industry can answer <Col N="2325" /> that type of question.  The Government must not &mdash; and I am quite sure they will not &mdash; allow their commitment and financial investment in the industry to be wasted or frittered away.  The climate is right for those in the industry with vision, resourcefulness and energy to chart a new and successful decade ahead in Ireland's tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I want now to turn to the area of social welfare where I note that public expenditure this year will exceed £2.6 billion. This is a very substantial sum.  In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> Fianna Fáil said that their aim would be to maintain social welfare allowances in real terms to ensure that the position of recipients would not be eroded by inflation.  I feel we have already made considerable progress towards our aim of a better managed and more humane social welfare system.  We have extended optical and dental benefits to the spouses of insured workers.  I hope that all dentists, in the interests of their patients, will participate fully in the scheme which has after all been sought from successive administrations for a good number of years.</P>
    <P>The current development of computerisation within the Department of Social Welfare is proving helpful to those in need of assistance and welfare payments of various kinds.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods, is committed to developing the service to such an extent that social welfare recipients will be able to call to their local welfare office and claim their entitlements on the spot.  The Minister is committed to the introduction of the comprehensive new service and to the concept of the one stop shop for social welfare recipients.  This is a development that I particularly welcome because, in my constituency of Dublin South-West, such a service and facility will be of tremendous benefit to social welfare recipients in their efforts to deal with the welfare system which, in the past, has proved complex, confusing and, at times, incomprehensible to the ordinary person.</P>
    <P>The general increase of 3 per cent in <Col N="2326" /> social welfare allowances is to be welcomed. Naturally, because of Fianna Fáil's commitment to improving the lot of the less well off and disadvantaged in our society we in Fianna Fáil would wish that the increase referred to would be greater.  However, the Minister has succeeded in increasing by over 11 per cent the personal rate of long-term urban unemployment assistance which will now be increased by an overall £4.20 to £42 per week.  This 11 per cent increase is a substantial increase over and above the expected rate of inflation and other increases of greater than 3 per cent are also welcome.  I hope that in each of their next three budgets, for the duration of this administration, social welfare will continue to run ahead of inflation.  I know this would be welcomed by everyone in this House.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that all social welfare increases given in the budget will cost the Exchequer an additional £44.8 million this year.  The total cost to the Exchequer in a full year will be £101 million.  These are very substantial sums of money.  I am delighted the Minister has managed to provide this money, despite the difficult financial task this Government have set themselves.  I take this opportunity to compliment the Minister for Social Welfare on the high degree of professionalism he has brought to this very important ministry.  His caring approach in running his Department is widely respected.  His determination to make the Department more accessible and more amenable to the public is welcome and indeed is not before its time.</P>
    <P>The continuation of equal treatment, alleviating payments until the end of 1988, at an additional cost this year of £20 million, is further evidence of this Government's caring approach and determination to ensure that social welfare recipients do not fall behind in terms of their receipts.  The other measures announced, particularly the extension of the social insurance scheme by the Minister, are in keeping with this Government's determination that all who can pay should pay.  The self-employed will be brought into the social insurance <Col N="2327" /> scheme from 6 April this year.  It is right that the Government should ensure a widening of this scheme.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Eastern Health Board I have seen at first hand the operation of the community drugs refund scheme and the long-term illness scheme. I compliment the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon and the Government for looking again at the 1988 budget to ensure that increased funding would be made available to allow these schemes to continue at their previous level.  I am satisfied that the Government took account of informed and reasonable views on the proposed changes in the schemes referred to.  The Government, realising that the reduction contemplated in the two schemes would impose undue hardship on the handicapped and those with long-term illnesses, have provided an additional £11 million for the Vote to ensure the continuation of the two schemes at their present level.  This is yet another example of Fianna Fáil's humane and caring approach to the disadvantaged, the handicapped and the less well off in our society.  I refer also to the Government's decision to provide an extra £2.8 million this year, £3.3 million in a full year, to ensure the continuation of assistance for the promotion of mobility among disabled drivers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister for Health's commitment to strengthening the community care aspect of the health services. The intention is to care for people within their own community, thereby, where possible, obviating the necessity for hospitalisation in acute hospitals when proper community care would be more than adequate for their needs.  How often have we known of patients in hospital yearing to return home to their families, where warmth, care and compassion await them during their illness?  Is it not true that often the person who is ill can make a more speedy recovery when cared for at home, especially when the caring family have the support of the health board's community care facilities?</P>
    <P>The Minister's continued commitment to the planning and development of the <Col N="2328" /> new Tallaght hospital, in my constituency, is very much appreciated.  We, not only in Tallaght but in the wider regions extending to Wicklow, Kildare and other parts of Dublin, look forward to an opening date in 1992-93.  It is right that when the health services are being reorganised the Minister should try to ensure that the resources are available within the communities where they are required.  In Dublin particularly the facilities are located in areas where the population, through demographic changes, have long since changed the balance of occupation in those areas.  It is as well to relocate these facilities out in areas such as Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown and the other newer towns around Dublin.  It was one of the failings in planning, particularly in health in the past, that this was not done.  Due account was not taken of the changes in the movment of the population.  We are beginning to see the result in the form of large towns on the outskirts of Dublin &mdash; Tallaght, for example, with a population nearing 100,000 &mdash; where basic facilities such as hospitals are required.  There is an intensity of such facilities in the inner city so people are faced with the prospect of making long journeys to the city.  If there had been proper planning in the past this would not now be necessary and we could have provided earlier, perhaps, the facilities that are required in Tallaght and other such areas.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of criticisms of the Jobsearch programme but I do not subscribe to those criticisms.  I believe the Jobsearch programme has a great deal of merit.  It has helped a great number of people.  We see from the figures that over 40,000 people were placed in some scheme last year.  A substantial number of those had never been offered anything from Government agencies in the past. That is worth nothing.  Over 4,000 of those involved in the Jobsearch programme found permanent employment.  Of course, another figure worth noting is that 12,700 left the live register when invited to avail of assistance under the programme.  This is a very substantial number.  We all know from attending our <Col N="2329" /> clinics at weekends that people who feel aggrieved, who believe they are not getting their entitlements, will often quote cases they know of people who are getting help to which they are not entitled. Perhaps some of those people are now included in the 12,700 who left the live register when offered assistance under the Jobsearch programme.  The programme had a great deal of merit as it operated last year.  The Minister intends to operated it again in 1988.  I am sure other people will benefit from the training for interviews and placements.  Participation in any scheme can only be of benefit to those concerned.  It is better to be involved in something than to be sitting around and waiting for something to turn up.  I congratulate the Minister on his decision to move the Jobsearch programme into 1988.  I hope he will be able to record substantial progress when he advises us of the outcome for 1988.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation of an additional £6.5 million to the Department of Education.  This will be used for the school building programme, for the school improvement programme and the provision of classrooms, etc.  Some of the schools built in the past ten to 15 years have tended to deteriorate extremely quickly so I wonder about the type of construction materials used and whether they meet the standard that is required for our climate.  I am amazed when I visit a primary school in my constituency &mdash; and most of them are brand new schools because of the type of constituency that is Tallaght and its hinterlands &mdash; to find windows rotting away, doors in need of replacement and roofs needing repair or replacement as a result of weather conditions. I wonder why such work should be required at such an early date after construction.  The planning unit within the Department of Education will have to look carefully at the type of materials used so that we do not have fairly substantial repair and maintenance bills occurring in a short time.  The Minister and her advisers must take up this point.</P>
    <P>I appeal also to the Minister to consider using some of the additional moneys to <Col N="2330" /> provide sports halls in our community schools.  Over the years this programme seems to have fallen back somewhat.  For example, in my constituency two schools, Rathcoole and Killinarden, spring to mind. They each need a sports hall because their education programme is geared to the utilisation of such facilities.  It is a pity that sports halls have not been provided in both those schools before now.  I shall be asking the Minister again to consider carefully those two schools as a priority because they are at maximum usage level.</P>
    <P>They have planned their education programme around the availability of the sports halls, promised frequently in the past by a number of administrations but still awaited.  Perhaps funds could be made available from the national lottery, it being the intention to use some of these funds towards sporting and recreational facilities?  I am sure that other representatives will also be putting the case for schools in their areas, but there is a strong case to be made for the two schools I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I welcome, as have many other Deputies, the commitment to a revival of the decentralisation programme, which has been talked about for a long number of years.  All administrations tried in some way to revive and implement this programme but, for a variety of reasons, a great deal of progress was not made.  The Minister for Finance in his contribution to this House on budget day referred to the fact that four centres in phase one of the programme &mdash; Ballina, Galway, Cavan and Sligo &mdash; are moving ahead very rapidly, contracts being signed or about to be signed.  He also referred to the other areas of Limerick, Ennis, Nenagh, Killarney, Letterkenny, Waterford and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>It is only right that we should take definite concrete steps towards implementing a decentralisation programme. As a Dublin Deputy, I can see one of the great drawbacks of not implementing such a programme.  There is a whole imbalance in the movement of people across to the eastern region, caused partly by a failure to decentralise and <Col N="2331" /> partly by the concentration of resources on this side of the country, particularly in and around the Dublin region.  In such a situation there is a need, through local government and so on, to make very substantial infrastructural investment in these areas.  Only recently the Minister for the Environment has given sanction to a major roads construction project, the western parkway, involving construction costs of approximately £30 million.  That is only one small portion of the total road construction programme envisaged for the greater Dublin region, some of which has already been provided.</P>
    <P>There are sanitary services required to service major new towns like Tallaght, Clondalkin, and Blanchardstown on the northern fringes of Dublin.  I wonder if all of these would have been necessary if we had been able to ensure that the population remained, so far as it was possible, in the various counties, towns and villages? Probably it was not feasible or practicable for them to remain because the jobs simply were not there.  Whatever jobs were developing over a period of ten or 20 years tended to be available in the greater Dublin region.  Decentralisation will, I hope, help to reverse that trend. That is something on which the Government are to be congratulated.  I expect to see a movement out of the city through the development of the programme.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation should not be confined to the various centres to which I have referred.  I should like to see a commitment and a plan put forward for decentralisation out of Dublin 2, which tends to have all the Government agencies and Government Departments. There would be a great benefit to our newer towns on the outskirts of Dublin if they were to participate in decentralisation. They have a right to look for some of the benefits.  Perhaps the Government could consider moving some of the agencies, not necessarily out of the Dublin region altogether but out to the new towns, such as Tallaght with a population of 100,000, or the new, developing town of Clondalkin, to Lucan and Blanchardstown and the other areas <Col N="2332" /> around?  There is a great deal of merit in that suggestion.  There is no reason for all these agencies to be concentrated in this small golden mile of the inner city.  As the newer towns develop, a commitment might be given to moving some of the agencies out of those areas.  That would give a certain stability to the newer towns and a great deal of hope to the thousands of new families who have moved to those areas in expectation of development and who until now have been disappointed.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the urban renewal scheme.  It would be remiss of me, as a Deputy for Dublin south-west, if I did not mention his intention to designate an area in and around the town centre of Tallaght for expansion of this scheme.  That is a very enlightened decision.  I recognise that there have been some criticisms of this proposed designation by what I would term ill-informed opinion.  I would remind those who have the view that it is to help any particular developer that the lands referred to in so far as the town centre is concerned are in public ownership. Therefore, the local authority, if they wish to take up the challenge, will have a great deal to say about how these lands are to be developed ultimately, by whom and in what manner.  I should like to see that designation not confined solely to the town centre lands, but expanding outwards. There are a number of industrial estates in the Tallaght area which are at present under-utilised.  The infrastructure and telecommunications facilities are there.  The people of Tallaght are entitled to some bias in terms of Government action to create jobs and of Government commitment to try to develop the area.</P>
    <P>Recent figures have shown that there are of the order of 6,200 people on the live register in Tallaght and of the order of 4,000 in Clondalkin.  We must try to come to grips with those figures in the matter of the provision of jobs for these people.  The Minister's proposal in relation to the designation of the Tallaght area will go some way towards achieving this.  The decision has been warmly welcomed in the area, particularly by all of <Col N="2333" /> us working there and representing the area.  We have been seeking this for a good number of years without success, but now the decision has been taken and it cannot but benefit the whole region of Tallaght and Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have an opportunity to look at the other new towns. Such a move should not be confined only to the Tallaght area.  A case has been made for Clondalkin and also for Lucan. These new towns were built because Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation decided to solve their housing crisis by developing those areas.  Many of us representing the areas recognise that both local authorities have failed in their commitment to the needs of these areas in terms of infrastructural development and facilities and the building of local authority housing and local authority development required because of the movement of such huge numbers of families.</P>
    <P>I believe that the decision taken in the budget regarding Tallaght is welcome and will have tremendous beneficial effect.  We look forward to the construction projects which will inevitably arise from the decision taken.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2334" /> That Dáil Éireann, disturbed at the implications of the proposed closure of Barringtons Hospital, Limerick; mindful of the fact that it is a major public hospital facility in the mid-west region, with the busiest out-patient department outside Dublin city, treating approximately 45,000 patients annually, and being open 24 hours a day, seven days a week with 80 per cent of its in-patients being public patients; and in view of the fact that it is a highly cost-efficient hospital and that its facilities will have to be replicated elsewhere at heavy cost to the Exchequer, directs the Minister for Health to rescind his proposal to close the hospital from 31st March, 1988, since such an action is not justified on either financial, medical or social grounds.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are opposed to wasteful expenditure of scarce national resources and are committed to carefully scrutinising all Government proposals on a need and cost-efficiency basis.  The health services account for a very large proportion of annual Exchequer spending and lack of planning and inefficiency in this sector in the past has resulted in the crisis that we are now confronted with.  The Progressive Democrats believe it is the duty of a democratic Government to make adequate provision to ensure that each member of our community has access to needed health care as a fundamental right.  We also believe that equity must be a central value in health policy both in regard to access to services and in the quality of care available to all.  We believe there is an obligation on Governments to ensure that health care is provided efficiently because wastage of scarce public resources can result in a denial of needed care.  Efficiency, therefore, is linked closely with equity.</P>
    <P>Because resources are scarce and wastefulness denies needed care to many, it is most important that we reorganise our health care system to make it more cost efficient.  It costs £700 per week to keep a patient in an acute hospital bed. We have more hospital beds than are <Col N="2335" /> needed for a country of our size and too many people are being referred to hospitals who could be better catered for at a much lower cost if we developed a comprehensive community primary care system to enable more people to be treated at home in the environment where the patient would be more content.</P>
    <P>At a recent health conference organised by the Department of Health a senior public health official stated:</P>
    <P>The Irish public hospitals have got themselves into the position reached by many old English industries, like the motor car industry, steel and so forth.  Their product is old-fashioned and their price is not competitive &mdash; customers will leave them.  Unfortunately, in health, the customers cannot leave but the taxpayer has to pick up an ever-increasing tab and this he is no longer able to afford.</P>
    <P>Those who have had responsibility for hospital policy over the past ten years have presided over an inefficient and wasteful system.  The Progressive Democrats see the need for proper long-term planning after full consultation with those involved in providing the services. Unfortunately the Minister for Health since coming into office has proceeded to act in an arbitrary way announcing major decisions without adequate consultations with the practitioners who will have to operate under the new regime.  In the case of Limerick it is generally accepted that there are too many voluntary hospital beds, there are three major voluntary acute hospitals and it is generally accepted that the needs of the Limerick area can be adequately provided for by closing down one of these hospitals.  The need for the services provided at the Regional Hospital is accepted by all which means that a decision has to be made on whether it would be St. John's or Barringtons hospital which should be closed.  Having carefully examined the evidence made available to us and having examined the Minister's statements we <Col N="2336" /> could only come to the conclusion that Barringtons hospital should be retained.</P>
    <P>We are amazed that a Minister flying in the face of all available evidence should in fact decide to close Barringtons.  Our consideration of this matter has been based on choosing between Barringtons and St. John's as voluntary hospitals.  We have not been influenced by considerations regarding the future use of St. John's should that be the hospital that is closed.  What we are concerned with here is the level of services available in voluntary hospitals in the Limerick area.  It is quite extraordinary that the weight of opinion in Limerick among doctors, nurses, paramedicals and health board officials should all favour the retention of Barringtons <i>viz-á-viz</i> St. John's and yet the Minister insists on the opposite view in deciding to retain St. John's and close Barringtons.</P>
    <P>It is more extraordinary when the weight of opinion among public representatives in Limerick in every political party, the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael, Labour, The Workers' Party, Democratic Socialists and even the Minister's own party should favour the retention of Barringtons but the Minister ignores all these views and insists that his personal view must prevail and Barringtons be closed.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats regret the necessity to bring this matter to the floor of the House but, in view of the additional costs that will arise and the level of services that will be available in the Limerick area in future, we feel we have a public duty to let Dáil Éireann decide this matter.  Our motion is worded in such a way that it directs the Minister to rescind his proposal to close Barringtons from 31 March this year.</P>
    <P>Speaking in the Dáil on 3 February on behalf of the Minister for Health, the Minister of State said that in arriving at this decision Deputy O'Hanlon had available to him an architectural report on the suitability of both hospitals as to their future participation in public hospital service in the area and that all the evidence and the outcome of meetings he had with the Mid-Western Health Board <Col N="2337" /> and the management of St. John's and Barringtons hospitals on the architectural aspect all pointed to the retention of St. John's.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister, however, that though it was agreed at a meeting held in Limerick on Friday, 14 August between officials of his Department and the board of Barringtons hospital that a sub-committee on the speciality needs of the region be set up with two members from Barringtons, one medical and one management, in fact, no such committee was ever set up and no meetings took place with the Barringtons hospital officials and the Department between then and the date that the Minister announced that the subvention was being withdrawn from Barringtons in favour of St. John's.  This announcement was made on 10 December 1987.</P>
    <P>Among the other reasons given by the Minister are the following: St. John's is a more spacious building; St. John's is in better condition because £0.5 million was spent on improving the fabric of the hospital in 1986; St. John's is more readily adaptable to the changing emphasis in the practice of acute medicine; St. John's is suitable for day hospital services and its mechanical and electrical services are superior to those at Barringtons hospital.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister states that his decision is based purely on the basis of the physical facilities available in both hospitals and the management co-operation of the two bodies concerned.  Of course, what the Minister did not tell the Dáil is that Barringtons hospital is in excellent structural condition, being entirely built of cutstone and all floors are of reinforced concrete.  A number of major improvements were carried out in recent years with the approval of, and funding by, the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>In 1981 and 1982 the mechanical and electrical services were upgraded to meet the Chief Fire Officer's requirements, the boilerhouse was reroofed and the kitchen renovated and refurbished.  A new medical oxygen system, etc. was also installed. The total cost of these works with some ancillary improvements amounted to £212,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2338" /> In 1983-1984 a new lift and lift shaft were installed and a ward was converted and refurbished as an intensive care unit at an approximate cost of £13,000.  A suite of two totally enclosed, fully air-conditioned and pressurised operating theatres was completed in 1969.  These theatres are equipped with every modern facility and are considered to be the best in the mid-west region with the exception of the recently completed specialised theatres in Croom.  Every form of surgery has been undertaken here with a sepsis rate that is considerably lower than in comparative units.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above capital works the Department of Health approved and funded the purchase of two houses adjacent to the hospital in 1985 at a cost of £60,000 to provide additional space for the development of the casualty-out-patients department.  A planning brief for this development was submitted to the Department in April 1986.  Since 1982 capital grants totalling £190,000 have been received for the purchase of replacement items of equipment.</P>
    <P>The facilities at Barringtons include the previously mentioned two modern theatres, a well equipped X-ray rooms, an intensive care unit and a casualty department. In this context it is worthy of mention that Barringtons can provide acute hospital services for virtually every type of patient condition presented at the hospital.  Obvious exceptions would include head injury cases which are transferred to Cork Regional Hospital and orthopaedic cases which are dealt with at Croom Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>I have here a quantity surveyor's report and an engineer's report on the building which states that the cost of upgrading Barringtons hospital building to presentday requirements would cost only £90,000.  It is difficult to understand how the Minister could recommend to the House that Barringtons, a hospital that has all the facilities, be closed and that St. John's, a hospital that does not have the wide range of facilities that are already in operation in Barringtons, be <Col N="2339" /> kept open.  It is, to put it mildly, an extraordinary decision.  I appeal to Deputy Alan Dukes and the Fine Gael Party to withdraw the amendment they have placed on the Order Paper as it is clearly worded in such a way that it will ensure all Opposition parties could not join together to vote for it.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil debate on 3 February last, Deputy Michael Noonan, Finance spokesman for Fine Gael, said he disagreed with the Government's decision to close Barringtons hospital.  If his party are supporting him in that view, they should support the Progressive Democrats motion without amendment or else propose an amendment that would have the support of all of the Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>At present all parties except Fine Gael have indicated they could support the Progressive Democrats motion and thus save Barringtons hospital.  However, if Fine Gael proceed with their amendment it will be seen as a device to give the impression that they are opposing the closure while, at the same time, making sure that it did in fact close.  The public will know that Labour, The Workers' Party, and Deputy Kemmy's Party as Socialists cannot be expected to accept the Fine Gael amendment which calls for the development of private hospital facilities.  It is clear that the Fine Gael motion is worded deliberately to ensure that the Progressive Democrats motion, with the Fine Gael amendment added, will not get the support of the Socialist Deputies and will, therefore, be defeated.  Barringtons hospital will close and Fine Gael will have closed it.  I want to make it quite clear that we will vote against the Fine Gael amendment, for the reasons I have stated, if it is moved.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow night Dáil Éireann can exercise its will if the majority against the closure of Barringtons stand together in voting for an unamended Progressive Democrats motion.  I appeal to Fine Gael to reconsider their position in the interest of retaining Barringtons hospital.</P>
    <Col N="2340" />
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an assumption on the part of some media commentators and also some members of the public that if one believes in the control of public expenditure and the reduction of the appalling deficits and debt which we have then one must necessarily support every move and every proposal made in a financial context by this Government, irrespective of how demonstrably foolish the particular proposal may be and irrespective of the existence of more sensible alternatives.  That is the thinking underlying the Tallaght doctrine also.</P>
      <P>I do not subscribe to this blank cheque approach which takes from the Government the onus to get things right.  Within the overall valid context of controlling expenditure, errors have inevitably been made but the difference in this Dáil as opposed to any other is that those errors have been underwritten and supported by those who are too terrified to assess individual proposals properly lest they would have to oppose them.  Political welfare is paramount for some, even if they can successfully portray it as helping the national welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole misconception of newfound financial control and this fundamental misconception of the nature of Opposition in the parliamentary system have been brought to new levels of absurdity in the matter which is before us tonight.  The Government take the view that in Limerick one hospital is as good as another and that it is largely the toss of a coin which should close if one hospital has to be closed.  They have made a decision that takes no account whatever of the work done in and the service provided by Barringtons hospital to very large numbers of people, the great majority of whom are medical card holders or people with small incomes.  Furthermore, they are closing down a hospital which, apart from the orthopaedic hospital in Croom, has the two most modern operating theatres in the mid-west and which has extensive X-ray facilities for a substantial accident and emergency service.  They are closing a hospital which, on the Department of <Col N="2341" /> Health's figures, is far more cost efficient per occupied bed than any other hospital in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Of all unwise decisions that have been made, this one must surely be the craziest of all.  The Minister for Health is closing a hospital that contains the facilities that the taxpayer will have to provide in another hospital 500 or 600 yards away which does not have those facilities.  To put it in simple terms, if there were two football clubs which it was decided to merge or to close one, and one had the option of closing one or the other and transferring the members and the players to the other club, surely one would close the club with the limited facilities and retain the one with the large existing facilities because otherwise one would have to replicate those facilities in the other club.  Even at the most conservative estimate, the closure of Barringtons hospital and the provision of its own facilities elsewhere will cost the taxpayer at least £2 million extra, a cost that would not arise if the normal commonsense decision were made and the closure made elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am accused of parochial special pleading.  If this absurd decision were replicated anywhere else in Ireland I would be equally opposed to it for that reason. It makes no financial sense and it makes a joke of the Government's commitment to saving public funds.  It actually costs public funds substantially more to do what it is now proposed.  I have no objection, as I have made clear in a succession of five or six statements which I have made on this issue, the earliest of them being on the morning of 11 December in this House when I protested at the foolishness of this decision on the Estimate for the Department of Health, to a rationalisation in Limerick.  I do not consider that Limerick should be any more exempt than anywhere else, but I have the most strenuous objection to the foolishness and the waste of public money entailed in the way this rationalisation is being carried out.</P>
    <P>As well as making absolutely no financial sense but costing the taxpayer substantially more than if there was a <Col N="2342" /> different rationalisation, this decision, as Deputy Noonan has said in the House on 3 February, is socially discriminatory. Why should a hospital that treats tens of thousands of less well-off people be closed in this town when another hospital which treats a much smaller number of much better-off people who have easy alternatives open to them is retained? Why must the delays for public patients, which we know are endemic in our hospital system today, be further increased by this proposal and the advantages in our existing system for private patients be further reinforced?</P>
    <P>Is it not amazing that this decision is regarded as so perverse that nobody can be found in the mid-west region of Limerick city and county, County Clare and north Tipperary to defend it?  Since it is so patently perverse why is it persisted with?  What is the point of depriving the poor at considerable cost to the Exchequer?  Is it not clear that it makes no financial, medical or social sense?  Has not that been said many times by people of all parties and none and it has never been contradicted?</P>
    <P>In this House on 1 December 1987, as recorded at column 127, of the Official Report the Minister for Health had this to say:</P>
    <P>As regards the closure of acute hospitals, it is not my intention that there should be any further closures of acute hospitals other than those that have been already announced and are either closed or in the process of being closed.</P>
    <P>I might draw the attention of the House to the latter part of that quotation in particular: it was not that they had already been announced or were either closed or were in the process of being closed, as the Minister tried to suggest afterwards; it was that they had already been announced and were either closed or in the process of being closed.  Clearly no announcement had been made in respect of Barringtons hospital on 1 December last.  However, nine days later the Minister for Health totally contradicted what he had said in the House <Col N="2343" /> on 1 December.  Either he misled the Dáil or this decision was taken out of the blue, at extremely short notice, for an unspecified reason.  We are entitled to ask: why was it made?  If we do not get a satisfactory answer then, out of the Minister's own mouth, we are entitled to believe that he did mislead the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Less than a month before this decision was announced Barringtons hospital was authorised to take on student nurses for a three-year period beginning this month. I wonder why, if there was any intention of closing it down?  In October 1987 new permanent staff were taken on with the sanction of the Department of Health. Did that suggest that the hospital was about to close or that it was the intention of the Department to close it?</P>
    <P>The only arguments advanced by the Minister that I can see are that there is more room to expand in St. John's hospital and that it is in better condition. I wonder how does the question of expansion arise since a lot of beds have to be closed in Limerick anyway and since there are two wards now closed in the regional hospital, which I presume will not remain closed for all time?</P>
    <P>Barringtons hospital has nearly one and a half acres of land including a car park, garden, a whole lot of ancillary buildings and land made available nearby by Limerick Corporation.  What expansion is envisaged by the Minister that will require more than one and a half acres when there is already on the site a hospital of close to 100 beds?  The difficulties of building at St. John's hospital are well known.  I will not go into them. I do not want to have to speak in any critical manner in regard to St. John's hospital.  Unfortunately the circumstances surrounding this debate preclude me from ignoring it altogether.  The work which has to be done in St. John's hospital and which will be extremely expensive &mdash; because of the layout of the hospital, the difficulties of access to it and those created by the existence of the walls of Limerick as almost an integral part of the hospital &mdash; has been largely done in Barringtons hospital.  I ask again: why <Col N="2344" /> repeat it elsewhere, a few hundred yards away, at a huge cost to taxpayers?</P>
    <P>The architect of Barringtons hospital, with whom I checked this matter specifically, tells me that it is in excellent condition, that very considerable sums of money were spent on it in recent years, that any remaining minor works that might ideally be required could be done, on his estimate and that of a quantity surveyor, for a sum not exceeding £90,000 including value-added tax.  These are not essential works but, in any event, this is a fraction only of the huge sums that will have to be spent elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Molloy said, within the past two years an adjoining property was bought with funds provided by the Department of Health late in 1986.  Is that the action of a Department that felt that hospital should close within a year or so?  This House should ask itself once and for all: does stupid waste in this country mean nothing, or does it concern this House any more?</P>
    <P>The overwhelming opinion of people who know anything about this matter is that a decision has been taken in regard to the wrong hospital.  I have no objection to spelling that out.  Neither have I any objection to St. John's hospital formally becoming a private hospital, particularly as that is largely what it is at present and would entail no material change.  I have the greatest objection to unnecessarily antagonising those Members of this House who would vote to reverse this perverse decision.  That is why we did not include in our motion any references to St. John's hospital or to private medicine. We kept the motion broadly-based, as common sense would dictate, to allow everyone who is genuinely opposed to this ridiculous decision to vote against it.</P>
    <P>I might add that, in connection with private medicine, Limerick is now one of the few places in Ireland without any private hospital.  It seems obvious that this should happen.  Inevitably it would have happened but there is no need to spell it out here in an amendment to a motion.  It does not have to happen in that form.</P>
    <P>I was interested to learn recently that <Col N="2345" /> the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are extremely keen to start a small private hospital of their own and that they are hoping that, in this present year, legislation will be passed in this House that will enable them to do so.  For their purposes a relatively small hospital like St. John's in Limerick, owned and run by them as a private hospital, would be enormously beneficial because it would enable them to set a scale of charges for all the other private hospitals in this country, some of which are causing them severe difficulties at present.  The Minister would have no difficulty in getting the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to go along with him in that regard.  It would suit everybody.  I say that by the way but by way of indication of the possibilities that are open if Barringtons hospital is retained, as common sense demands.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in common with everyone interested in the future of Barringtons hospital and its preservation, I have the most strenuous objection to the Fine Gael amendment to this motion, not because I disagree with its terms but because it is provocative and designed deliberately to ensure the defeat of the motion and, thereby, the closure of Barringtons hospital.</P>
    <P>Deputies in this House cannot have it both ways.  If they wish to see this decision reversed let them vote for the motion before them.  If they wish to see the decision upheld, and a large amount of public money wasted, with great harm done to the welfare of poorer people in Counties Limerick and Clare, they will vote for the Fine Gael amendment ensuring the defeat of the motion.  It is as simple as that.  It is a black and white matter and cannot be gainsaid.</P>
    <P>At this late point, even after the commencement of this debate, I renew the appeal I made at length last Saturday &mdash; and that the entire board and action committee of Barringtons hospital made at length last Saturday &mdash; to the Fine Gael Party and their representatives not to persist in this amendment to the motion.  The amendment will have one effect, and one only, that is, to close that hospital and to override what I believed, <Col N="2346" /> up to recently at any rate, was the majority feeling in this House.  Most people to whom one speaks privately, and all people who know anything about the position are agreed that this decision is wrong.  What is happening now is an unfortunate parliamentary tactic to enable a decision by the Minister which is generally agreed to be wrong to be upheld, causing the foolish closure of this hospital and at the same time, trying to give the impression that one is in support of the hospital and wants its retention.  I do not think any members of the public were fooled by that.</P>
    <P>I would say very earnestly to members of the Fine Gael Party in particular: &ldquo;You will not get any benefit from the course of action you are now pursuing.  The public know perfectly well what you are up to. You will get benefit if you desist from that course of action, allow commonsense to prevail and allow a sum of £2 million or more to be saved for the taxpayers.  You will be acting in accordance with financial rectitude if you have the wisdom to realise that this ploy has already been seen through very widely and that it will do you no good.&rdquo;  I would ask members of Fine Gael, of whom there are only a few here but I am sure many are listening, to think again.  If my references to the fact that we and we alone brought this motion for debate caused offence to any of them, I can assure them that if they have the commonsense not to persist with this amendment, I will not say anything that will give them cause for offence.</P>
    <P>This is a matter on which there is extraordinary unanimity among all who know anything about it.  What amazed me was that doctors, nurses, paramedical staff and ambulance drivers from the Regional Hospital said to me within the past week: &ldquo;For God's sake, try to prevail on them to keep Barringtons open.  What are we going to do if it closes?  Look at us &mdash; people queuing for five, six or seven hours even with Barringtons open.  What in the name of God are we going to do? Are they mad in Dublin?  Have they a tittle of commonsense?  Surely anybody looking at what is happening here will know that to close Barringtons is crazy.&rdquo;<Col N="2347" /> I believe a majority in this House would tell the Government to stop if they were allowed to do so.  The difficulty is now in the Fine Gael Party.  I make a particular appeal to the leader of that party to ensure that commonsense prevails, that needless expenditure is not incurred, that needless hardship is not caused and that the obvious necessity to rescind this decision is allowed to go through this House.</P>
    <P>There is extraordinary unanimity in all political parties in Limerick about this issue.  I look around to see where Deputy O'Dea is.  I have not seen him for a long time.  I am not surprised because, if I were in his unfortunate position, an absolutely indefensible position, I might not be here either.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to think of this in terms of politics and victories or defeats.  I ask the Fine Gael Party to do the same, and between them to unwind this concoction of an amendment and allow this motion to be put to the House and carried, which is the desire of this House.</P>

      <P>The reason we in the Progressive Democrats have tabled this motion on Barringtons hospital is that it makes no economic, social or medical sense to close that hospital.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to all that more and more cutbacks are needed in the levels of public spending in this country.  For far too many years we have being living beyond our means and spending money which we could never really afford to spend.  Now, however, the time has come to pay for our mistakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is going to be any improvement in the public finances, all areas of society will have to play their part.  It is not going to be easy but, at this stage, there really is no choice in the matter.  Like everyone else the whole health sector is going to have to get used to less public money. <Col N="2348" /> The problem with this particular attempt at rationalisation in Limerick, however, is that it just makes no sense whatsoever. It will actually end up costing more money to the State to close Barringtons and provide the same care elsewhere than it would to keep the hospital open.  In comparison with other hospitals in the area, Barringtons is very economical to run and, more important, treats a very high proportion of public patients.</P>
    <P>That is another problem with the decision to close Barringtons.  If the hospital is closed it will be the poor people of the area who will be most affected.  These are the people who use the hospital most and they will be caused a great amount of hardship if this terrible mistake goes ahead.</P>
    <P>This is very different from the promises which Fianna Fáil made to the people of this country during the last election.  Over the past few months we have nearly become used to the fact that that party have changed their mind on nearly every issue that has come up, be it the Anglo-Irish Agreement, or the need for cutbacks, or whatever.</P>
    <P>I believe that Fianna Fáil realise full well that they have made a wrong decision in the case of Barringtons and that is the clear message they are getting from whatever supporters they have left in the Limerick region.</P>
    <P>They are a party who have now got quite used to making U-turns, and I appeal to them again tonight to make at least one more such turn.  They had to admit the error of their ways in their badly thought out primary education cuts, and it is now quite plain that that policy is effectively reversed.</P>
    <P>The Dáil has also forced them to change their disastrous decision to abolish the National Social Service Board. They had the sense then, too, to bow to the will of a majority in the Dáil.  I am appealing to the Government to show some similar sense here tonight and to reverse their decision on Barringtons.</P>
    <P>Of course, if they fail to do that, it still lies in the hands of the Opposition in this House to force a change of policy on the Government.  That surely is what the Dáil <Col N="2349" /> should be all about &mdash; giving the Opposition the opportunity to force a change of mind on the Government where wrong decisions are concerned.</P>
    <P>That is why I am also appealing to the Fine Gael Party to stop their codology. Everyone can now see through their tactics. They are pretending to be in favour of Barringtons but they know full well that their amendment will so divide the Opposition parties that the Government will win.  If they continue with their amendment, they must share just as much blame as the Government for this unfortunate wrong decision.</P>

      <P>I must say I was initially rather surprised when the original motion in relation to the closure of Barringtons hospital was put down by the Progressive Democrats, given their stated policies in relation to the control of public expenditure.  On reflection, however, their attitude on this issue must come as no surprise to anybody because since their inception, they have failed abjectly to show that they have the courage of their convictions.</P>
      <P>Public expenditure was to be mercilessly slashed and the incentives of the free market were to be allowed full rein. The Government have attempted to put some order back into the public finances and, at the same time, protect the weak and the underprivileged from the so-called &ldquo;free&rdquo; market of the Progressive Democrats.  In the lifetime of this Dáil the Progressive Democrats have continually reneged on their stated position and have supported populist policies as we witness here tonight.</P>
      <P>In this country we have a relatively high number of acute consultant staffed beds by comparison with numbers in other countries and particularly by comparison with that in the United Kingdom which has a health service and structure which is broadly comparable with that in Ireland.  I would also like to point out that over 50 per cent of all expenditure on health services in Ireland relates to general hospital services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to ensure that the available <Col N="2350" /> resources are used as efficiently as possible, I initiated a review of the acute hospital care system.  This review confirmed what was already recognised &mdash; that there was a surplus of acute hospital beds in the City of Limerick.  So, if money is to be spent where it is to have the most effect, at least one of the hospitals in Limerick has to close.</P>
    <P>This issue has been a good acid test for the Progressive Democratic Party. Where now are the statements of principle and the clarion calls for cutbacks? Where now is the much vaunted ideology of free enterprise?  Where now are the mould breakers of Irish politics?</P>

When these Deputies have to face a point of principal on their front doors as they do today, their courage evaporates, their principles disintegrate and their images crumble.  I think, perhaps that, on this occasion, they have forsaken national politics for parochial party politics.  Here we have a party without direction.  The reasons they thought they had for existence are no more.</P>
      <P>Might I quote a passage from one of their policy papers produced for their first national conference in May of last year? It reads:</P>
      <P>During periods of fast growth certain services no longer relevant to modern needs are allowed to remain in place, while new services tend to overlap existing ones.  There is in this area a clear need to rationalise these services, to discontinue obsolete ones and to eradicate overlap.  These are best achieved through good management practices.</P>

      <P>Why do we spend a higher proportion of our GDP on health care spending than many of our European neighbours?  Are we really getting a better service for this money?  Why do we need significantly more hospital beds per 1,000 people than the UK or Denmark.</P>

      <P>There are indeed many other statements of the Progressive Democrats which I could instance but I do not propose to delay the time of the House.  How do the statements which I have just read out compare with the Progressive Democrats' stance on the Barrington's hospital issue?  Here we have the Government practising the good management which the Progressive Democrats called for; we are phasing out overlapping services and reducing the overall level of acute hospital bed provision. This plan of action is necessary in terms of better acute hospital services, is one with which the Progressive Democrats agree and yet what do they do?  They oppose it.</P>
      <P>In Limerick, we have three hospitals providing the same type of services with three separate administrations and within a short distance of each other.  We are talking about rationalisation and this is what the Progressive Democrats are opposing in their motion.  It appears tonight that the Progressive Democrats are running away from their own motion and are following Fine Gael in asking for the closure of St. John's.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I go on to outline the position in relation to Barrington's hospital I would like to set out very briefly a few salient points in relation to the acute hospital services.  The past <Col N="2352" /> 12 months have certainly seen a considerable level of activity in this area. Most of the attention has focussed on the negative aspects of hospital and bed closures but I think I can claim that these were more than out weighed by the positive aspects of what we achieved.  As part of the rationalisation it was inevitable that some hospitals had to close.  This was also necessary if we were to control the level of spending on the health services and yet achieve the difficult balancing act of protecting to the maximum extent possible the funds available for other essential and priority services such as health promotion and community-based facilities.</P>
      <P>There have been many advances and innovations in the practice of hospital medicine in recent years.  This is evidenced by shorter lengths of stay in hospital, an increasing emphasis on technology and a change in the focus of our general hospitals away from the traditional in-patient care to treatment on a day or out-patient basis.</P>
      <P>The practice of hospital medicine is going through a very dynamic phase. It is essential that our hospital structures and organisation are adapted to meet the modern day demands and challenges with which we are faced.  The changes themselves mean that some hospital closures were inevitable if the rest of the system was to be adapted and strengthened to fulfil its new role.</P>
      <P>My concern at all times has been to minimise the level of closures and at the same time to ensure that a viable network of hospitals is retained.  I am satisfied that the measures which I have adopted have not only minimised any hardship which might otherwise have resulted from the hospital and bed closures but they have also allowed us to make considerable progress in strengthening and modernising our acute care hospital system.  This will enable us to provide the highest level of hospital and bed closures but have</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House will be aware, for example, that at long last the new Beaumont hospital was opened in November last and that major hospital building and development projects are under way at <Col N="2353" /> Ardkeen, Waterford, Sligo, Wexford, Cavan, Mullingar and Castlebar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The hospital in Wexford is closing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>These are some of the more positive aspects of what is being achieved but sadly these points are usually lost in the emotion which can be aroused in relation to a hospital closure. I fully acknowledge that it can be difficult for the local community and interests to accept the closure of a hospital but I have a wider responsibility for hospital and health services in the country as a whole.  I fully intend to discharge that responsibility in a constructive and responsible manner.  If this means that difficult decisions have to be taken then I will not shirk that task.</P>
      <P>As a result of what I, as Minister for Health, and the Government have achieved in less than 12 months I am fully confident that our hospital system can cope with any demands which will be placed on it and that nobody who is genuinely in need of attention will go without it.</P>
      <P>Before any hospital closes it is necessary for the Minister of the day to satisfy himself that the hospitals remaining in the system are adequate to cater for the needs of the catchment population.  I would now like to deal in some detail with the reasons which led me to decide to close Barringtons as a public hospital and with the alternative arrangements which I am making for the provision of hospital services in the Limerick city area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after I assumed office it became apparent to me that, in view of the oversupply of acute hospital beds, we could not continue to sustain the existing number of acute hospitals.  Many of these acute hospitals had become redundant because of other hospital developments in the areas.  In any event, it appeared that we had a surplus of such beds when we compared our level of provision with that obtaining elsewhere.  One of the initiatives I took was to establish a review group to examine the entire acute <Col N="2354" /> hospital system in order to identify the changes needed to bring the service into line with present day requirements, taking account of absolute need and the likely availability of resources.</P>
    <P>This group had discussions with every public hospital agency, both health board and voluntary, and in many instances more than one meeting took place where the optimum organisation of services was not immediately obvious.</P>
    <P>In March 1987, when I came into office, I was presented with a list of possible hospital closures.  One of the items on the list was Barringtons - St. John's. No previous decision had been made by either my Department or any previous Minister for Health as to whether St. John's or Barringtons, which are only 400 yards apart, should be retained.</P>
    <P>In the Mid-Western Health Board area two series of meetings took place &mdash; in June and again in August.  On each occasion the group met the Mid-Western Health Board and the two voluntary hospitals &mdash; Barringtons and St. John's. At these meetings it was pointed out that the mid-western area seemed to have a surplus of acute hospital beds and even though this is a relatively compact area hospital services were scattered over a large number of locations &mdash; all located within 25 miles of Limerick city.  The area had a total of 1,119 consultant staffed beds in nine different locations.  Since I understand there is some confusion on this point I will list them.  They were: Limerick Regional Hospital 385 beds, Limerick Maternity Hospital 129 beds &mdash; of which 31 are for the care of sick neonates; Barringtons, 88 beds; St. John's 100 beds; St. Camillus &mdash; this is a geriatric hospital but it did contain 30 paediatric beds; Croom, 120 beds; Nenagh, 110 beds; Ennis, 127 beds; Cahercalla, 30 maternity beds.</P>
    <P>The health board had gone some way towards rationalising the services in its hospitals by closing the 30-bed maternity unit at Cahercalla and the 30-bed paediatric unit in St. Camillus.  However, it was clear that there was scope for and indeed a need for further rationalisation. Because of this, at the June meetings <Col N="2355" /> the review group discussed with all the interests involved the possibility and desirability of concentrating the services of the two voluntary hospitals &mdash; Barringtons and St. John's &mdash; on one site with about 100 beds.  At the August meetings the policy of concentrating the services of both hospitals on one site was considered.  I have already pointed out that these two hospitals are only 400 yards apart.</P>
    <P>Now I am aware that claims are being made that the possibility of one of the voluntary hospitals closing was not made clear at these meetings.  However, I must point out that in August both voluntary hospitals put forward detailed submissions as to why each of them should be the hospital to be retained.  Significantly, neither submission suggested that both hospitals were fully aware of the possibility that one or other should be closed and that the logic of the situation was accepted by them.</P>
    <P>When the review group reported back to me I considered very carefully the outcomes of the meetings in Limerick. In addition I obtained an architectural report of the suitability of both hospitals as to their participation in the public health service in Limerick.  I would challenge Deputy Molloy to produce the evidence from the Mid-Western Health Board which suggested that Barringtons should be retained rather than St. John's.</P>
    <P>I should say at this stage that there is a school of thought that both Barringtons and St. John's should be closed.  I must say that this idea has much to commend it, and indeed, I did give it serious consideration. However, I finally decided that one of the two voluntary hospitals should be retained to co-ordinate with the Regional Hospital in providing acute hospital services in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Having decided that one of the hospitals should be retained as a publicly funded hospital I am satisfied on the basis of all the evidence presented to me that St. John's is the more appropriate location.  I have already indicated on a <Col N="2356" /> number of occasions why I decided that St. John's was the hospital to be retained but for the record I will repeat them:</P>
    <P>&mdash;St. John's is a more spacious site.</P>
    <P>&mdash;St. John's is a larger building.  It has a capacity of 120 beds as opposed to 90 at Barringtons.  I am aware that additional bed capacity could be provided at Barringtons by taking over staff accommodation but adequate bed capacity is already available at St. John's.</P>
    <P>&mdash;St. John's provides better potential for adapting to the changing needs of hospital medicine.  For example, it has a unit which is very well suited for the provision of day hospital services. It contains an endoscopy room, two five-bedded rooms and an area for a theatre.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The St. John's hospital building and services are on balance superior to those in Barringtons.  This is due largely to the fact that £500,000 was spent on improvements in 1985 and 1986.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The St. John's mechanical and electrical services are better.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley drew the analogy with football clubs.  I do not think we can look at this in the context of football clubs.  It appears to me that it is in the same context that the Progressive Democrats are looking at what is a very serious issue for the people in Limerick.</P>
    <P>I do accept that some services in Barringtons hospital are superior to those in St. John's, for example, the theatres and the x-ray unit.  However, these advantages are more than outweighed by those I have listed above for St. John's and indeed the operating theatres at St. John's are more than adequate to meet the needs of the people.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the fact that Barringtons was a hospital for the poor.  There appears to be an implication that St. John's and the Regional do not cater for the poor of Limerick.  I have made it clear on numerous occasions that, as Minister for Health, I will not tolerate a situation in any hospital in this country funded from public funds that does not provide the very highest level of care for the poor in this country.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In their motion the Progressive Democrats say that Barringtons is a highly cost-efficient hospital and I accept that it is but I will now deal with the issue.  If we compare the costs per patient treated in St. John's and Barringtons for 1986, the last year for which we have completed returns, we do find that Barringtons appears to be more cost-efficient than St. John's.  The average cost per discharged patient in Barringtons is £447 as opposed to £672 in St. John's. However, these figures do not take any account of the nature of the work undertaken in both hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The patients treated in Barringtons have a much shorter length of stay than those treated in St. John's.  This is what one would expect since Barringtons with its casualty unit is bound to have a large number of patients who need only a day or two in hospital.  This reduces dramatically their overall average length of stay.  If, however, we compare the average weekly cost per occupied bed in the two hospitals a different picture emerges. <Col N="2358" /> Now we find that the average weekly cost in Barringtons was £631 while the cost in St. John's was only £602.  On this criterion St. John's is more cost-effective than Barringtons. From these figures it is not possible to sustain the argument that Barringtons is much more cost-efficient than St. John's.  I might also add that the pathology service for Barringtons is provided from St. John's hospital.</P>
    <P>I am aware that certain suggestions and innuendos are being put about that I had some ulterior motive in choosing St. John's rather than Barringtons.  I want to say here and now that this is not the case. Prior to announcing my decision I received representations from no quarter or person whatsoever, apart from the two submissions made by the hospitals which I have already referred to.</P>
    <P>It has also been alleged that all previous considerations of hospital closures in Limerick focused on St. John's rather than Barringtons and that I have rejected the advice of my Department in this matter.  These suggestions have come from Deputy Desmond, among others. Again I must put it on record that this is not the case.  I have here with me a list of possible hospital closures which was on Deputy Desmond's desk when he was Minister for Health and one of the items on the list is Barringtons-St. John's.  This is clear evidence that no previous decision as to whether St. John's or Barringtons should be retained was made by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The half million pounds spent in 1985-86 is an indication that in 1986, the year before the change of Government, the Coalition, including the then Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, intended St. John's to provide public hospital facilities for many years to come.  If they did not do that they should not have spent £500,000 or he should have been before the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>Since I announced my decision on Barringtons on 10 December there have been some allegations of inconsistency on my part in view of an earlier statement I made in this House on 1 December that I did not envisage any further hospital closures in 1988 other than those which had already been announced or were in train.</P>
      <P>It has to be accepted from what I have outlined already that the closure of a voluntary hospital in Limerick was well in train by the beginning of December. Consequently there is no inconsistency between my statement here on 1 December and my subsequent announcement on Barringtons on 10 December.</P>

      <P>In my view it is preferable that discussions in relation to hospitals' roles or closures should first take place with the hospital authorities involved so that the business can be conducted in a calm, professional manner and away from the pressure which can be generated by premature public pronouncements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might point out, lest there be any confusion on the issue, that I also informed this House in a reply to a parliamentary question last week that a small number of other acute hospitals, funded directly by my Department, are likely to close this year and in all these cases discussions on the future roles of <Col N="2360" /> these hospitals have been in progress for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While on the question of alleged inconsistencies I would also like to deal with this issue of student nurses.  It has been stated, correctly I may add, that officers of my Department visited the hospitals in Limerick last November and discussed a level of intake of student nurses with these hospitals, including Barringtons.</P>
      <P>This is being interpreted as an indication that my Department did not know in November of the proposal to close Barringtons and that my decision in December came as a &ldquo;bolt from the blue&rdquo;.  This is not so.  It was necessary in November to try to achieve agreement on the overall intake of student nurses for the entire country for 1988 and this was done on the basis of the anticipated requirement for each hospital.  The number of students required for the Limerick area would be the same no matter how many or how few hospitals were to remain and it was considered at the time that the best approach was to agree a figure with each hospital as they then existed.  The whole question of nurse training in Limerick is a matter which still has to be resolved and this will be done in the near future in association with An Bord Altranais, my Department and the hospital authorities involved.</P>
      <P>The closure of Barringtons as a public hospital does mean that certain facilities at St. John's and the Regional Hospital in Limerick will have to be strengthened. This applies in a particular way to the accident and emergency departments at these two hospitals.  I have already announced that I am making available a capital grant of £400,000 for this purpose &mdash; £150,000 at St. John's Hospital and £250,000 at the Regional Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amounts are sufficient not only to provide a first class casualty unit at each hospital but also excellent day hospital facilities in both hospitals which is in keeping with the best practices in <Col N="2361" /> modern day hospital management.  It is well known that the casualty unit at Barringtons hospital needed to be replaced. There were long standing plans in my Department for a new facility at Barringtons which would have cost about £1.3 million to provide.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from any question of the closure of Barringtons there was an obvious need to rationalise casualty services in Limerick. Does it make sense to staff and run on a 24-hour, seven-day basis two casualty units which are only a few miles apart in a city the size of Limerick?  Indeed it is worth repeating that Tallaght in Dublin, which has a population roughly the same size as Limerick, does not have any casualty service and that in Dublin as a whole there are only two casualty <Col N="2362" /> units open after 5 p.m. &mdash; one on the north side and one on the south side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Considerable comment has been made in relation to the numbers who find it necessary to attend at the casualty unit in Barringtons.  The numbers are extraordinarily high at over 34,000 in 1987 and, indeed, there were over 40,000 attendances in 1986.  In fact, about 72,000 people attended at casualty at Barringtons, St. John's and the Regional Hospital in 1987 and this figure was over 82,000 in 1986.  This is an amazing figure and is all the more so when one considers that only slightly over 30,000 attended the casualty unit in Galway Regional Hospital last year which serves a catchment population roughly the same as that served by the Limerick hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>These figures deserve some explanation and I will be having immediate discussions with the Mid-Western Health Board as to how the Limerick figures can be reduced.  It would seem that many of those who go direct to the casualty units in Limerick do so for rather trivial reasons and should have been more properly treated by their general practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While on the question of casualty and emergency services I would like to mention the major emergency plan for the Limerick area.  I know that the suggestion has been made that Barringtons hospital has the primary role within the context of this plan.  This of course is not so.  The <Col N="2363" /> primary role in an emergency rests with the Regional Hospital and Barringtons and St. John's have been allocated support roles only.  The major emergency plan for the Limerick area is now being revised in the light of my decision on Barringtons.  I am satisfied that this revised plan will enable the health services in the area to cope adequately with any emergency which may arise.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned at the level of specialist hospital services provided at Limerick Regional Hospital.  In my view these should be strengthened considerably. I intend to do this to the maximum extent possible within the limits of the resources which can be provided by the Mid-Western Health Board. With general hospital services spread over three sites and some other services at other locations it would be difficult to achieve any worthwhile degree of specialisation. I intend taking advantage of the rationalisation now in train to begin to rectify this situation.  In addition, it so happens that a number of consultant vacancies exist in Limerick and further vacancies are due in the near future.</P>
    <P>In this connection I might add that of the seven consultant posts at Barringtons hospital at present, five are vacant or about to become vacant.  There are also vacancies at Limerick Regional and other hospitals in the area.  It is my intention that these vacancies will be filled.  They will be filled by consultants from disciplines which will provide the mid-western area with the specialist services which the patients need.</P>
    <P>I will be asking my Department and Comhairle na nOspidéal to commence immediate discussions with the Mid-Western Health Board and other local interests with a view to putting this reorganised and enhanced hospital system in place.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may be aware of recent difficulties in filling the critical post of chief executive officer in the Mid-Western Health Board.  This was a matter of particular concern to me.  I took immediate action to remedy this problem. A new chief executive officer is now <Col N="2364" /> in place in the mid-west and I have every confidence that he will be able to give the health board, its staff and other health personnel in the area the confidence and the sense of purpose which are required to enable the provision of the maximum level of health services in the area within the limits of the resources at his disposal. I can also assure him of my wholehearted support and that of my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would now like to comment on the Fine Gael stance on this issue.  Unlike the Progressive Democrats, I am glad to see that Fine Gael accept in their motion that the closure of some public hospital facilities in Limerick and the Mid-Western Health Board area is inevitable.  If Barringtons does not close then the spectre of closure looms for St. John's.  This is the reality of the situation.</P>
      <P>It is not realistic to have three hospitals with less than 600 beds in a city the size of Limerick.  I would hope that the Progressive Democrats would have the capacity to grasp this essential fact which is apparently only too evident to Fine Gael.  However, my difficulty with the Fine Gael amendment is that it still would provide for hospitals at three locations, even though one of them would be a private hospital.  Presumably this would involve some consultants working out of all these locations.  I do not consider this to be either desirable or necessary.</P>
      <P>The main problem with the Fine Gael motion is that the VHI are simply not in a position to afford the creation of further private hospitals.  They have stated this publicly and from the detailed discussions I have had with them I accept this fact. Otherwise VHI premia would become prohibitively expensive for the vast bulk of the people who insure with them at present.  In any event, I am satisfied that the Regional Hospital and St. John's between them will be in a position to provide sufficient private and semi-private beds to meet the demand for such facilities in the Limerick area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is one important point I would like to emphasise and that is that <Col N="2365" /> I would consider it wrong on my part or on the part of any political grouping to direct or suggest to any hospital authority that they should go private.  As Minister for Health I have no powers in this area nor would I wish to have them.  This has to remain a decision for the interests involved.  It is an area in which I do not intend to get involved.</P>

      <P>Before I conclude I would like to place on the record of this House my appreciation, the appreciation of the Government and, I am sure, of the people of Limerick, of the marvellous service which Barringtons hospital has provided over the 160 years of its existence. However, time marches on.  We have to face the realities of the present and, perhaps, more importantly plan for the future.  This is something that I, as Minister for Health, am committed to do in relation to our health services.</P>
      <P>In relation to this issue I am satisfied that I have taken the correct course.  I am satisfied that it makes good sense from the medical, social and economic points of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To add to the motion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that if, however, in the opinion of the Minister for Health, the rationalisation of the health service in Limerick requires the closure of a voluntary hospital, Dáil Éireann considers that St. John's hospital, rather than Barringtons hospital should be closed, and in the event of such closure, Dáil Éireann being aware that private medical interests have offered to purchase St. John's hospital with a view to keeping it in operation as a private hospital calls on the Minister not to inhibit this, or any other initiative along these lines.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to divide my time with some of my colleagues.  My party agree that the <Col N="2366" /> health services require a major review. In a service spending £1.2 billion each year a radical review must take place to eliminate inefficiencies, abuses, duplication and over-administration.  Unfortunately, the Minister came to office after four years in Opposition without a policy to his name.  He has implemented a series of decisions which did not tackle the fundamental problems besetting our health services and, instead, butchered the services that go direct to the public.</P>
    <P>The Barringtons hospital issue is a simple one.  Stripped of the hype and the emotions it has generated it remains a simple issue.  Fundamentally it is a question of whether the Government are wrong in calling for its closure or whether the people of Limerick are right in demanding its retention.  I, or my party, have no problem in coming to a definite conclusion in relation to this central issue. From the beginning it has been quite apparent that the Government have got it wrong.  A simple issue requiring an equally simple solution was totally immersed in Government messing that enraged a city and surprised even the diehard advocates of health cuts.  It remains a simple problem that has been mishandled by the Minister, in the first place, and by the Government.  They have made Barringtons a central issue in a health policy which has neither cogency nor coherency.  They have endeavoured to push it through as if there was no simple, rational, constructive or prudent alternative.</P>
    <P>It is blatantly obnoxious for the Government to behave in this highhanded fashion despite all the points put forward to the contrary.  Of course, arrogance is not new to the Fianna Fáil Party. Our position on this issue is clear.  We believe that Barringtons must be retained in its present format and if in the overall health budget one hospital in Limerick must be closed that hospital must be St. John's.  We believe that if private sources are interested in St. John's no obstacle should be placed in their way.  Private medicine is a fact of life here, as it is in all developed countries.  Our party do not have anything to apologise for in that <Col N="2367" /> respect.  State controlled medicine has run into problems worldwide and even the most prosperous of nations cannot afford to provide funding at a level that will adequately fulfil health obligations to their people.</P>
    <P>We have struck this problem but the Government in their muddled haste to get things in order have floundered and got things wrong.  Barringtons is one of those wrongs.  We have been criticised in recent days for allegedly advocating two-tier medicine and for encouraging private interests to step into the breach.  The policy of the Labour Party, and the other Left wing parties, is not necessarily the policy of the Right and, certainly, not in relation to my party's overall proposal in regard to Barringtons.  It is spurious and need not be addressed further in the debate.</P>
    <P>For some reason we can only guess at the Government's mule-headed approach to this controversy.  To me it is incomprehensible.  They have marooned their health policy, such as it is, in quicksand. I should like to make it clear that Fine Gael in Government recognised the need for a new approach to our growing financial problems.  We campaigned on that issue in the election.  Charity, and time, prevent an exposé of Fianna Fáil's disgraceful performance in Opposition on this crucial issue and now their incompetence in Government when their Damascus-like conversion to our strategy took effect is unbelievable.  Their preelection promises misled many cities and, in fact, misled the nation.</P>
    <P>We have not abandoned our committed support for the policy of financial restraint that we pursued in Government and continue to advocate in Opposition. We are proposing a sensible and meaningful solution that does not breach the guidelines we have set for ourselves and for the country.  Yes, we say, one hospital must close.  Barringtons and St. John's almost side by side are too great a burden together.  The one we believe should close is St. John's and we have spelt out the future for that hospital.</P>
    <P>I share the intrigue felt by a growing <Col N="2368" /> number of disillusioned supporters of the Progressive Democrats at their party's ambivalence as underlined in this case and at their performance tonight.  They are voluble enough in their enunciation of their policy of financial rectitude when they are sweeping the political canvas with the national brush.  However, on specifics such as this case when a local nerve is exposed they are deliberately imperfect.  I do not see this as the proper forum &mdash; we do not have the time &mdash; to highlight PD double talk when it suits that party but being all things to all men is indeed a hazardous course and the painful pitfalls of that course are now beginning to surface.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the rubbish and doubt talk of the Deputies for long enough.  We will continue on our policy course and we have not been found wanting in regard to it.  If we could see sense in the decision to close Barringtons we would, as we have done in the past, support the Government but getting it right has not been the Government's strong point when dealing with the health services. Admittedly, their task is difficult but by their actions they have more than often created insurmountable barriers for themselves.  Barringtons is a case in point.</P>
      <P>The decision to close Barringtons is unjustified on social, medical and economic grounds.  It is a busy hospital that is stretched to the limit.  Its standards of medical treatment are widely known and recognised.  Therefore, there is no case for closure on medical or social grounds. The closure of Barringtons makes no economic sense.  The facts show that there will be no savings in terms of staff and that there will be extra expenditure of £500,000 on the capital side.  Not only is it a bad decision on medical and social grounds but it is a dreadful decision on financial grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2369" /> In the course of a debate in the House on 3 February Deputy Michael Noonan spelled out the real case for keeping Barringtons open.  I should like to ask the Minister to defer his decision to close Barringtons and have a look at the matter again.  It takes a good person to admit that a mistake has been made.  The case put forward by Deputy Noonan earlier this month was a strong one.  The Minister's decision has all the signs of a panic one.  In the course of a reply to a supplementary question put by me on 1 December the Minister assured the House that there would be no further closures of acute beds in our hospitals. However, eight or nine days later he did a U-turn or he seriously misled the Dáil. It has all the signs of a panic decision by a man under pressure, a Minister who has lost his way and has no health policy. He is pursuing a policy of cost-cutting in a hamfisted way.  People are suffering. Some time ago I made the allegation here that people were dying.  I gave the evidence to the Minister but he has not yet replied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment tabled by my party regarding the closure of Barringtons hospital.  There has been much discussion on this subject on radio, television and in the newspapers. The whole issue is very emotive because Barringtons has given a great service to Limerick, Clare and parts of Tipperary.  Everybody was very surprised that this Government would take such <Col N="2370" /> a decision, especially in view of the promises they made when trying to get into power.  They created the illusion that when they came into power there would be no hospital closures or bed closures. This message was conveyed particularly by the then spokesman, now the Minister for Health.  It is my lot to represent County Clare and we had a particular problem in Ennis County Hospital. Deputy O'Hanlon asked repeatedly in this House for the extension of Ennis County Hospital, saying that facilities there needed to be improved.  Now we find that Ennis is to be rationalised and will be called a satellite of the Regional Hospital in the plan put forward by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Everyone in the region was shocked by the proposal to close Barringtons hospital.  It was realised that one of the two hospitals would go, either St. John's or Barringtons.  I do not know what element of competition existed between the two hospitals in getting to the Minister's desk but it seems that some particular group in St. John's had better bargaining power when the chips were down.  The general public believe that the wrong decision has been made and that Fianna Fáil are closing the wrong hospital.  They should have closed St. John's but instead they are about to close Barringtons.  That is the issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined his reasons and spoke about cost effectiveness.  I am not convinced that figures quoted to justify closure are ever totally accurate.  I am not impressed by the analysis done by the Department of Health and the Mid-Western Health Board in relation to cost efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have used Barringtons for emergency and casualty services and it has been very effective.  The Minister has said that in the case of an emergency or serious accident Barringtons does not figure high on the emergency list.  Geographically Barringtons is on the north side of the river.  There is easier access to it for the people of Clare or in the case of an accident at Shannon or in one of the factories north of the river.  This is the hospital which has been used traditionally <Col N="2371" /> in such cases.  There is not easy access to St. John's, even though the Minister has spoken about 400 yards. There is a great traffic bottleneck in this area and the additional 400 yards would cause grave problems for Clare people.  I cannot say I admire Limerick for everything because one problem they have not solved is that relating to traffic, especially in this area.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion calls for the closure of St. John's hospital.  This is the populist decision.  It is what the ordinary people want and they are the people who use public acute beds.  St. John's as I understand it, caters mainly for private and semi-private patients.  These would be VHI patients with B and C cover. More public acute beds would become available in the Regional Hospital.  That is why I expect the Labour Party to support this motion rather than reject it.</P>

    <P>His decision was based on a number of points, the first being that St. John's has a more spacious site.  The Minister is talking about 2.5 acres <i>versus</i> two acres and an additional two houses in Barringtons. That argument is really quits.  The number of beds is 120 versus 90.  There is plenty of room in the Regional Hospital <Col N="2372" /> to make up the additional 30 beds if St. John's is closed.</P>
    <P>When talking about the potential for adapting to the changing needs of hospital medicine, the Minister went on to say that there is a unit in St. John's which is suitable for day hospital services. That may well be, but there is plenty of space and potential within Barringtons to provide the same service.  In regard to structure, the Minister said that St. John's was in a far more satisfactory structural condition than Barringtons. Basically the Minister was talking about a new floor structure which has been installed in St. John's but not in Barringtons. That is very flimsy ground on which to base a decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that some services in Barringtons are superior.  As far as the people of Clare and Limerick are concerned, all services in Barringtons are superior, in particular the casualty and out-patients unit.  It is the largest such unit outside the Dublin region.  If other hospitals in the region were offering superior services would the people not be going to those hospitals? They are not.  They are going to Barringtons because they have confidence in it.  They have shown their confidence in Barringtons by their attendance.  It has the largest attendance outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement on student nurses and their future in the region is totally unsatisfactory.  The Minister stated that the whole question of nursing training in Limerick is a matter still to be resolved.  That is not acceptable.  It is appalling that a Minister should come in here tonight and say that.  In relation to the overall casualty-accident-emergency department, the Minister suggests that he will spend £150,000 on Saint John's and £250,000 on the Regional.  The Minister knows that to spend that sort of money in both those hospitals will not provide an adequate service such as that being provided in Barringtons.  Where will all the numbers of people from Clare and Limerick at present being treated in Barringtons go to be treated?  The other hospitals are incapable of treating them. I am now calling on the Minister to <Col N="2373" /> seriously reconsider his decision and to accept the Fine Gael amendment which is constructive, realistic and possible.</P>

      <P>I am sure I am speaking for every Member of the House in offering sympathy and condolence to the bereaved Oglesby family as a result of the tragic occurrence last Friday morning. Mr. John Oglesby is a great loss to his family, to the entire fishing community in Donegal and to the fishing industry.  His colleague, Mr. Tom Rodin, was injured in the incident on Friday morning and he is ill in Sligo hospital.  I wish him a speedy and complete recovery.</P>
      <P>There is great concern in Donegal and throughout the country at what happened last Friday morning.  As far as we can make out this tragic incident occurred at 3.30 a.m. on Friday and immediately a distress signal was sent out.  The signal was received in Shannon and elsewhere but no help was forthcoming.  The trawler had to make its way to Ballyglass Harbour in west Mayo.  The skipper was alive and in full control of his faculties for some time after the occurrence.  This is not the first time that a call for a helicopter has gone unanswered.  I have raised the matter of the search and rescue services in this House on a number of occasions.  I have stressed how important it is to have one of the five new helicopters based in the west or north-west to be available to reply to distress calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1 January a number of accidents occurred off the Donegal and the west coast.  Only about a week ago the <Col N="2374" /><i>Hellensport Courage</i>, a Liberian registered vessel went out of control 20 miles off the Arranmore coast, with 50,000 tonnes of crude oil and 23 members of a crew on board.  We did not have the facilities to come to their rescue and fortunately they succeeded in getting in order themselves and carrying on on their voyage to Scotland.  Last January five men were rescued from the <i>Kris An Avel</i>, another boat, off the Donegal coast and four crew members had to be picked up by a trawler in the area at the time. Last year there were a number of fatal incidents off the Donegal coast.  Late in 1987 <i>The Boy Sean</i> perished off Inishowen with four crew members lost. At that time we were depending on the RAF and the Portrush lifeboat to come to the rescue.  Unfortunately they were too late and four lives were lost.  Earlier in 1987 a young Donegal man was marooned coming ashore from his fishing boat near Greencastle.  The man was standed on a rock for an hour and no one came to his rescue.  He also perished.  I mentioned these incidents to show the regularity of these tragic occurrences off Donegal and the west coast.</P>
    <P>Recently, helicopters were purchased at great expense but they are still not operational at night.  From what the Minister has said it seems it may be another year before they are operational at night.  In the meantime we should approach the RAF who have always been willing to answer our distress calls to see if they would be willing to give us the personnel and the craft to base in the north-west or in the north of Ireland until we get our own helicopters operational. To mount a search and rescue operation we need the craft.  We have the craft but they are not fully operational.  We also need trained personnel.  Until we have fully trained personnel and fully operational craft we should make some arrangement with people who can provide the facilities.</P>
    <P>In a rescue operation communications are very important and we have difficulties in the area of communications. Indeed, up until the end of the year it was well known that the radio station at <Col N="2375" /> Malin Head, one of the most important in the country, was short staffed.  I do not know whether that situation has been remedied but, if it has not, those responsible should remedy it.  There is something more serious.  Even though Malin Head is a very important radio station and is vital in relation to making arrangements for search and rescue operations, the equipment there is obsolete.  Indeed, last week during this tragic incident which I mentioned earlier the station was operating a borrowed wireless set which was provided and lent to them by a firm in Donegal.  If that is true &mdash; perhaps the Minister will let us know whether it is &mdash; it is a sad reflection on the importance we attach to these vital services.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the sea and rescue service is the part played by lighthouses down through the years.  Not alone do the lighthouse keepers operate the lights, but they watch what is going on and provide a vital link very often between what is going on at sea and the rescue services on shore.  At present a policy is being implemented of de-manning these lighthouses. I understand Tory Island in my constituency plays a vital role in these communications.  I ask the Minister responsible and the Government to suspend this policy of de-manning until we go into the entire area of search and rescue, take our responsibility seriously, build this service up from the ground and have it functioning properly and effectively.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Kenny, will be coming in shortly.  We are all shocked and dismayed at the untimely death of John Oglesby.  His loss will be felt not only by his wife and family but by the entire fishing community of Donegal.  He was a leader of men, highly respected, who took up the challenge of the sea at an early age and was one of the great pioneering spirits of the Irish fishing industry.  His death was tragic but if by it we are provoked into reorganising the search and rescue services in this area that death may not have been entirely in vain.  I would like to pay tribute to the surviving members of the <i>Neptune</i> and <Col N="2376" /> her sister ship the <i>Golden Rose</i> who provided care and attention for the injured man until they got ashore in Ballyglass in Mayo.</P>
    <P>We have raised this matter in the House on numerous occasions, and I make a last plea to have these helicopters operational without further delay.  When they are operational it is vital to have them placed in the west because when an emergency occurs at sea, time is a crucial factor.  It takes an hour or more to fly from Dublin to the west, but if they are placed in the west, be it north Mayo or Finner, they will be within 20 minutes flying distance of south Galway and Malin Head, and security and all the facilities are there.  They would be safe there and strategically placed to provide this vital service on the north west and west coast.</P>
    <P>The incidents are frequent, some tragic, some where prople escape; never-the less they happen.  They will occur in future and that is not the time to start making arrangements to have a proper service; this is the time to do it, before we have to suffer any more.  I ask the Ministers and the Government to give this careful consideration, to look into the feasibility of having this service established in the west or north west and, in the meantime, perhaps to make approaches to the RAF and have one of their Sea Kings there until we get ours operational.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by Deputy McGinley. I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to have this matter raised in the House, and I thank Deputy McGinley for giving me a portion of his time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seas around the Eagle and westward can be savage and desolate.  Loss of life in any event is tragic for the personnel and families involved.  Loss of life at sea is particularly poignant and carries with it particular memories for those concerned for the remainder of their lives.  Air, sea and marine rescue services carry with them the badge of individual heroism. Each incident is specific, each is particular and this one, also, ended in tragedy.  I agree with Deputy McGinley <Col N="2377" /> about the urgency of training the personnel to fly the Dauphins at night and join with his call for the stationing of one of these helicopters in the west or north west area.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify some points as I am sure he has all the accurate technical details in his memorandum. I do not believe there was a lack of communication in this instance.  I understand Shannon control were contacted. They in turn contacted the control centre at Swansea.  A helicopter was to be sent from Aldergrove but this did not prove suitable and a Sea King helicopter was being prepared in Prestwick in Scotland. On examining the matter the services there felt that by the time the helicopter would get to the scene of the accident the trawler <i>Neptune</i> would have reached base.</P>
    <P>The RAF provide a very high level service to this country free of charge. In reply to my Question No. 136 of 9 February 1988 the Minister indicated that in 1983 the RAF carried out 70 air-sea-marine rescues; in 1984 there were 20; in 1985 there were 93; in 1986 there were 61; and in 1987 there were 50, all provided free of charge.  I understand the Air Corps, while not issuing a statement, answered questions on this matter.  They said that at 6.15 a.m. they were preparing a helicopter for flight but this was cancelled at 6.37 a.m. when it became obvious that the <i>Neptune</i> would probably reach harbour before the helicopter would reach there.  At this time of year daylight comes much later than 6.15 a.m. I am not sure that the Air Corps could have effected a rescue at that hour of the morning.  The Minister might clarify that.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about the broader issue in his reply to Question 135 on 9 February when he indicated that a private helicopter company of the UK are negotiating with the British Government for the contracting out of various services.  I know that is an internal matter for the British Government, but I urge the Minister that, whatever arrangements are arrived at between the private helicopter company and the British Government, <Col N="2378" /> this Government and this country should have the opportunity to discuss the consequences and its impact in terms of cost and effectiveness, speed of arrival at scenes of accidents etc.  I hope the Minister will take a serious view of that.</P>
    <P>When the <i>Neptune</i> arrived at Broadhaven Bay to Ballyglass Harbour no light showed from the lighthouse because the generator was out of action.  The ESB had been contacted about this.  There were no lights on the pier because these have been blown down due to storm, and electricity in the area had been out for some time.  The ironic fact is that half a mile from the pier electric power had been restored to houses in the vicinity.  I urge that the ESB should respond to sea calls particularly quickly because events like this, tragic as they are, happen continually.</P>
    <P>I endorse fully the call to base one of the helicopters in the west or north-west To have to fly from Prestwick or Aldergrove is not sufficient in this day and age. Fishing is expanding and accidents will happen.  The facts speak for themselves. It should be possible to base a helicopter in Finner Camp, Castlebar or Galway.  In each of these three areas there is a military presence.  Military barracks and garrisons are stationed there with helipads.  Any of those locations would be admirably suited to effecting speedy rescues anywhere off the west coast, and, remember, there is no lifeboat between the Aran Islands and Arranmore and the coastline there can be wild and desolate at this time of the year or in a storm.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify for us here whether he, as Minister for the Marine, and the Minister for Defence are fully satisfied that the Dauphin helicopter is capable of providing an effective night rescue service.  I understand some people have misgivings and doubts about the capacity of the Dauphin to live up to the proven record of the Sea King helicopter or others.  I do not understand fully why we have not our personnel trained as yet.  These helicopters were bought with public money, probably on the best of advice.  They should be based where <Col N="2379" /> they can effect the best service for the public.  I do not see why the expertise is not available to train our personnel a little more quickly.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I endorse the sentiments expressed here.  I express my sympathy with the family of the deceased and my condolences to the family of the injured seaman.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to express my deepest sympathy on the tragic death of John Oglesby and to extend to his wife Eileen, his son, daughters, father, brother, sister and all his relatives our deepest sympathy on their tragic loss.  I should also like to take the opportunity to wish a very speedy recovery to the injured fisherman, Tom Rodin, who is recovering in Sligo Hospital and to pay tribute to the crew of the <i>Neptune</i> and the crew of the sister fishing vessel the <i>Golden Rose</i> and all those who assisted in any way in relation to this tragic accident.</P>
      <P>In so far as the search and rescue services are concerned the position is that the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Shannon received a distress call at 3.48 a.m. on 12 February requesting a helicopter to take two injured fishermen off the fishing vessel the <i>Golden Rose</i> which was then near Eagle Island off the west Mayo coast.  While I understand that the accident occurred on the <i>Neptune</i> I am aware that the injured parties were transferred to the sister fishing vessel, the <i>Golden Rose</i>, and were brought ashore at Ballyglass pier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Army Air Corps have no night flying capabilities.  In the circumstances the MRCC immediately <Col N="2380" /> asked the UK coast guard at Swansea for RAF assistance.  At first the coast guard had asked the RAF at Aldergrove near Belfast to provide a Wessex helicopter for the mission and preparations in that regard were immediately set in train. However, it was later decided that the Wessex helicopter would be unable to handle the mission because of weather conditions and preparations were then made seeking a helicopter to operate from Prestwick.  This helicopter has a 90 minute alert time and when it was realised that it would not reach the Mayo coast until 7.50 a.m. the mission was abandoned because the fishing vessel would have landed the casualties before the helicopter arrived at the scene.  In the event the <i>Golden Rose</i> arrived at Ballyglass pier at 7.21 a.m. and a doctor and ambulance were in attendance at the request of the MRCC.</P>
    <P>The Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Shannon Airport are responsible for search and rescue operations within our regional responsibility.  The centre receive and assimilate information relating to marine distress situations and co-ordinate the activities of the various rescue units and services at their disposal in order to ensure that speedy and effective help is rendered to vessels and persons in distress.  The rescue service at the disposal of the MRCC include the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the Irish Army Air Corps, the Irish Naval Service, the coast radio stations at Malin Head, Donegal and Valentia in Kerry, the coast life saving service and the Garda Síochána. They also maintain close liaison with the UK and international search and rescue agencies such as MRCC Swansea, the UK coast radio stations, the US coast guard and the Spanish and French MRCCs.</P>
    <P>We have an understanding with the UK in search and rescue matters and the MRCC can ask for assistance from the British Navy and the RAF if the need arises.  In the case of incidents occurring beyond the range or capabilities of the Irish Air Corps it is common practice for the marine rescue co-ordination centre to call on the Royal Air Force or the Royal <Col N="2381" /> Navy for medium and long term range aircraft, Wessex and Sea King helicopters and Nimrod fixed wing aircraft to effect rescue.  Assistance from neighbouring countries and close preparation are essential if we are to provide an effective maritime search and rescue system. Assistance from the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy is always immediately available and requests and assistance have always been provided free of charge.</P>
    <P>In 1986 the Department of Defence acquired five Dauphin helicopters.  Two of these helicopters will operate in support of the naval services.  They have been specially equipped for shipboard operations and will be based on the <i>L.E. Eithne</i>.  The other three helicopters will be dedicated to search and rescue and other operations in support of the civil community.  This marks the start of a programme to replace the ageing fleet of Alouette helicopters which first entered the service in 1963.  As Deputies will be aware the Dauphin is a light twin-engine, ten-seat fast helicopter.  All five helicopters are equipped with highly sophisticated navigation and guidance systems making up an integrated flight system specifically intended to allow the helicopter to undertake search, rescue and surveillance missions over the sea and in bad weather.  In addition to their navigation equipment, they are fitted with full radio communications equipment, including homing facilities and search and rescue radar.  They are also equipped with a rescue hoist, stretchers, cargo slinging equipment, a search light and a loudhailer for use during rescue missions. Emergency flotation gear provides extra safety over water.  The Dauphin is a medium helicopter which can carry out rescues at distances of up to 110 miles from a suitable land base and has an endurance of three hours.  It can carry six to seven passengers and can accommodate up to four stretchers and a medical kit and crew.  They have already been involved in day time search and rescue operations and full night time flying capability is expected to be available later this year.  I know there has been some criticism of the delay in that respect but <Col N="2382" /> I now have an assurance from the Minister for Defence that the full service and night flying capability is expected to be available by June or July this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>When the helicopters are fully operational they will greatly enhance our search and rescue facilities but we are still likely to require RAF and Royal Navy assistance, though on a reduced basis.</P>
      <P>The lifeboat service around the coast of Ireland is provided and operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. They are an independent voluntary body who provide the lifeboat stations and appoint the station personnel, including the lifeboat crews.  There are three lifeboat stations on the west coast, at Valentia, Galway Bay and Arranmore.  The institution are satisfied that, with their present coverage of the west coast, they can meet the obligations they have and they have no immediate plans for further stations in the area.  In 1987 the RNLI provided a new 53 foot lifeboat in Galway Bay.</P>
      <P>The search and rescue agencies of the State are represented on the Irish Marine Search and Rescue Committee who operate under the chairmanship of an official in my Department.  The terms of reference of that committee are to keep under review the general arrangements for marine search and rescue in Ireland, to make recommendations for any improvements considered necessary, to consider the implications of any intended changes in equipment, deployment or organisation in any arm of the search and rescue organisation in advance of such changes and to take any measures which are necessary.</P>

      <P>They also review on a continuing basis marine search and rescue arrangements by reference to the facilities provided by each component organisation of the committee.  Most of the major operational search and rescue facilities are provided by organisations not under my control.  Any modification in procedures and equipment by any of these organisations will be carried out under their executive authority after discussion and consultation with other member organisations.  The committee do not submit recommendations in that regard to me and I would have no control over the bodies concerned.  In this context, for instance, the deployment of Army Corps helicopters around the coast of the State is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Defence and the deployment of lifeboats is a matter for the RNLI.  An ongoing function of the search and rescue committee is to consider the lessons to be learned from incidents involving the employment of search and rescue agencies and the efficiency of <Col N="2384" /> the responses of these agencies in situations such as we had recently.  Therefore, the committee will be looking at the <i>Neptune</i> accident and the lessons which might be learned from it to ensure that we can deal with deficiencies and put in place a system which will be efficient and effective.</P>

      <P>The embassy held discussions on this matter in the course of last year with the two relevant airline carriers at Heathrow (Aer Lingus and British Airways), the Heathrow Airport authorities, the customs and excise service and immigration service.

The development co-operation office in Khartoum was closed last month.  There are no plans to close any other embassy or mission.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to maintain diplomatic relations with Kenya on a non-resident basis.  It is also proposed to continue to maintain formal relations with Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, countries to which our ambassador in Nairobi has also been concurrently accredited.  Similarly our ambassador in Cairo will continue to be accredited to Sudan, as he is at present.</P>

I am sure that he would be happy to explain this concept further, if asked to do so.</P>

The Austrian People's Party (OVP) the smaller of the two parties forming the Austrian coalition Government, has now adopted a motion calling on the Government to seek membership of the Community.  Austria has not make a formal application for accession to the Community.  Such an application, if made, would be addressed to the Council; Article 237 of the EEC Treaty states that the Council shall act unanimously, after obtaining the opinion of the Commission.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 34 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>I made it clear in the Seanad on 16 December last the Government's deep concern at events in the occupied territories. I underlined the importance Ireland attaches to matters affecting the rights of the population of the occupied territories and I set out the essential principles underlying our approach.  Our concern has been conveyed to the Israeli authorities in the course of recent bilateral contacts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the beginning of the present disturbances the Twelve have co-operated closely in the framework of European <Col N="2154" /> Political Co-operation in order to convey to the Israeli authorities our shared concern for the population of the occupied territories.  On two occasions since the outbreak of the present violence, on 18 December and again on 12 January, the Presidency's ambassador in Tel Aviv has expressed to the Israeli authorities the views of the Twelve at the rapidly and seriously deteriorating situation and urgently called on the Israeli authorities to ensure the immediate protection of the inhabitants of the area.  The Presidency also conveyed the Twelve's concern at Israel's decision to pursue a policy of deportation in the occupied territories.</P>
    <P>At a meeting in Bonn on 8th February the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve had a thorough discussion of the situation. The declaration which they adopted, a copy of which is available in the Library, expresses their profound concern at conditions in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  The Ministers agreed that the <i>status quo</i> in the occupied territories was not sustainable.  They reiterated their conviction that the only solution is by means of a comprehensive, just and lasting political settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict in accordance with the 1980 Venice Declaration and subsequent Twelve declarations.  The Ministerial Declaration reaffirms Twelve support for the convening of an international conference as the most suitable framework for negotiations between the parties directly concerned.  It is for the parties directly concerned to agree on the precise modalities for the convening of this conference.</P>
    <P>I have informed representatives of some of the parties involved, including the PLO, of Ireland's support for a conference under UN auspices with the participation of the parties concerned and of any party able to make a direct and positive contribution to the restoration and maintenance of peace and to the region's economic and social development. I have also emphasised our commitment to play an active part in seeking to bring the positions of the parties directly concerned closer together with a view to the conference being convened <Col N="2155" /> at an early date.  Together with our partners in the Twelve we reaffirmed this commitment on 8th February in the declaration which the Twelve Foreign Ministers adopted at their meeting in Bonn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 36 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the party mentioned by Deputy O'Keeffe I am aware of the case. The person concerned, who was working in the US, was detained in January 1988 by the US immigration authorities.  She has been in touch with our Consulate General at New York where she was advised on the possible courses of action open to her.  I understand that she has now engaged a US attorney who will advise her on how best to seek a legal solution to her problem.  The Consulate General will monitor her case closely and will be available for consultation at all times should she require further advice. With reference to the more general aspects, as Deputies are no doubt aware, both the Taoiseach and I visited the <Col N="2156" /> US last March and discussed the problem of Irish citizens whose immigration status is uncertain with prominent Irish-American politicians, leaders of Irish American organisations and representatives of the US Administration.  I am happy to say that, as a result of this initiative, a draft Bill was published last year by Senator Kennedy and Congressman Donnelly which, if enacted into law, would provide a substantial increase in the number of immigrant visas available for Irish citizens.  This Bill has recently been co-sponsored by Senator Simpson and the redrafted Kennedy-Simpson Bill will be put before the Judiciary Committee of the US Senate in the very near future and may be passed by the Senate itself next month.  This is a most significant move and the Government have warmly welcomed it.</P>
    <P>During my two subsequent visits since March, and the visit of Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, early last month, contact was continued with leading members of the US Congress.  The measures before Congress were also discussed with Congressman Donnelly by both the Taoiseach and myself when he visited Ireland in January.</P>
    <P>As regards the more immediate problems facing the out of status Irish in the US, we have set up immigrant working committees, based on the consulates general at New York and Boston, to exchange information about these problems and to explore ways of finding solutions to them.  These committees are made up of leaders of the main Irish American groups who are actively engaged in this area, representatives of church social agencies and the consulate staff.  The committees have already done major work in gathering and disseminating information about the main problems facing our citizens in the US. In addition the staff of the consulate general at New York has been increased and the advisory services provided by our consulates have been extended.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the steps we have taken to promote legislative change and to develop our advisory services will <Col N="2157" /> improve significantly the situation facing our emigrants in the United States.</P>

Furthermore, it can also be expected that the agreement reached at the European Council on the Delors Plan at the end of last week will help to stimulate progress in this area.</P>

Permission for such overflights is normally granted provided certain conditions are met.

In the last ten years 20 requests for authorisation for foreign military aircraft to fly over the State were refused.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to previous questions on this matter on 8 December last I emphasised that the Government's overriding concern is to assess at all stages what are the most effective means of ensuring that neither Libya nor any other country offers support of any kind, moral, political or material to subversive elements in this country.  This remains the essential principle underlying the Government's approach.</P>
      <P>The Government will maintain their prudent and measured approach based on a careful assessment of all the facts available to it.  The Gardaí and French security forces remain in close contact in order to ensure that all relevant information is made available to the Government as the French judicial investigation into the operation engaged in by the <i>Eksund</i> and its crew develops.  As I have made clear in response to earlier questions, the Government will, when the full facts are available to them, carefully assess what further action may be required.</P>
      <P>There is a wider Twelve dimension to our concerns and I can assure the Deputy that the Twelve are actively examining in the European Political Co-operation framework how to improve co-ordination of their efforts to prevent the provision of material and other support to subversive organisations within the Twelve.</P>

      <P>I am aware of recent renewed public expressions of concern about the case of Raoul Wallenberg, who was last seen in Budapest in January 1945.  There are reports that he has been seen since then in different prisons in the Soviet Union. In 1957 Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko said that the conclusion should be drawn, from a document found in the archieves of the Lubyanka Prison in Moscow, that Wallenberg died in this prison in July 1947.  The statement made by Mr. Gromyko in 1957 remains the official Soviet position.</P>

    <P>The Wallenberg case is one in which successive Irish Governments have taken an interest.

Irish Government representatives &mdash; while recognising the legitimate concerns of creditors &mdash; have argued in various international fora for a more sympathetic approach to debtor countries, especially the poorest among them.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the task of compiling figures of the amounts of taxes outstanding is undertaken annually by reference to the position at 31 May for publication in the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Appropriation Accounts.</P>
      <P>Statistics of the amount of taxes outstanding at the end of each year are not compiled.</P>
      <P>The most recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is for the year 1986 and shows the amounts outstanding under the various tax headings as at 31 May 1987, under Schedules 1 to 10 (pages xii to xx).</P>
      <P>Except in the case of health contributions, the youth employment levy and the income levy &mdash; the only PRSI contributions hitherto payable by the self-employed &mdash; statistics are not available which would enable the Revenue Commissioners to identify outstanding balances attributable solely to the self-employed.</P>
      <P>A summary of the Comptroller and Auditor-General's most recent report in so far as outstanding tax balances are concerned was provided in my reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Higgins for answer on Tuesday, 8 December 1987 (Official Report Vol. 376, No. 5, Cols. 1061-1063).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A breakdown of the amounts of health contributions and levies outstanding from farmers and other self-employed people was given in my reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Desmond for <Col N="2171" /> answer on 20 October 1987 (Official Report Vol. 374, No. 3, Cols. 559-561).</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.  Statistics are not available which would enable the information requested by the Deputy to be given.  To determine such information would require identification of the cases involved, an individual examination of all the income tax returns and accounts of such cases and the provision of additional information by taxpayers in most instances.  Such an examination could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they examined these recommendations in detail following the publication of the second report of the Commission on Taxation.  To ensure comparability between that analysis and earlier work on the first report of the commission, the measures to which the Deputy refers were costed in 1983-84 terms as shown in the following table.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to supply figures for any tax year subsequent to 1983-84 as the Revenue Commissioners would have to divert scarce staff resources from other, more urgent tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2174" /> There have, of course, been numerous changes in tax law in the period since the Commission on Taxation's second report was prepared.  Some of these changes reflect in whole or in part the relevant recommendations of the commission.</P>
    <P>For example, capital allowances are now generally allowed on qualifying expenditure net of grants and the recent budget announced improvements consistent with the approach of the commission in tax treatment of cars purchased for business use.  Moreover, the reform of capital allowances also announced in the budget will go some way towards meeting the commission's recommendations in this area.</P>

    <P>It is not possible at present to give any estimate of the revenue gain to the Exchequer which would result if self-employed taxpayers were assessed to income tax on their income in a current year.

The market values of many of these benefits could not be determined from tax records without undue expenditure of staff resources in compiling the figures.  However, Revenue records indicate that the yield under existing legislation in 1986-87 from the main fringe benefit &mdash; use of an employer-provided car &mdash; was of the order of £31 million.</P>

This study covered the legislation relating to the C&amp;AG, the development of his role over the years and the possibility of expanding his role into the areas of economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  The study also looked at developments in national auditing in other countries.  The results of the study are now being considered but before any proposals are finalised consultation will be required with a number of interested parties.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts recently established an Advisory Group on Public Financial Accountability which is also considering the role of the C&amp;AG. An interdepartmental committee chaired by the Department of the Environment is reviewing the Local Government Audit Service.  The outcome of these reviews will be taken into account before any final decision is taken on the future role of the C&amp;AG.  I understand that both these reviews are expected to be completed this spring and I will announce decisions on any proposals for change as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if the partly demolished perimeter wall of Mountjoy Prison at the rear of numbers 40-86 approximately, Glengariff Parade, Dublin 1 can be rebuilt or replaced by an effective security fence as its present condition provides ready access to the rear of the houses, many of whose residents are elderly, in view of the commitment given to do so by the authorities eight years ago; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The high wall perimetering custodial precincts in Mountjoy is in sound structural condition and is not partly demolished or damaged in any way.  The wall to which the Deputy refers seems to be a rubble masonry wall about a metre high which demarcates prison property and runs roughly parallel to and about 12 metres outside the perimeter.  In the intervening space there is a surfaced private road along the perimeter and a grass verge along the low wall.  Apart from facilitating maintenance of the perimeter and <Col N="2184" /> of the lighting, this private roadway is availed of for staff car parking.</P>
      <P>The side walls to the back-yards of the Glengariff Parade houses abut this low wall and with passage of many decades extensions to the houses, sheds and so forth, have been built by occupants against and upon the wall.  It has been damaged, particularly at coping level, over the years by trespass across the wall into the area between it and the prison perimeter and by the effect of access being taken by occupants in over the wall to facilitate work being done to the houses.  Damage is not always properly repaired or repaired at all and in some instances has eventually to be done by Prison Service trades staff.</P>
      <P>There was correspondence with the local residents in December 1978 and discussions which, at their request, were postponed in January 1979 did not commence until 1982.  These were adjourned in March 1983 to enable the residents to consider the structures which had been built against and on the wall and the consequences of this.  There was no subsequent request to resume the discussions.</P>
      <P>Erection, at public expense, of higher walls or fences on prison property along the back of the Glengariff Parade houses, not by reference to security of the prison, which is not at issue, but rather to inhibit intrusion into private houses could not properly be undertaken by my Department. As with occupiers generally, responsibility for practical precautions to ensure the safety of their houses remains with the occupiers.</P>

      <P>In so far as US airlines are concerned, it would be a matter for the US Authorities to make the application in the first instance.  No such application has been received.  In any event, as the Deputy is aware, it is established Government policy that Shannon Airport is Ireland's sole transatlantic gateway and no change in this policy is at present envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as Canadian airlines are concerned, negotiations took place last December between the Canadian and Irish Authorities on a new air services agreement between Ireland and Canada. During those discussions, the Canadian Authorities sought direct access to Dublin and points beyond via Dublin for its scheduled carriers.  The Canadians were advised that direct access to Dublin <Col N="2188" /> was not possible in the light of the established Government policy to which I have already referred.</P>

      <P>I believe that cereal growers should concentrate on the efficient production of quality cereals for use in the milling and malting industries, both on home and export markets.  This is the best course for them to follow if they intend to remain in cereal production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in a position to produce the <Col N="2196" /> bulk of our cereal requirements but markets can be seriously disrupted by the large-scale importation of cereal substitutes. I have voiced my opposition to the extent of these imports on a number of occasions and am glad to see that the recent European Council has called upon the EC Commission to press for an appropriate solution to problems arising from imports of cereal substitutes into the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is scope for increasing the production of malting barley in this country for use on the Irish market and for sale on export markets either as malt or malting barley.  It is essential, however, that the quality of product should meet customer requirements. The variety used, the time of sowing, management during the growing season, with particular reference to nitrogen content, and care in handling the crop at harvest and drying time, are some of the factors to which special attention must be paid if we are to be successful in availing of these market opportunities.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if discretion is allowed to inspectors from his Department to decide the eligibility of an applicant for headage grants within certain townlands when such an entire townland has been designated as disadvantaged; and if an inspector is empowered to decide himself those who are eligible for grants and those who are not eligible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that this question refers to mountain sheep areas in certain <Col N="2197" /> townlands in Leinster and Munster which are designated as disadvantaged for sheep headage purposes.  In these areas, lowland sheep do not qualify and only mountain ewes and hogget ewes of specified breeds and types substantially maintained on mountain grazing are eligible for sheep headage payments.</P>
      <P>When carrying out inspections each year my Department's inspecting officers must verify that the sheep presented by applicants in these townlands are mountain sheep substantially maintained on mountain sheep grazing lands.  As only part of some of these townlands comprises mountain sheep grazing lands, it is inevitable that some applicants cannot meet these requirements and therefore are ineligible for sheep headage payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Michael Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Michael Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following investigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned, he was assessed with means of £10.75 derived from the value of board and lodging in his parents' home.  He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and an appeals officer, on 10 February 1988, assessed him with means of £8.40 weekly with effect from 28 May 1987.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance of £25.60 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £34 less means of £8.40.</P>
      <P>The delay in this case, which was due to a clerical error, is regretted.  All arrears due to the person concerned will be paid this week and weekly payments of £25.60 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>From 4 January 1988 her claim was governed by the 1986-87 contribution year.  Because of an administrative error the number of contributions recorded on her behalf was shown as 37 which resulted in payment being issued at a reduced rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a person (details supplied) in Dublin 16 is considered for pay-related benefit in the 1985-1986 tax year, although benefit only commenced on 4 January 1988; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 16 November 1987.  He did not qualify for benefit at that time as he had less than the required minimum of 39 contributions paid or credited in the 1985-86 year which governed his claim from that date.  He was however awarded credited contributions on foot of his weeks of incapacity which will reckon towards future entitlements.</P>
      <P>From 4 January 1988, his entitlement to disability benefit depended on his insurance record for the 1986-87 year. The person concerned qualified for payment at that point as he had 50 contributions recorded for the 1986-87 year. Disability benefit is now issuing at the weekly rate of £90.20, the maximum rate appropriate to a married man with two dependent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although entitlement to flat rate disability benefit can be affected by different contribution years at different stages of a claim, entitlement to pay related benefit <Col N="2204" /> remains dependent on the last complete income tax year before the beginning of the pay-related benefit year in which the first day of incapacity for work occurs. This insured person's entitlement to pay related benefit is therefore dependent on his reckonable earnings during 1985-86. He does not qualify for payment as he has insufficient earnings in that tax year.</P>
    <P>All disability benefit currently payable has been issued to 8 February 1988, the date of the latest medical certificate received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the anomaly in the Pay Related Benefit Regulations 1979 (S.I. 141, Par. 5(1) (a)) whereby a person who becomes sick in December 1987 is governed by the 1985-1986 tax year for pay related benefit purposes, whereas a person who becomes sick in January 1988 is governed by the 1986-87 tax year, and will generally receive higher pay-related benefit; whether he proposes to put pay-related benefit on the same footing as other benefits whereby the new benefits year come into operation for all claimants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 19(1)(b) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act requires a claimant for disability benefit to have 48 contributions paid or credited in the last complete contribution year before the beginning of the benefit year which includes the day for which benefit is claimed. The benefit year starts on the first Monday of January each year and the governing contribution year is the last complete tax year before the start of the benefit year.  Thus for a person who claimed benefit in December 1987, the governing contribution year would be the 1985/1986 tax year whereas for a person who claimed benefit in January 1988 the governing contribution year would be the 1986/1987 income tax year.  For administrative reasons it is necessary to have claims to benefit calculated on the basis of the last complete tax year before the year of claim because this is the latest <Col N="2205" /> year in respect of which full details of earnings and PRSI contributions would be available.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 5(1)(a) of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Regulations 1979 (S.I. No. 141 of 1979) states that the relevant income tax year in relation to pay related benefit is the last complete income tax year before the beginning of the pay-related benefit year in which the first day of incapacity for work in a period of interruption of employment occurs.</P>
      <P>For the vast majority of claimants to disability benefit the governing contribution year in which they must fulfil the contribution conditions for qualifying for payment and the relevant income tax year for pay-related benefit purposes coincide.  However, in a small number of cases if a claimant does not qualify for benefit on application but continues to claim into a new benefit year, it can happen that he will satisfy the contribution conditions in the later contribution year and therefore be entitled to payment but the application of paragraph 5(1)(a) of SI No 141 of 1979 ties the determination of his pay-related benefit to the earlier tax year because that was the tax year which governed the benefit year in which he first became incapacitated. It should, however, be pointed out that in some cases the earlier tax year may be more favourable for a claimant, for example, if his earnings were higher in that year while he had much lower earnings in the later tax year.  I will nevertheless have the matter examined to see if a more satisfactory arrangement can be achieved which would at the same time be administratively feasible.</P>

      <P>Following re-investigation of his unemployment assistance claim, the <Col N="2206" /> person concerned was assessed with means of £12.99 weekly derived from the value of board and lodging on his father's holding and from the value of capital.  He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and an appeals officer reduced the assessment to £10.00 weekly with effect from 9 December 1987.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance of £26.60 weekly being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £36.60 less means of £10.00.  All arrears due to the person concerned were paid on 4 February 1988 and weekly payments of £26.60 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason the part-time job allowance scheme gives those participating an allowance in respect of a spouse, but no allowance in respect of dependent children, as do other social welfare schemes; and the cost of extending such an allowance to include provision for children on an equivalent basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The part-time job allowance scheme has been operating on a pilot basis since September 1986.  Under the scheme, an unemployed person may take up part-time employment for up to 24 hours a week and still retain entitlement <Col N="2207" /> to a basic income maintenance payment by way of a flat-rate allowance from my Department.  The allowances are £25 for a single person and £40 for a married person with a dependent spouse.  In the Cork area there was throughout the pilot scheme an additional payment of £2 per week in respect of each dependent child.</P>
      <P>The amount of earnings from part-time work do not affect the allowances payable and the incentive which is built into the scheme is the fact that participants are free to maximise their earnings from part-time working without suffering any reduction in the allowance.  The part-time job allowance scheme is, therefore, different in a fundamental way from other payments under the social welfare code, such as unemployment benefit or assistance.</P>
      <P>Information is not readily available on the family status of married participants and it would be difficult to estimate the numbers that might participate in the scheme if the payment structure were changed.  However, there is not evidence from the pilot phase that the different payment structure in the Cork area was a positive factor in the take-up of the scheme in that area.</P>
      <P>As already announced the part-time job allowance scheme is to be extended nationwide with effect from April 1988 and the allowance for a participant with a dependent spouse will be increased to £45 a week.  This scheme will continue to be monitored by my Department and it will be subject to review in the light of the experience of the extended nationwide scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the social insurance system, permanent and pensionable public servants are covered for contributory widow's pension, contributory orphan's allowance and deserted wife's benefit.  The social insurance element of their PRSI contribution is 2.75 per cent, employer 1.85 per cent and employee 0.9 per cent.</P>
      <P>The social insurance schemes which it is proposed to extend to the self-employed are contributory old age pension, contributory widow's pension and contributory orphan's allowance.  The proposed rates of social insurance contribution to be applied to self-employed contributors, as announced in the budget, are 3 per cent from April 1988, 4 per cent from April 1989 and 5 per cent from April 1990.  If the present 2.75 per cent rate appropriate to public servants was raised to these levels, the additional income arising over the next three years would be as follows: 1988, £4 million; 1989, £21 million; 1990, £43 million.</P>
      <P>These additional amounts would however be a relief to the Exchequer only if all of the increased contribution rates were levied against the employee.  The present contribution of 2.75 per cent is divided between employer and employee in the ratio 1.85 per cent to 0.9 per cent. If that ratio were to be maintained with the increased rates there would obviously be a cost in similar proportion to the Exchequer as employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional income in a full year if <Col N="2209" /> existing social insurance rates, including a rate of 3 per cent for the self-employed, were applied without an income ceiling would be £83 million.</P>

      <P>One of my priorities is to ensure that every opportunity is taken by the semi-State bodies under my aegis to keep prices as low as possible.</P>
      <P>Electricity prices are being reduced by approximately 5 per cent across the board with effect from the March-April and April-May consumption periods. This reduction is on top of a reduction of 3 per cent in domestic charges and 7.3 per cent in industrial-commercial charges announced in early 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since INPC acquired the Whitegate Oil Refinery in 1982, there has been a significant reduction in prices.  While this is substantially due to the fall in crude oil prices, the management and workforce of the refinery must also be credited with achieving economies which have contributed to cost minimisation.  On average ex-Whitegate product prices dropped by over 40 per cent in 1986 as compared <Col N="2213" /> with 1985, followed by a further reduction of about 16 per cent in 1987.</P>
    <P>Natural gas is currently supplied on attractive competitive terms by BGE, when compared with the cost of alternative oil products and it is intended to maintain this policy.  The average price per therm came down by over 20 per cent compared with 1986, which in turn was 15 per cent down on 1985 prices.</P>
    <P>Due to the current financial difficulties of Bord na Móna, a reduction in peat prices is not proposed for the present.</P>
    <P>In general, the prices charged by the energy semi-State companies have come down in line with decreases in world energy prices over the past number of years.  It is my intention to keep prices as low as possible bearing in mind the cost of supplies and by insisting on further improvements in operating efficiencies in the semi-State energy sector.</P>

    <P>The Treaties establishing the European Communities provide for the <Col N="2214" /> development of nuclear energy but there are important provisions in the Treaties relating to the protection of health and safety of workers and the general public and the safeguarding of nuclear materials.</P>
    <P>It is through Ireland's membership of the European Communities including the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) that the Government have a means of expressing these views and having them more fully and effectively taken into account than could ever be possible outside the Communities.  It is within the framework of Euratom that I have been pressing for the establishment of a Community nuclear inspection force. Health and safety are major elements of the Euratom Treaty and considerable Community resources are spent on this aspect of nuclear power.  The Government's priority is that Community competence in these areas should be increased.</P>
    <P>The provision for Community expenditure on promoting its nuclear objectives are contained in the Community budget.  Once a budget is adopted, in accordance with Community law, the Community is legally entitled to collect the financial resources needed to finance the budget.  These resources belong to the Community itself and not to the Governments of the member states who merely collect them and pay them over to the Community as its agent.  It is not open to a member state to opt out of payment of any part of the resources which are the property of the Community.</P>
    <P>Community financing of individual nuclear installations in member states is by way of loans from Euratom and the European Investment Bank.  Such loans are made at commercial interest rates, the funds are raised in the financial markets and are not provided out of the &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; used to finance the budget of the Communities.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for funding nuclear expenditure in the Community do not in any way inhibit the Government from pursuing their concerns about the safety <Col N="2215" /> of particular nuclear installations or operations either in the framework of the EC or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I have received the representations to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Act, 1980, empowers me by Order to designate an area within which it is lawful to engage in aquaculture subject to licence.  The first step in a process which may or may not lead to such a designation of Oysterhaven was taken towards the end of last year when a notice was published inviting representations or objections to the proposed designation.  The Act provides that I can order a public inquiry &mdash; to be held locally &mdash; on foot of the response to the press notice to hear all sides in relation to designation prior to making an Order. I have not yet reached a decision on this case.</P>
      <P>I would take this opportunity to point out that the designation of an area for aquaculture purposes does not mean that the area will be exclusively reserved for aquaculture.  The fish farming industry must be developed in harmony with the interests of other water users including navigation, traditional fishing, amenity interests, sailing etc.  The process laid down in the Fisheries Act, 1980, is designed to reconcile the needs of various water users and, where that is not possible, it enables me to decide where the balance of advantage lies.  If Oysterhaven Bay is designated for aquaculture, the licensing of any aquaculture projects must take account of the requirements of other water users in the bay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of works on main and county roads falls to be financed by a combination of State road grants and local resources.  The relevant State grants are the block grant, county road strengthening grant and special improvement grants.  In the case of Kildare County Council, the grants allocated under these headings in 1988 are £374,000, £315,000 and £515,000 respectively.  The local authority has considerable discretion regarding the distribution of the block grant and the county road strengthening grant.</P>
      <P>I understand that the estimates adopted by the local authority for 1988 provided for an expenditure of £1.187 million on main and county roads from local resources.  The question of the sufficiency of this provision, which was determined subsequent to the notification of State road grants for the year, is a matter for the local authority.</P>
      <P>Detailed information has been received from all county councils, in response to a departmental circular, issued in May 1987, about the condition of the network of county roads together with estimates of the level of investment required to remedy deficiencies in the network.  This information is being considered in the context of the preparation of a blueprint for road development which I intend to publish within the next few months.  The blueprint will address the question of the long term needs of the entire system of public roads, including the networks of county and main roads.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the problems affecting the houses at Cox's Demesne, Dundalk.  The refurbishment of the houses is the responsibility of the urban district council using funds provided under the Department's remedial works scheme.  A decision in regard to works to further <Col N="2229" /> houses in the estate will be made following an evaluation of the technical and cost results which will be submitted by the council on completion of the 20-house phase.  The current unit cost is £5,388.37.</P>
      <P>Because of the ground conditions in the estate, the council did not consider it feasible to replace the panels with conventional construction.  The timescale for completion of refurbishment work to the estate will be dependent on the capital provided in the annual public capital programme and the demands of other authorities for assistance under the remedial works scheme.  I hope to be able to notify the allocations for 1988 to housing authorities in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2234" /> Emission limit values have not been specified for any class of premises or air pollutant.  However, under section 24 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, there is a general obligation on all non-domestic premises to use the best practicable means to limit and, if possible, to prevent emissions.</P>
    <P>Specific guidelines have not been set for the disposal of incinerator waste residues, but disposal of any such wastes is subject to the European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979 or, in the event of wastes coming within the definition of toxic or dangerous, to the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982. Appropriate conditions in relation to the handling, storage or disposal of wastes could also be incorporated in the planning permision for an incinerator.</P>
    <P>Environmental control in relation to the two particular cases mentioned in the questions is a matter for the local authorities concerned within the statutory framework described above.  In the case of the waste incineration facility, I understand that Dublin Corporation have as yet taken no final decision to proceed with it.  In the case of emissions from the Beaumont Hospital incinerator, I understand that the corporation have investigated the problem and are discussing ways to resolve it with the hospital authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>Licences granted during the calendar year 1987 would permit the importation of up to 53,503,264 condoms.  However, this does not mean that this quantity was actually imported in 1987.  During the period of validity of a licence, the licence holder may in fact import far fewer contraceptives than the maximum authorised under the terms of the licence.  Moreover, as an import licence is issued to cover any period of 12 months, most of the licences issued during 1987 would not yet have expired.</P>
      <P>I regret that it is not yet possible to give a final figure for sexually transmissible diseases for 1987 as not all community care areas have submitted their returns to my Department.  I will forward the final figures to the Deputy setting out the incidence of particular types of diseases, as soon as they have been submitted to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to say if the incidence of sexually transmissible diseases has increased or decreased with the greater availability of condoms.  It is accepted internationally that sexually transmissible diseases are often under-reported and it is therefore not possible to determine the degree to which specific factors influence the actual incidence of these diseases.  As regards the reporting <Col N="2243" /> of these diseases, the fee for reporting was increased in 1981 when the number of cases reported was 2,474.  In 1982, the number of cases reported increased to 2,523 and the increased fee, for instance, may have been a factor which influenced the increase in the number of cases reported in 1982.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the problem of underage drinking and the problem of alcoholism in general.  I have had inquiries made of the North-Eastern Health Board and I have been informed that there have been no admissions to the Rathlin Unit at St. Davnet's Hospital, Monaghan since 19 April, 1987.  This 10-bed unit which is located in the hospital's admission unit had an occupancy rate of under 25 per cent in the six months prior <Col N="2244" /> to April 1987.  Persons now admitted because of alcohol-related problems are treated in the hospital's admission wards. Treatment for alcohol-related problems has become more out-patient orientated at St. Davnet's Hospital with greater emphasis on seeing patients in their own homes and involving families in the therapeutic process.  In addition, a community education and preventive programme is provided by hospital staff.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the North-Eastern Health Board is providing a comprehensive service from St. Davnet's Hospital for persons with alcohol-related problems which is in line with the policy set out in the report of the Study Group on the Development of the Psychiatric Services &mdash;&ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;.</P>

However, I must emphasise that medical need should be the criterion for admission to hospital services.  The admission of a patient to hospital is a matter for the clinical decision of the consultant concerned and the hospital authority.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to initiate an inquiry on behalf of an individual patient in these circumstances.  Should the Deputy wish to pursue the matter, he should contact the Southern Health Board direct.</P>

      <P>There is a need to rationalise the existing practice whereby in-patient services which are provided by health boards for particular catchment areas are not availed of by persons who opt instead to use similar services outside their functional area.  The controlling mechanism which I propose will involve a health board approving non-emergency external referrals for services which may be availed of by persons without attracting a special <Col N="2247" /> charge.  Patient interest, the range of services provided by a board within its functional area and the geographic location of services and patients are important factors which will be taken into account by boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Measles Campaign which ran from 1 October 1985 to 31 March, 1986 required a particular concentration of effort and resources and achieved a national uptake of 95 per cent.  In this context, the number of cases of measles notified to my Department was 9,903 in 1985, 451 in 1986 and 201 in 1987.  Following the campaign, routine immunisation of children aged 15 months was introduced and the uptake for this category is now approximately 45 per cent, ranging from 28 per cent in parts of Dublin to 82 per cent in Clare.  The current uptake figure for the North Eastern Health Board area is 45 per cent.  If this level of uptake were to continue, eradication of the disease would not be achieved and cases of measles would continue to occur with consequent illness and suffering and, in some cases, long term disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the need for a high level of measles immunisation and, in an effort to increase the current uptake level, my Department has held meetings with the Directors of Community Care and Medical Officers of Health, and with the Irish Medical Organisation, who have been asked to make special efforts to promote measles vaccination.  A major <Col N="2248" /> cause which has been identified for the drop in the uptake of measles vaccination, is the perception among parents that measles is not a serious disease and their resultant failure to bring their children for vaccination.  The health boards notify parents routinely to bring their children for vaccination at age 15 months and if the objective of eradication of the disease is to be achieved a constant 95 per cent uptake must be maintained. Arrangements to promote the vaccine and to encourage parents to have their children vaccinated need to be intensified at local level.</P>
    <P>My Department will be contacting the health boards shortly with a view towards putting in place the arrangements necessary to achieve and maintain an uptake of 95 per cent.  The North Eastern Health Board will be part of these overall arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that during the course of my speech to Dáil Éireann on the 1988 Estimates I announced that with regard to additional productivity in the area of higher education I will be having a study carried out which, <i>inter alia</i>, will look at the savings that could be made, or the additional student numbers that could be accommodated at no extra cost, by reducing the length of courses for qualifications awarded by the NCEA. I have also asked the Higher Education Authority to carry out a similar exercise in their own sector by examining the question of shortening four year degree courses to three years.</P>
      <P>I also stated that I will be presenting proposals to the Government on the establishment of an interdepartmental committee representative of the Departments of Education, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Labour, Health and Agriculture and Food to examine:</P>
      <P>&mdash; the provision of third-level places,</P>
      <P>&mdash; the rationalisation of third-level departments and institutions, and</P>
      <P>&mdash; the funding of these institutions.</P>
      <P>This committee will take into account the study already referred to and such factors as demographic trends, personnel requirements and the existing numbers of student places in third level institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the above and of the considerable building developments in the universities and other third level institutions in recent years, the Government have decided not to proceed with a range of capital developments to provide additional student places at third level.  It was felt that to proceed would be inappropriate in present financial circumstances and that all other possible options in relation to additional productivity and student throughput must be <Col N="2256" /> fully and carefully considered before any new major building programme is initiated.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the proposed new regional technical college at Blanchardstown is among a number of building projects which have been deferred.</P>
    <P>Pending the report of the interdepartmental committee to which I have referred, it would be inappropriate to consider whether any elements of a proposed regional technical college for Blanchardstown should be developed in conjunction with the Corduff Community College.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the average State grant and local contribution in respect of (a) new buildings at primary school level and (b) improvements to existing buildings at primary level; and if it is the case that higher rates of grants relative to local contributions are offered usually in the case of new buildings or major works, than in the case of minor improvements; and, if so, the reason.</P>

      <P>The average State grant and local contribution in respect of new national school buildings and improvements vary from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2258" /> It would be true to say that higher rates of grant relative to local contributions are offered in the case of major building projects than in the case of minor improvements, since finding large local contributions usually represents a considerable burden on school authorities.</P>
    <P>The amount of the grant laid down for the building, improvement and furnishing of a national school is two-thirds of the cost.  This rate would be applied to minor improvements.  In exceptional circumstances the Minister has discretion to offer larger grants than the norm if satisfied that one-third of the cost of the works cannot be contributed locally.</P>
    <P>Local contributions for major projects are negotiated on the Minister's behalf by departmental officers who would decide from experience the appropriate grant rate to offer to individual schools.  If necessary in the course of negotiations the advice of the patron would be availed of to ensure general equality of treatment.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to give the Deputy the actual averages in recent years for State grants and local contributions, since the compilation of such information would require the expenditure of an inordinate amount of official time.</P>

      <P>Because of the pressure on <Col N="2259" /> the capital funds available to my Department for the national schools building programme, it will not be possible at present to advance further the architectural planning of a proposed permanent extension to the County Cork school referred to, which had been listed for the preparation of sketch plans.</P>
      <P>My Department recently sanctioned a grant towards the cost of providing two prefabricated classrooms at the school. Tenders are about to be sought for this accommodation.</P>

      <P>A leaflet giving general information about the various schemes under which aid is provided to students in third level colleges is already available from my Department.  The body responsible for the administration of each scheme of aid advertises such scheme annually in the public press and makes copies of the scheme available free of charge to interested parties.  These present arrangements have proved adequate for this purpose, but if the Deputy is aware of any particular difficulty in obtaining information, I would invite her to communicate with me.</P>
