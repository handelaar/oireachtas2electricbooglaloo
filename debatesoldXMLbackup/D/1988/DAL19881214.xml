      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that we are dealing at the moment with an amendment proposed by Deputy McDowell which concerns the powers to obtain information in the course of an investigation which has been undertaken. I understand that a number of points were raised in the Seanad by Senator Patrick Kennedy in regard to this matter. It derives from the issue as to whether the investigation is, in fact, a judicial process and, if so, in that regard the investigator has powers to summon witnesses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy, but can we be clear that we are now dealing with section 10, amendment No. 7 on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Martin Cullen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I meant. I was explaining essentially that matter. I do not fully appreciate what the amendment from Deputy Cullen is designed to achieve, but I am aware that there is a problem in this area arising, I think, from the case where the Committee of Public Accounts of this House were seeking to have evidence from a Member of the House who is still a Member of the House, in <i>re</i> Haughey.  I understand the committee were not able to obtain the evidence that they would have obtained if they were acting in a judicial capacity.</P>
      <P>The question again arises as to whether an investigation in these circumstances could be frustrated, or in any way deprived of evidence that the committee might otherwise obtain, on a similar ground that their judicial capacity might be challenged.  Whether that is an issue that is addressed in the amendment by Deputy Cullen or not, I am not certain. It would be useful if the Minister would address that issue when dealing with the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 would introduce <Col N="1504" /> two changes to section 10 (4) of this Bill as it now stands.  First, it would enable the inspector to address a series of written questions to any person being examined, whether instead of, or in addition to, an oral examination.  That is the key import, as I understand it, of Deputy Cullen's amendment.  I can see how such a device might be a useful enough tool in the inspector's armoury.  The amendment would also allow the inspector to record the answers given by any person exam-lined and require that person to sign the answers.  I can see the merit of this aspect of the amendment.  Probably the amendment will improve the Bill and I am quite prepared to accept it on that basis, the main change being that the person in question would be asked to sign his or her answers.  That is a reasonable enough approach.  I am happy to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister of State for that.  Deputy Cullen's amendment is an important and useful one.  It arose out of my own personal experience in trying to investigate two companies where I was advised, correctly as it happened, by the Department of Industry and Commerce that I was wasting my time.  I found that two or three years later the inspectors had made no progress, simply because they had not powers of the kind envisaged here.  For that reason, I am particularly happy that the Minister of State has accepted the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>What would happen if a person refused to give evidence or considers that the evidence he would give might incriminate him in a future criminal action?  Can the evidence he gives be referred to in a future criminal action? Deputy Cullen's amendment goes further than the present provisions.  The whole purpose of the investigation is to elicit wrongdoing in the course of the company's affairs.  I know that the court will appoint an inspector and, therefore, he will act on behalf of the court.  However, it is not too clear what will happen when the inspector outlines the causes for the <Col N="1505" /> company's downfall.  It will still be up to the court to decide what action will be taken.  The section, as it stands, is wide-ranging and if we include this amendment it will cause great difficulties.  It will not be a normal court of law but it will have far reaching powers.  When a liquidation takes place the books and records of a company for the previous few years are examined to try to ascertain what went wrong and very often it is obvious that things were not run properly.  The agents and officers of the company would have to discuss the matter in an informal manner.  People are usually brought in, one by one to a room, usually the place of business of the company.</P>
      <P>Presumably the inspector will be conducting his affairs from an office in the company or in his own office.  Only he and his officials will be present and the person being examined will know nothing of what other witnesses said to the inspector before he came in.  Everything will be taken down, written out in longhand and typed and he will have to sign it like a statement in any ordinary criminal prosecution. I am sure that many people will refuse to co-operate in those circumstances. I appreciate the purpose behind Deputy Cullen's amendment, to make the Bill more stringent, but it is doubtful if it would be effective.  I see great difficulties in anyone going before the inspector because it will not be in an open court with witnesses and powers to cross examine them.  The person giving evidence will have to sign a statement under oath and, as I said, there is a great danger that it could be used against him in a criminal prosecution.  I also dislike the fact that the person will not be aware of the evidence of other people given perhaps a couple of weeks earlier.  I know the Minister is prepared to accept the amendment but I want him to be aware of my objections to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>All we are doing here is providing for somebody who gives information to an inspector to sign the answers they give to questions.  If there are downstream legal implications we will certainly look at them between now and <Col N="1506" /> Report Stage.  On the surface, we have no difficulty in asking someone to sign answers which they gave to an inspector or the list of written questions which they answer subsequently.  There may be areas to be looked at if people refuse to sign them but we will look at the implications in accepting the amendment.  The amendment is not a major departure from any principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister.  Deputy Cullen's amendment states:</P>
      <P>...&ldquo;(4) An inspector may examine on oath, either by word of mouth or on written interrogatories the officers and agents of the company or other body corporate and such person as is mentioned in subsection (2) in relation to its affairs and may&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  administer an oath accordingly,</P>
      <P>(b)  reduce the answers of such person to writing and require him to sign them.&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>If we include this amendment in the Bill it is not too clear what its effect will be.  I thought the whole purpose of this investigation procedure on behalf of the court was to give powers to the inspector and that when he had conducted his investigation of the affairs of the company he would form his own opinion as to how the company was run.  He would then report back to the court and indicate what he thinks should be done in regard to contradictory evidence or whatever. He could recommend a certain course of action to the court but the court would have the final decision as to what would be done.  The inspector's examination is not in open court and Part II transfers the powers in the 1963 Act from the Minister to the court to appoint an inspector. This is a quasi-judicial function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How will the inspector work?  He will not have an inspector's room which will be open to the public, like an open court, and people will not be examined there nor will witnesses be cross-examined there as in open court.  This inspector will <Col N="1507" /> work on the lines of the liquidator or receiver who investigates the affairs of a company.  The directors or financial controller will be examined if there is anything wrong with the books, and if it has been discovered that the company was not properly run.</P>
    <P>These proceedings will be conducted in private but the person conducting the investigation will be an inspector appointed by the court.  People will be examined in private not knowing what other witnesses, employees or agents of the company have said about the conduct of the affairs of the company or what they have said about other people in the company, even if defamatory remarks have been made which do not relate to the matter under investigation.  There is nothing in this section to suggest that a person has the right to know what others have said about him, either orally or in writing.  Now we are amending that section and the inspector, sitting in his private room, will require a person to sign on oath that his answers were true, without knowing what has been said by other witnesses.</P>
    <P>Later sections make it clear that when finalising his report the inspector can say what he thought went on in the company and the court, if it thinks fit, may direct that appropriate action, even court action or criminal proceedings, be taken.  It is not fair that under the other subsections of section 10 people do not have the right to know what others have said about them.  Now we require the witness to sign an affidavit saying he has given the correct answers.  Presumably that will form part of the evidence if the court decides to bring criminal prosecutions. Any person who got legal advice would be very reluctant to sign an affidavit at that stage.</P>
    <P>When a person is in open court he has no option but to state on oath what went on in the company but to do it during the investigation not knowing what other witnesses have said, and now under the amendment the inspector may administer an oath and then reduce the answers of such person to writing and require him <Col N="1508" /> to sign them.  I must protest at this amendment.  I recognise that its purpose is to strengthen the powers of the inspector but it is going too far and I do not think the Minister should accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what Deputy McCreevy said, this amendment strengthens and clarifies the powers of the inspector.  In strengthening these powers, it calls into question some of the more profound constitutional issues as to the rights of an inspector and the rights of somebody appearing before him in regard to natural justice.</P>
      <P>In the case of <i>Kiely v. the Minister for Social Welfare,</i> 1977 <i>Irish Law Reports</i> it was decided that where an inspector was making an investigation, inspecting one person, the person was entitled to an oral hearing and also to the opportunity of cross-examining other witnesses if he was to be adversely affected.  Similarly, a person in such circumstances is entitled to access to documents in the possession of another person or company concerned in the investigation.  This also arises in the case of <i>Nolan v. the Land Commission,</i> 1981 <i>Irish Law Reports.</i> Furthermore, a person may be entitled under natural justice to an adjournment in order to prepare his case or to defend the case being made against him, and that may be granted.  It is important to recognise that that arises again in the case of <i>Kiely v. the Minister for Social Welfare.</i> Finally, a person may be entitled to legal representation if the seriousness of the matter at issue would appear to warrant it.  That arises from the case re <i>Haughey,</i> an investigation conducted by this House and the Committee of Public Accounts, or perhaps a court case associated therewith, I am not absolutely certain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If all those rights exist for a person who is the subject of an investigation of this kind, the investigations will be very long drawn out and expensive, and will continue to be very expensive despite the fact that the court has been brought in to sanction the appointment of an inspector. I do not think appointment by a court <i>per se</i> makes anybody appointed by the court a court itself.  That is not the case, and I <Col N="1509" /> do not believe the Minister is claiming it to be.</P>
    <P>If this inspector is acting in place of a court and all those rights to which I have referred arise this makes me question whether this procedure serves any purpose. One wonders if it would not be better to go ahead and prosecute and wind up the company rather than go through all this procedure when all these rights arise in natural justice anyway.</P>
    <P>We are making slow progress in this House and I do not want to draw the Minister into making a point by point reference to all the cases I cited, but it is only fair to say that those authorities I have quoted raise serious issues and the Minister might want to contemplate whether this part of the Bill can work in the way it was intended.  We spent all the last day, and we may spend all today, dealing solely with the inspection sections, and if it transpires that these sections serve no purpose because they are unworkable, we may be wasting a lot of time.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could give an adequate assurance that he would deal with some of these issues on Report Stage, maybe we could make progress, but we would need to acknowledge the seriousness of these points or we will be fighting about them all day.  Deputy McCreevy made a number of valid points which need to be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty at all in acknowledging the seriousness of the points made, and the legal background quoted by Deputy Bruton is very useful.  We are in almost daily touch with the Attorney General's office on this Bill seeking to develop some of these issues, but I do not think anything said so far has made the acceptance of this amendment something we should change our minds about.</P>

      <P>Before I call <Col N="1510" /> Deputy O'Dea, since the lack of progress has been adverted to and in view of the fact that the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Séamus Brennan, has indicated his acceptance of amendment No. 7 in the name of Deputy Martin Cullen, let me ask if the amendment is agreed?</P>
      <P>Deputies: Agreed.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>May we then proceed with amendment No. 8 in the name of the same Deputy?  Here I observe that amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are related.  I suggest, therefore, that we discuss amendments Nos. 8, 16 and 17 together.  Is that satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 51 and 52, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) A person who is examined under this section shall not be entitled to refuse to answer any question put to him on the ground that his answer might incriminate him but none of the answers of such person shall be admissible in evidence against him in any other proceedings, civil or criminal, except in the case of any criminal proceedings for perjury in respect of any such answer.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment on behalf of Deputy Cullen who is indisposed at the moment but hopes to be back shortly. This amendment is word for word the same as section 105 (6).  That section relates to the power of the court to summon persons for examination after the appointment of a provisional liquidator or after the making of a winding up order.  It defines the rights of somebody who is questioned by the court in those circumstances and provides that none of the answers he might give which might incriminate him should be admissible as evidence against him in any other proceedings, civil or criminal, except in the <Col N="1511" /> case of proceedings for perjury for giving an untrue answer on oath.  If that is appropriate, as I think it is, in the case of an examination on oath by the court, it is perhaps even more appropriate in the case of an examination by an inspector. That is why I suggest it be inserted in section 10 after subsection (4) which is a new subsection just now inserted.  It in no way differs from the provision in section 105 and if it is thought to be necessary in section 105 it is even more appropriate in section 10.</P>
    <P>Arising out of what Deputy Bruton has just said, an inspector is now in a position different from the position he was in when he was appointed only by the Minister. As I see it, the whole purpose of changing the provision to enable him to be appointed by the court on the application of the Minister rather than by the Minister off his own bat alone, is to give him additional powers and to put the exercise of those powers beyond the challenge to which they might otherwise be open if he were not appointed by the court.  The phrase used by Deputy Bruton was <i>in loco</i> the court.  I think the correct phrase to use would be that he act as a commissioner of the court, in other words he is taking evidence on commission. Somebody in that situation, usually a barrister who is asked by the court to take evidence from somebody who cannot attend the court due to illness, absence abroad or whatever else, has normally all the powers of the court and somebody appearing before that person is in the same position as if he were appearing before the court itself.  The fears raised in regard to the inspector's powers are, perhaps, not well founded for that reason because he is in a much stronger position legally than he was previously when he was appointed by the Minister only.</P>
    <P>If we are only going to seek to vindicate the rights of those who are under investigation it would be a pity because the whole purpose of this section, this Part and these amendments, is to try to vindicate the rights of those who have been wronged by the abuse of incorporation, by the abuse of directors' powers.  Those <Col N="1512" /> people certainly have their rights too; there are a great many of them and they have to be balanced.  This section is favourable to those who are undergoing examination, therefore whatever objections may have been raised to the last amendment, I do not think they are appropriate to this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I understand the purpose of these investigations if it is not to lead to criminal proceedings. If Deputy O'Malley's and my amendments are accepted the evidence obtained in investigation could not be used in criminal proceedings.  Is that not the case?  If the purpose of the investigation is to get money for creditors the way to go about that is to wind up the company, not to put them into an investigation which would last for years while the assets wither.  Therefore, I must say I am puzzled by the way this thing is intended to work.  This procedure for investigations does not exist in company law in other countries.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand they operate on the basis of normal winding up or criminal proceedings.</P>
      <P>It would appear that in one sense Deputy O'Malley's and my amendments would remove the problems I was adverting to on the earlier amendment where a person is entitled under the maxim <i>audi alteram partem</i> to get a fair hearing if that person is likely to be affected by findings and recommendations of an investigation. That involves cross-examination, legal representation and so forth. Those requirements may be reduced if the evidence adduced before the investigation cannot lead to criminal or civil proceedings and cannot be used in them, but if that is the case what is the point of the investigation if the evidence obtained in it cannot be used for either civil or criminal proceedings?  Therefore, we are caught in a conflict.  That is why I opposed the original section and I have continuing doubts about the validity of this entire Parts of the Bill.  However, I am open to be persuaded on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to my amendments, whereas Deputy O'Malley says the evidence given <Col N="1513" /> here may not be used in any criminal proceedings or civil proceedings, I am saying simply that they shall not be used in criminal proceedings but may be used in civil proceedings.  That would give some use to the evidence obtained by the investigation.  If evidence given on oath before an inspector is useless other than for the inspector's report, useless in civil proceedings and useless in criminal proceedings, and has to be obtained all over again when somebody takes civil or criminal proceedings, all we are doing essentially is giving witnesses an opportunity for a free rehearsal of their evidence and if they said anything they should not have said in the investigation by the inspector their legal advisers will point out to them afterwards, &ldquo;You should not have said that, so on no account say it when you come to the real court, which may be in two or three years time, so say something else and let them prove you wrong and remember they cannot refer to what you said before the inspector&rdquo;.  It is a sort of free rehearsal, a dry run for the defendant. That is not what any of us intended in the section.  I would like to hear the Minister of State on this because he may have something to say which will allay some of my fears.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy Cullen to section 10 and Deputy John Bruton's two amendments to section 18 deal essentially with the same issue, the question of what evidential use can be made of answers given by a person to an inspector.  Obviously, as is clear from the debate, this brings us into a very difficult and tricky legal area. Section 18 provides that an answer given by a person to a question put to him by an inspector under section 10 can be used in evidence against him in any subsequent proceedings.  I should like to make it clear that the Bill is currently silent as to whether a person can refuse to answer a question on the grounds of self-incrimination. Deputy Cullen's amendment would, in effect, remove any right to silence which may currently exist but would make any statements which are <Col N="1514" /> made inadmissible in evidence in any subsequent proceedings.  On the other hand, Deputy Bruton's amendments would allow the statements concerned to be used in evidence, but only in civil proceedings and not in criminal proceedings.</P>
      <P>My main problem with Deputy Cullen's amendment is that it is in direct conflict with section 18 which provides that an answer given by a person to a question put to him by an inspector may be used in evidence against him.  The section also appears in corresponding UK legislation and is important to ensure effective investigation procedures.  Without it I do not think we could have effective investigation procedures.  I understand Deputy Bruton's reservations about this procedure but, now that we have adopted the notion of having it, it is important that we make it effective.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the idea behind the amendment may be covered in section 10 (5) which provides that, if a person refuses to answer an inspector's question, the inspector may refer the matter to the court.  Where this happens the court can inquire into the case and, after hearing evidence for the defence, can punish the person concerned as if he had been guilty of contempt of court.  If a person persisted in claiming that his refusal to answer a question was based on a fear that he might incriminate himself, the court would be in a fairly good position to adjudicate on any such claim under section 10 (5).</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's amendments, on the other hand, do not deal with the question of self-incrimination but confine themselves to narrowing to civil proceedings the evidential use that can be made of the information concerned.  In regard to Deputy Cullen's amendment I should like to state that in practical cases it is likely that the inspector will be able to establish the facts from other sources and an admission of guilt on somebody's part would not add greatly to the effectiveness of an investigation but, as I said earlier, may perhaps hinder the process of law by giving safe conduct to a person provided he co-operated by not refusing to answer questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1515" /> I would not see any point in effectively forcing a person to answer a question and then ruling out the admissibility of his answer in any subsequent proceedings. That would amount to saying to a person: &ldquo;If you come clean and make a full confession we will forget about any consequences and absolve you fully from any sins you may have committed&rdquo;.  I do not think that is what we should be able to do here.  It has to be remembered that the prime purpose of an investigation is to establish the facts in a particular case of concern as a part of an overall system of regulatory control under company law. If the facts lead to a conclusion that some aspect of the law ought to be changed, then so be it but if, on the other hand, the facts established suggest that criminal proceedings ought to be brought against a person I do not think we should rule them out.  That, in effect, is what Deputy Cullen's and Deputy Bruton's amendments would do.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley correctly referred to section 105.  We have been taking advice on this but certainly it is the case that those provisions are identical.  However, I am advised that the two situations are completely different and that the context of section 105 is a different one from that of section 10.  An examination of a person under section 245, which is what section 105 is based on, is a judicial process while an investigation of a company's affairs under Part II of the Bill is not.  I am advised that a court examination under section 245, which is the one we are discussing, arises in the context of winding up proceedings at a stage when the company is already dead.  An investigation by an inspector is more in the nature of a system of ongoing regulatory control of companies under company legislation.</P>
    <P>I will continue to have talks with the Attorney General's office and take advice from that quarter as we proceed through Committee Stage.  In particular I will be referring to that office the legal points which arose in the earlier part of the debate and, if adjustments or tidying up are required, I will make the necessary changes on Report Stage, based on the <Col N="1516" /> Attorney General's advice.  The advice given to me is that section 105 is in a different context.  I can see how a person reading the Bill may consider it unusual that we are not prepared to put word for word what appears later in the Bill into an earlier section.  On the surface I can see that there is common sense in that. Nevertheless, I am advised strongly that this is not a judicial part of the Bill and that section 105 is.  It refers to an open court and is in the context of the winding up of a company.  I am advised that it would not be appropriate to put that control into the section under debate.  I should like to assure the House that, if there is any doubt in this area, having had discussions with the Attorney General's office on the points made in the House, I will bring forward any changes that are needed.</P>

      <P>If section 10 is not a judicial process how can a court punish somebody for contempt of court by refusing to answer a question put to him under this process?  I do not understand that.  It seems to me that that raises a key issue. If it is judicial there may be a right to punish for refusing to co-operate and answer but if it is not judicial I cannot see how, constitutionally, it could be possible to punish.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That imports directly into this one of the key elements of court proceedings, the ability to punish contempt thereof.  If this is not a judicial process and yet people <Col N="1517" /> can be punished for refusing to give information to it, and also if statements made to an inspector can incriminate the person making those statements or be used against that person in civil proceedings, that person must be entitled to all the rights I recited which arise from the Kiely <i>v.</i> Minister for Social Welfare, re Haughey and the case of Nolan <i>v.</i> Land Commission.  If he is entitled to all those rights, legal representation, cross examination, access to documents belonging to other parties etc., on the grounds that a statement made might incriminate him, then, in essence, what we are talking about here under such an investigation is a judicial process.</P>

      <P>With respect, the section says that the inspector may certify the refusal, that is to answer questions and so on, under their hand to the court and the court may punish the offender. The judicial process commences at the point at which it is referred to the court. The inspector may certify the refusal under their hand to the court and the court may thereupon inquire into the case and so on.  After hearing witnesses the court may punish the offender as if he has been guilty of contempt of court.  It moves to the judicial side of the house when it is certified by the inspector.</P>

      <P>The provision in subsection (5) is a very common one.  It is contained in a whole lot of Acts and it is frequently implemented.  You do not commit the contempt and be condemned or sentenced by the inspector.  The inspector has to report the fact to the court who then inquires into it.  If the court is satisfied it then declares the failure a contempt of court as it is perfectly entitled to do.  All of that was dealt with in the Haughey case in, I think, 1971.  At that time an effort was made to give the committee the power to punish a witness <Col N="1518" /> who refused to answer.  It was held that that was quite improper, that the committee did not have and could not be given any such power, that only the court could impose the penalty after the facts were reported to the court and it had inquired into it.  That is exactly what is happening here.  It is what has always been held to be appropriate.  If the inspectors and the court are to be divested of all sanctions against people who tell untruths to the inspector, or refuse to answer, the whole investigation process falls down.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to hear questions raised in this House by somebody like Deputy Bruton as to the propriety in this Bill of having investigations.  There is a vital need for these because in no country that I know of can people get away with more under the existing Companies Act, 1963, in relation to improper conduct of companies, than in this country.  That is deplorable.  There has not been, to the best of my knowledge, a successful investigation carried out by inspectors under the appropriate part of the 1963 Act since it was passed &mdash; 25 years ago.  It cannot be suggested that the conduct of corporate affairs in this country is such that nothing has happened in the last 25 years that does not warrant investigation.  It most certainly does and it galls me to see the people who have got away with serious improprieties and serious malpractices, who have cocked a snook at the law, laughed at it, left the companies there and started up others, again with the benefit of limited liability.  Very often they engaged in the same malpractices as in the first case and nobody was able to say anything about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to the view expressed by the previous speaker, Deputy O'Malley, regarding the need for an effective investigation procedure.  It was brought home very forcibly to me in the sad events surrounding a company in this city not very long ago which was established with a fanfare of glitterati and public figures, some of whom were perhaps unwittingly involved.  This was a company set up and designed to deliver <Col N="1519" /> through sales of goods about the city and country.  A case was brought to my attention of a young married man from Darn-dale who was caught by this and gave up £2,500, which he had borrowed, in the hope that this company was going to be his saviour.  Despite the hype that was generated, that eventually collapsed, it was a completely worthless exercise.  The person responsible was a member of the Bar and was brought before the Master's Court and examined at length.  More than anything else the case illustrated the ineffectiveness of the 1963 Act.</P>
      <P>I think we are getting bogged down in the differences between administrative and legal functions.  The authorities quoted by Deputy Bruton say that a person acting in an administrative capacity, as in this instance an investigator, must act fairly.  Clearly, a person brought in will have certain rights and will be entitled to avail of them but because these exist that does not turn the exercise into a judicial function.  It is important to remember that there is a distinction to be drawn between what is basically an administrative function carried out by non-court people and judicial functions carried out in the courts.  In terms of the rights of persons there can be certain similarities but in law they are understood to be difficult.  That is so even though the person is appointed by the court and has, ultimately, under section 10 (5) the right to come back.  Subsection (5) is a procedure on its own which allows the administrative officer appointed to come to the court and make a complaint, unnoticed to the offending person.  The matter is then opened before the judge. There is an opportunity for the alleged offender to answer and to reason and for the judge to adjudicate.  There are two separate parts in this and we should not get bogged down on how we describe them.  They are separate and entire and should not present us with any difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question relates to the amendments proposed.  I am more inclined to accept these sections as they stand without amendment.  What we are trying to <Col N="1520" /> achieve &mdash; and that is the approach we should take here &mdash; is an effective body of legislation which has grown out of 25 years of experience under existing law, where it is clear that there is a body of entrepreneurs or rogue directors, as they are more correctly termed, who are prepared to exploit the laws as they stand, abuse the entitlements and avail of the limited liability and the secretiveness of the boardroom to its fullest extent and to the disadvantage of a great many people. For that reason we need an investigative process.  We need a process whereby a company that is operating but which, people in authority are unhappy with, for many different reasons can be investigated at an early stage and reported on where necessary.  Often it is discovered too late that what has been happening has been a conspiracy of criminality.  That has been the experience of the past 25 years and we are trying to address that problem.</P>
    <P>For that reason where a person is being investigated they should be obliged to answer.  Where they do not answer they should be made answerable for their silence and where their replies are forthcoming they should be answerable in full both in civil and in criminal law for what they say they have been doing and what they have been discovered to have been doing.  For that reason I am not impressed by the suggestion that savers should be given to them.  I think Deputy Bruton agrees with the need to deal with the criminal activities of directors but there is a certain contradiction in his suggestion that, while we may extract answers from them, the information thus gained should be used only in civil cases.  We have a problem about Part II in its entirety.</P>
    <P>There are analogous provisions in the 1984 Criminal Justice Act, under which a person is required to give an account in relation to stolen property, with the proviso that the answers given cannot be used in evidence in a subsequent prosecution. The idea is to help the Garda to investigate and pursue the recovery of stolen property and to make people answerable on the spot.  If they find somebody in possession of property, they can <Col N="1521" /> get an explanation there and then.  My understanding is that the section is virtually unworkable and that the Garda have not relied on it at all.  I know this from talking to practitioners in the city. If a garda finds property and brings a suspect into the police station, the one thing he does not want to do is to give the suspect the opportunity to give an account which cannot be used subsequently. Huge problems are being created by giving savers to people who are prepared or are obliged to talk.</P>
    <P>It would be far more effective to leave the section as it stands and make these people answerable.  Those who conduct their business properly and fairly have nothing to worry about.  Those who will be worried will be the rogues and they would welcome the opportunity of an &ldquo;out&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make clear to Deputy O'Malley who misrepresented, perhaps deliberately, what I was saying that I am in favour of an effective and speedy way of dealing with rogue directors. I believe that this investigation procedure will simply be duplication of effort.  The Minister is taking substantial powers under sections 19 and 20 to obtain information from companies.  My view is that he should not use that information to initiate an investigation in which there would be a surfeit of legal representation, under the authorities I quoted earlier, because of the rights of everyone being investigated to be represented, to cross-examine, to obtain other people's documents and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should not engage in that procedure which cannot lead to a prosecution but should go directly to court and prosecute offenders on the basis of information obtained in the normal way in which one would obtain information in respect of any criminal activity.  If that is not sufficient, the Minister should take power to petition to wind up the company if he is not satisfied with the way it is being run.  He should not engage in this long investigative procedure which would serve no other purpose than to be a bonanza for the legal profession.  Everybody <Col N="1522" /> involved would have to be legally represented, not just before the investigation but also before any subsequent winding up or criminal proceedings.  The lawyers would be involved twice.  That is a waste of time.</P>
    <P>I have made this case before.  Deputy O'Malley was not here when I originally made it.  I am repeating it today so that he will understand exactly what my position is.  The House has decided it is going to have this Part of the Bill.  That being the case, although I feel it may well be a recipe for a waste of time, it behoves us to try to make the section as effective as possible.  I have no great attachment to limiting the use of the evidence to civil proceedings.  Given the safeguards that are there, perhaps it would be no harm to allow it to be used in criminal proceedings as well.  If it were not to be used in criminal proceedings, it would be even harder to justify the investigation.  In that spirit and in the hope that we will make progress without trying to impugn one another's motives I will withdraw my two amendments.</P>

I based what I had to say on what he said this morning, which surprised me.  That is why I felt it necessary to say it.  I did not bother to comment on certain other things I heard.  Deputy Bruton made the suggestion this morning that perhaps the best thing to do in these cases is not to pursue an investigation but to put the company into liquidation.</P>

      <P>The whole problem has been caused over the past 25 years <Col N="1523" /> by a succession of companies going into liquidation.  The consequence for the creditors and people dealing with the company is that they do not get paid. The people who have run the company improperly depart with the assets, leaving the creditors high and dry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why it is important that the powers contained in the section should be used long before the question arises of putting the company into liquidation.  When a company of this type which is improperly run goes into liquidation, the creditors very rarely get any dividends of even part of what is owed to them.  That, in turn, has forced into bankruptcy or liquidation many other people and companies who, if they had been trading with honest people, would not have found themselves in that situation.  That is why these provisions are important and should be maintained and strengthened.  I do not think resort to prosecution or liquidation is sufficient because it means the creditors get nothing.  Something more is needed.  This kind of investigation is invaluable.  It has not been possible to carry it out over the past 25 years but it will be possible now. In the circumstances I withdraw amendment No. 8.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 covers a very important part of the investigative procedure.  Lest anyone be under any misapprehension about my views, I gave my opinions on Committee Stage. Nobody would disagree with what Deputy O'Malley and Deputy McCartan have said regarding the abuse of the concept of limited liability, particularly over the past ten or 15 years.  There have been no successful investigations under the <Col N="1524" /> 1963 Act which gave power to the Minister. This Bill provides for the transfer of the power from the Minister and the appointment of an inspector by the court. Sections 7 to 23, inclusive, dealing with investigations will, in my opinion, achieve nothing at all.  I am in agreement with what Deputy Bruton said.  I am not against the concept of having the investigation of companies carried out by inspectors but because of the way in which this will be done under section 7 of the Bill, which we previously discussed, I believe very little investigation will be carried out under this Bill.  Under section 7 only certain categories of people can apply to the courts to have an inspector appointed and security or money will have to be given to conduct the investigation. When we last discussed the Bill I advocated that investigations should be carried out by an official investigator, similar to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Director of Consumer Affairs, who could investigate the abuse which Deputy O'Malley spoke about.</P>
      <P>The more I read sections 7 to 24, covering investigations, the more I am convinced&mdash;and this idea was originally put forward by the consultative committee of accountancy bodies and many other people&mdash;we will not be able to get at the rogue directors and the abuses of limited liability which should be got at under Part II of the Bill.  I doubt if anything can be done about this now because the Bill has gone through the Seanad but the more I read the sections under Part II of the Bill the more I am convinced we will get into legal tangles about whether this is a judicial process under section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Limited liability is a privilege and it has responsibilities.  As we all know, this privilege has been abused and I believe the best approach to dealing with this problem is, as I advocated the last day, to establish an office of official investigator. This office could have an investigator's court which would examine all the problems which have been spoken about.  If we proceed, as proposed under section 10, we will pile up thousands of pounds in legal fees and under previous sections people could be rushed in and out of <Col N="1525" /> court.  After studying sections 7 to 24 over the weekend I am convinced that it is not the right approach for the carrying out of investigations.  The 1963 Act provided that the Minister could appoint inspectors but that provision was not successful. This section seeks to get over the problems which arose in that respect by providing for the appointment of inspectors by the court but I do not think this provision will work and it will not stamp out the problems which Deputy O'Malley and Deputy McCartan spoke about. The way to get over all these problems is to establish an office of official investigator who could examine all these matters and the powers in relation to the judicial process and the powers of the court could be transferred to this individual so that he can carry out the investigations.</P>
    <P>If we include the provisions in section 10 in relation to investigations in the Bill, which I am not convinced is the right approach&mdash;I put this on the record of the House the last day and I wish to do so again&mdash;we will have to ensure that it is the best section possible.  Under this section an inspector can be appointed by the court, he has the power to administer oaths and, under Deputy Cullen's amendment which we agreed to earlier this morning, the person whom questions are asked of will have to put his replies in writing.  However, having given all these powers to the inspector I think a subsection should be included in section 10 which would also give some rights to the people being examined.  Perhaps the Minister can include a subsection on Report Stage which would give the right to people being examined either to cross-examine or have before them the replies given by other persons of the company about the person being examined.  The Minister said earlier in reply to Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Bruton that this is not a judicial process.</P>
    <P>I do not know what kind of a process it is at present.  We went down the road of trying to make it a judicial process but I believe the more we discuss it the more a mess we will make of it.  It is not a judicial process, yet a person who refuses to give answers can be brought before <Col N="1526" /> the courts under section 10 (5) and found to be in comtempt of court if the court so decides.  I believe a subsection should be included in section 10 which would give people who are being questioned the right to examine the replies given by other witnesses or to cross-examine them, but I find it hard to understand how this will be done given that the Minister said a few minutes ago that this is not a judicial process.</P>
    <P>I have liquidated some companies under an official court investigation and during the liquidation of the company I have on occasion questioned directors and other members of a company.  When I asked one director what he had been doing he told a story which lasted a few hours but when another member of the company was questioned another day he told a different story.  It is the same in politics or in any other walk of life: when the muck starts to hit the fan everyone dives for cover and blames everybody else.  For example, if I investigate a company of which Deputy Bruton is the director and I ask him questions he will give me one set of answers and if I bring in, say, Deputy Pat McCartan another day and he thinks Deputy Bruton incriminated him the previous day, he will give me different answers to the same questions. I believe it is only fair to both people being examined that they know what the other person has said about them.  Therefore, I would like a subsection to be included in section 10 which would give a right to people either to cross-examine &mdash; and there may be some difficulty with this because, as the Minister said, it is not now a judicial process &mdash; or have access to what was said by another member of the company.  The answers given by one member of a company should be produced to the person being investigated if they include information which damages or incriminates that person.  If this is not done it will be difficult for an inspector to form an opinion if he has to consider contradictory statements from five or six directors of a company.</P>

      <P>There are three points <Col N="1527" /> I want to raise.  Mr. Justice Keane in his book, <i>Company Law in Ireland</i>, says in regard to the rights of people appearing before an inspector that it may be that in certain circumstances it would be a denial of natural justice not to allow such persons an oral hearing, an opportunity to cross-examine other witnesses, access to documents in the possession of other persons associated with the company, an adjournment in order to enable them to prepare their case and legal representation. While I defer to Deputy McCartan and Deputy O'Malley, who said that this does not constitute a judicial process &mdash; and the Minister said the same &mdash; it will certainly cost as much as a judicial process.  That is why I agree with Deputy McCreevy that it would be better to have an official investigator of companies who would go out in the same way as the Fraud Squad go out and get information and then take criminal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The same rights would still arise no matter what one calls it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this procedure one would have an investigation which would cost as much as a court case, the outcome of which would only be a report, and one would then have the whole investigation again in court.  This would mean that people would not be brought to justice quickly.  If we have a purpose, which I believe we do, it is to stamp out fraud quickly and not after five or ten years of interminable and costly investigations.</P>
      <P>There are one or two points I should like to query in relation to the section. There seems to be a case for reciting the rights in the section of those appearing in court and making certain whether those rights adverted to by Mr. Justice Keane in the book <i>Company Law in Ireland</i> do or do not exist in so far as the person being investigated is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the law is to be effective there should be certainty and we should not have to wait until a court case is heard before we know whether Justice Keane is right or wrong.  It should be stated in the Act <Col N="1528" /> whether a person has the rights I have referred to just now.  A subsection should be inserted stating that those are their rights or qualifying those rights but an investigation should proceed on the basis of certainty, rather than uncertainty, as to the rights of the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) of this section states that the court may punish somebody as if guilty of contempt of court if they refuse to answer certain questions or produce certain documents.  According to the wording of that subsection the court does not appear to have the right to direct that the person does not need to produce the documents.  The court should have the right to direct that a person produces the documents or to direct that he should not but as presently phrased, while the court may punish a person for not producing the documents, it is not stated that the court may direct that he does not have to produce the documents.  Perhaps that is implicit in the section but it would appear that the language should be made clearer.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make is in relation to subsection (6).  It is stated that it shall be the duty of all officers and agents of a company to produce books, documents and so on and to appear before the inspectors.  Officers and agents include the solicitors of the company. Could the privacy of the relationship between the solicitor and the client be interfered with in this regard?  For instance, if the solicitor of the company is also the solicitor to a director of the company who subsequently may be prosecuted&mdash;and we know that any statement made by a director of the company before an inspector may be used as evidence in criminal proceedings&mdash;would communications between that director and the solicitor cause any problems?</P>

      <P>I agree largely with what was said by Deputy McCartan in relation to the ineffectiveness of the 1963 legislation. Various points of view have been expressed as to why the investigative procedure set out in the 1963 legislation has <Col N="1529" /> proved to be ineffective.  It may be that the provisions as written are unworkable or it may be that there is a lack of political will to pursue the procedure.  However, the Minister of State should take on board the point made by Deputy McCreevy in that to initiate the procedure as set out in the Act a person has to request under section 7 that an investigation take place.</P>
      <P>It would seem that this is a very expensive process and a very cumbersome way of dealing with this matter.  There is some merit in Deputy McCreevy's suggestion that we set up a speedy and effective investigative procedure which would be inexpensive.  I agree with other speakers who suggested that a provision for an investigation to take place should be contained in company law, as one can imagine a liquidation resulting in a great deal of social and financial dislocation. Such an investigation might head off that eventuality and this would be desirable.</P>
      <P>No one could disagree with the statements made this morning with regard to cowboy directors who have literally got away with murder.  There is little point in Deputies, such as Deputy O'Malley, coming into this House to cry about the fraud and the illegalities which have been perpetrated by those people and to regret that they have got away with it while at the same time putting down amendments which seek to emasculate the investigative procedure as laid down.  I agree with Deputy McCreevy when he says this is not the best way of going about it but if the Minister and the Government insist upon this procedure then we are stuck with it, and if we are stuck with it it is incumbent upon us to make sure that it is as effective as possible and to give it as much teeth as possible.  Therefore, I am totally opposed to Deputy O'Malley's amendment, amendment No. 8.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>He made a number of points in favour of the amendment and I am entitled to respond to them.  There seems to be an amount of confusion in <Col N="1530" /> regard to the report to be produced by the inspector following an investigation and as to the answers to some of the questions put by the inspector in the course of his investigation.  The report could form the basis of criminal or civil proceedings.  It is easy to imagine cases where the conclusions reached by the inspector could be used as a basis for such proceedings.  The suggestion that the answers given during the course of the inspector's investigation should not be admissible would render the procedure nugatory and ineffective.</P>
      <P>Section 10 contains a certain amount of technical detail and I would like the Minister of State when replying to respond to a couple of points I am going to make in regard to the interpretation of parts of the section.  Subsection (2) refers to books or documents which must be produced in respect of an illicit bank account.  The term &ldquo;books or documents&rdquo; is defined in the interpretation section, section 3, but it is not clear on reading section 3 whether the definition extends to electronic data records.  Even if the definition in section 3 could be interpreted in such a way, I think that it should be clearly stated that it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that there was some debate in the Seanad as to the definition of a bank account and apparently the Minister of State has taken on board some of the suggestions made in the Seanad in that he has inserted a definition of what is a bank account, to include an account with any person, exempt by virtue of section 7 (4) of the Central Bank Act, 1971 from the requirements of holding a licence under section 9 of that Act.  Under section 7 (4) the following are exempt: the ACC, ICC, the Post Office Savings Bank, the Trustees Savings Banks covered by the Trustee Savings Bank legislation 1863 to 1965, building societies, industrial and provident societies, friendly societies, credit unions, investment trust companies and unit trust schemes.  However, in my opinion there is a large loophole in this section.  For instance, pension funds and funds managed by life assurance companies are not covered by that definition. <Col N="1531" /> It is easy to imagine a director of a company buying a life assurance bond with money arising from the sale of one of the company's assets which he does not account for and putting that money into a bank account.  The legislation is very loose in this respect and the Minister should take another look at it with a view to tightening it up.  I appreciate that he has extended the definition as contained in the original Act but there is still a lot of room for improvement.</P>
    <P>The section also refers to documents not only in the possession of such a director but also those under his control.  We all accept that we must draw the line at some point but the Minister should look at the feasibility of getting at documents within the possession or under the control of somebody connected with the director or somebody over whom he has some influence or control.  There is a certain number of words which I think should not be included in the legislation but the main point I wish to make is that a provision for an effective investigative procedure should be contained in this Bill.  It should be as speedy and as simple as possible.  The Minister should look carefully at the definition of &ldquo;bank account&rdquo; in section 10 (3) and also look at the people connected with the director who is referred to in that subsection to see if documentation within the control of these people can be brought within the ambit of the subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions on section 10.  Deputy McCreevy talked about the official inspector.  On section 7 we already debated the whole question of whether or not we have an inspection procedure and that has been decided by the House. I would prefer if we could move on to try to make the system, that we decided on the last day, more effective.  There is no point in redebating, in a Bill with 28 sections and hundreds of amendments, something that we already debated. Many Deputies have slipped into doing that.  We really should move on because <Col N="1532" /> this legislation is required as soon as possible to tackle the kind of abuses the Deputies have spoken about.</P>
      <P>I made it clear on the last day that the official inspector approach means setting up another State office, more bureaucracy and arguably the State sitting on the shoulders of businesses.  I thought we had got to the point where we did not want to go down that road.  The procedure here for investigating companies will be rarely used.  It is a full dress rehearsal.  It is not meant to be a short, snappy, simple mechanism as Deputies want.  Sections 19 and 20 provide those mechanisms.  This is an alternative where one wants to get to the bottom of a very complex case.  This procedure is not baggage and it does not cost the State very much because the costs will be paid by the people seeking the application and by the persons convicted arising out of that, under section 13.  What we have here are companies paying for their own crimes.</P>
      <P>In relation to cross-examination, I do not see it as being essential, as Deputies McCreevy and Bruton suggested.  The inspector will take evidence from up to a dozen persons and get those persons to sign the evidence.  Then the inspector will decide which statements he can accept because he must make the decision as to what goes into his report.  The inspector does not have to put every allegation into his report.  He has to adjudicate on the evidence given to him, because he has been appointed by the court as an inspector. The inspector then goes to the court with that report and the court also would be very slow to accept any defamatory statements without substantial support for them.  I am happy that we should not try to turn into a judicial process something that is not meant to be a judicial process.  This is an investigation procedure which is not meant for everyday use but for major fact finding operations. We should retain this procedure which is cost effective in that the people involved, and not the State, pay for it.</P>

    <P>Deputy Bruton raised the question of quoting the rights and I mentioned the Judge Keane opinion.  There are enough <Col N="1533" /> precedents and enough legislation to indicate the rights of a person in any court.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton also talked about where the court may punish a person for contempt of court on receipt of the inspector's certified complaint and pointed out that the court has no option other than to punish the person for contempt of court and that the section does not say, for example, that one must now publish the information.  I am happy that where it says &ldquo;the court may thereupon enquire into the case and, after hearing any witnesses who may be produced against&rdquo; may punish the offender.  What we have put in here is an option for the court, but it is not the only option.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  That is what I intend in that section.  I will look at whether or not the wording actually reflects that.  Deputy O'Dea made interesting points about books and computers. Section 3 makes it clear that reference to books include computer printcuts and computer information.  The Deputy queried the procedure for investigations and I have already dealt with that.  The Deputy also asked me to look at section 10 (3) with regard to the definition of banks. I amended that in the Seanad to further expand what is generally regarded as a bank account.  I am happy that that takes as broad a sweep as possible in the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton asked about solicitors and accountants.  Section 10 (6) would be subject to section 23 (1) which is a specified provision about privilege, particularly in the light of Government amendment No. 18a. to which we will come later on.  Section 10 is essential because we have debated and put in place an inspection system to allow someone to go to court to get an inspector put into a company.  Section 10 is totally consequential on having decided on an inspection procedure, so as to make it as efficient as possible.  I am happy that section 10 makes it as efficient as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 (3) specifies that if an inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that a director, or past director, of a company maintains or has maintained a bank account he can ask that person to produce details of such bank account and so on which may not be in the name of a limited company. Section 10 (1) gives such power to directors, officers and agents, and subsection (2) specifically to any other person.  Why then is there need for the inclusion of subsection (3) in order to break down the grounds under which certain people can be asked to furnish details of bank accounts and so on?  For example, some <Col N="1535" /> person who was not a director of a company could effectively control that company; I can think of many such instances. A person who may be listed as a director but who may not be in control of the company at all would be required to furnish evidence under the provisions of subsection (2) whereas the other person, if not known, would not be caught at all.  I wonder why it is necessary to have included subsections (2) and (3).  It strikes me that the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) are adequate to cover everybody, whereas the provisions of subsection (3) are more specific, laying down certain grounds for seeking such evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>My profession are greatly concerned that, in all sections of an Act, where auditors are referred to as officers or agents of a company, there would be included a further subsection to say that an auditor is not an officer or agent of a company.  In section 10 (6) and other sections auditors are included as agents of a company.  My professional body would be very anxious to have it made clear that an auditor is an independent person or body.  I am sure that point has been made to the Minister by many accountancy bodies.  There are other sections apart from this one which include an auditor as an officer or agent of a company whereas he is neither.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (3) (<i>b</i>), line 36, to delete &ldquo;(including an employee)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(including an employee, or a trade union representing employees)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment speaks for itself.  It seeks to establish and recognise the position of rights of trade unions and trade unionists to represent employees and their interests with regard to companies.  Many of them have been very active in this area, particularly in the period within which companies may be wound up.  The provisions of the amendment seek to facilitate and recognise their position, to enable a copy of any report prepared by an inspector to be passed on, not merely to an individual but, where appropriate, to the union representing him or her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 (3) provides that the court shall furnish a copy of an inspector's report to certain persons set out in the subsections.  In particular subsection (3) (v) provides that the court may, if it thinks fit, and if requested to do so, furnish a copy of the report to an employee where the court is of the opinion that the employee's financial interests are affected by the matters dealt with in the report.  This matter was discussed at great length in the Seanad on the basis of a number of amendments tabled there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of general comment I should make it clear that, while I appreciate, understand and sympathise with what the Deputy is trying to achieve, I do not think that this Bill is the appropriate place to make provisions for the position of representatives of employees or, for that matter, employers.  There is no way in which it can be said that a trade union itself is being directly affected by the activities of a company.  Clearly the members of a trade union, who are employees of a company, may be affected and, in the case of insolvency, very often will be badly affected.  The fact of the <Col N="1537" /> matter is that the employees themselves have the right to request a copy of an inspector's report.  Undoubtedly they would use that right whenever it was considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this matter was the subject of considerable debate in the Seanad, at the end of which I agreed to insert the phrase &ldquo;including an employee&rdquo; which had not been in the original draft.  I feel I have moved a substantial distance in having done so and, on account of the facts I have put before the House now, I cannot accept the amendment in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's response.  I had read the Seanad debate.  I do not accept that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;including an employee&rdquo; constitutes a concession.  Of necessity the existing wording, would have involved an employee.  By definition all employees must be affected in their financial interest by the workings of any company at any given time.  Therefore the words in section 11 (3) (v) reading:</P>
      <P>any other person (including an employee) whose financial interests appear to the court to be affected by the matters dealt with in the report whether as a creditor of the company or body corporate or otherwise;</P>
      <P>will include an employee.  Our amendment seeks to recognise the position that trade unions play on behalf of employees at such trying times.  It is worth putting in context the scale of the David and Goliath encounter that often obtains when an individual employee is attempting to come to terms with what is going on within a company at a given time, even more so if there are troubles looming that might, in time, lead to the winding up of that company.  The history of this is well known &mdash; employees being left without proper tax, PRSI and other contributions having been paid, indeed when VAT and other dues owing to the State leave them in very difficult circumstances, when often efforts on the part of trade unions, with all their might, are thwarted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this section seek to <Col N="1538" /> deal with events beyond the capacity of an individual employee.  For that reason employees become members of trade unions in an effort to protect themselves collectively.  Indeed trade unions have the resources, authority and capability to confront sometimes what may be termed the activities of cowboy companies.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that the Companies Bill is not appropriate legislation for dealing with the position of trade unions.  I could not disagree more, particularly in the case of companies in difficulties and the huge impact that has, and will have, on the position of their employees.  The Minister said he had made the concession of referring specifically to employees.  I contend that the insertion of the wording &ldquo;including an employee, or a trade union representing employees&rdquo; would not complicate the formula.  No one is suggesting that it should be just any trade union or trade unions at large.  The amendment is drafted in such a way as to make it clear that the union concerned is the one representing the employee and also that the union receive the report in the context of representing the employee.  It is in that limited way that we are asking the Minister to concede, on the advice of his officials an amendment that simply reflects a <i>de facto</i> situation on an everyday basis and recognises that unions have a very important role to play on behalf of their members in the events as they unfold when companies run into difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the general principle being put forward by Deputy McCartan but in practice a court might order that the report would be given to the trade union and not to the individual employees.  For instance, individual employees who are not members of a trade union would not get the report whereas those who are members would get it.  The wording would have to be changed to make it clear that all employees and not just those who are members of a trade union should have an equal right to access to the report.  Perhaps the wording could read, <Col N="1539" />&ldquo;including an employee or a representative nominated by him&rdquo;.  That could include a trade union but the right to receive the report would be that of the employee rather than of the representative. Perhaps if that phraseology were used it would achieve the objective set out by Deputy McCartan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain logic in what Deputy McCartan says but I think it is purely a symbolic geature.  Symbolism seems to be very important in many aspects of Irish life and to include this amendment might be another symbolic gesture.  I would have to agree with the Minister that perhaps the Companies Bill is not the correct legislation in which to make this change.  To include Deputy McCartan's amendment would be a contradiction but I can see the symbolism of including it.</P>
      <P>Nobody pressed an amendment under section 7 which is an important section. Of all the people who could apply to the court to have an inspector appointed, a trade union, or an employee, was not included.  In many cases it is the trade union who would avail of this provision. I cannot see any other people, or very few at least, going to the bother or expense of carrying out an investigation, but a large trade union could do so, because employees are usually the people who are ripped off the most when companies go to the wall.  If we are to accept Deputy McCartan's amendment it would only be fair to provide that trade unions or employees also have the right to apply to the court to appoint an inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also see difficulties arising if we accept Deputy McCartan's amendment, for example, under section 11 the court may, if it thinks fit, order that this report be sent to a variety of people, including the Minister.  Amendment No. 10 in the name of the Minister, which is a good amendment, states that certain sections of the report may be left out.  If the report is to be issued to all and sundry, it will also appear in the public press.  If this provision regarding the inspectorate is effective I hope it will apply to companies <Col N="1540" /> that are still trading rather than companies that are winding up.  If the report is issued to a wide variety of people it could end up in the hands of the media and that could do extreme damage to a trading company.  The publicity attaching to such reports should be considered.  It does not make much difference if the inspector issues a report when the company is gone out of business but it may do considerable damage to trading companies.</P>
    <P>If we accept Deputy McCartan's amendment, which I am not very much in favour of, the <i>quid pro quo</i> should be in section 7 and, secondly, perhaps an amendment could be included on Report Stage to provide that the court order that the report be given only to the people concerned and not to the public press. Perhaps the insertion of Deputy McCartan's amendment would be a symbolic gesture but I can see difficulties arising regarding the publication of the inspector's report for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say to Deputy McCartan that there is absolutely nothing sinister about my not wanting to include trade unions.  It is a purely pragmatic approach to the matter.  Other organisations such as the Federated Union of Employers and the CII are not included.  We deliberately did not include representative bodies of people who might have an interest but that was purely for the sake of being consistent.  I reiterate the Government's desire, and the importance they attach to working with the trade union movement in resolving all our national difficulties, as we have been doing.  There is absolutely nothing sinister in it and I do not resist it for any other reason than purely to be consistent about representative organisations in general.  In practice, the trade union that represents the employees will get a copy of the report but we have gone further and said that an employee also can get a copy.  Obviously the trade union official will be in contact with the employee but that is a matter for them.  The union are fully involved in this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> This is a Companies Bill and, to my knowledge, in all companies legislation we have avoided representative bodies and tried to deal with the individuals affected, such as the directors or employees.  We try to avoid the representative bodies on either side, as it were.  I would like to genuinely assure the Deputy that there is no other motive or reasoning behind it.  We have made it possible for an employee to get a copy of the report immediately and in that context I am sure the union involved will have the report.  Throughout company legislation we have avoided nominating representative bodies and that is purely to be consistent in company law.  I stress again that there is no philosophical or other reason involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because I know Deputy McCartan wants to contribute as this is his amendment.  I am sorry I missed most of the debate because I was elsewhere.  There is no fundamental reason why a report should be furnished to a trade union representative of an employee if the employee can get a copy of the report.  I have no objection to the amendment but I do not think it adds anything to the legislation.</P>
      <P>One point has not been raised in relation to paragraph (v) of subsection (3) (b).  From newspaper reports I know that there was some debate about this matter in the Seanad.  The Minister of State included the words &ldquo;including an employee&rdquo; to satisfy the fears of some Senators that employees were not included among those who had a right to seek a copy of a report.  That was not necessary.  Under the original wording they were covered.  Nonetheless, I welcome the inclusion of the phrase, to make it absolutely beyond any doubt that employees who are a fundamental part of the company are included also among those with a right to demand a copy of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister of State expand on the question of the financial interests of employees, whether as a creditor or otherwise?  What does &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; mean?  Does it mean future employment <Col N="1542" /> prospects, or does it refer to the wage structure of the company?  Have the Department or the Minister an exact idea of the limitations in this case?  Is it the intention to leave the position like that and let the courts decide on such limits? My own view is that the rights of employees should be as widely interpreted as possible in company legislation. I would like to think that in a matter for the courts those rights would be interpreted very widely and very liberally.  Has the Minister any concept of what the limitations under that phrase will be?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have specifically included employee in this paragraph. Financial interests in that regard would be moneys due in wages and salary or, indeed, the sheer prospect that there might not be employment in the future.  I would certainly see that as a financial interest.  It would include any concern of an employee that might affect his or her future earning capacity or power.</P>
      <P>We have specifically written in an employee after a lengthy debate in the Seanad.  I wanted to remove any suggestion that I did not want employees to have a copy of the report.  However, the exclusion of the representative body is purely for the sake of consistency in legislation. It takes one into the area of other representative bodies, various associations and so on, that may be attached to individuals who operate the company's system.</P>

      <P>I want to speak briefly in respect of the amendment and, secondly, on the general aspect of another point touched on by Deputy O'Dea.  I am somewhat dissapointed that the amendment does not commend itself to the Minister.  I accept his position in regard to the way in which he wishes to present the Government view of being consistent in not including any one particular representative organisation to the exclusion of others.  However, I base my case on my belief that we are dealing often with issues of confrontation where employees are greatly disadvantaged and, of necessity, rely on union representation.  That <Col N="1543" /> should be recognised.  This is unique. Drawing in references to the Federated Union of Employers or other groups does not really arise.  The point has been made by Deputy Bruton and touched on by Deputy O'Dea.</P>
      <P>The section is permissive of the inspectorate investigator.  There in no obligation on him to supply, and no right in the section for persons to ask for, a copy of the report because the wording is that &ldquo;the court, if it thinks fit,...&rdquo;.  It is the court that decides.  I incorrectly said that it was the inspector who had the discretion, but it is the court.  There is certainly no right of any person to demand one.  Has the Minister considered whether it would be more desirable to make it obligatory on the court to furnish copies, in other words to substitute for &ldquo;if it thinks fit&rdquo; the words &ldquo;it shall&rdquo;?  I would be worried that considerations not in the interests of those who should see the reports might come into play to act against them.</P>
      <P>If a court concedes that an investigator should be sent in, we are at a stage where all the parties named in paragraphs (i) to (vi) in the subsection should be advised and kept abreast of what is happening and what the conclusions are.  That is where the inclusion of the amendment with regard to union representation becomes even more important.  You are ensuring that the report moves into not just individual hands but responsible hands.  It has been a constant complaint and a fact of life that the company have gone or are complete and utter financially negative entity, a huge liability without anybody's knowledge.  They have been able to maintain a facade but nobody could get behind that to see exactly the truth of the future of the company.  It is very progressive that in terms of future employment capability of the company reports can now find their way, directly or indirectly, into the hands of employees so that they can be fully apprised of what is going on.  That is something to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people put a lifetime of effort and commitment into a company, they are <Col N="1544" /> entitled at least to know where the company is going.  Too often company accounts, or reports, or statements are given out when employees are not in a position to confront and examine them. In the order of things proposed by the Minister and the intent of the legislation, we should be working towards people, as of right, being furnished as a matter of course with such reports.  Would the Minister comment on the reason for his borrowing those terms, of allowing the court a discretion to decide whether reports are to be made available or not? These, as a matter of course, should be made available to the bodies named therein.  They have a well established right of interest and they should be kept informed.</P>

      <P>A few points have arisen.  Deputy McCartan referred to a trade union.  I want it to be crystal clear that it is purely for technical consistency reasons that I am opposing the insertion of the words, not for any other reason.  I fully accept the Deputy's right to pursue the inclusion of the words, from his standpoint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that later.  Line 26 included the expression &ldquo;if it thinks fit&rdquo;.  That is the point that Deputy McCartan has raised with me.  In other words, should we insist that the court makes the report available to a list of people or should we give the court the authority to make up its own mind in that regard?  I favour the latter course, letting the court make up its own mind about it, because there may be circumstances which we cannot envisage in which the court may decide not to release the report into the broad public arena.  It may be, for example, that the publication of such a report might in itself bring down the company and in a case like that the court might say that if they gave the report to the list of people who are entitled to request it, it might be the straw that breaks the camel's back.  Indeed, it could be detrimental to the employees, directors and shareholders of the company.  In the vast majority &mdash; if not all &mdash; cases I envisage the court making it available to the list of people in the section but we might be wrong to tie the hands of the court to having to give it out when it might be clear to them that doing so would damage the company and those who work there.  I see Deputy McCartan's point but it is better to let the court have the prerogative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that Deputy Bruton was trying to be helpful when he spoke about a person acting on behalf of others.  I have no difficulty in doing that but it is not necessary.  We could put the phrase &ldquo;a person whose conduct is referred to in the report&rdquo; in all the sections or &ldquo;a person nominated to act on their behalf&rdquo;.  We <Col N="1546" /> would be extending the list to people acting on behalf of others.  I know the Deputy was referring to a specific discussion between Deputy McCartan and me and I welcome his intervention in that regard but it will not solve the problem. I ask Deputy McCartan to accept the context and the goodwill which I am extending to the trade union movement instead of trying to get around it in a clever way.  I have clearly put in &ldquo;including an employee&rdquo; which should be sufficient. It means an employee of a company can get a copy of the report.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea asked about the procedure for applying.  Line 29, page 15 says &ldquo;furnish a copy on request and payment of the prescribed fee&rdquo;.  You will notice that there is always a prescribed fee.  It is not necessary to spell out what &ldquo;on request&rdquo; means.  It merely involves a letter, telephone call or a knock on the door.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If a fee is involved it probably makes sense for employees to get together, get someone to represent them and get one report for one fee rather than applying individually.  As Deputy McCartan said, one would expect most of the other people involved to be professionally competent and to be able to pursue their rights under company law whereas employees are probably more likely to require representation.  I hope we will not spend too much time on this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where the court so thinks proper it may direct that a particular part of a report made by virtue of this section be omitted from a copy forwarded or furnished under subsection (3) (a) or (b), or from the report as printed and published under subsection (3) (c)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This allows the court to edit or omit parts of the report before circulating it and the idea behind it is similar to that underlying a number of amendments we introduced in the Seanad to Part IX of the Bill.  It is a recognition that where a report of some aspect of a company's affairs is conducted by an outsider, so to speak, some parts of it may be unsuitable for general publication. Indeed, full publication in all cases could be positively and unnecessarily damaging to the interests of the company, their employees or some other party.  We obviously would not want legislation to have this effect and this amendment would give the court the discretion to make the report available with certain aspects omitted.  The form of the draft amendment is based on a similar idea which we introduced in the Seanad in regard to sections 167 and 170 which contain similar provisions in relation to reports by an examiner.  We are giving the court authority to omit portions of it from those supplied to the individuals listed.</P>

      <P>I do not understand this section which deals with proceedings on inspectors' reports.  This incorporates part of section 170 of the Companies Act, 1963, and it appears as if someone decided to keep just part of that section. Section 170 of the 1963 Act referred to the proceedings the Attorney General could bring on behalf of the State.  As I said, it appears as if somebody decided to incorporate parts of that section to make up section 12 of this Bill.  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>If, in the case of any body corporate liable to be wound up under the Companies Acts, it appears to the Minister from&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b) any report made by inspectors appointed by the Minister under this Act,  </P>
      <P>Under this Bill we are taking from the Minister the power to appoint the inspector.  The courts will be appointing them.  Some of this wording is in section 170 of the 1963 Act.  Maybe I am reading it incorrectly but perhaps somebody could explain the wording in section 12 (2) (a) and (b).</P>

      <P>Subsections (1), (2), (4) and (5) of section 170 of the 1963 Act are not being re-enacted.  Subsection (1) requires the Minister to refer criminal evidence arising from a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  This will not now be necessary.  Subsection (2) requires the company's officers and agents to assist the Director of Public Prosecutions where such referral took <Col N="1550" /> place.  This is also unnecessary now.  Subsections (4) and (5) enable the Minister to bring public interest proceedings on behalf of the company against a director arising from a report.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is effectively withdrawing from active involvement in the investigation of companies, this does not appear to be an appropriate power for the Minister to have.  As regards paragraph (b) which says, &ldquo;any report made by inspectors appointed by the Minister under this Act,&rdquo; there are specific instances in sections 14 and 16 when the Minister has the power to appoint inspectors.</P>

      <P>The Minister said we are doing away with section 170 of the 1963 Act which referred to the Attorney General before the advent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I agree with the Minister not including the Attorney General, but why are we re-enacting one part of the 1963 Act here by referring to the Minister?  These inspectors are appointed by the court.  The Minister can have an inspector appointed under section 8 but he has to go to the court to do so.</P>

      <P>The Minister does not appoint the inspectors in general but he retains power to appoint inspectors under section 14 to investigate the ownership of a company.  It is in these cases that the Minister appoints an inspector.  This legislation retains provisions whereby the Minister appoints an inspector and not the courts.  Section 14 deals with the appointment and powers of inspectors to investigate ownership of a company.</P>

      <P>Having considered a report made under section 11, the court may make such order as it deems fit in relation to matters arising from that report...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section starts by referring to a report under section 11 which covers inspectors appointed by the court, but in section 12 (2) (b) we refer to &ldquo;any report made <Col N="1551" /> by inspectors appointed by the Minister under this Act&rdquo;.  It appears that this wording was taken directly from the 1963 Act. Inspectors appointed by the Minister are referred to in sections 8 and 12 of this Bill. Section 12 (2) (b) does not say anything about inspectors appointed by the Minister to investigate the ownership of a company.  Reading this Bill one would get the impression that whoever drafted it decided to scrap a number of sections in the 1963 Act by omitting the words &ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo; and inserting the &ldquo;Director of Public Prosecutions&rdquo;.  This is totally unnecessary and I do not know why these words are there.</P>

      <P>Section 12 has two parts.  Subsection (1) deals with the courts and the general appointment of inspectors and says &ldquo;the court may make such order as it deems fit in relation to matters arising from that report including an order of its own motion for the winding up of a body corporate.&rdquo;.  That deals with the court, but subsection (2) does not take that approach.  It says:</P>
      <P>If, in the case of any body corporate liable to be wound up under the Companies Acts, it appears to the Minister from&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  any report made under section 11 as a result of an application by the Minister under section 8, or</P>
      <P>(b)  any report made by inspectors appointed by the Minister under this Act, or</P>
      <P>(c)  any information or document obtained by the Minister under this Part,</P>
      <P>It is broader than just dealing with what the Deputy refers to, the general area of appointing inspectors.  It broadens it out completely to take in a number of instances, including where the Minister directly appoints an inspector.

Section 12 (1) states: &ldquo;Having considered a report made under section 11, the court may make such order as it deems fit in relation to matters arising from that report including an order of its own motion for the winding up of a body corporate&rdquo;.  Could the Minister say what is in mind there?  Is there other than a winding up order?  I cannot think of any order &ldquo;the court may make&rdquo; other than a winding up order.  What other orders are we talking about?  Take a hypothetical example which is quite possible considering events here in the past couple of years.  Suppose there has been a dispute in a company regarding the trade union and management and maybe a difference of opinion between <Col N="1553" /> individual members of the union as to how the company should be conducted, and that led to a strike and eventually the close down of the company.  We have seen instances of that.  Suppose the inspector's report, having taken on the evidence, said the trade union or someone else was totally responsible for the way this company was conducted and this led to a number of problems.  This is why I make so much reference to section 170 of the 1963 Act.  I still think this section was thrown in because section 170 was there and it was a case of throwing in something like this here also.  I see no need at all for it.  What is the purpose of this section and in particular subsection (1)?  What other orders would the court be thinking about?  Are there any such orders?  When we come to other sections there can be criminal prosecutions and whatever and the court can decide on compensation but this section was just thrown in.  What is the purpose of it?</P>

      <P> (a)  convicted of an offence on a prosecution instituted as a result of an investigation,</P>
      <P>(b)  ordered to pay damages or restore any property in proceedings brought as a result of an investigation, or</P>
      <P>(c)  awarded damages or to whom property is restored in proceedings brought as a result of an investigation,  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> may, in the same proceedings, be ordered to repay all or part of the expenses referred to in subsection (1) to the Minister for Justice or to any person on whom liability has been imposed by the court under that subsection, provided that, in the case of a person to whom paragraph (c) relates, the court shall not order payment in excess of one-tenth of the amount of the damages awarded or of the value of the property restored, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(3) The report of an inspector may, if he thinks fit, and shall, if the court so directs, include a recommendation as to the directions (if any) which he thinks appropriate, in the light of his investigation, to be given under subsection (1).&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>We are coming to section 13 which deals with expenses of the investigating company's affairs, how they are paid and so on.  That is the general thrust of section 13.  The amendments which are put down all relate to this section 13 which deals with the question of liability for the expenses of an investigation and provides guidelines for the court as to the manner in which these expenses are to be defrayed.  As drafted the section provides that the expenses of an investigation shall be defrayed in the first instance by the Minister for Justice and then that certain other persons shall be liable to repay that Minister to the extent to be specified by the court.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that there was considerable debate in the House last week on the whole question of who should pay for the expenses of an investigation. This debate took place in the context of section 7 (3) which deals with security for costs in relation to investigation. There was strong opposition last week to the idea that an applicant for an investigation could be liable to pay for the whole cost of an investigation, with no limit.  I have given careful consideration during the past week to the points raised by Deputies and have come to the conclusion that some of what was <Col N="1556" /> said &mdash; indeed, a great deal of what was said &mdash; has considerable merit.  Therefore, I am proposing an amendment which would replace the existing section 13 with a new section which will cover many of the concerns raised by Deputies, Deputy Bruton in particular.  In proposing this amendment I am satisfied that we are improving the overall workability, as it were, of the investigation procedure of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It will be useful if I outline quickly what I am proposing in this amendment and I hope Deputies will see from the explanation that we are taking on board many of the suggestions made in last week's debate.  First, we made three changes in subsection (1).  We have taken out the reference to the liability of a person convicted of an offence as a result of an investigation.  A number of questions were raised in the debate last week about how this provision would work in practice as a prosecution for an offence would probably take place only some considerable time after the investigation had been completed.  My reaction at the time to those comments was that this provision was already in the 1963 Act and should not be changed.  I am proposing, therefore, that the question of the liability of a person convicted of an offence in a prosecution arising out of an investigation should be decided during those proceedings and that where liability is imposed the person convicted should be required to repay any person who has been ordered by the court to pay the expenses in the first instance.  This is provided for in subsection (2) of the amendment where there is also a number of other new provisions which I would like to deal with quickly.</P>
    <P>I should say at this stage that I cannot agree with Deputy Bruton's proposal in amendment No. 11 that a person convicted of an offence should only be liable to the extent that he benefited financially from the company.  In the first place it seems to me that the extent of a person's benefit would be extremely hard to establish and that it is not a question which is appropriate for decision by a criminal court.  Secondly, the question of the <Col N="1557" /> extent of a person's liability in this type of case should be left to the court to decide.</P>
    <P>In regard to my amendment, the second change we are making in subsection (1) is to tidy up the wording somewhat. This is a minor change but it makes the subsection easier to understand.</P>
    <P>The final change in this subsection is much more fundamental and takes account of the concerns raised by a number of Deputies that there should be a limit written into the legislation on the extent of an applicant's liability under the section.  On reflection I am inclined to agree that this is a good idea and I am proposing, therefore, that the maximum liability for an applicant should be set at £200,000.  At this point I should like to make it clear that the figure of £200,000 will be the maximum liability which the courts could impose on an applicant.  It does not in any way suggest that that figure will be the usual one used by the courts.  Clearly, the courts will decide in each case what the extent of the applicant's liability should be, depending on the cost of the investigation and whether the applicant should be liable to pay at all.  In many cases an applicant may not be liable to pay.</P>
    <P>During the debate last week Deputy Bruton was concerned that an applicant's liability should be limited to half the cost of an investigation.  In fact, he has tabled amendment No. 11 (a) to this effect. Having examined the question of maximum liability for an applicant I am prepared to accept the principle involved. I am not sure, however, that Deputy Bruton's proposal is the best way to deal with the problem.  In my view my proposal setting a figure for maximum liability is a clearer way to approach this as it has the advantage of certainty.  Under Deputy Bruton's proposal an applicant could be required to pay costs arguably in excess of £200,000 if the expenses of an investigation exceed £400,000.</P>
    <P>The idea that liability should be set at half the cost of an investigation gives no guarantee whatever as to a person's maximum liability.  While I accept the principle of setting a limit I suggest to the <Col N="1558" /> House that my proposal of specifying the limit of £200,000 in the section is preferable and I urge the House to adopt it.</P>
    <P>The proposed new subsection (2) deals with the question I referred to, relating to the liability of a person convicted of an offence on a prosecution arising as a result of an investigation.  I should like to emphasise that the question of such a person's liability will be decided at the time of the criminal proceedings, as provided for in section 171 of the 1963 Act. That was not made clear in the Bill as drafted.  In addition, we are taking another element of the 1963 Act, not included in the Bill initially and which on reflection should now be included, and that is where a person is found to be in default by virtue of civil proceedings brought as a result of an investigation he should be liable to pay some or all of the costs of the investigation if the court which hears these proceedings considers it appropriate.</P>
    <P>I am taking on board the substance of Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 11 (b) by providing in paragraph (c) of subsection (2) that a person who actually benefits from an investigation being held on the basis of damages being awarded to him, or property being restored at civil proceedings, should be required to contribute to the cost of the investigation. I agree with Deputy Bruton's proposals that this liability should be limited and I am including a limit of one-tenth of the cost of the investigation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of the amendment is the same as the existing subsection (3) in the Bill as it came from the Seanad.  Finally, I am proposing the deletion of the existing subsections (2) and (4).  On reflection, subsection (2) is unnecessarily complicated and unlikely to be availed of in practice.  I am satisfied that the safeguards which are now built into the section under my proposed amendment will ensure that the liability for the costs of an investigation would be properly dealt with.  I do not, therefore, think that subsection (2) is necessary.  Subsection (4) is being deleted because it is no longer relevant in view of our proposed changes in relation to the liability of a person <Col N="1559" /> convicted of an offence arising out of an investigation.  I value last week's contributions by Members and I trust that they find my response to them to be suitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for in substance accepting many of the amendments I tabled and incorporating them in the new section drafted with the professional advice available to him.  There are one or two points which remain and which I would like to pursue with the Minister.  The first is in regard to the amendment tabled. According to that a person convicted of an offence on a prosecution instituted as a result of an investigation in the course of those criminal proceedings may, in addition to being sentenced to jail or being ordered to pay a fine, be also asked by the judge hearing the criminal case to pay to the Minister for Justice a sum of money in respect of the costs of the original investigation.  Two issues arise from that.  It would appear that a court would be considering the question of the attribution of the costs of an investigation in two separate proceedings.  In the first instance the court would be considering it at the conclusion of the investigation and asking for contributions at that point from the body corporate that was investigated and from the applicants.  Subsequently, another judge in a criminal case may decide that the directors, or whoever was being prosecuted, should pay a contribution.  There could yet be another court case in which a person who was awarded damages against a member of the company arising from the investigation had those damages confirmed and yet a third judge might decide to order that some of the damages should be paid back to the Minister for Justice as a contribution towards the cost of the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister is trying to achieve is very good but I wonder, from a practical point of view, if there is not a possibility that at the first of those hearings the judge might decide to make an order for restitution to the Minister for Justice of <Col N="1560" /> the entire costs of the proceedings and ask the body corporate and the applicant to split the costs between them.  Later, if there is a prosecution another judge may say that he thinks the person who was convicted should pay a contribution to the costs of the proceedings.  What happens then?  Will the fact that the issue of costs has been dealt with influence the judge in the subsequent criminal proceedings to take the view that as the costs had been looked after he would not bother making any order?  Will the judge make such an order in which case the money will be paid to the Minister for Justice who will refund such proportion of the costs paid by the applicant or the body corporate as represented by the money received for the second court case?  In the case of a third court case, if there is one, will the same procedure be gone through, that the money will be paid to the Minister who will in turn pay it to the applicants?</P>
    <P>We should remember that there may be three court cases and there may be gaps of several years between them.  I wonder if the Minister should introduce a provision to ensure that the one judge hears all cases so that there will be a continuity of view as to the appropriate proportion of the costs that should be met.  Alternatively, should a formula be established by law whereby money coming in from subsequent proceedings can be paid back to those who have already paid in money?  Some provision is needed to deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>So far as my own amendments are concerned the Minister has correctly stated that he has accepted in practice amendment 11b.  He has not accepted amendment No. 11a but he has introduced an overall limit of £200,000.  I am not pushed about that, the Minister's approach may be better.  My original amendment, No. 11, is one which raises another issue of jurisprudence which we should look at. Amendment No. 11 proposes that a person who is convicted of a crime shall only be asked to pay towards the cost of the investigation in proportion to the extent that he has actually benefited from <Col N="1561" /> the operations of the company.  In looking at it from a broad moral point of view one could say that nobody should be more responsible for the cost of the investigation than the person who is convicted ultimately of the offence which may have been the reason the investigation was initiated.  It seems much more sensible that he should pay than that somebody who applied for the investigation should pay.  In that sense it is fair.  In another sense it is importing into our law a rather unusual principle, namely, that someone convicted of an offence, sent to jail or fined should also have to pay for the investigation which led to their being brought to court.  Such a provision does not apply, for instance, in the case of the offence of murder.</P>
    <P>When somebody commits a murder they are sent to jail but they are not asked to pay for the cost of the Garda Special Detective Unit, travelling expenses and so forth that led to their being detected and the evidence being assembled.  If we are to ask persons convicted of crimes under the company's law to pay for the cost of the investigation, if that is to be an accepted principle of company law and this is company law we are talking about, why should we confine that provision to company offences?  I have made suggestions before on the Estimate for the Department of Justice that there should be much more power to ensure a contribution by criminals to the cost of either the investigation leading to the offence or the cost of their incarceration if they have substantial resources.  That is a very wide and potentially disputatious area of criminal jurisprudence.  Here we are providing in company law that a person should be civilly liable for the costs of an investigation.  I know that has applied in the 1963 Act but it is new in the sense that it is being renewed here.  It is an unusual principle and I do not know what are the views of other Members of the House who, perhaps, have more practical experience of dealing with cases of this kind in relation to it.  The idea is that a person who has committed an offence, as well as paying the fine or going to jail, <Col N="1562" /> would have to pay the cost of the detectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very generous in accepting the spirit of the amendments put forward in this debate.  I wonder whether this is an appropriate amendment to make and I wonder whether the Minister has not been too generous to Deputy Bruton by taking on some of his measures.  I am worried about subsection (2) because it seems to provide, in three separate circumstances, that someone can be made liable to indemnify the Minister or the company or the applicant for the costs of an investigation.  The three separate circumstances are very different.  One is that a person has been actually convicted, another is that you are found civilly liable and the third is that you are found civilly to have been wronged.  I agree that in the last case a person's liability to contribute to the cost is limited to 10 per cent.  It is extraordinary that it is now proposed that in law the victim of a wrong, a wrong carried out by someone else, would have to pay towards the investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is wrong, it should not be brought in.  The principle of paying something towards the cost of finding out that you had a case is all very well but it is very difficult to decide whether civil proceedings were brought as a result of an investigation.  It is very hard to know whether something which follows something in time resulted from it and whether somebody had, in fact, intended bringing that action beforehand, had just waited to see the outcome of the report and when fortified by the result of the report actually brought his case.  It is very difficult for a judge to work out what was going on in the mind of the plaintiff, whether he was holding fire or whether he was activated only when he saw the report and realised he had a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not keen on the whole idea of lumping what is penal in subsection (2) <Col N="1563" /> (a) and (b) with a non-penal but similar liability, even though of a lesser kind in paragraph (c).  I do not see the logic of it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take on board another reservation I have concerning a person convicted of an offence on a prosecution instituted as the result of an investigation.  If that were a summary offence we could be back in theory to the old difficulty under section 57 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, where the District Court would have an ancillary power to award a sum, effectively as damages, which hugely exceeds anything the District Court can otherwise do.  I think there would have to be a trial on indictment, otherwise it would be unconstitutional to allow the District Court to make a person liable up to £200,000 or more &mdash; there is not a limit of £200,000 on the amount. That needs to be looked at.  Those are my thoughts on the section.  I do not like the look of that section as it is coming out.  It was better as drafted and was neater.  I do not like the general drift of it.  It may not be an improvement and there may be an over-generous acceptance of suggestions from the Government side of the House which may lead, in the last analysis, to a worse piece of law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing in a new section replacing the old section completely but whether it will do what is intended I do not know.  The applicant for an investigation is the person who will have to put up security of a sum not exceeding £200,000.  That is the bond the court will have.  The problem with the section as originally drafted was that if the court found that X, Y and Z were the people responsible for the trouble in the company and should be prosecuted and found that the applicant should only be responsible for £50,000 of the cost of the inspector's report and if none of the people who were criminally liable could come up with some of the costs of the report, one could go back to the person who had suffered the greatest loss and take out the rest of <Col N="1564" /> his money.  That was the main objection I had to the section.  Subsection (1) of the new section proposed by the Minister says that a liability greater than £200,000 cannot be exceeded.  That is not the same £200,000 which was mentioned in section 7 which is the security an applicant must put up.  It cannot be greater than £200,000.  If I am reading this correctly it is a different matter altogether.  The cost of this whole investigation may not exceed £200,000 and it shall not be borne by those people referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b).</P>
      <P>Under section 7 the court may decide that the security put up should be, say, £100,000.  When the investigation and so on takes place the costs might be £500,000.  Not only will the court have the security of the £100,000 but it can also order another £100,000 to be paid which would bring the amount up to £200,000.  Lest anybody be confused this £200,000 is not the same as that in section 7.  It just so happens that the two figures coincide.  In the new section as proposed by the Minister the figure could be £1 million.  It would be a total contradiction if it was under £200,000 and it is obvious that we are not talking about the same figure.  Am I correct in my assumptions?</P>

      <P>As I said in my statement to the House on 24 November and in response to supplementary questions on 6 December, I have asked the Minister for the Environment to assume a special responsibility for planning and co-ordination of the provision of physical infrastructure to prepare the economy for the single market.  This will involve ensuring that our approach in this area is comprehensive, that facilities are not duplicated and that requirements in particular areas of infrastructure are met.  The Minister will be responsible for seeing that changes take place, without administrative delays, as rapidly as is economically feasible and that developments in the different sectors of infrastructure are consistent with each other.</P>

Therefore it would seem sensible to ask the Minister for the Environment to keep an overview of the position in regard to our infrastructure, even that which would not come directly within the ambit of his ministerial responsibilities, <Col N="1566" /> so as to ensure we use the moneys from the Structural Funds to the best possible advantage, that we do not duplicate or neglect some important piece of infrastructure which might get overlooked in the normal course of events.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The projected current expenditure by the Chester Beatty Library for 1988 is in the region of £250,000, of which £200,000 <Col N="1568" /> is funded by way of a grant-in-aid from my Department.  The pay element of the library's total expenditure is about £200,000 or 80 per cent of that expenditure. The grant-in-aid &mdash; which is funded in 1988 from national lottery proceeds &mdash; is not broken down into pay and non-pay elements.</P>
    <P>The library does not have a specific promotion budget.  The trustees are very concerned to promote public awareness and appreciation of the library's magnificent treasures and I have arranged for this issue to be examined by my Department in consultation with the trustees who, it will be appreciated, are an independent entity established under the terms of Sir Chester Beatty's will.  The interdepartmental committee on tourism are also considering proposals made in that context.</P>
    <P>The Board of Trustees are not required to publish annual reports and accounts. However, under the Department of Finance guidelines in relation to the issue of grants-in-aid, the annual accounts are presented to my Department.  The books and accounts of the library and, indeed, all grantees in receipt of public funding, are made available &mdash; if required &mdash; for examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>I understand that the trustees have met on 24 occasions in the past two years.  The board's policy proposals and discussions are confidential, as are those of similar bodies.  I am quite confident that the board meets frequently enough to discuss pertinent issues.  This month's meeting is to be held later this week and I am not aware of any compelling reason to call for a special meeting as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach sought any inquiry into the recent departure of one of the members of the Board of Trustees and a suggestion contained in reports that a number of other board members, including his own nominee, are also considering departing?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This is a very special type of organisation and it could <Col N="1569" /> probably be described as a rarefied institution. It is not the sort of body in which I take a day-to-day supervisory interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that it is an institution that certainly could be described as rarefied, but would the Taoiseach not agree in view of the significance of the works held in the library and, more particularly, in view of the moneys expended by his Department on an annual basis, accounting for upwards of 80 per cent of the overall budget, it is time that the rarefied atmosphere was invaded by his Department who have a responsibility in this area so as to bring more order into the library and to make it more accessible to members of the public who in effect are the owners of the library?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that I can be of any particular assistance.  The trustees are appointed in accordance with the terms of the will; three are appointed by the Government and they appoint the others.  To that extent it has a special type of independence.  The Government provide some moneys for maintenance and repairs.  I think the Deputy would agree with me that it is better that there should be the least possible Government interference in the running of an institution of this kind.  I have no information on file at my disposal which would indicate that there is any need for a special investigation by me or any of my officers at this stage, but in deference to the Deputy's queries I will discuss the matter again with my officials to see if anything needs to be done.</P>

Unless it is something of a particularly important public nature I think it is much better to leave these institutions to run themselves, particularly when the terms under which they are to be operated were so carefully delineated by the original donor.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he has considered the report produced by the Combat Poverty Agency on money-lending and low income, which recommended that the Garda should be resourced to carry out an intensive campaign to identify and prosecute unlicensed money-lenders, and that a senior Garda officer should be appointed to oversee the enforcement of these laws; if he intends to act on these recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) (for the Minister for Justice)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 21 together.  The report produced by the Combat Poverty Agency for the Minister for Social Welfare was considered by the Government recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of their consideration of the report the Government have decided to approach the issue of money-lending on two levels &mdash; intervention through legal and financial measures and through the provision of advice, information and education on debt and money management. These measures include the initiation by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, of a full review of the present legislation on money-lending and its implementation with a view to countering disreputable practices through improving the regulation and control of money-lending.  In that context the Minister for Industry and Commerce will introduce the necessary legislation to <Col N="1576" /> implement the EC Directive on Consumer Credit which will encompass money-lending.  The Directive is to be implemented by January 1990.</P>
    <P>As to the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency report concerning the Garda, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda pursue actively all alleged breaches of the law in relation to money-lenders.  However, a difficulty nearly always encountered by the Garda in investigating the allegations against money-lenders is that in many cases the persons making the allegations or the borrowers in question are either unable or unwilling to give information. While this is an aspect which I will naturally consider further in the context of the review of the present legislation, it is difficult to envisage any amendment of the law which would have the effect of removing this difficulty fully.</P>
    <P>As regards the specific recommendation that a senior Garda officer should be appointed, at both national and regional levels, to oversee the enforcement of the law on money-lending, I consider that it is more appropriate that this should continue to be dealt with by all members of the Garda Síochána as at present, having regard to local circumstances and within the context of overall policing in any any particular area.</P>
    <P>In the light of the foregoing, it will be clear that I have serious doubts concerning the implementation of the report's recommendations about the involvement of the Garda generally.  It seems to me that in the light of experience and having regard to the essential character of a money-lending transaction &mdash; and this is borne out to a great extent in the Combat Poverty Agency report &mdash; there is much to be said for dealing with the issue in the context of consumer credit &mdash; protection &mdash; control as is the case in other countries.  Nevertheless we will be looking at this aspect of the matter again in the context of the review of the present legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister for Justice any proposals for legislation to tighten up on the licensing of money-lenders? Is it proposed to allow those who are not immediately involved in the granting of a licence, such as community or charitable interest, to object to or oppose the issue of a licence to a money-lender?  Has the Minister for Justice, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, had regard to the Consumer Credit Act, 1974 in Britain and the usefulness of some of its provisions in proposed legislation here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be considering all these matters in conjunction with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and will take appropriate action. The bulk of action in this area will transfer to Industry and Commerce in line with procedures in other European countries. This legislation is in the early stages of preparation but it must be completed in the course of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to impress on the Minister for Justice the need for some mechanism whereby licences issuing can be opposed by those who have a community or charitable interest in an area.  Money-lenders, whether they be legal or illegal, often operate in a very small neighbourhood area and the information is local to that area.  This is a point which should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will convey that to the Minister.  Even in the present circumstances it would be open to local community groups or a credit union to make their views known to the Garda, who would bear those views in mind if an application for a licence was received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that because of the nature of money-lending it is not enough to say that complaints will be investigated?  People who are involved with money-lenders may be very reluctant to make complaints for one reason or another, as is well known.  The recommendation that a senior Garda officer should be appointed at national and regional levels to oversee the enforcement of the law would be more appropriate and effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In tackling the question of money-lending generally information came to light as to the very high interest rates which were being charged, particularly bearing in mind the APR, the true rate of charge in the course of the year. APRs ranged from 210 per cent to 288 per cent.  This was one of the major findings of the study.  Those who have looked at money-lending otherwise have found charges even higher than 288 per cent. The Government's action plan includes a number of measures, one being the loan guarantee fund.  The Lock Credit Union in Cork have taken a major initiative which has been very successful in getting people away from money-lenders.  That is probably one of the most practical and immediate things that can be done.  Cork also seems to have taken the initiative in regard to complaints.  One major case where the borrower was prepared to go the whole way was very successful and the money-lender subsequently got out of business.  With regard to small fines, it is a matter of updating the legislation.  It is true that there is a natural reluctance to make complaints.  In cases which I have discussed with the credit unions there have been threats made.  There is no question about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain why a review is taking place now in view of the glaring inadequacies in our money-lending legislation?  The Minister indicates that there is not a case for major change in that legislation.  Would he not accept that the onus of proof is totally on the debtor while in other countries, including the UK, the onus is on the <Col N="1579" /> creditor to disprove allegations of extortionate credit?  That is what we should have here.  Would he comment on the proposal in the report by the Combat Poverty Agency that money-lending at excessive rates should be made a criminal offence?  Why is he not taking that recommendation on board?  Would he not accept that the penalties are utterly derisory and are no deterrent to those carrying on illegal money-lending?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has serious doubts that making it a criminal offence would be a satisfactory solution. However, that matter will be considered in the context of the forthcoming legislation. It is useless to get into argument about why the matter is being dealt with now.  Work on the report was undertaken by the Combat Poverty Agency when I asked them to undertake a specific, direct study which would produce fairly immediate answers as a basis for action. That report led to the Government action programme.  In any event, preparations are under way under the EC Directive through the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this is a bumper period for these leeches in society and that the people involved exploit the less well off in our community?  Are there any proposals to discuss this matter with the commercial banks, who have failed miserably in educating people in particular areas as to the facilities available?  They should extend their facilities to people rather than depend constantly on business from different sections of the community. Would the Minister agree that commercial banks have a moral responsibility towards all sections of society and that ways and means should be found through their system to replace these leeches by proper commercial trading?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Everything the Deputy says is very relevant.  This is the time of year when money-lending comes to the fore and the report brought this <Col N="1580" /> out.  At certain stages in the year, or at certain events in the family cycle, people are in need of money.</P>
      <P>In relation to the banks, I approached the Banks Standing Committee of the four major banks and I asked them if they would support the loan guarantee fund and the action we are taking in that area. They considered the matter for about a week and said they would put down pound for pound.  As the Deputy knows, the Government made £100,000 available for the loan guarantee fund and the banks said they would also give £100,000. I do not know how much each one allocates but it is probably done on a <i>pro rata</i> basis in relation to their own business. They have also nominated a person for the supervisory committee.  I was quite anxious that the banks, as well as the credit unions, would participate.  In the past I was familiar with local bank managers helping people out of trouble&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but there is always the occasional defaulter and of course the local bank manager has to answer for that.  In the case of the credit union in Cork, out of 114 cases only three defaulted.  That gives a good idea of the ratio.  The banks will now be able to participate and that will get under way early in the new year.  The credit unions will hold a meeting on the matter this weekend. I would hope by next week to be able to go ahead with the setting up of the supervisory committee.  The banks are prepared to work with us on this matter and I am delighted with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if the Garda will investigate an amusement arcade (details supplied) in Dublin 1 where pay-outs are made above the legal limits on a large scale on a daily basis; if appropriate action will be taken; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice for Ministers for Justice, unless there are exceptional circumstances indicating otherwise, to disclose whether or not a particular individual or establishment is the subject of a Garda investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply, particularly in view of the fact that this establishment is around the corner from Store Street Garda station.  It is a scandal that the owner continues to evade the legal restrictions on gambling.  Is the Minister concerned about the reports from social workers and people involved in child care in the area that many teenagers involved in local social employment schemes are spending all their earnings in this establishment in Talbot Street and that other teenagers are inevitably being lead into crime such as muggings and so on to get money for the slot machines in this arcade?  Can he not at least give a commitment here that some determined effort will be made to uncover the mechanism that is being used by this individual to evade the restrictions and to see that justice is done and that this individual is dealt with before the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should make clear that during last year 127 breaches of the Act were detected and evidence was produced in those cases.  The provisional number of detections up to the end of September this year is 393.  I mention that figure to let the Deputy see that in general action is taken.  The Deputy can be assured that the necessary actions are taken by the gardaí in relation to any case which is reported to them and they are <Col N="1582" /> prepared to use every method at their disposal to obtain the necessary proofs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in this case, while the legal payout limits are marked clearly on each machine to give the impression that the establishment is run within the law, the system of credits which is marked up on each machine is used to gain pay-outs from the cash box which are made directly to the local youths who use the arcade?  When strangers or people whom the proprietor is not certain are his usual clientéle appear this system is not used. In view of the fact that under-cover plain clothes gardaí are used regularly in the immediate area to deal with women selling flowers and jewellery from prams, could the Minister not ensure that some of these gardaí are diverted to deal with what I would consider to be a more pressing social problem in that area?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is difficult when we are dealing with a particular case and hence the approach of the Minister in the reply.  If the Deputy reads my reply he will see that I have answered his question already.  He has also mentioned the difficulty that arises.  He said that in cases like this if people know their usual clients and can identify other people no matter who they may be a difficulty may arise.  I would like to assure the Deputy that every method at the disposal of the Garda is, and will be, used in any cases that are reported and he can have confidence in that.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if regular spot checks are made on all these arcades around the city of Dublin.  It is my information that many of them are in breach of the law.  A great many young people are concerned about other young people who are falling prey to this kind of temptation.  Could I ask the Minister if regular spot checks are made and if a report is made on a particular case, will that be checked up not <Col N="1583" /> only immediately following the report but on a continuing basis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of indictable offences involving knives from 1 January 1987 to 30 October 1987 is 115 and in 1988 it is 120, an increase of 4 per cent. These are particularly frightening crimes and constitute a frightening development. Overall, these crimes account for 0.8 per cent of all crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note that the Minister regards these offences as particularly objectionable and brutal. <Col N="1584" /> Will the Minister confirm that the provisions of the Bill he mentions will render it an offence to carry a knife unless a person in possession of one can give a valid explanation as to why he is doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to discuss details of the proposed Bill in advance of Government approval.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that the Minister cannot go into the details of the proposed Bill now, may I have an assurance from him that its provisions will outlaw the carrying of knives?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister says it is the intention of the Department of Justice to introduce legislation outlawing offensive weapons would he ensure, in so far as possible, that a particularly vicious weapon, in the form of a crossbow, will be covered by its provisions having regard to a number of incidents which have taken place in the past six months when animals were viciously slaughtered by crossbows and, more recently, in Dublin where a citizen was seriously wounded by a crossbow?  Will the Minister ensure that crossbows are covered in any relevant legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The prevention and detection of crime are, of course, primarily matters for the Garda Síochána.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the provisional figures for recorded indictable crime in the Dublin Metropolitan Area for the first nine months of this year indicate an increase over the figures for the corresponding period in 1987, which are a cause of concern.  This upward trend has become evident only in the current year.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have assured me that they have taken a number of positive steps to address the situation.  Each district officer in the DMA has recently prepared a programme of measures designed to reduce the incidence of crimes that most affect his district and particular attention is being given to the problem of crimes of violence.  I consider that it would be counterproductive were I to disclose the content of these plans.  I will say only that they contain quite specific measures designed to meet the circumstances peculiar to each district in the DMA.  More Garda resources are also being devoted to crime prevention in the DMA in the current year, with the continued expansion of the neighbourhood watch scheme and the extension of community policing to a number of new areas.</P>
      <P>The Garda continually monitor the crime situation in Dublin and elsewhere and they will continue to assess and adapt their strategies for dealing with changing crime patterns as needs dictate.  Their ability and readiness to adapt to changing circumstances has brought success in relation to crime problems in the past and I am confident that they will respond successfully to the increase in crime which is becoming evident at present.  I will, of course, be keeping in close touch with developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the reply.  Would he not agree that there are appalling problems in Dublin? The figures he has just quoted show an increase in 1988 over 1987 but he did not say that there was also an increase in crime in 1987 over 1986.  Since the Government took up office there has <Col N="1591" /> been a complete breakdown in regard to the fight against crime, in Dublin city area in particular.  Would the Minister agree that this is a result of lack of commitment on the part of the Government towards providing the necessary resources for the Garda Síochána to do their job?  This includes the recruitment, or non-recruitment, policy that they are pursuing and their failure to fill various vacancies such as those of sergeant, inspector and superintendent.</P>

      <P>The incidence of armed raids decreased in 1987 by 15 per cent. <Col N="1592" /> There has been a reduction of 21.7 per cent in terms of money stolen but there is a problem, I agree.  It is a problem particularly to Dublin, because in the rest of the country there is a decline of 4.3 per cent in the number of crimes committed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to say, the new Garda Commissioner will have his own approach to this problem.  Measures are being taken by the Garda in relation to the neighbourhood watch schemes and community policing.  The neighbourhood watch schemes have been very widely accepted and cover a large number of households.  There are 544 schemes involving 136,266 households in Dublin. These schemes have been very successful generally.  Communities are quite enthusiastic about them.</P>
      <P>In addition, community policing trials are going on in a number of locations and these locations are being extended.  I happen to be familiar with a number of these because of being familiar with extremely high crime areas.  They are being very successful, in my opinion.  The fact that the Garda are extending them further at this stage indicates that they are considered worth while.  I would expect that with the various trials and other developments which have recently taken place, the Garda will be in a better position to get on top of the situation.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that an imbalance in crime and Garda coverage exists in certain areas?  Last year the imbalance was of 57 per cent of crime being committed in Dublin and 35 or 36 per cent of the Garda Force being stationed in Dublin.  As his figures now show, that imbalance is increasing with the increase in crime in Dublin and the decrease in crime outside Dublin.  Would the Minister indicate to the House that that would be very much taken into account in considering the allocation of further gardaí to Dublin?  Would he ensure that the neighbourhood watch schemes are able to take effect and that there will be liaison officers available?  In <Col N="1593" /> order that neighbourhood policing can take effect, one needs gardaí on the ground and in particular areas &mdash; in my own constituency, for instance &mdash; that is not the case.</P>

In relation to the neighbourhood watch scheme and the extent to which it has been of benefit, I would agree with the Deputy.  Also community policing may be of further benefit when it is extended and the Garda have had an opportunity to prove and test it further. I would remind the Deputy that I was chairman of the committee that prepared the first report on this matter &mdash; and it was an all-party committee &mdash; on the desirability of the neighbourhood watch system and also of the community policing methods.  The Garda have one scheme well under way.  They are trying another scheme at the moment and as far as I can see it seems to be going very well.

Are they not aware of the hardship involved &mdash; especially to children &mdash; when there is a struggle between parents and legal custody of a child or children is sought by one of them?  I cannot think of anything more ugent in his Department than resolving a problem concerning young children.  Will urgent steps be taken to produce the necessary legislation to enable us to ratify this convention? How many countries have ratified both conventions?  What co-operation is there at present in relation to problems of this nature where the Garda are involved? Are there built in safeguards and contacts with other police forces in Great Britain and throughout Europe?  Are there checks at airports and ferry ports?</P>

      <P>As I said, the examination of the convention is at an early stage but even now it is possible to forecast that any legislation to enable ratification will be substantial.  I will convey the Deputy's view about the urgency of the matter to the Minister for Justice.  There is co-operation on a country to country basis and 15 have signed the European Convention. It has been ratified by nine <Col N="1597" /> States, France, Luxembourg, Portugal, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Spain and the UK.  It has been in force since October 1983.  The Hague Convention has been signed by 15 States and nine have ratified it.  These are Canada, France, Portugal, Switzerland, Australia, Spain, the UK, the USA and Hungary.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to a written Dáil Question on 1 December &mdash; column 133, volume 385 of the Official Report &mdash; the Family Mediation Service was established in Dublin in July 1986 to operate as a pilot scheme for a three year period.  At the end of that period a decision will be made regarding the future of the scheme, including its geographical scope.</P>
      <P>The service is located at Irish Life Centre, Block 1, Floor 5, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1.  However, the service can be availed of by persons from outside Dublin and statistics supplied to my Department in relation to the service show that 20 per cent of those who used the service up to July 1988 were resident outside the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The funding provided for the operation of the service in 1988 and 1989 is indicated in the Revised Estimates for the Public Services 1988 and the Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version) 1989, respectively.  The same money has been provided for the whole year in that case as can be seen from the Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the average remission of sentence given to prisoners for whatever <Col N="1599" /> reason; whether this average has been exceeded over the past six months, due to overcrowding in our prisons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of those serving commuted death sentences in practice all offenders serving fixed sentences of longer than one month are regarded as entitled to full remission of one-quarter of the total sentence unless all or part of this remission is forfeited as a consequence of breaches of prison discipline.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, provides for various forms of temporary release.  For example, temporary release under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service can be allowed to help an offender to reintegrate into society.  Daily temporary release is on occasions granted to allow an offender to leave prison each morning for work or training and to return to prison at night. In certain circumstances other occasional periods of temporary release can be granted.</P>
      <P>In circumstances where pressure on custodial accommodation may be a factor, early releases which are authorised generally apply to offenders who are serving relatively short sentences or who are very near the end of longer sentences. Other factors taken into account when early release is being considered are the nature of the offence, the length of sentence served, behaviour while in custody, previous criminal history and the Garda view of the likely threat to the community which a particular release might involve.  Releases of this type can be made subject to conditions &mdash; for example, that the person released should report at certain times to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Annual Report on Prisons and Places of Detention gives details of the number of occasions on which temporary release is granted and similar statistics in relation to temporary releases this year will be compiled in preparing the 1988 report.  Statistics, however, are not available which would show the relationship <Col N="1600" /> between temporary releases and sentences and these could be compiled only by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time.</P>
    <P>Also, as pressure on accommodation is only one of a number of factors that have to be considered in deciding whether to grant an early release, there would be difficulty in attributing any particular early release exclusively to this factor.</P>
    <P>I can inform the Deputy, however, that statistics which are maintained on a daily basis, showing the number of offenders on various forms of temporary release each day, show that the number of offenders on temporary release at present is broadly in line with the same time last year and lower than the number on temporary release six months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but he did not really answer my question.  I was not talking about people on temporary release as part of a training programme.  I was talking about the people who are being permanently released because of overcrowding in our prisons.  Would the Minister not agree that the Government's policy in this area is failing?  Is he aware that over the last couple of weeks the population in Mountjoy Prison rose to over 600 when the accommodation is, at best, for somewhere in the region of 488?  Is the Minister not aware that the Government's lack of policy in relation to alternatives to custody is being seriously interfered with as a result of the reduction in the level of funding for the Probation and Welfare Service and the community services orders in the Estimates for 1989?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problem referred to by the Deputy.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that there are constitutional difficulties in relation to any proposal to limit the circumstances in which bail may be granted and I am advised that the approach suggested in the question is unlikely to get around this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the law relating to bail has been strengthened by the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which provides that a sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed by a person on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed or about to be passed on him for <Col N="1602" /> a previous offence.  The operation of the relevant provisions in the 1984 Act is being monitored and should they not prove to be effective I will give further consideration to what action might be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the new procedures are being monitored, but is he not aware that with a 26 per cent crime detection rate criminals are willing to take the chance of not being detected, not facing a court and, therefore, not facing consecutive sentences?  Would he not consider that the essence of the problem is that there is nobody, neither the criminal nor his bail surety, who has to take responsibility for his behaviour between the time he is charged and his trial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this area causes great concern in the community.  As I said, the question of the consecutive sentences and their impact is being monitored. There is information available on this at this stage.  In 1983 the number of offences committed by persons on bail was 8,295; in 1984 the figure was 6,338 and up to 9 December 1988 the figure was 2,414.  Since there has been a consistent drop from that figure of 8,295 in 1983 it appears the message has got across.  I am sure Deputies will be interested in this fact because there was all-party agreement that this was a very important step. It is heartening to see that consecutive sentences could have such an impact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is giving figures which indicate a downward trend, but the point should be made that that is only a quarter of the offences which have been committed on bail, because they are only the offences which have been detected and prosecuted. Would the Minister give an assurance that this particularly thorny problem, which, as he admits, is of real concern to the public at large, will be referred to the Law Reform Commission to establish a realistic method within the Constitution of dealing with the problem of crimes committed on bail?</P>

    <P> 13.&mdash;(1)  The expenses of and incidental to an investigation by an inspector appointed by the court under the foregoing provisions of this Act shall be defrayed in the first instance by the Minister for Justice but the court may direct that any person being&mdash;</P>

    <P>(3)  The report of an inspector may, if he thinks fit, and shall, if the court so directs, include a recommendation as to the directions (if any) which he thinks appropriate, in the light of his investigation, to be given under subsection (1).&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I understand Deputy Charles McCreevy reported progress and is in possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was welcoming the new amendment 10a put down by the Minister to effectively scrap section 13 as in the Bill at present.  I recognise the Minister is attempting to put in a complete new section to get over a problem which was raised on the last day when we were discussing the expenses of the investigation.  The section as it stands gives rise to the following problems.  I think the best way to explain this is to give an example of what I envisage will happen when the investigation takes place and the inspector is appointed.  We will say the shareholders of XYZ company apply to the court under section 7 for the appointment of an inspector and the court grants that.  When the court is granting the appointment of an inspector to carry out the functions, the applicant will have to put forward some security of money, bonds or whatever, as provided for under section 7, of a sum not exceeding £200,000.  Take it that the court decides that a bond must be put forward by the applicant for the appointment of the inspector of, say, £200,000.  When the inspector has drafted his report and it is <Col N="1676" /> sent back to the court, criminal prosecution may result from this report and some people involved in the company may be brought to trial charged with various misdeeds or wrongdoings and may be convicted of offences.  Under the section as it stands the expenses of the whole investigation are to be borne in the first instance by the Minister for Justice. When the whole report is completed and prosecutions are initiated against various people and the costs of the investigation come to, say, £500,000, under the present section if those people are convicted of offences the court can decide that they should contribute a certain proportion of the costs.  If it happens that they cannot pay up or are not in a position to meet those costs, even though the court decided that the applicant who had put up the security then had to pay only £50,000 and the other people could pay nothing, The Minister for Justice could still have the bond estreated up to the sum of £200,000.</P>
      <P>We can almost take it for granted that most of the applications for this will be from people who suffered loss before the whole proceedings commenced in the first place.  That seemed an innocuous section.  The Minister here is trying to meet the problems put forward when we were discussing that last week, and I suppose this goes some way towards it.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) of the amendment provides that:</P>
      <P>The report of an inspector may, if the thinks, and shall, if the court so directs, include a recommendation as to the directions (if any) which he thinks appropriate, in the light of his investigation, to be given under subsection (1). </P>
      <P>We can take it then that the inspector in a practical case would probably say in his report who he thought should be liable for the cost of this investigation.  Presumably then the court will, under subsection (1), direct the various bodies to pay certain proportions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the difficulty I see with subsection (1) is that only two kinds of bodies are mentioned there after the Minister <Col N="1677" /> for Justice has been liable for the costs in the first place, namely, the company themselves or the applicant.  The applicant may have brought these matters to the light of the inspector, the inspector was appointed and he completed his report.  Arising from his report a number of other creditors, members of the company, or X, Y or Z could benefit as a result.  The only people who are going to bear the costs of all this are the people who brought the application in the first place, but everyone else could benefit at the same time.  Would it not be possible to provide that the inspector may include a recommendation under subsection (3) as to who else might benefit from an investigation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If, under subsection (2) (c), a person got damages or property, arising from this investigation in the court, such persons would have to pay the costs as well.  The amount cannot be greater than one-tenth of the compensation they got.</P>

      <P>Two points occur to me.  The word &ldquo;repay&rdquo; where it appears at the beginning of the last paragraph of subsection (1) seems inappropriate.  The wording &ldquo;to repay the Minister for Justice&rdquo; all or part of the money seems to be wrong drafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, and I ask the Minister to take this on board seriously, if you get an award of damages of, say, £100,000 and that made you liable in theory to contribute 10 per cent of it, which would be £10,000, you can be ordered to pay the £10,000 by virtue of having the damages awarded to you.  However, it is one thing to have the damages awared to you; it is a different thing to have them paid and to collect them.  The court is only entitled to make the order at the time it awards the damages, but if the court says that I, for instance, have to pay 10 per cent of an award by way of indemnification to the Minister, I may be ordered to pay that money to the Minister but I may <Col N="1678" /> have no chance at all of doing so due to some problem about recovering the remaining 90 per cent.  Is that fair?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of an investigation in the context of summary proceedings. We have given some consideration to that matter in drafting our amendment.  It may have been the wording in section 57 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 which caused the problems which led to Mr. Justice Hamilton rendering the section unconstitutional in the case of <i>Cullem v. AG</i> in <i>The Irish Reports,</i> 1979.  The section was very clear in its infliction of a punishment on a person convicted.  The requirement to pay compensation was stated in the section to be &ldquo;in addition to any other punishment&rdquo;. Therefore, while we have yet to confirm our view on that finally, I am fairly satisfied that the wording in the section is in no way intended as an intentional, as it were, penal deprivation of property, to quote from the case of <i>Conroy v. AG, The Irish Reports,</i> 1965.  I would like to confirm that position by Report Stage but I am fairly happy at this stage that we are clear of this difficulty.  However, I appreciate the Deputy's raising it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised some points about the number of courts and so on. We may have covered that by providing that the Minister for Justice or the applicant or a body corporate can be refunded, but the Deputy may have a point about the manner in which the subsequent proceedings are to be dealt with.  I will have to give that some more thought also.  The Deputies have suggested trying to get more of this done in one court rather than have a number of proceedings, but it will not be that simple because some are in the civil area and some in the criminal <Col N="1679" /> area and there would perhaps be different levels of court.  I will have to give more thought to tidying that up.  What we are trying to do here is put some order on the procedures.  If that leads to a second or third court case, offhand I have no neat way of preventing that.  I will have a close look at it between now and the next Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell asked about the word &ldquo;repay&rdquo; and I accept his views in regard to it.  We will tidy up the wording in the subsection between now and Report Stage.  I take his point about &ldquo;awards&rdquo; not being the same as &ldquo;collection&rdquo;. However, the intention is clear, that the times will coincide.  I will have to look at that matter between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;any other punishment&rdquo; that appears in that section of the Road Traffic Act also appeared in relation to disqualifications.  It was held by the Supreme Court not to mean that it was penal in nature.  I am referring to one losing a licence.  The relevant section states that one can lose a licence in addition to any other punishment, and the Supreme Court, rather surprisingly, arrived at the view that that did not apply, that it was a punishment to lose a licence. It may be that the Cullen case is not as straight-forward as it appears.</P>

      <P>These investigations may cost a lot of money and may drag on for one or two years.  In the meantime the inspector may have to make payments to third parties, experts and so on.  Will superior court rulings be drawn up indicating how those people will be reimbursed as the investigations progress?  If an investigation lasts for one year the sum for expenses and fees will be very big.  In the case of liquidations and receiverships experts are paid out of the assets and funds of the company but it does not appear that that will happen in the case of investigations.  An inspector when appointed will not control the company. Will professional witnesses have to wait until the end of the investigation, which may take 12 months or 18 months, for payment?  If that is the case very few <Col N="1681" /> experts, or firms, will be in a position to take on such work.</P>

      <P>The section should allow for the making of payments on account as the investigation proceeds. This is a different type of procedure to liquidations and receiverships.  A liquidator or receiver has control over the assets and funds of a company and they may apply to the court for payment on account.  Under this legislation an inspector will be asked to investigate many of the activities of companies but without having control over the assets.  I accept that the costs will be defrayed by the Minister for Justice at the end of the investigation but if it takes two years to complete we should make provision to pay the experts on account.  An inspector would not be able to fund himself as he proceeds with the investigation.  I should like to appeal to the Minister to consider this matter between now and Report Stage.  If payments are not made on account to the inspector and third parties employed by the inspector to carry out work on his behalf there will be few experts anxious to participate in lengthy investigations.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (2) (c), line 3 after &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in the light of activities or possible future activities of the company which the Minister shall specify&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This section deals with the investigation of the ownership of a company. This is not a power related to the formal investigation that we have been talking about in the last few sections.  It is simply a free standing power on the part of the Minister to inquire who owns particular shares in a company.  There are three grounds under which he can inquire as to who owns the shares in a company, one is for the effective administration of the law in respect of companies.  There is absolutely no doubt but that the Minister should be well able to use the power in that circumstance.  Another is for the effective discharge by the Minister of his functions under my enactment.  While that is a much wider power it is reasonable. For example, the Minister might want this information for the exercise of his powers under the mergers legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or insurance, as Deputy McDowell has rightly reminded me.  Again, that is not unreasonable, it is broad commercial law.  The power is also being taken that the Minister in the public interest can obtain this information.  Perhaps the Minister can cite various authorities and so on regarding the public interest but the public interest seems to me to be essentially what the Minister as a politician decides is a good enough reason.  If it is good enough politically <Col N="1684" /> for the Minister he can inquire into the ownership of the shares of a particular company.  It could be done potentially for partisan political purposes.  For one reason or another a Minister might not like a particular company.  He might suspect that one of his political opponents owned shares in that company and that his political opponent was not disclosing the fact that he owned those shares and he might decide that it was in the public interest &mdash; which is so broad that it has the most elastic meaning &mdash; that he should find this out.  It is a kind of a fishing expedition for information.  That is some thing that is not particularly desirable and that is the reason I suggest in my amendment that the Minister should be required to specify exactly what he thinks the company might be liable to be doing wrong, as stated in the amendment:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;in the light of activities or possible future activities of the company which the Minister shall specify&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>In other words the Minister could not go to court off the top of his head looking for the names of owners of a particular company; either he would have to do it because he needed the information to enforce company law, because he needed it for some other enactment or because he was worried about something the company were going to do which he should specify.  He should not be able to do this just in the public interest which could mean anything and which would be an entirely subjective judgment of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a sense I know one will naturally be suspicious about who owns shares in companies if people deliberately choose to cover up the true ownership of a company. One would be inclined to suspect that there was something amiss.  That might tend to be more frequently the case in the matter of public liability companies. In private companies people might have perfectly ordinary reasons for not wishing to disclose the ownership of the shares.  I think it is right in certain circumstances that they should be forced to do so but I wonder if the Minister <Col N="1685" /> should be free to do it on such broad grounds as are contained in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Deputy has raised this point on Second Stage and I appreciate his concern.  I see his point that the Minister of the day might be influenced other than by the most desirable motives to appoint an inspector but I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that there could be a number of circumstances in which the Minister might use this power although, in fairness, I cannot see them arising very often. Having said that the type of cases where I think it would arise would be if, perhaps, the Minister suspected that the company concerned were being used as a front for illegal operations of one kind or another, for example, trafficking in drugs or the use of companies by illegal organisations.  Cases might arise where the IDA, say, had substantially grant aided a company, but following a takeover or some other similar circumstance, the Minister wished to know who controlled the company.  They are some examples of what we would have in mind in this section dealing with the question of, &ldquo;in the public interest.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I take on board the Deputy's general concern.  I am very sympathetic to the aim of his amendment but I am not entirely happy with the wording he proposes.  For example, I do not see what benefit would be served by the Minister specifying the activities of the company which led him to appoint an inspector in these cases. Indeed, in some of the cases I have mentioned already by way of the three examples I have given, the very specification by the Minister of the activities which led him to appoint an inspector in the first place, could turn out to be counter-productive.  Arguably, it could forewarn some operators as to what the Minister had in mind.  Requiring the Minister to specify the activities concerned would not itself seem to serve any public cause since I assume there would not normally be any publicity attached to the appointment of an inspector under this section.  I would not envisage it being a matter of publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> The Deputy has legitimate concerns regarding this section.  If he wishes me to pin down what I mean by &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo; then I would like to do so on Report Stage by bringing forward a Government amendment on the subject. Incidentally, another reason I should do it that way is that in section 15 (1) (c), the words &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo; also appear and we would have to deal with it at that point also.  I would say yes in principle to the amendment but reject the actual wording.  I will bring forward a Government amendment which will meet the Deputy's concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says.  The three cases he mentioned are all reasonable but they are all circumstances which arise under an Act of the Oireachtas, not necessarily an Act for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible.  Perhaps we could get rid of the public interest element altogether by extending paragraph (b) to include for the effective discharge by the Minister of his functions under any enactment or at the request of another Member of the Government for the effective discharge of functions attributable to him under an Act of the Oireachtas for which he is responsible. Perhaps that would be a way round it. There is something to be said for tying it to an actual responsibility which a Minister has and not to allow for a purely subjective judgment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies it strikes me that the phrase &ldquo;that the Minister is satisfied&rdquo; is one which is an objective test and that if the Minister decided entirely subjectively and arbitrarily that something was in the public interest it would be subject to judicial review and could be quashed and an <Col N="1687" /> order made by the Minister.  That phrase has been held in a number of cases to actually require the Minister to arrive at an objectively justifiable judgment which can be set aside if there are not reasonable grounds for his being satisfied.  Those two points are covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell has given a sufficient answer to that question. There is a provision contained in the Bill which would allow a judicial review to take place in cases where the Minister has to be satisfied in regard to a certain aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <P>The fact that an aggrieved party can go to court to vindicate himself in respect of something which has been done by the Minister is not sufficient justification for enacting sloppy legislation.  We should try to specify when exactly we envisage the Minister using this power rather than waiting for the court to decide on this matter on a case by case basis.  In any event, it is desirable in a matter of this kind that the Oireachtas should give some guidance to the court as to when it is envisaged and the circumstances in which the Minister would use this power.  While I have been reassured by what Deputy McDowell said, a few points remain to be looked at and I take it that notwithstanding what Deputy McDowell has said the Minister will look at this issue to see if the legislation can be tightened up and made more precise.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(b)  to be filed with the Registrar of Companies&rdquo;.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present when the Minister imposes restrictions on shares or debentures under this section he is required to have a notice of this direction sent to the company so that it would know what it may or may not do and to have a notice of this direction published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in at least two daily newspapers.  This amendment seeks to place a requirement on the Minister to have a notice of this direction filed with the office of the Registrar of Companies which has been substantially automated and which will be used to an increasing extent by those in business who wish to obtain information. Clearly, potential purchasers would need to know that restrictions have been imposed on shares or debentures and if they are to rely on the company to supply them with that information or on the fact that they are regular and assiduous readers of <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> or of all the statutory notices in the daily newspapers, there is a danger that that information may not be made available to them.  It is possible that people may want that information long after the time when the notice appears in the newspapers.  It would be much better if the information was available at some central location where people could easily locate it.  That is why I suggest that the office of the <Col N="1690" /> Registrar of Companies should be added to the list of places where the Minister would have to submit this information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put one or two questions to the Minister of State. In subsection (1) the Minister would be given power to impose restrictions on the transfer of shares.  Let me quote subsection (1):</P>
      <P>Where in connection with an investigation or inquiry under section 14 or 15 it appears to the Minister that there is difficulty in finding out the relevant facts about any shares (whether issued or to be issued), the Minister may by notice in writing direct that the shares shall until further notice be subject to the restrictions imposed by this section. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are different types of shares in most companies and if difficulty arises in finding out information about a particular type of share it appears that the restriction will be confined only to that type of share.  That seems to be the plain interpretation of this section.  I should like the Minister to look at this section because it is easy to envisage circumstances where difficulties could arise and where the restriction would not be imposed on the <Col N="1692" /> transfer of other types of shares in the company.</P>
    <P>Section 16 (2) (a) states that any transfer of those shares &mdash; that is the shares on which the restriction is based &mdash; shall be void.  Will the Minister confirm that the word &ldquo;void&rdquo; means totally inoperative, in other words that even bona fide purchasers for value without notice will not in effect acquire the legal or beneficial ownership of those shares in the case of a transfer?</P>
    <P>Section 16 (6) states: &ldquo;Subject to subsections (7) and (13), an order of the court or a direction of the Minister that shares shall cease to be subject to the restrictions imposed by this section may be made only if...&rdquo;.  In other words, an order of the court lifting a restriction placed on the transfer of shares may only be made in two circumstances &mdash; if the court or Minister is satisfied that the relevant facts about the shares have been disclosed to the company and no unfair advantage has accrued to any person. The person who is affected by the restriction on the transfer of shares may not be the person who has gained the unfair advantage.  Having regard to that point the Minister should have another look at the subsection and perhaps we can talk further about it when he has commented on what I have said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 16 (17) applies this section to debentures as it applies in relation to shares.  Does this mean that a freezing order made by the Minister catches debentures as well as shares?  I wrote to the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, about one point in relation to this &mdash; some securities of companies, including promissory notes of banks, are defined as debentures.  They are a security but there is a problem with their tradability, and prospectuses apply in relation to them. Suppose one of the big banks issued floating rate notes which are classified as debentures, as the law presently stands, could this have the effect of making bearer bonds frozen in the hands of various people?  I would be worried about that possibility.  I wrote to the Minister <Col N="1693" /> about this possibility and I thought I was getting a reasonably sympathetic reading of my letter.  Does the Minister propose to make bearer bonds of banks exempt from the provisions of the Companies Act in relation to prospectuses and the like?  I know this issue does not immediately arise under this section but it could have a bearing on this section.  If the Minister does not propose to introduce an amendment on Report Stage would he indicate what his attitude would be to an amendment to that effect tabled by me or any other Member of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton asked me for an example of when we might need this section.  All I can say to the Deputy is that the section is included in the Bill because the Minister may have difficulty in finding out the facts about shares &mdash; whether they have been issued or have to be issued &mdash; and he may require to know who owns the shares.  If somebody anticipates that the Minister may move, they may start to unload shares, transfer shares or attach voting rights to shares which might frustrate the inquiry.  They may issue further shares which may dilute the holding of an existing shareholder or they might start to make payment of sums out in anticipation of a move by the Minister.  If there is any suspicion on the Minister's part that somebody may be engaging in such transactions in order to head off what the Minister may wish to do, the Minister may move in and impose these restrictions on the shares.  It is in that kind of context we would use the section.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy O'Dea's point, we would envisage these restrictions being used selectively.  The Minister may put restrictions on one of these aspects but he may not necessarily put restrictions across the board.  He may put the restrictions on debentures or further shares being issued and the restrictions would apply selectively and would depend on what classes of shares were in existence.  They may be voting shares, non-voting shares, preference shares&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister put <Col N="1694" /> restrictions only on the classes of shares about which he cannot get facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with instances where he has difficulty getting facts about shares so he would use it only where he has difficulty in getting facts.  Therefore, if he knew all the classes of shares except one he would need it only in that one case and use it in that one case.  I am satisfied that the Minister will use section 16 only in cases where he cannot get information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is desirable. One can envisage cases where a lack of knowledge about one particular class of shares in a company can give rise to difficulties if another class of shares in the same company are transferred.  In effect, the Minister's powers under this section should be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look at that point but I am happy at this stage that section 16 will be used only where there is difficulty in finding out the relevant facts about any shares.  The restriction will be placed in cases where there are difficulties in finding out the facts and nowhere else.  Section 16 (1) states that where there is difficulty in finding out the relevant facts about any shares the Minister may by notice in writing direct that the shares shall until further notice be subject to certain restrictions.  This section is targeted only at those shares about which the Minister has difficulty in obtaining facts and he would not go beyond that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give that some thought but I believe the section should be confined to the area where the Minister has difficulty.  It should not be extended across the board because that would throw it open much too wide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea referred to section 16 (2) (a).  I will have another look at this subsection.  On the surface the Deputy was right in his remarks about that section <Col N="1695" /> but I will have to think further about it. I want to confirm that the word &ldquo;void&rdquo; in subsection (2) (a) means totally void.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to section 16 (17) which states that this section shall apply in relation to debentures as it applies in relation to shares.  What we have in mind here is that the section will apply either to a debenture or to shares depending on the area of difficulty.  That leads me to the Deputy's other point which was very complicated and one which gets increasingly confusing as the financial industry hots up.  I understand the Deputy to be talking about debenture-type paper and financial instruments which are continually being created. Some of this is equity-like and some is interest bearing and not risk related.  We had originally intended putting something in at the end of the Bill about this whole area.  Since the Deputy has raised the matter, I should like to look at it very carefully.  It is not a simple question.  The usual areas of ownership and involvement are covered but they are continually devising a plethora of new financial instruments.  We will have to figure out how to lock those in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to put down as an amendment to the general Part at the end of the Act an amendment to the definition of &ldquo;debenture&rdquo; so as to exclude securities intended to be traded in as money, as interest bearing notes in international exchanges.  Some of the big financial institutions here are facing the difficulty that if they issue a letter offering these floating rate notes, either nationally or internationally, it amounts to a prospectus and on a strict interpretation of the law they could be committing an offence. We should get the law in order so as to permit them to compete with other banks.  The law in Britain has been changed to allow the issue of that kind of debenture without prospectus laws applying. Our institutions should not be at a disadvantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gives very wide powers to the Minister and I understand completely the purpose of these powers.  As the Minister pointed out in reply to Deputy O'Dea, the section is pursuant to actions under sections 14 and 15 which enable the Minister to inquire as to the ownership of shares.  It is a very wide section which covers all kinds of possibilities.  If the Minister cannot get satisfactory answers under sections 14 and 15, it is only then that section 16 follows on.  Section 16 (1) relates back to sections 14 and 15.  If the Minister is not satisfied under these two sections and then makes an order under section 16 declaring all transactions in those shares to be null and void, it will not be of any great benefit.  I am in favour of the powers given to the Minister from subsection (2) to the end of section 16, but we must remember that the section is pursuant to sections 14 and 15 relating to the ownership of shares.  Is it necessary to include subsection (1)?  Let us suppose that information came overnight to the Minister that something terribly dangerous was going on to do with one company.  The Stock Exchange would probably suspend trading in the shares if the problem came to light but that would not prevent private transactions.  The Minister and his advisers might consider using section 16, but in my opinion he would be unable to do so if he had not already made initial inquiries under sections 14 and 15 regarding ownership.  I understand that section 16 comes into play only as a result of unsatisfactory inquiries under sections 14 and 15 and the Minister's not being able to find out about the shares.  All the powers given under section 16 are very necessary but they would not be used. The horse would have bolted before they could come into effect.  Is it necessary to include subsection (1)?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to have a fairly targeted Bill.  Sections 14 and 15 deal with the powers to investigate the ownership of shares and debentures.  In <Col N="1697" /> the context of seeking information about ownership, a person might seek to prevent the satisfactory conclusion of an inquiry by transferring shares or interfering with voting rights and the payment of money.  In order to prevent that the Minister may wish to direct that these matters be frozen.  I take Deputy McCreevy's point that this is a good power which should be extended across the board.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister on the broad issue of the level of interference which should be tolerated.  I find it difficult to see when section 16 will come into play.  If it can be used only when activities are being carried out under sections 14 and 15, it will not be of any use.  The general purpose of the section is very good.  I accept that the power of a Minister to suspend trading in shares is a totally different matter. Section 16 is subordinate to sections 14 and 15.</P>

      <P>To get over the bolting horse syndrome, perhaps it might be possible to alter the wording in the second line of section 16 by deleting &ldquo;is&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;may be&rdquo;.  The Minister could then act where it appears to him that there may be difficulty in finding out the relevant facts about any shares.  This would enable the Minister to act under sections 14 and 15 and simultaneously to put a restriction under section 16.</P>

      <P>It is a very detailed section and it is important to point out that where the Minister can so direct, an aggrieved party can apply to the courts to have the order restricted.  At the end of the day it will be up to the courts to make a decision and if the Minister's action is found to be unreasonable the court will not agree to it.  Under section 11 the person who sells the shares will have to pay for the cost of the court case.  Maybe the section will be used quite frequently but there are adequate safeguards for a person applying to a court if he feels aggrieved or under duress.  I do not think the Minister can make an unreasonable request because if he did so the court would just throw it out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On reflection, the coverage of section 17 is too wide at present.  For example, it is not appropriate or practical to apply sections 14 to 16, which deal with investigations of share ownership, to overseas companies.  In re-examining the question of scope I thought it might be preferable to look at the question the other way round, in other words what provisions of Part II do we want to apply to such companies.  The answer I came up with is that we certainly need the sections mentioned in the amendment, as well as sections 19 to 21.  It is not necessary to <Col N="1700" /> include sections 19 to 21 in the amendment because these automatically apply to foreign companies by virtue of section 19 (1) (e) of the Bill.  The sections in Part II which would not, following the insertion of this amendment, apply to the companies involved are sections 7, 12, 14 to 16 and 23.  That is the intention of this provision.</P>

If the Minister's amendment is passed am I right in saying that the section will read: Sections 8 to 11, 13, 18 and 22 shall apply to all bodies corporate... That is not what the Minister said but I think that is his intention.  Will that be the reading of the section or has the Minister something else in mind?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 30, after &ldquo;modifications.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The Minister shall place a report each year before both Houses of the Oireachtas outlining the steps he has taken in bilateral contacts with other States to ensure the effective implementation of this section.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This section deals with bodies operating in the State which are incorporated outside the State.  During the course of my contribution on Second Stage of this Bill I made quite an issue of the fact that there is a danger that much of this legislation would be simply side-stepped by companies who would incorporate themselves in countries where company law legislation is more lax than it is here.  I referred in particular to the position in the Isle of Man where, as a result of recent changes in the legislation there, a number of regulations covering private companies which previously existed there have been abolished, particularly that which restricts the transferability of shares and limits the maximum number of members of a private company to 50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These latter provisions make it possible for the formation of what are known as bearer share companies, private companies with freely transferable shares in bearer form.  Private companies, either with bearer or registered shares, do not have to file accounts any more in the public registry or elsewhere in the Isle of Man.  If those freedoms exist in regard to the way in which companies can operate in the Isle of Man, it will be extremely attractive for people who want nothing to do with this legislation to incorporate themselves in that country.  This route also may be sought by people who have avoided their tax liabilities.  They will find ways of incorporating themselves in the <Col N="1702" /> Isle of Man and will become employees here of a company which they own but which company is located somewhere else.  They will have a very comfortable existence in the sense that they will be able to move from one jurisdiction to another.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that this is happening on a fairly large scale.  It frustrates not just the administration of company law but also the administration of taxation. People can dissolve companies that are Irish owned, leaving debts to many people including the Revenue.  They then incorporate themselves in the Isle of Man and continue to work here as employees of an Isle of Man company.  The Isle of Man is not part of the European Community even though it is very close and accessible to us.  It is not subject to any of the decisions that are taken by the European Community in regard to the harmonisation of company law.  I am sure there are considerable attractions for people to pursue that route.</P>
    <P>This section rather optimistically says that a limited number of sections now will apply to bodies incorporated outside the State but doing business here.  I must confess that I do not know exactly how the Minister can avoid this type of thing happening.  I am not pretending that the amendment I am putting forward here provides an answer.  What my amendment does is to ask the Minister to report each year &mdash; in the companys' report which he is obliged to provide to the House &mdash; on the steps he is taking in bilateral contacts with other States, to ensure the effective implementation of the provisions of this section.  In other words, I want the Minister to come back here each year and say how he is getting on in getting information from other countries about companies located there but which are operating substantially here.  If the Minister is obliged to report periodically to the House on that it will throw into the public arena for debate the type of difficulties the Minister may be encountering.  Indeed it will act as an encouragement to the Minister and the House to find solutions to any practical <Col N="1703" /> difficulties he may be experiencing in ensuring that our company law or other legislation is not evaded by people simply incorporating in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that is causing quite an amount of concern in regard to the harmonisation of legislation and the free internal market in 1992.  A lot of people are worried that &mdash; on account of the freedom to provide services from one country to another &mdash; what we will have is competitive laxity of regulation.  In other words, countries will seek to attract business to their part of the EC &mdash; leaving Isle of Man companies out of it &mdash; by being relatively more lax in regard to company law and other requirements than competitor nations within the EC. That is something we need to monitor on a continuous basis.  That is why I have suggested in this amendment that the Minister should deal with this in the annual report he will present to the House.</P>
    <P>I have a general amendment tabled, No. 109, which I do not think we will reach this evening, which deals with companies annual reports in more general terms, requiring the Minister to report on certain matters in that report.  Certainly this issue of enforcement &mdash; where companies are operating in one country and are domiciled in another &mdash; and the general question of competitive laxity of regulation are issues on which the Minister should be asked to report each year in the now rather delayed report on companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Deputy Bruton is trying to get at in his amendment.  The purpose of the whole section is that there be an extension of the Minister's powers of investigation to certain bodies incorporated outside the State.  In the amendment we have just passed the Minister has already amended this section, recognising the lack of authority he could have in investigating the ownership of shares of bodies incorporated outside the State.  As the Minister said earlier: how would we investigate the ownership of companies <Col N="1704" /> incorporated outside the State?  In the past couple of years there have been innumerable EC directives published, the whole idea of which is to harmonise various company law.  The last Companies' Bill passed in this House was during the term of office of Deputy John Bruton as Minister for Industry and Commerce. That had to do with the implementation of the EC directive which required all limited liability companies to file their accounts in the Companies' Registration Office.  I think we were in danger of being prosecuted by the EC for not having implemented that directive.</P>
      <P>I have always contended that various laws and directives proposed by the EC to apply to every member state may not be appropriate to a small community such as ours at any given time.  I made that point rather forcibly on that Bill about the filing of company accounts.  I do not agree with uniform company law throughout the EC.  I know that may appear to be flying in the face of the objective of the internal market and so on.  I do not think &mdash; and I am on record as having said so consistently &mdash; that all EC laws and directives are necessarily appropriate or proper for us.</P>
      <P>I do not think the provisions of Deputy Bruton's amendment will enhance the powers of this section except that each year the Minister will have to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas as to how these provisions are being implemented.</P>
      <P>I presume that, in years to come, we will be introducing another Companies' Bill on account of further EC directives to, say, limit Irish law or in order to have everything known about all companies incorporated within the EC.  I am not a great believer in that either.  As Deputy Bruton has pointed out, the reality is that we are very close to the Isle of Man.  Far be it for me to contend that people would avoid or evade their taxes by forming companies outside the State but, because of the nature of my work, I readily recognise that possibility and the fact that that practice may well continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from places like the Isle of Man, which is adjacent to us, particularly in the case of multi-national companies it is <Col N="1705" /> often very difficult to ascertain the true ownership of a company or the manner in which shares are held.  Often many individuals form companies primarily for the purpose of tax avoidance, that is companies incorporated outside the State in, say, the Isle of Man, the Cayman Islands or wherever where it may be legitimate practice to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment proposes that the Minister should report each year to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I see nothing wrong with that.  I do not know what it will achieve except perhaps to highlight the inadequacies of the provisions of this Bill.  Since the Minister's amendment was passed it means we are focusing on the sections over which we have some control, recognising the inadequacy of the powers available to us.</P>

      <P>In regard to companies incorporated outside the State I should say that the Eleventh EC Directive will require all foreign companies with branches within the country to lodge their accounts.  I gather that directive is well advanced now.  As Deputies probably know, under the provisions of the 1963 Act, we require foreign public companies to file their accounts in the Companies Registration Office.  But the Directive applies to all companies.  I understand that the philosophy behind that Directive is to prevent companies from moving out and then moving back into the State through a branch, as it were, specifically for the purposes of avoiding disclosure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the philosophy behind the Directive.  The Eleventh Directive and the 1963 legislation apply to all foreign companies which have branches in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's amendment, the section as it stands would simply apply the provisions of Part II of the Bill to foreign companies carrying on business here as if they were Irish companies.  By virtue of the amendment <Col N="1706" /> which we have just discussed, we have reduced the scope of the section somewhat, to apply to foreign companies only those sections which it is practicable to apply.  The type of case in which this section is likely to arise is where a foreign company are carrying on business here by means of a branch.  In such cases an inspector could be appointed to investigate the affairs of the branch.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, this section goes further and would enable the investigation to extend to the actual overseas registered company itself.  However, we would have to accept that it is simply not practical from the legal point of view that an inspector appointed by the Irish courts could expect to be able to investigate on the territory of a foreign sovereign state the activities of a company which is registered there.  We could not go down that road.  This procedure is more likely to come about in due course in general terms by means of agreed multilateral treaties, conventions and so on, whether under the aegis of the EC, the Council of Europe or some other international body.  I have already mentioned the forthcoming Eleventh Directive.</P>
    <P>If it were to become apparent that there was a growing number of investigations into the affairs of companies registered in a particular foreign country, it would be correct at that stage to develop bilateral contacts with the country involved to see whether some aid procedure could be worked out.  I could not see this as being a significant problem. I could not agree to the requirement that the Minister report annually to the Oireachtas on contacts because these contacts may or may not arise.  It would not be sensible to lay that requirement on a Minister when it is probably unlikely to arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  My amendment was put down before the Minister's so I did not have sight of the more restricted application of section 17 that he now has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that I understand the Minister's reaction to the more general point made about Isle of Man companies <Col N="1707" /> in particular.  We have a real problem with the Isle of Man, in that it is not part of the EC and we have no diplomatic representation there.  Increasingly, its legislation is diverging from the legislation in Britain and we have no means of pursuing any bilateral arrangements with the Isle of Man that I am aware of, other than through Westminster.  It seems that this will be an increasing problem in the Community in general.  There is the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey and Sark which are not part of the EC and yet are attached to one part of the EC. There is another place which has a similar characteristic and that is Greenland, which is not part of the EC although it comes under the Danish Crown. However, that is not a problem because Greenland is so far away that it is unlikely that people would be incorporating companies there.  I could see much of this going on elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This may not be the section under which to bring up this matter.  Probably the better course for me to adopt would be to put this more general requirement about reporting on bilateral enforcement of company law into the requirements placed on the Minister in regard to the annual report which he must present each year.  Would the Minister in general terms be agreeable to the idea that the Minister should be required to report annually on problems arising in respect of bilateral and multilateral enforcement of company law?  Would he accept that sort of approach here which would mean dealing with this matter much later in the Bill rather than under this section where it is probably a little tangential?</P>

      <P>The question does not apply only to the Isle of Man.  There are Gibraltar, Liechtenstein and a whole host of tax haven type regimes.  That the Isle of Man is the closest to us is what causes the Deputy to bring it up.  It is a larger question than that.  There is no ready or immediate answer on what we can do there.  Public companies with branches there are all accountable under the Acts.</P>

There will be individual Irish people changing their domicile by going to live abroad for some time of the year, who will incorporate their companies somewhere else but will spend large parts of the year and derive large parts of their business from activities here.  There will be a tremendous capacity for people effectively to be earning their money here but being governed by legislation from the Isle of Man, or Guernsey, or Gibraltar, or wherever. This will be an increasing problem that the Minister and public administration generally will have to address.  I accept that the Minister says there is no ready answer to it.  I know that only too well. The purpose of my amendment is that the Minister at least should be obliged to report on this subject to the Oireachtas on a reasonably regular basis so that there will be more information and ultimately out of that debate we will discover methods of dealing more effectively with the problem.</P>

Private <Col N="1709" /> companies registered in the Isle of Man do not have the accounting requirement here, but have to report other basic information under the 1963 Act such as directors, shareholders and so on.  They do not have to report their accounts.  I understand, however, that the Eleventh Directive when applied here will take in not just the EC but foreign companies operating here through branches.  I trust that that Directive will substantially allay the worries expressed.</P>

      <P>In page 22, subsection (5), lines 21 and 22, to delete &ldquo;and liable to a fine not exceeding £1,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a straightforward amendment which simply involves raising the penalty for non-compliance with the direction of the Minister under this section to produce documents and so on.  A maximum fine of £1,000 is paltry in view of the level of penalties under the Bill generally and the specific nature of the offence under this section.  Deleting the words mentioned in the amendment will, of course, have the effect of applying the standard penalties in section 202 of the Bill to offences under this section which are somewhat higher. I am raising the penalty, as it were, for not producing documents under this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is concern to ensure that our competition law works effectively and that there is no collusion by companies contrary to the public interest in so far as keeping prices high is concerned.  Would there be any advantage in adding something like &ldquo;if, in the opinion of the Minister, a company is conducting its affairs in collusion with other companies in order to maintain prices charged by them to members of the public at a higher level than would apply if the company was competing freely rather than acting in collusion with another company&rdquo;?  It may be that such powers already exist under the fair trade legislation although I do not think so.

      <P>We discussed that this morning and had a row about it.  This is a very elaborate and far-reaching section. In earlier sections we were giving powers to the courts and so on and asking the Minister to inquire about the ownership of shares of a company.  This is about the production of documents.  Presumably the Minister will form an opinion and then appoint an inspector.  Many of the sections involve legal expenses in regard to applicants coming to the court and asking it to appoint an inspector but this section empowers the Minister to do this. It will be used quite often because, when a company is run down, the employees will probably know what is going on, be concerned about their jobs and write to the Minister's office.  After that, the Minister might require the company to produce documents, books, etc., and his Department would make a general appraisal of the information and, if necessary, appoint an inspector under section 7.  Will there be a separate section within the Minister's Department to do this type of work?</P>

In which case does the Minister have to prove his case without the evidence?  Would it be better to have the words &ldquo;...by the Minister if he is of opinion that there are circumstances suggesting&rdquo; so that he can get this information without necessarily having to satisfy the court that one or other of these circumstances exists?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

The Minister just cannot go and look for the information in the same way as somebody <Col N="1713" /> can look for information under a search warrant in an ordinary criminal proceeding. This occurred to me when listening to Deputy McCreevy.  I do not want to make a big deal of it, but if that is the case are we taking the teeth out of section 19 by making it more difficult for the Minister than it should be to get this sort of information?</P>
      <P>I recall to the House that I have been urging all along that section 19 is one we should be using for getting this sort of information rather than using the procedure we were discussing which involves very formalised and expensive investigations. Anything therefore, that strengthens section 19 is a good thing.  Is the Minister satisfied that he is not going to have undue difficulty in getting the sort of information he is looking for in view of the difficulty of proving fraud, which is well established in the legal field and in the problems arising from the use of the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to prevent an inspection under section 19 being frustrated by a failure to produce the books, or their removal to another premises we have this section which provides for the right under warrant to enter and search premises and seize any books found therein.  The warrant remains in force for a month.  Books so seized may be retained for either three months or until the conclusion of any criminal proceedings mentioned in section 21 which we are coming to, that is essentially prosecutions under the Companies Acts.  A penalty is provided against any person who obstructs the entry.  While it is envisaged that this power of entry will be used infrequently, it is of importance that legal provision exists to ensure rapid and effective entry to gain possession of books and documents which might be denied to the Minister or perhaps even destroyed.</P>
      <P>It should be observed that this is not an unduly draconian power.  It can be exercised only with a warrant given by a district justice and only in cases where the Minister has required the production of documents under section 19 but where these have not been produced.  As regards the Deputy's question, a district justice could give a warrant anywhere, for example in his house, in the court, or anywhere else.

      <P>Where documents are <Col N="1716" /> produced under section 19 the Minister may take copies of them or extracts from them.  If under section 20 the books of a company who are still in business are going to be seized and retained for three months it could make the legitimate operation of that company rather difficult, to say the least, if their own documentation, which they needed for normal purposes, and was not available, it had all been seized and taken away.  There should be something in this section which would require the Minister who has seized documents under this section to make available or provide copies on request of the material he has seized to the company so the company can continue to have access to the information.</P>

      <P>I see the point, but it is hard to be sympathetic where the people involved have refused to give the books. We are dealing here with circumstances where people have refused to hand over documentation under the legislation.  In that context the period might not be that long.</P>

      <P>I accept that but in Irish society there are thick people.  I have heard it said one hundred times, &ldquo;I will go to jail rather than comply.&rdquo;  Certain characters will dig their heels in and while they may be behaving in an entirely irrational and wrong way, the seizing of the documents may so paralyse the company that it will no longer be able to function.  I imagine that if an inspector invokes this section he will sieze everything from the filing cabinets.  In other words, the company would be wound up by the inspector exercising the powers of section 20 by virtue of the documents not being available to it for normal use.  I do not have any sympathy for thickness, or endorse it in any way or sympathise with those who may be found guilty of an offence.  I am recalling that what we are dealing with here is obtaining information which may or may not subsequently lead to a prosecution and where it does not the people who would be innocent would find themselves without their books and documents essential <Col N="1717" /> for the operation of the company for up to three months.  I am not saying that the Minister should not have the documents but if he takes them he should be required to produce copies or allow inspection on a regular and continuing basis by the officers of the company at a reasonably convenient location close to the company. If the company is operating in Cahirciveen it will not be of much use to it if the Minister says the documents can be inspected at the offices in Kildare Street in Dublin from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The material will have to be made available to the company at a reasonably convenient location.</P>

      <P>I accept that there is a need for the clause but what will happen to companies that voluntarily give their books to the Department or are forced to do so by an order of the court?  A company may endeavour to continue trading while the books are with the Department.  Will that company have access to the Minister's office in order to keep the business going?  If all the books are seized, or given voluntarily under section 19, what provision is there to enable a company to continue trading?  I am sure it is the intention of the Minister to allow reasonable access to the books but there is no such provision in the Bill. Those books may be retained by the Department for between six months or 12 months.  They can be held for at least three months unless it is decided to institute criminal proceedings.  The Minister will have to allow reasonable access to the books of a company that is endeavouring to continue to trade.</P>

      <P>Members should take a harder line in regard to this. We are referring to companies who refused to co-operate.  I take Deputy Bruton's point about thickness but in this case we are talking about the Minister applying to a district justice for a warrant to permit gardaí to enter a premises and take away documents.  If the Minister has to apply to the court for a warrant the case has reached a serious stage.  Are the <Col N="1718" /> Deputies suggesting that having gone through that procedure the Minister should say, &ldquo;your books are in my office if you wish to have a look at them any day and you need not worry about the court procedure&rdquo;?  We are giving people an opportunity to voluntarily produce their books and if they do not do so we have to adopt a tough line.  Otherwise we are telling companies that they need not worry because they can always have a look at the books in the Minister's office.</P>

      <P>It is reasonable for the Minister to adopt this approach if he has to apply to the courts for a warrant in order to get people to produce their books.  However, I am referring to the person who voluntarily gives up his books.  How will such a person be able to conduct his business if his books are in Kildare Street?  It may be said that I should have raised this issue on section 19 but at the time we were debating that section the Ceann Comhairle was getting a little upset at the length of time it was taking us to deal with sections.  In my view the Minister will have to insert a provision that will allow reasonable access to such documents, otherwise companies will be closed overnight.</P>

Section 20 refers to people who have refused to comply with the direction of the Minister to hand over documents and books.  I am being asked to provide in section 20 that having seized the books we will give the person permission to inspect them while they are in the possession of the Minister. It is important that there should be a clear distinction between complying with the ministerial direction and the Minister having to obtain a warrant to force people to comply with it.</P>

      <P>Could I make a suggestion here to deal with this problem? Would the Minister be agreeable to add a subsection (5) to section 20 to the effect that where documents are retained by the Minister under subsection (3), a person or company who require access to those documents for the continued operation of the company should have the power to apply to a district justice for an order governing such reasonable access by the company to their books, which these books are detained by the Minister, or, to obtain copies of all relevant information from the books which he needs for the continued operation of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will undertake to have a look at that suggestion.  I want to <Col N="1720" /> be careful not to so soften up section 20 as to make it virtually a repeat of section 19 except that the Garda are involved.  I want to make sure that this section is tough, otherwise it would be a repeat of section 19.  I take on board the point that if the books are missing the company may not be able to continue and I will try to find a way to resolve it.  I do not think that necessarily applying to the court would be the way to do it, but there may be another way.  I would not start out by having lots of sympathy for people who refuse the ministerial direction and then put the State to the trouble, through the Minister and a district justice, of having a search warrant prepared and so on.</P>

      <P>If he wants to wind up a company the Minister has the power. Before anything has been proved in court it would not be reasonable to retain the documents that belong to the company to such an extent that the company are paralysed simply by the exercise of this section.  That is not natural justice.  I would imagine that if one were to attempt to retain these documents in such a fashion as to paralyse the company under section 20, the Supreme Court ultimately would vindicate the constitutional rights of the company.  Rather than put them to that trouble it might be no harm to clarify that in the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there must be some provision in our law, even though it may not be in this Bill, for the company to apply to the court and say: &ldquo;I need my books in order to carry on my business&rdquo;. I am sure there is a law, under the common law of the land, to require that something like that be done.  It does not say it in this section but perhaps another subsection is needed.  It would be only right and proper that the company would have a right to go to the court and say: &ldquo;it is unreasonable to expect me to carry on my business without my books and records.  They have been taken away, they are in Kildare Street and I cannot get at them.  If I do not get them back in the next day or so I will be out of business&rdquo;.  If there is not a <Col N="1721" /> subsection here it would seem to be a reasonable and proper course that there should be some provision in the courts where that could be done; otherwise the law would not be a just law.  As Deputy Bruton has pointed out perhaps this kind of subsection should be added to section 20.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that if a company receive a reasonable request under section 19 and do nothing about it, thus forcing the Minister to act under section 20 in order to obtain a warrant, we should be as hard as possible on them.  One must recognise that there are many people in this country &mdash; not all in County Meath or County Kildare &mdash; who, as Deputy Bruton said, have an element of thickness about them and would say: &ldquo;Over my dead body you will get those books&rdquo;.  It might be necessary to use these powers.  If it is not provided for in ordinary laws at least there should be some provision which would allow the company to have reasonable access to their books in order to be able to carry on their business.  If they are going out of business they will not need the books and if they are involved in criminal activities they will not want to see them anymore but will hope they will be burned or lost in the meantime.  It is not unknown for books to be missing or burned.</P>

      <P>This section is about the security of information.  The main thrust of the section is in subsection (1) which states:</P>
      <P>No information, book or document, relating to a body which has been obtained under section 19 or 20 shall, without the previous consent in writing of that body, be published or disclosed, except to a competent authority, unless the publication or disclosure is required&mdash;</P>

    <P>by (a), (b), (c) and (d).  I would like to deal with the competent authority.  Apart from the items under (a), (b), (c) or (d) which are more or less about the <Col N="1723" /> institution of criminal proceedings arising out of the Companies Acts.  In subsection (2) it is stated that the books can be disclosed to a competent authority.  The competent authorities listed under subsection (3) are:</P>

    <P>(c)  an inspector appointed under this Act,</P>

    <P>(e)  an officer authorised by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I presume the purpose behind authorising the Minister for Finance or an officer authorised by the Minister for Finance to be competent authorities is to allow the Revenue Commissioners to carry out a full investigation into the tax affairs of a company.  In many of the Bills passed by this House there appears to be a cross-fertilisation of Departments in that Departments are given the right to get involved in the activities of another.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I would like to make on this section.  I am not clear as to what the purpose behind this section is.  It seems to be designed to permit, on the face of it, a copy of the inspector's report to be introduced as evidence of the opinion of the inspector in relation to any matter contained in the report and I presume that &ldquo;inspectors&rdquo; should read &ldquo;inspector&rdquo;.  Is the opinion of the inspector admissible in evidence in a court?  At present as I understand the law, evidence of opinion is receivable from an expert but the fact that one is appointed an inspector does not necessarily mean that one is an expert.  Is this replicating the existing provisions of the 1963 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be slightly vague in that an inspector's report may or may not contain expressions of opinion. Those opinions may or may not be admissible in evidence.  It could be widened to make it more useful as the court should be entitled, unless contradicted, to draw findings of fact from a report of this kind.  If an inspector says in his report that he found certain facts and that this or that event had occurred it would seem, unless contradicted, we should allow the court to accept them as findings of fact, but this section is restricted to opinion evidence. Opinion evidence, as I understand the law, can only be accepted by a court where it is proven that it comes from an expert.  Who is an expert inspector?  Is it an expert accountant or an expert solicitor and does the opinion have any weight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also suggest that on Report Stage the section should be amended to read &ldquo;a document purporting to be a copy of a report&rdquo; because one of the things one would have to prove if one wanted to produce the report in court is that it is <Col N="1727" /> a true copy.  One of the difficulties with the bankers' books evidence Act is that one has to prove that a report is a true copy before one can produce it in court and one has to bring a witness to prove that it is a true copy, whereas it would be better if it was stated that a document purporting to be a copy of the report would be admissible in evidence.  I am making two points: first, that that should be done and, secondly, that such a copy should be admissible as evidence of the facts set out therein unless contradicted. It would be a useful way of avoiding duplication of a subsequent civil proceeding if there were facts that were not an issue and which the inspector had found as facts for the purposes of his report.  The court could rely on his finding of fact rather than on his finding of opinion or statement of opinion.  That would eliminate unnecessary duplication in court evidence and would improve the Bill if it was extended in that way.</P>

      <P>In page 23, subsection (1), line 48, to delete &ldquo;sections 14 to 16 or 19 to 21&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;this Part&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill deals with investigations. Sections 7 to 13 deal with investigations under the auspices of the courts while sections 14 to 23 deal with investigations and less formal procedures under the auspices of the Minister.  The court investigations proposed in the Bill replace similar provisions in sections 165 to 173 of the 1963 Act.  Section 173 of the Principal Act included a saver for privileged communication by a solicitor. Section 10 (6) of the Bill defines an agent as including &ldquo;bankers and solicitors of the company&rdquo;.  Whereas section 23 (1) retains and indeed widens the saver for legal professional privilege in the case of investigations and so on initiated by the Minister, no such privilege is available for court-initiated investigations.  It is considered that such privilege should be available in the extended format provided by section 23 (1).  In order to achieve this it is now proposed to replace the specified sections in section 23 with reference to the Part as a whole and hence this Government amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <P>This is a drafting amendment intended to give a better understanding of what I <Col N="1729" /> believe the Minister means.  The reference in the section to the &ldquo;first-mentioned person or the customer is a person on whom a requirement has been imposed by virtue of that section&rdquo; is somewhat opaque.  If the Minister considers this amendment to be an improvement I hope he will accept it but if he does not consider it to be an improvement I do not intend to delay the House in debating it.</P>

      <P>Section 23 (2) is reasonably straightforward and simply prohibits the Minister from requiring a bank to disclose any information about a customer except in two specific circumstances: firstly, where the Minister considers it necessary for the purpose of investigating the affairs of the bank, or secondly, where the person being investigated is a customer of the bank involved.  I know the Deputy is trying to be helpful but against that background I do not think the wording of his amendment is logical.  Taking the first part of his amendment and transposing it into subsection (2) would mean lines 9 and 10 would read &ldquo;...for the purpose of investigating the affairs of the company under investigation&rdquo;.  This appears to be somewhat circular and I do not see the merit in it.</P>
      <P>The second part of the Deputy's amendment would allow the Minister to require information from any person involved with the company under investigation but this seems to be precisely what the last line and a half of the subsection states in any case and in the circumstances I do not think the amendment makes that much sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment has given us some grounds for thinking and when we looked at the Deputy's amendment we asked ourselves whether we had got the provisions of section 23 (2) right in the text of the Bill or whether we were going too far in breaching the notion of confidentiality between a bank and its customers. I should like to give some more thought to this aspect and while I would prefer not accept the Deputy's amendment I should like to express my thanks <Col N="1730" /> to him for drawing this aspect to my attention.  It has raised the more general question of what degree of privilege should extent to bank accounts under this Part of the Bill.  I will give a lot more thought to this between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the amendment which the Minister introduced a moment ago, section 23 (1) shall now read: &ldquo;Nothing in this Part shall compel disclosure by any person of any information which he would, in the opinion of the court, be entitled to refuse to produce on the grounds of legal professional privilege...&rdquo; The opinion of the court will be sought under that subsection and it will be the court who will form the opinion about whether a solicitor or anybody acting in that behalf is entitled not to disclose information.  Under subsection (2) the proviso about the opinion of the court will not apply in relation to banks. I know the Minister has said he is willing to have another look at this subsection in relation to confidentiality between a customer and his bank, but I wonder if it would be possible to include the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the court&rdquo; in subsection (2). in subsection (1) we have provided that a person may not disclose information which he would, in the opinion of the court, be entitled to refuse on the grounds of legal professional privilege so why do we not follow this on and provide, in the case of a bank, that no information shall be disclosed which in the opinion of the court, is not necessary for the purpose of investigating the affairs of a bank?</P>

      <P>The section refers to legal professional privilege.  A company may use the services of a large firm of auditors.  The directors or other people in the company may also need the advice of accountants in that firm regarding their personal affairs.  What about the activities of an accountant in his capacity as financial adviser in the company?  The partners in the firm may also give taxation advice to the directors of the company in regard to other matters. Would privilege be extended to these people as well?  They are not legal people but they are professionals acting with people in the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 24, before section 24, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;24.&mdash;In laying down the terms of reference of inspectors under sections <Col N="1732" /> 7 and 8 of this Act, the Court shall take account of the need to complete the investigations as quickly and as inexpensively as possible.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>I have expressed concern that the investigative procedures set up under earlier sections will be extremely expensive, with a lot of legal representation being required because of the rights that people who might be jeopardised have under various court decisions to be legally represented, to cross-examine other witnesses and to have access to books and documents that might be relevant to their own case.  Anything said in an investigation may incriminate the person concerned. All those factors mean that investigation will be a very expensive procedure which will be seldom used or useful.  I am suggesting in this amendment that in laying down the terms of reference for an inspection the court should take account of the need to complete the investigation as quickly and inexpensively as possible.  It is important that the court in making an order should do it in such a way as to try to reduce the cost and increase the speed.  I hope the Minister will be able to accept this amendment.  It statutorily draws to the judge's attention the need to do the thing quickly and relatively inexpensively.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21.</P>
      <P>In page 24, subsection (1), lines 36 to 44, and in page 25, lines 1 to 5, to delete paragraph (e) and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1733" />&ldquo;(e)  is a private company limited by shares.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to delete paragraph (e) of section 24 (1).  As it stands, the section proposes to exempt private limited companies from the terms of the section if they do not comply with any two of three conditions.  The three conditions are that their turnover exceeds £2.5 million, that their assets exceed £1.25 million and that the number of employees exceeds 50.  If they do not reach those figures they are exempted.  This is a fairly sweeping exemption.  I understand from information given to me by the ICTU that approximately 80 per cent of all manufacturing companies here employ fewer than 50 people and that there are over 2,000 small IDA grant-aided companies with fixed assets of less than £500,000.  There are over 75,000 private companies in Ireland but the number of such companies coming within the scope of the section will be very small.  Perhaps the Minister will explain why such a sweeping exemption should be applied.</P>
    <P>As I understand it the section is an attempt to prevent the directors of companies from doing deals outside the company for the supply of goods or money to themselves, for which the company would be responsible.  Our amendment would do away with the exemption and provide that private limited companies would be obliged in the same way as public companies to comply with the terms of section 24.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now moving to Part III of the Bill.  It deals in general with the question of loans and quasi-loans to directors and credit transactions in which directors may be involved.  We are also trying to ensure that directors have as little involvement as possible in areas where there is conflict of interest.  That is the general thrust of Part III of the Bill, the first section of which is section 24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section defines a number of terms for the purposes of Part III of the Bill. Throughout this Part, two important kinds of distinctions are drawn.  Three distinct types of transactions are covered <Col N="1734" />&mdash; loans, quasi-loans and credit transactions, depending on the type of company being referred to.  The word &ldquo;loan&rdquo; is a straightforward term which does not need definition.  &ldquo;Quasi-loan&rdquo; and &ldquo;credit transaction&rdquo; are somewhat more obscure and need specific definition.  Accordingly these terms are defined in subsections (2) and (3) of section 24.  The main distinction to be borne in mind in Part III is that the proposed restrictions on loans to directors apply to all companies, whereas the restrictions on the somewhat more sophisticated quasi-loans and credit transactions apply only to a relevant company.</P>
    <P>A relevant company is defined specifically in subsection (1).  Essentially it means a public limited company or a member of a group of companies which includes a plc or large or medium sized private company.  The definition of relevant companies was queried in the Seanad and it was pointed out there that this definition would effectively exclude 80 per cent of manufacturing companies, including most companies where such abuses are likely to occur and be of concern. While accepting my arguments that policing of a prohibition of making quasi-loans and meeting credit transactions on behalf of directors would be burdensome, I undertook nevertheless to have a look at that whole area.  That is a general overview of section 24.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by the Deputies would have the effect of bringing all companies within the scope of the restrictions imposed in relation to quasi-loans. If, as I suspect, the intention of the amendment is to bring all companies, particularly small private companies, within the scope of the prohibitions on making quasi-loans to, or undertaking credit transactions on behalf of, directors then it could more easily be achieved by doing away with the definition of relevant company.  That is just an incidental and technical comment as to how we might achieve what the Deputies wish to achieve.</P>
    <P>The distinction between an ordinary company and a relevant company arises <Col N="1735" /> in section 31 which contains the prohibition on the making of loans, quasi-loans or credit transactions.  In the case of loans, the prohibition on making loans greater than £2,500 applies at present to all companies.  With regard to quasi-loans and credit transactions the prohibition applies only to relevant companies.  I appreciate the concerns expressed by the Deputies but, as with so many aspects of this Bill, it also comes down to a question of balance.  I realise that the number of companies covered in relation to the quasi-loan and credit transaction restrictions will be limited.  However the matter has to be looked at pragmatically.  We would not have the resources to police these provisions if they related to all companies. In the circumstances, to introduce a law that we suspected from the outset we would not be in a position to police would run the risk of bringing all the provisions of this section into disrepute.</P>
    <P>At the same time we are not aware that private companies engage to a large extent in making quasi-loans or undertaking credit transactions for their directors. Obviously if this was shown to be an area of concern the matter would have to be looked at again and looked at quickly.  For the moment I am happy that the most serious areas of concern are properly addressed in the Bill as it is framed.  We are only interested in introducing these provisions and applying them in relation to those companies where the problem actually exists.  If at a later stage it can be shown that the same problems arise in the type of companies we are currently proposing to exclude here, I certainly will undertake to look again at the matter.  In the meantime I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Rossa's amendment gives us an opportunity to get an understanding of the whole purpose of this Part of the Bill.  I take it that the Minister's purpose in dealing with quasi-loans and credit transactions is the same as his purpose in dealing with ordinary <Col N="1736" /> loans to directors &mdash; to avoid the interests of creditors being prejudiced by the directors having taken money out of the company by way of a loan which there is considerable difficulty in having repaid subsequently.  Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a wholly laudable purpose and one which I fully support. As the House may be aware, I do not believe loans should be given to directors.  We should not be considering the limits which the Minister is allowing. If a company have to give loans to their directors there is something going on that should not be going on.  I know it is done in practice as a means of avoiding income tax.  Companies give their directors loans on very soft terms as a means of buying material things.  If they were to give them the money to do so there would be a deduction of 58 per cent but if it is given in the form of a loan there is no deduction and they can buy a house in Foxrock and pay the company back over a period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking here about section 24 (2) which defines a quasi-loan. To put it simply, this would be a transaction between a company and a director or a connected person whereby the company paid or promised to pay a third party on behalf of that person.  Such a transaction is, in substance, a loan.  An example would be where a person uses a credit card to buy goods on terms that the liability to pay fell on the company as the card holder.  If a company gave a person connected to that company a credit card and he wandered around the shops of Dublin or elsewhere buying <Col N="1737" /> goods on credit that would be a quasi-loan. The definition would also include any arrangements where a company laid out money on their own account for goods or services for a director's personal use on the basis that reimbursement would be made later.  We can all think of dozens of examples of perks that a company would extend by means of credit cards, for example, to pay for a carpet, a new hall door and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa's amendment to section 24, the definition section, gives us an opportunity to get information on the section.  I would like to ask a question regarding what are termed, for tax purposes, as loans to directors.  Most Irish companies, some of them quite large, are run by a husband and wife.  Since the passing of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, there has been a considerable change regarding what are termed as loans to directors.  Up until the 1976 Act a person who owned a limited company could avoid tax very easily.  For example, if a company made £200,000 a year and the director's salary was £10,000 a year, charged to the company's account in the same way as other wages, he could draw out as much money as he liked.  The transactions in the books of the company would show a credit to the director's account for the amount of his salary less the amount of money that he has drawn out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that person owned the company that would not make much difference but the accounts of the company would look absolutely ridiculous.  The director's loan account would come under the assets of the company.  He could have drawn £200,000 from the company but he would only vote himself a director's salary of <Col N="1738" /> a certain amount.  That was a legal tax avoidance measure.  It meant one could effectively control the amount of money on which one paid tax, because one only voted oneself a salary of so much but one drew out as much as one liked from the company.  Therefore, one could really run the company into the ground because one would be paying tax on a very small amount only, say, PAYE on one's director's salary.  If the company was making money it would be paying corporation tax but if it was losing money there would be losses within the company in any event.  It also meant one could draw out lots of money at the expense of creditors and everybody else.  But in the accounts of the company there would be a big asset, like a debtor &mdash; amount due from director, classified as a director's loan. Anybody who has ever seen the accounts of a company that has been liquidated will know that is something one will always spot.  On examination of the accounts one will see a wonderful asset which in reality will be a directors loan account, that is money that a director who owned the company in the first place owed to the company, but which <i>de facto</i> was never able to be collected for the simple reason that the director concerned used the company as a type of private bank account.  He would run the company into the ground in that manner.</P>
    <P>Arising from the provisions of the Corporation Tax Act 1976, if one draws more out of a company &mdash; putting one's directors account into debit, so that one owes money to the company &mdash; that attracts a tax charge and is classified in the company's accounts as a director's loan account; in fact as a loan because one is drawing out more than one is entitled to.</P>
    <P>Will that type of loan be caught within the ambit of all of these sections as well with regard to loans, quasi-loans because, strictly speaking, it would be a loan not a quasi-loan, and that is how it would be described in the accounts of the company? Since the passage of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976 if, at the end of the year, one's company accounts show an overdrawn director's account, classified in the balance sheet as a director's <Col N="1739" /> loan, it will attract a tax charge.  Would the Minister say whether that type of loan will be caught by the provisions of this section because some people have to engage in that practice even though they own the company themselves?  Will that be caught under the definition of loans and so on?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something that concerns me about the whole of Part III, that is that, under section 60 (13) of the Principal Act &mdash; which has to do with financing by companies of purchase of their own shares &mdash; it is possible for a company to lend money to its directors. It is not possible under the provisions of section 60 (13) (c) of the Principal Act to lend money to directors for the purpose of purchasing shares in a company but it is possible under the provisions of section 60 (13) (b).  Many companies, including some major ones &mdash; under the provisions of section 60 (13) (b) &mdash; are making loans to directors to enable them to purchase shares in their companies.  It may be that some people think it is not possible to lend money to directors under section 60 (13) (b) but it is clear that one can.  This is something I have come across in another context.  It is clear that one can because under the provisions of paragraph 8 (d) of the Sixth Schedule of the Principal Act &mdash; loans are permitted.  Some companies &mdash; and these are very respectable companies &mdash; now have schemes for the purchase of shares by employees, including directors.  They have schemes for such employees to purchase shares on a company by way of loan and are doing so at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What worries me is that the exceptions provided for in Part III of this Bill do not seem to permit a loan made to a director for the purpose of an employees' share scheme.  I should like to ask the Minister whether it is not the case that the effect of this Part of the Bill would be to prevent employee directors from receiving any loan to enable them to purchase shares as part of an employees' share scheme. That would be a retrogressive step and one that should be guarded against. <Col N="1740" /> There are large public liability companies which operate employees' share schemes under section 60 of the Principal Act. They give loans to some of their employee directors for the purpose of enabling them to purchase shares in the company.  It seems to me that this Part of the Bill, if left alone, will prohibit such loans, which would be a retrogressive step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  I have been examining that section of the Bill.  It is not my intention to prevent directors of companies getting loans under a suitable scheme to purchase shares in a company.  Certainly I will have a very close look at that.</P>
      <P>To revert to what Deputy McCreevy was talking about &mdash; a loan on a balance sheet being shown as an overdrawn director's account or whatever &mdash; it is intended to prevent such practice.  We are talking here about the definitions section.  The real meat of Part III is contained in sections 30 and 31 which deal with loans to directors, When we come to those sections we can deal in detail with that matter.  I might say that the intention of the Part is to prevent, with certain limits and exceptions, directors turning their companies into their private bank accounts; to prevent directors borrowing from their companies, perhaps having the company close down a week later, leaving outstanding sums due.  Liquidators have told me that a favourite device has been directors borrowing from a company, that company subsequently going into liquidation, when there is difficulty experienced in recouping the money from the relevant director.  That has been a fairly regular practice.  Therefore, any loan to a director &mdash; with the exception of what I said to Deputy McDowell &mdash; for whatever purpose but particularly those for any personal purposes we would envisage being caught under the provisions of this section.  Obviously that would include the director's outstanding loan account as it appears on the balance sheet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not get into a debate on taxation with the Deputy.  I am here endeavouring <Col N="1741" /> to limit loans made to directors of companies. I must stress that I have not taken a taxation view or any taxation complications or otherwise into account.  This is company legislation, not taxation or financial legislation.  Our objective is quite clear, which is to ensure that directors do not over-borrow money from their companies, by whatever method, for personal purposes, leaving the company high and dry at a later stage.  That is the import of what I am endeavouring to do here.</P>

He has said that effectively the intention is to protect companies from being run into the ground or deprived of assets by directors who might abuse their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By excluding such a large number of private limited companies, the Minister, in effect, is telling them that it is all right because we have not the capacity to police whether they are complying or not. Could the Minister explain, first, how he has decided on the criteria for exemption? The thresholds of 50 employees, £2.5 million of turnover and £1.25 million of assets are extraordinarily high.  In order to come within the ambit of this section, two of these criteria must be met. I could understand the Minister exempting companies where the proprietor and his wife would be the main persons <Col N="1742" /> involved, with perhaps a son, or daughter, a nephew or a niece, who would between them run the company and would be quite agreeable to lending each other the assets of the company in terms of money.  Companies with the other criteria of 50 employees, a turnover of £2.5 million or, alternatively, assets of £1.25 million are quite substantial companies. The interests of the employees, if nothing else, require that these companies should be policed as closely as those private companies which would be over the threshold. I do not have any examples in terms of companies being bled of their assets through quasi-loans or credit transactions, but there is a case to be made at least for reducing the thresholds proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation to policing, as I understand it every private limited company are obliged to have their accounts audited by a reputable auditor who is controlled by his professional body.  One must assume that if their books are being audited by such a person and the returns are being made to the Companies Office on a regular basis, that in itself would be a method of policing the system.  I would appreciate if the Minister would explain why the threshold has been set at such a high level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the level of the 1986 Fourth Directive which we have adopted in conjunction with our EC partners. It was convenient and already set, so it was a handy reference point worked out at EC level.  There was no other reason, other than that it was available and practical.</P>
      <P>It is not that I do not want to catch all these companies in the quasi-loan area but just that it is not practical to do so. Any loans made by private or public companies are caught under the prohibition on making loans to directors above a certain level.  It is only when we moved to the quasi-loan area, the credit card, the carpet being put in and matters like that, that we have had to confine it to two areas.  The first is the public company, which is clear enough, and then the large, medium and private companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" /> We still exclude the quasi-loan there to the set limit.  The only group that we have left out are small companies below the set thresholds.  It is because there are so many of these that it would be quite impossible to police them.  I would have no difficulty in expressing the aspiration, but that is not what this legislation is about, it is about getting a job done.</P>
    <P>It would be totally impractical and horrifically costly for the State to try to pin down all the quasi-loans in all the private companies in Ireland.  How do we find out all the credit cards given in perhaps, up to 60,000 to 80,000 private companies? How do we audit that information? It would make a mockery of the legislation to include it.  We simply could not get the information under the present format.  We put in the loans aspect because that information would normally be in the accounts but the quasi-loan is entirely different.  How do we find out that every small limited company with two directors and a small turnover give credit cards to their directors?  I am rejecting the proposal only on the grounds of impracticability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that what the Minister is doing here is making a straight copy from section 49 of the UK Companies Act of 1980?  Section 49 says that in the case of all companies they shall not make a loan to a director and that in the case of what are known as relevant companies they shall not make quasi-loans. What were the reasons for those distinctions?  We seem to be directly following UK law on this point and I wonder if it is necessarily correct.</P>

The quasi-loan is a very practical thing.  The word &ldquo;loan&rdquo; did not describe what was going on in the company area.  The words &ldquo;quasi-loan&rdquo; catches it very well indeed.  It is all those other loans which would not normally be called loans, but which are extended.</P>

Does the Minister not <Col N="1745" /> think that it would be more appropriate to set the thresholds at a lower level?  My amendment seeks to include all private limited companies.  I would be quite happy if the Minister were to exclude the type of company that he describes, where the proprietor and his wife, or the sons and daughters, ran the company.  I am thinking of small companies with no more than seven or 10 employees who would, in general, be related to one another.  I have great difficulty in accepting that it is right to exclude companies as described in the exemption under section 24.  The Minister said it would be impossible to police the section.  I can appreciate the difficulty in locating all the credit cards which will be issued to the directors of about 70,000 companies.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy R. Bruton on Tuesday, 13 December 1988:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the disruption that will be caused to public viewing and listening choice by the termination of un-licenced radio, and unlicensed television deflector systems long before alternatives are available, that Dáil Éireann urges the Minister for Communications to introduce an amendment to the Wireless and Telegraphy Act, 1988 to permit him discretion in deciding dates after the 31st December, 1988, on which that Act would come into force in respect of unlicensed radio stations and of UHF deflector systems.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P>2. To delete all words after &ldquo;Wireless and Telegraphy Act, 1988&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1746" />&ldquo;(1)  to permit him to grant a provisional sound broadcasting licence to any person or body presently providing an unlicensed radio service and who made a submission to the Independent Radio and Television Commission in accordance with the requirements of the Radio and Television Act, 1988 prior to the 21st November last;</P>
    <P>(2)  to permit him to grant a provisional licence to unlicensed television UHF deflector systems presently transmitting TV signals from channels other than RTE.</P>
    <P>Such provisional licences to be granted where it can be shown that no interference will be caused to signals from legal systems and where the operator complies with all other existing requirements of the Broadcasting Acts, such licences to remain in force until licences presently provided for in the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988 and the Television and Radio Act, 1988, are issued by the Minister for Communications&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was moving the Adjournment last night I said that when the Minister introduced the Sound Broadcasting Bill last December which, subsequently, became the Radio and Television Bill, he acknowledged that it <Col N="1747" /> was not realistic to expect that we could clear the air waves of illegal operators if we did not have an alternative legal structure in place.  He regarded that as very important.</P>
      <P>The kernel of this debate and the issues outlined in the motion before us have to do with that aspect of the legislation. Obviously, if we do not have an alternative system in place, it will be much more difficult to rid air waves of illegal operators.  From what we know at the moment, it will be quite a long time before a legal system is in place to facilitate independent sound broadcasting and transmission of television signals other than RTE.  If the Minister in introducing the legislation put that as the cornerstone of how he would get the illegal operators off the air waves, it is now fair to say to him that he must accept his own logic.  If he recognises that there is a market for the services provided by illegal operators, he must also realise that an alternative system must be in place before there is any prospect of having the illegal operators put off the air.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that we passed the Radio and Television Act, 1988, last June which provided the legal framework, particularly for radio stations and the proposed independent national television channel.  The Minister will acknowledge that all parties in the House were constructive in their approach to that legislation.  Amendments from all parties were accepted and we ended with good legislation.  On that occasion also &mdash; I think it was 8 June &mdash; we passed the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill which mainly provided for increased penalties which would come into effect on 31 December next for those who continued to operate illegally in the radio or television sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time the Minister set that date he assured the House that there would not be a gap between the coming on stream of the new legal services and the going off the air waves of the illegal services. By a gap, he gave us to understand that he meant a few weeks.  He intended <Col N="1748" /> that the transition to the legal system would be speedy.</P>
    <P>I should like initially to deal with radio. The Radio and Television Act provided for the establishment of an independent radio and television commission.  Its primary function was to arrange for the provision of sound broadcasting services other than RTE and the third national television service.  The commission had a heavy workload and the Minister must accept that, from the time of the passing of the legislation in June, it took almost four months to establish the commission. I draw his attention to the fact that on Report Stage, the Minister undertook to establish the commission very quickly so that they could get on with their work. Incidentally, in the original legislation, the Minister did not want such a commission to be set up, he wanted to rely on an advisory committee but we persuaded him that we should have an independent broadcasting commission.  In any event, when they were appointed, they did not delay.  They were appointed on 12 October, had their inaugural meeting on 17 October and, on the following day, they invited submissions from all those interested in providing the new services.</P>
    <P>The Act provided for the commission to seek submissions from those who were interested in providing radio services and the new national independent television service.  The commission got on with their work but the fact that they were established so late has led to a chain reaction in the sense that we now have a major difficulty with regard to bringing in the new licences for the legal regime.  Yesterday the commission advertised applications for 25 new stations.  They are just the first of the new stations; we have other tiers of sound broadcasting to be provided for.  They are very important, they are local and community radio, neighbourhood radio and special interest radio and so on.  Even though the Minister is trying to assure us that the first 25 stations will be up and running by late February or early March, we need to be convinced that that will happen.  In any event, the other stations will not be established for a very long time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> It is not right that people who have demanded alternative choices in listening and viewing should be left without them for that length of time.  Our amendment seeks to shorten the gap and in the radio scetor we propose to issue provisional licences, particularly to those who responded to the commission's advertisements for submissions to be made to them by parties who are interested in providing those services.  They had to advise the commission of their interest by 25 November last and my amendment suggests that the Minister should amend the legislation to enable him to grant provisional licences to stations already operating and who made a submission to the commission prior to 21 November last.  It is fair to say that anybody who made a submission to the commission is obviously intent on operating within the legal framework and within the new legislation. Not to have the air waves totally devoid of an alternative service, It is right that a provisional licensing system should be brought into play immediately to fill the gap created by the Minister's delay.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem in relation to television, as I am sure the Minister knows.  I heard one of the Minister's backbenchers, Deputy Morley, on RTE the other morning, or an account of what he said, which was that he would try to convince the Minister not to proceed with the threat to ensure that the UHF deflector operators would be off the air by 31 December.  I hope Deputy Morley and others in his party have persuaded the Minister and that he has taken their advice.</P>
    <P>The UHF rebeaming operators have been using this system to transmit television signals, other than RTE, to thousands of houses throughout the country, and they have been doing it very successfully over a number of years.  If the Minister insists on closing down those operators on 31 December, there will be a vast section of the community throughout the country without BBC 1, BBC 2, ITV and Channel 4.  We cannot allow that to happen.  The Minister has proposed MMDS &mdash; the new legal system which will transmit those stations &mdash; but the <Col N="1750" /> obvious delay before that is brought on stream will cause a major problem.</P>
    <P>The UHF deflector operators have been clamouring for years to be legalised. They are willing to pay their licence fees, to pay copywright fees, to be controlled and subjected to all the requirements of the Broadcasting Acts and to comply with them.  The Minister and the Department of Communications have refused to license them mainly on the grounds, they say, that it is not in the best interests of the management of the frequency spectrum, and they claim that the UHF spectrum is reserved for State broadcasting services.  Even though it is reserved for State broadcasting services, that spectrum is not fully utilised and there is spare capacity.</P>
    <P>In using the UHF spectrum the illegal operators, as they are termed at the moment, are quite flexible in their approach and can adjust their frequencies to suit whatever requirements the Minister or the Department might make of them.  They would be willing to encode their signals to ensure they would not interfere with cable television stations or with other legal systems.  On many occasions they have indicated that they would willingly get off the air if and when space is at a premium and RTE, the State broadcasting service, need the available space in that spectrum.  They are willing to do all those things.  They are providing a very worthwhile service and we are proposing to terminate that service on 31 December without any readily available legal alternative to come on stream. What the Minister has proposed is the MMDS.  The impetus for bringing in that system seems to have arisen as a result of his decision to bring in a third independent national television station, and that television station could not be transmitted throughout the country if we did not use the UHF spectrum.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Minister is proposing to bring in the new terrestrial system, the multi-point microwave distribution system.  The Minister and I have spoken on this issue on many occasions and I have been consistent in my request to him to legalise, to provisionally license, <Col N="1751" /> the UHF operators for the reasons I have already outlined, and I have also consistently mentioned the major reservations I have about the MMDS.  I will mention a few of them.</P>
    <P>One must query the technical suitability of this system.  We know it is a line of sight system developed in Canada where the topography is very different from that in Ireland.  They have wide open plains but Ireland has many hills and valleys and these are the areas which need this service because the cable system is not there at the moment.  It is state of the art technology.  It has never been used anywhere in the way it is intended to use it here, which is on the basis of a blanket coverage of the country. We are pioneers in this respect and we are not sure this is a technically a good system.</P>
    <P>There are other major questions about the MMDS, not least of which is the health hazards one hears are associated with it.  It is a microwave system and this has given rise to genuine fears among the public.  The Minister has acknowledged on previous occasions that there could be a health hazard associated with this system.</P>
    <P>When these operators are licensed they will have to apply for planning permission. I envisage that there will be major objections every time a planning application is made to erect one of these masts.  We will have a repeat of what happened with the Tara mast in Meath some months ago.</P>
    <P>Another factor to bear in mind is cost. It will cost a householder about £150 to provide an MMDS mast and about £100 annually, much more expensive than the present UHF system, and he is paying for the privilege of receiving what he already receives.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of technological development, we are on course to be using a DBS system, that is, direct broadcasting by satellite, in the years immediately ahead.  I cannot understand why the Minister insists on bringing in a new terrestrial system given the technological developments which are taking place and <Col N="1752" /> which would make MMDS obsolete.  Satellite broadcasting is the way of the future and I need to be convinced that the MMDS is the right system for this country.</P>
    <P>The purpose of our motion in the case of radio and the deflector operators is to discuss a way they can be provisionally licensed until such time as a legal regime comes into place.  In the interests of broadcasting, the Minister cannot ignore the difficulties he is piling up for himself and for the viewing and listening public. I urge him to accept our amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The very dogmatic approach of the Government in insisting that the stations at present broadcasting should cease broadcasting at the end of this month represents an extraordinary breach of faith in what this House and the public understood was to be the situation. That breach of faith is not supported by this party.  The explicit understanding was that the cessation of broadcasting in a disorganised fashion, from a statutory point of view, would be followed immediately by the new legal stations.  That is not happening.</P>
      <P>I cannot comprehend the Government's obsession in insisting that stations which are providing an excellent social service, who are giving excellent employment and who in my personal view are giving a service far superior to what is likely to emerge from the collective desire of this House, cannot be facilitated until it is possible for them to go their way or to broadcast under licence.  I have no doubt we will have stations that will give a service, but not necessarily a better service, and they will cost the State money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are responsible for a major breach of faith in that respect.  I do not believe the Minister or the Government want to break their word but that is what they are doing.  It will not bode well for trying to increase confidence in the system if we let this go unchallenged.  We will not support that <Col N="1753" /> approach, although we share the desire to bring about more organisation in the broadcasting area, particularly from the point of view of technical interference.</P>
    <P>I understand the commission are to make these decisions ultimately.  I was somewhat taken aback to note that the Minister was able to say who would not get licences if they continued to broadcast allegedly illegally.  I do not know if that is for the Minister or the commission to decide.  I also believe it is right that I should state unequivocally my admiration and respect for the professionalism, entrepreneurial flair and enthusiasm of many people associated with the present stations &mdash; KLAS, TTTR, Sunshine and others who are giving an excellent service in the Dublin area and in many other areas around the country.</P>
    <P>I want to hand over to my colleague who has a number of points to make. That is the essence of what I want to say. They are giving a fabulous service and it is some Christmas present for the workers in that service who want to do it legally and have not been faciliated by the omissions of successive administrations that they are apparently to be thrown on the unemployment scrap-heap coming up to Christmas week.  That is incredible.  I tell the Minister to go ahead and legalise in due course, but in the meantime do as he and as his predecessors have done up to now and allow an excellent service to continue for the short period intervening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to concentrate on the deflector rebeaming of TV signals. There seems to be some misunderstanding here that the people using this service are somehow in isolated areas, perhaps in the west.  From the research I have done it seems only the centre of Dublin and the centre of Cork are unaffected because they are on the Cablelink system.  Every other constituency has some form of rebeaming of TV signals, particularly those from the UK.  Therefore, we are not talking about a small lobby group; we are talking about <Col N="1754" /> a national issue.  It is a very good example of politicians creating a barrier between themselves and the public.  If the Minister is going to persist in putting these people off the air before the new system comes into operation I assure him he is building a Berlin Wall around himself and digging a hole far deeper than the one dug by his colleague over the rod licence issue.</P>
      <P>It is not the public's fault that people are utilising this system.  Cablelink have seen it is not fit for them to go into some of the other areas because it is not financially viable to do so.  Large communities and even satellite urban areas are affected in this area without the Cablelink system.  Communities themselves got together to figure out a way of gaining for themselves an equal footing with other members of the community.  That was not unwarranted or in some way outrageously illegal.  They simply wanted the type of service all other citizens were entitled to.  They have achieved a community based effort in all constituencies. They have pitched it at a cost that is accessible to unemployed people, OAPs and the whole gamut of people across the community.  Let the Minister believe it or not, this is a very necessary service being provided to thousands of homes as we speak here this evening.  I assure the Minister that if he is to persist in making these actions totally illegal from 1 January next the hue and cry will be enormous. Already some of the people operating the systems have turned off the rebeaming signal in the last few days and this has created unbelievable fury in various constituencies.  Waterford is a typical example.  The public are not going to accept this and I do believe that as politicians we have a mandate not to ignore what is quite clearly the wish of the majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public are not saying to the Minister they do not want an improved system or they are somehow against the idea he and the Government have for improving the system, whatever that may be.  They are saying clearly that until a system is in place and operating they will not put up with being treated as second class citizens by TV signals that are available in some <Col N="1755" /> urban areas being made totally unavailable to them.  That is not on.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister tonight to look at this.  He should now accept the situation with regard to the rebeaming of TV signals.  There is a reality out there and many thousands of people are going to be affected.  He has it within his power to accept the amendment put down in the name of Deputy O'Malley which will overcome this problem in the short term.</P>
    <P>I want to add to what Deputy O'Malley said about the MMDS system which is probably another day's work for discussion, but we have consistently outlined grave reservations about this system and how it will operate.  I am convinced it is the wrong system to introduce here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

How this MMDS system is going to operate without a multitude of rebeaming signals all over the place I do not know.  It is unnecessary.  We can see what is happening with the advances in satellite TV and direct broadcasting.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be wise to look at this question again.  As Deputy Keating said, we do not want to put people out of work.  We want to keep those who are employed working.  We do not want to send more people on to the unemployment register.  This affects jobs in Waterford, Clare, Limerick and all over the country.  I appeal to the Minister to give the people the comfort of the knowledge that they will not be affected come 1 January and will be allowed to continue receiving TV systems, and those rebroadcasting them will not be subject to prosecution in this area.</P>

      <P>This House unanimously passed the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988 last June as part of a dual package of measures to bring order to radio broadcasting in this country.  It comes as a great surprise to me, therefore, to see a motion before the House now seeking to amend that legislation.  I have to say that it is one of the most blatant examples of political opportunism that I have come across in a long time.  However, when I think about it perhaps it is not at all surprising.  After all, when it appeared that there was going to be a serious attempt by the then Government in 1983 to tidy up the radio broadcasting situation and provide a legal regime for alternative radio services two things happened &mdash; they capitulated to what I might term the &ldquo;rent a crowd&rdquo; lobby to leave the illegal radio stations alone and then failed miserably to steer their own legislation to a successful conclusion. Their radio Bill never completed the Second Stage debate.</P>
      <P>This Government were left to inherit a scandalous situation.  The law, no matter how inadequate its provisions were to cope with the problem, was consciously not enforced against illegal radio broadcasters. Blatant breaches of the law of the land were not only tolerated but condoned, as were consequential breaches of our international treaty obligations. The Opposition, when in Government, became totally paralysed on this issue. The result has been a chaotic radio environment in this country which does nothing to enhance our image for law enforcement abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In stark contrast with the total paralysis of the previous administration, this Government have shown a resolve and determination to deal effectively with the chaotic radio broadcasting situation in this country.  Within 15 months we secured the enactment of perhaps the two most important and far-reaching pieces of legislation relating to radio and broadcasting policy in this country that will be considered by the Oireachtas for the <Col N="1757" /> remainder of this century &mdash; the Radio and Television Act, 1988 and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988.  These two Acts run in parallel and are complementary to each other.  One will not work without the other.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House of what the Radio and Television Act, 1988 is designed to achieve.  It puts in place a practical and flexible regulatory framework, which will be light in touch, to enable the provision of legitimate alternative broadcasting services to those of RTE.  The options provided for are: an independent national television service; an independent national radio service and independent local, neighbourhood and special interest stations.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to digress for a moment to express on my behalf and on behalf of the Government our gratitude and appreciation for the manner in which the new commission have set about their task and our admiration for the progress they have made to date.</P>
    <P>In October they sought expressions of interest in the provision of the various categories of service I have referred to.  In the case of the local tier the commission submitted their report to me on 9 December and I have accepted the findings of that report.  Deputies will have seen yesterday's advertisement by the commission inviting applications for these contracts.  The closing date for receipt of applications will be 20 January 1989 and I am optimistic that legal stations will start coming on stream by March next.</P>
    <P>The closing date for receipt of applications for the national radio service is 16 December and I understand that the commission hope to decide on the contractor for this service during January 1989.  The closing date for receipt of applications for the national television service is 16 January 1989.</P>
    <P>The achievements of the Government and of the commission they have appointed stand in stark contrast with the failure of the Opposition when in Government.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged in some quarters that it will be late 1989 before legal radio stations start coming on stream.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1758" /> The facts are that the commission have advertised for applications for both the new national radio services and for the first round of local radio services.  The closing date for receipt of applications for the national service is this coming Friday. The closing date for receipt of applications for local radio is 20 January 1989 and new stations should begin to come on stream by March.</P>
    <P>The task of clearing the radio airwaves so that legal radio can flourish will begin when the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988 comes into force on 31 December.  This task may be enormous or relatively small depending on the attitude of illegal radio operators to the new law.  While some operators have publicly stated their intention to respect the law after 31 December others have not.  The most recent monitoring information available to me indicates that about 70 illegal stations are operating on a regular basis.  This number of course fluctuates as existing stations cease or as new ones commence operations in contravention of the law.  There must be a breathing space between the close-down of illegal radio stations and the commencement of the legal regime.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Radio and Television Act, 1988 lays down the criteria to be taken into account by the Independent Radio and Television Commission in adjudicating on applications.  One of the criteria to be taken into account by the commission in awarding contracts is the character of the applicant.  Clearly the Commission would have to have serious doubts about the suitability of any applicant for a contract who, at the same time as his application is under consideration, treats the law of the land with contempt by continuing to broadcast illegally.  In this regard I welcome the policy decision of the commission that any person who continues to broadcast or is associated with an illegal broadcast after 31 December will be automatically barred from consideration for any of the contracts being offered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always of course shared the wish that the gap between the closedown of the illegal stations and the opening up of the legal stations should be as short as possible and I am satisfied that it will be so.  But even if in some instances it may prove longer than anyone would wish, I am not prepared to sacrifice the credibility of the broadcasting framework we have put into place and in particular our determination to restore order to the radio airwaves.</P>
      <P>Let me quote from the closing statement made on this matter when the Second Stage of the Radio and Television Bill was reached.  I quote:</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked for clarification as to how it was proposed to deal with the closing down of illegal stations and the phasing in of new stations.  This, indeed, will be a thorny problem and while we would wish to avoid any hiatus between the two, we will nevertheless face up to it if it is the price to be paid to get legal stations on the air. </P>
      <P>The Government are convinced that it would be wrong to show any weakness in our resolve to close down the pirate radio stations.  It has been because of the weakness of the previous Government that the pirates have thrived as much as they have.  Illegal radio operators read the signs correctly when they took the view that the previous Government lacked the political resolve to face up to them. Experience has shown that their view was the correct one.</P>
      <P>We cannot weaken in our resolve to tackle this problem once and for all.  What credibility would we have &mdash; and would the commission have &mdash; in dealing with the many legitimate bodies and groups who have, over the years, despite what must have been very strong temptation, refrained from getting involved in illegal radio broadcasting and who now propose to get involved in legitimate broadcasting? What sensible person would invest finance in legitimate radio broadcasting? What sensible person would that the pirates' reign is at an end and that he will be able to operate in a properly regulated environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1760" /> The effect of Deputy Bruton's motion is to give succour to the radio pirates; to give in to the pressure they have been trying to generate, through their illegal use of the radio airwaves.  In practice we are witnessing a repeat of the campaign orchestrated by the pirates in 1983, a campaign that was successful on that occasion.  As it was on that occasion, it is easy to stir the emotions when you have such access to the medium.  Does Deputy Bruton and his party, believe, if we gave in to the demand in his motion, that there would not be repeated demands of this nature, this time orchestrated by the unsuccessful applicants when the legitimate stations are ready to go on the air? We must face the harsh facts of life &mdash; those who fail to get legitimate franchises could be expected yet again to whip up another campaign and we would once again all be bombarded with special pleas from our local pirates as to why they should be allowed continue.  The line has to be drawn and it is being drawn on 31 December.  It is absolutely essential that we demonstrate our resolve once and for all to deal with the pirate radio stations. The Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act was passed unanimously by this House and it is our intention to carry out the will of the Oireachtas as stated in the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Any failure on our part to do so would lead the Independent Radio and Television Commission to question the whole credibility of the new broadcasting framework.  Their strength of feelings on the matter is such that they have, as I mentioned, decided that anyone who continues to broadcast illegally, or is associated with illegal broadcasting, after 31 December will be automatically debarred from consideration for any franchises being offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the enforcement of the provisions of the legislation against illegal radio operators my Department have <Col N="1761" /> made arrangements to monitor the airwaves nationwide after 31 December.  On the basis of the results of the monitoring operation action will be taken against illegal stations found to be broadcasting, and against advertisers using these stations. A search and seize campaign will go into immediate effect.  Concurrently the process of prosecuting anybody found to be aiding and abetting such stations or taking part in the operation of these stations will be put in train.  In this connection special arrangements are being made to strengthen the resources available to my Department to tackle any problem that is found to exist.  Deputies will have seen warning advertisements inserted by my Department in the national newspapers yesterday and it is no harm to state the categories of persons who will be liable for prosecution.  They are:</P>
    <P>A person who operates or assists in the operation of an illegal broadcasting station.</P>
    <P>A person who owns, controls or makes available vehicles, premises or land used for illegal broadcasting.</P>
    <P>A person who supplies, installs, repairs, maintains or keeps equipment which could be used for illegal broadcasting.</P>
    <P>A person who advertises on or invites others to advertise on an illegal broadcasting station.</P>
    <P>A supplier of programme material of any kind for illegal broadcasting.</P>
    <P>A participant in any way in an illegal broadcast, for example as an announcer, presenter or contributor.</P>
    <P>The penalties on conviction are severe: fines of up to £1,000 and/or three months imprisonment on summary conviction; fines of up to £20,000 and/or two years imprisonment on conviction on indictment and equipment will also be confiscated. In addition the provision of electricity and telecommunications services used for illegal broadcasting purposes may be prohibited.  Anyone permitting the use of these services for those purposes may have these services prohibited also and will be liable on conviction to a maximum fine of £1,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1762" /> The Fine Gael motion, and the amendments put down in the name of The Workers' Party and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; the great mould breakers who were never going to bow to any pressure group and whose credibility was going to be perfect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;refer to the situation of illegal television rebroadcasting, or deflector systems as they are generally known.  The current illegal status of these systems is unchanged by the coming into force of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988.  They are illegal now and they will be illegal after 31 December.</P>
      <P>We are in the middle of a major television revolution where the meaning of choice as we have known it over the past 25 years &mdash; the reception of the four British terrestrial TV services &mdash; becomes less significant.  While the illegal TV deflector systems have provided some semblance of choice, the service they provided was patchy and at times unreliable in coverage.  The Government are determined that the people of rural Ireland, who cannot be serviced economically by cable systems, will have the same opportunities for programme choice and quality of service equal to the best cable systems in the country.</P>
      <P>In furtherance of this policy to ensure equality of access to television programme choice throughout the country, as soon as we took office we commenced an immediate evaluation of the options available to provide greater choice.  Here again, in contrast with the previous Government, having satisfied ourselves as to the suitability of the multi-channel microwave distribution system for the provision of up to 11 television channels we proceeded with all speed to invite applications for licences for this system to provide national coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here let me emphasise the word <Col N="1763" />&ldquo;national&rdquo;.  Frequency planning and the invitation for applications for MMDS licences was done on the basis of achieving a network giving top quality service to all areas of the country.  In the case of the RTE transmission network the main stations did not reach into every corner of the land and RTE have been installing low powered transposers to service pockets of unsatisfactory reception.  Likewise frequencies will be available to MMDS licensees so that they can deal with any pockets of unsatisfactory reception in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>The new national system will also, in conjunction with cable television systems, be the means of distributing the new independent television service to viewers.  That was accepted by the House.  A most enthusiastic response was received to the invitation to apply for MMDS franchises and I expect to announce the award of the first licences in a matter of weeks.  My aim is to have licences issued to achieve national coverage in the shortest practicable time frame.</P>
    <P>The Government's speedy action in this area clearly signals that we recognise the legitimacy of the demand that lies behind the spread of illegal rebroadcasting systems &mdash; the desire of people for greater choice.  We are responding to that demand by the licensing of multi-channel microwave distribution systems.</P>
    <P>I have stated many times in this House that it is not possible to license the existing rebroadcasting or deflector systems. I have explained the reasons why this is so and it is no harm to repeat them now. The UHF frequency band 450 MHz to 960 MHz, which is allocated under the International Radio Regulations to which Ireland is a party for broadcasting, was planned at a European Broadcasting Area Conference in Stockholm in 1961. Under this plan Ireland has frequency assignments at main transmitting sites to provide for four television channels. However, considerable replanning of the UHF band and international co-ordination of additional frequency assignments would be necessary before four <Col N="1764" /> networks capable of giving nationwide coverage would be available, and even then there is no assurance that such coordination would be successfully completed.</P>
    <P>UHF broadcasting spectrum is currently being used for the RTE 1 and RTE 2 channels at a number of main and transposer stations around the country. RTE will have further requirements for UHF spectrum for the purpose of providing further fill-in transposers as part of their ongoing programme to improve reception of existing services in areas of poor reception.</P>
    <P>The remainder of RTE's transmission network for RTE 1 and for RTE 2, comprising ten main stations and 46 transposer stations, operates in the VHF band.  In the longer term, RTE's transmission network will have to be renewed. European trends indicate that all of the next generation of RTE transmitters will have to be accommodated in the UHF bands.</P>
    <P>The continued reception of UK television services, which operate solely on the UHF band in this country requires that the channels used by these services which are receivable here cannot be interfered with.</P>
    <P>The UHF band is the only spectrum available to accommodate any new broadcasting developments for the foreseeable future.  Even if, not withstanding this fact, the spectrum was to be given over to deflector systems the range of services that could be distributed in no way compares with the capacity of MMDS and would not fit in with the Government's desire to maximise and equalise the potential for choice in television viewing on a nationwide basis without discrimination between urban and rural.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What the deflector operators have done is to appropriate any frequencies that suited them without any regard to the constraints we are under as a consequence of the international treaties and conventions to which we are a <Col N="1765" /> party.  It is not, frankly, within our gift to legalise them even if we wished to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>MMDS will match the current cable systems in the provision of channel choice.  It will provide the potential for the retransmission of up to 11 channels additional to the RTE television services.  As the systems will use frequencies that are outside the tuning range of conventional TV sets an MMDS receiver antenna and a down converter will be required to pick up the MMDS signals from the central transmitter, and change them to frequencies suited to the TV sets.  Both units will be supplied by the licensed MMDS operator and can be located, for example, with an existing RTE aerial.  When these systems are in operation it is envisaged that the charges to subscribers will compare approximately with the more modern cable systems.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed that the introduction of MMDS could pose a potential hazard to health.  In devising the technical specification to be complied with by MMDS licensees, my Department have been very conscious of this concern and are satisfied that compliance with the specification will ensure that the general public will not run any risk of being exposed to radiation levels that expert opinion would consider harmful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As MMDS technology uses carrier frequencies near 2.5 Ghz., the technical specification requires MMDS operators to comply with the guidelines approved in June 1987 by the International Non-Ionizing Radiation Committee of the IRPA &mdash; the International Radiation Protection Association &mdash; on the limits of exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields in the frequency range from 100 Khz to 300 Ghz.  These guidelines lay down maximum exposure limits to protect people from the potentially harmful effects of exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic radiation.  The RF radiation exposure limits are such that they ensure, from presently available knowledge, a safe, healthy working and <Col N="1766" /> living environment under all normal conditions. Due to the combination of tower height, antenna directivity and the relatively low powers being used, the radiation levels from transmitters will, for the general public, be well below the guideline limits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, MMDS antenna systems &mdash; transmitters &mdash; will generally be sited on high ground in isolated areas.  In addition, the site will be well protected to inhibit entry by the general public.  A further safety factor will be the tower heights &mdash; 30 metres or almost 100 feet.</P>
      <P>As I said initially, we recognise the legitimacy of the demand that lies behind the deflector systems and we are responding expeditiously to that demand.  At the same time we are not unmindful of the service they have brought to many rural communities and of the loss that will be felt with their close-down pending the introduction of the alternative MMDS systems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, therefore, favourably disposed to introducing an amending provision to the 1988 Act whereby the operation of the new offences and penalty provisions would be suspended for a limited period in relation to deflector systems. Such systems are at present illegal and will remain so.  They will remain subject to the penalty provisions applying at present under the 1926 to 1972 Wireless Telegraphy Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the MMDS network is established region by region the full rigours of the 1988 Act will be applied to the deflector operators in the regions concerned.  That will be starting shortly.  In particular, deflector operators interfering with licensed cable systems or any other licensed service will continue to be pursued vigorously under the 1926 to 1972 Acts.  My Department are in consultation with the Attorney General's office with a <Col N="1767" /> view to having such amending legislation before the Dáil in the new session.</P>
    <P>1989 will see a whole exciting new regime both on the radio and on the television fronts with new radio stations at national and local levels in place as well as a new television service and a first class retransmission system which will bring real and meaningful choice to urban and rural areas alike.  Did I hear somebody from the Front Bench of the Progressive Democrats?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to the 77 or so radio stations operating illegally in this country is that they must be closed down.  The Minister is correct in seeking to introduce the legislation to do so and to achieve, as and from 1 January 1989, clarity and order within the broadcasting area.  Having said that, there is clearly a different case to <Col N="1769" /> be made for those people who have sought or relied, unwittingly, on many of the operators operating television deflector systems either on a community or other basis.  We had proposed in our amendment a suggestion that Cablelink would come in and work, with the political support of all in this House, to maintain the service to those rural and remote areas what will otherwise be disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>It is heartening to hear that progress is being made at the speed which it is from the Minister's point of view but, nonetheless, it is inevitable that there will be considerable gaps in some areas, if not all, for those relying on the deflector systems between the close down in January and the setting up of a comprehensive MMDS system.  For that reason we believe the Government should have envisaged this problem and acted in advance of the cut-off date.  As that has not been done we respectfully suggest that the amendment in the name of The Workers' Party is a mechanism that might well be employed or considered to deal with the gap that will obviously arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, it is regrettable that Fine Gael allied these two issues together.  It is equally fair to say that there is a degree of cynicism in regard to this matter because the provisions under which the Minister will operate are those contained in the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1987 which are exactly the same as those promoted in the Bill presented by the Coalition Government in 1985.  The wording of the section dealing with the closure of illegal radio stations and illegal deflector systems are exactly the same.  When those provisions came to be discussed in this House, no longer than June of this year, neither Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats or anyone else expressing concern for those who are going to be adversely affected by the legislation put down one amendment. Those listening to this debate, who are being asked to believe that both Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats are concerned, have to ask where were they when those provisions came to be debated.  Only one or two interventions <Col N="1770" /> were made and if anyone wishes to read the debate on that Bill I refer them to volume 381, columns 1810 onwards, of the Official Report, where they will see that not one single amendment was presented or promoted by either of the two parties now expressing concern. Clearly this area of the law is in chaos and what we are being presented with is an opportunity to bring early in the New Year a degree of clarity into this area.  It ill-behoves anyone to stand up in this House and suggest that something should be done for those who have so flagrantly and blatantly ignored the law.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the protection of jobs.  I read a report in one of the newspapers today which stated that many of the artists used by many of these pirate stations have not been paid for the work they have done.  These stations should be reminded that each of their workers has an entitlement to redundancy payments. When these stations close, as the Minister assures us they will, I would like the Minister and his coleague in the Department of Labour to ensure that all of these workers receive all of their statutory entitlements, such as redundancy payments and, in time, well paid jobs, fully protected, in the new stations which will be set up within a short time of the pirate stations being closed down.  Given the demand for licences there is absolutely no doubt that within a short space of time of the pirate stations being closed down stations will be operating legally in good order and order is what is necessary when we come to deal with broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Minister for giving me the opportunity to comment on our amendment.  We believe that this amendment should be put to a vote and I hope the House will support us in what we seek to achieve, <i>via media,</i> on behalf of the innocent parties involved.  As I said, it is regrettable that we had to deal with these two issues in the one motion and we are in the position in which we find ourselves this evening.</P>

      <P>I would like to respond to the points made by the Minister and other speakers in this debate in regard to the failure of the previous Government who introduced similar legislation. Specifically I would like to refer to the role of the Labour Party in the introduction of that legislation.  It has been acknowledged by speakers from all sides of the House that pirate stations have been in existence for the past ten years. If we were to go back ten years to 1977 we would find that a Fianna Fáil Government were in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>They failed to come to grips with that problem.  The Government at that time had an opportunity to do something about this problem but they failed to take it.  In 1979 the Labour Party adopted a position on this issue, encompassing both radio and television broadcasting.  It formed part of a 14-point plan for Government agreed with our former partners in Government.  The Labour Party felt that they owed it to their tradition and members that in or out of Government they would stick with that position but this we failed to do due to a lack of co-operation from the then Minister, Deputy Mitchell.  I do not think the Labour Party can be faulted for remaining loyal to what they stand for. Deputies took it upon themselves last night to attack the Labour Party for their failure in this regard and this will influence any decision I might take in the future about entering into any agreement with any other party in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are mainly concerned with public broadcasting and nothing which I have heard here tonight allays my fears in any way.  This motion deals specifically with <Col N="1772" /> the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988 introduced to update the Wireless Telegraphy Acts of 1926 to 1972, and the Broadcasting Offences Act, 1968.  We should reflect for a moment on the passage of that legislation through the House.  On 25 November 1987 the Minister, Deputy Burke, moved that Second Stage be ordered for Tuesday, 1 December 1987, subject to agreement between the Whips.  At that point I rose and offered the Taoiseach and the Minister the full co-operation of the Labour Party in allowing this legislation to go through without debate but that offer was not accepted.  It is also worth noting, as other speakers have said, that at no time during the passage of that legislation through this House or the Seanad was a vote called for by any party or individual Deputy.  The only amendments moved were amendments in the name of the Minister and those specifically dealt with the fines which would have to be paid by anyone who continued to broadcast illegally after 31 December 1988.  All of those amendments went through without a division being called. However, to be fair to Deputy Richard Bruton he fired a warning shot on that occasion and said to the Minister that the deadline of 31 December would not be met but the Minister, I regret to say, would not accept this and I have no doubt as to the sincerity of Deputy Bruton in this regard.</P>
    <P>On that occasion the Minister said that this deadline would help in concentrating our minds in having the legislation introduced within a short period.  Obviously our powers of concentration were not very good as now, only 17 days from the end of December, all the Minister has to offer is far from satisfactory.  The chaos on the airwaves is likely to continue for a considerable time.  The Minister owes this House an explanation as to why he did not fulfil his promise given on 18 June last when he said he could give legitimate applicants an assurance that they would be operating legally and would not be in competition with illegals after 31 December 1988 and that this was giving the illegal stations enough time to get off the <Col N="1773" /> air.  Is the Minister now prepared to stand over this assurance?  Perhaps I have been a little unkind to the commission in that, although the Bill was enacted before the summer recess, the Minister did not take it upon himself to appoint the commission until a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>In relation to the commission, once again I must express my concern at the way in which the commission were appointed, not in respect of the ability of some of the appointees but in respect of some of the omissions &mdash; the absence of any broadcasting practitioner; the absence of anybody from RTE; the absence of any representative of the youth of the country who have very definite views on broadcasting and the absence of any official trade union representation, and I stress official trade union representation.  Even at this stage I would ask the Minister to take the appropriate steps and fill the void left in his original appointments.  He can do this either by appointing new members or replacing existing members.</P>
    <P>The argument as to &ldquo;when and why&rdquo; has shifted somewhat to the type of system we are going to have, whether it should be a deflector system or a microwave system.  The Minister has opted for the microwave system, which as he has acknowledged, is going to cost a considerable amount of money.  A figure of £200 million has been mentioned and the cost of introducing the system into each household will cost about £300.  Who is going to provide £200 million?  These are figures which have been bandied around in recent times.</P>
    <P>One thing which is certain is that RTE will not be able to provide this type of capital investment.  This will exclude them from involvement in the system and it will give the stronger applicants an opportunity to monopolise the MMDS system.  Many questions have to be answered in this regard.  Deputy Pat O'Malley asked some very valid questions in his contribution tonight.  He expressed reservations about the effect of this system on the health of people but I think there is another consideration &mdash;<Col N="1774" /> its effect on the environment.  Pylons will be strung along the countryside and if this system goes to every part of the country some of the most scenic routes could be ruined by the imposition of these pylons on the landscape.  That is not in the interests of tourism and will not add aesthetically to the appearance of our countryside.</P>
    <P>My concern about the overall thrust of the Minister's broadcasting policy is what it will do to RTE.  RTE have served us loyally during the years but because of the huge investment which is required they will not be able to compete with the other stations.  They are now practically dependent on revenue from licence fees. Many stations which have money and which are able to invest money will take away from RTE their means of collecting revenue through advertising.  Any increase in the licence fee is subject to approval by the Minister of the day and thereby the Minister of the day, and not necessarily Deputy Burke, can put undue pressure on RTE.  I do not think this is a desirable development.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister and some of his colleagues in the back benches, such as Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, my fellow constituent, said they were very happy at what the Minister had done for Cork local radio.  I want to say a few words about my local radio station.  That radio station got a small extension but there has been a reduction in the number of staff in the station.  I do not understand why the Minister cannot make this an open-ended broadcasting station and enable stations which are capable of fulfilling the role intended for them to provide a service for 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Cork local radio are providing a very good service at present and I am very happy that I was one of the deputation who went to the then Minister, Mr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, which led to the setting up of Cork local radio.  It was a Labour Party Minister in a previous Coalition Government who set up Cork local radio, which I believe was the forerunner to this type of broadcasting.  We never got sufficient credit for doing that and I have no hesitation in shouting as <Col N="1775" /> loudly as I possibly can in giving the credit for this to the Labour Party which they justly deserve.</P>
    <P>With regard to the substantive motion before the House tonight I do not think I can recommend to my colleagues that they should suport it by virtue of the fact that several months ago we decided unanimously in this House that we would introduce this legislation without division and I do not think it would be right if I were now to change my mind in this regard.  The Minister has offered consolation to some people and obviously Deputy P. J. Morley who has just left was very successful in his representations regarding the deflector system and I wish him well in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party cannot, if nothing else, be accused of being inconsistent in this area.  We have maintained a steady course throughout the broadcasting debate.  Granted we did not achieve what we set out to achieve but I have no doubt that the Labour Party will be proved right regarding the future of broadcasting.  We are participating in <Col N="1776" /> the demise of RTE which I think is a regrettable and retrograde step.  I now want to hand over to my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins.</P>

      <P>I want to make a few points concerning the decisions which the House has to make this evening.  While the debate will not facilitate a general discussion on the philosophy which has influenced the Minister's recent broadcasting legislation it has in a way to be put within that context.  As Deputy O'Sullivan has said, what we are talking about is resolving some of the practical difficulties which have arisen in relation to the implementation of legislation which has been passed by this House.  I listened with great care to what Deputy Pat O'Malley said and while I agree with him in a number of important respects, which I will make clear in a moment, I think that the offering of even temporary cover to practically every illegal operator in the country would create an impossible situation later on in that it could be argued, in the event of a refusal of a licence to a station, that they had been recognised for the brief period but had not been recognised in the long term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the attitude taken in this House towards the debate on broadcasting policy.  I have listened with care on every occasion when these issues had been discussed in the House and I have noticed that there is never a reference made by members of the major parties to the Broadcasting Review Report of 1974.  This Broadcasting Review Committee include such people as Mr. Justice Murnaghan, Dr. T. K. Whitaker, Tomás Rosingrave, Mr. Brian McMahon and a number of others.  At paragraph 343 on page 20 of their report they said: &ldquo;The service should be a balanced service of <Col N="1777" /> information, enlightenment and entertainment for people of different ages, interests and tastes covering the whole range of programming in fair proportion&rdquo;. The Labour Party's response to the report in 1974 was to state a coherent policy which stressed the advantage of the accountability that public service broadcasting offered.  We were also in favour &mdash; and this is reflected in our statement in 1978 at the beginning of the debate on the future of broadcasting &mdash; of a wide range of choice, a wide range of technological development and the recognition of new and merging tastes. However, we raised the question: can a marketplace theory of broadcasting provide any mechanism of accountability such as to make it attractive to erode entirely the accountability being provided by public service broadcasting?</P>
      <P>It was this kind of careful thinking in relation to the future structure of broadcasting that led us to seek and receive an assurance in the <i>Programme for Government</i> of the last Coalition that there would be an orderly development of community radio with RTE participation.  It is not the fault of the Labour Party that this was never turned into reality.  We are attacked again and again because we would not live with the gross distortion of that clear commitment.  In the course of the argument which followed an easy sleight of hand was indulged in with regard to what was meant by community radio.  We specified what we meant by community radio and we separated it again in the most recent legislation.  I drew attention to it on 10 February 1988 in the Dáil.  We drew a distinction between local community radio and commercial radio.  Part of the blackmail was that we should accept commercial radio where it would be profitable and then a great deal of concessions would be made in relation to community radio where clearly commercial radio would not be profitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several issues are posed.  I attended a conference four weeks ago in Athens on the future of broadcasting by satellite. Some of the most responsible norms in <Col N="1778" /> international broadcasting are being frittered away.  The ascendancy of commercial criteria within the future of satellite broadcasting has put into clear danger the European Broadcasting Union.  Representatives of he EBU have openly said they may not be able to sustain in a commercial environment the reciprocity agreements which they have entered into between countries.  The EBU and their counterparts in eastern Europe may be put out of business because of the new commercial stength. We have seen in Britain the acceptance of market criteria purely.  Here I am afraid we will have the acceptance of a market theory of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>That must be put within the general context of the structure of communications within Ireland.  In the print media here we are living with a degree of quasi-monopoly which would not be tolerated in many democratic countries. Single individuals and companies control up to 34 per cent of the printed media in any one week.  We do not want that tendency in radio.  The whole thrust of the Labour Party philosophy has been internationally to respect cultural pluralism and nationally to respect diversity and to honour and recognise the contribution made by public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I will finish by putting a few questions which the Minister should address, particularly in relation to the infatuation with the MMDS system.  The system when tested in the United States covered just 70 per cent of some of the areas where it was installed.  There are not any published costings in relation to the implementation of the system.  There is some published work in relation to radiation levels.  The Minister has given an assurance on this tonight, but public lack of acceptance could lead in the establishment of the system to planning objections which could cause a very long delay. The environmental impact has already been stressed by Deputy O'Sullivan. Another question is whether this in the end might be an investment in an obsolete technology.  The whole thrust and impact of satellite has been to offer through a <Col N="1779" /> two-way system of cable the best advantages of developed technology.  Why take money from the public purse and spend it in a way that despoils the environment, with unknown risks and in a quite uncertain way and then say that down the road when we have the satellite impact harnassed through technology we will have a two-tier level of usage of the technology of the future?  These are very real questions and there is no point in ignoring them.  It is a case, I am afraid, of a certain infatuation with the capacity of an unknown product.  That product, where it has been tested, has clearly left 30 per cent of its area unserved.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for sharing his time and I hope there will be another opportunity to debate the references which have been made in this House to the third channel.  If the third channel is a commercial channel within which commercial criteria predominate we can say goodbye to any concept of people having the right to tell their own story.  In the end what we have witnessed in the dominance of the market theory of broadcasting is the corruption and abuse of the concept of freedom.  What people are speaking about on the Right is the freedom of those with money to abuse the fundamental freedoms of those without money to tell their own story.  That was the old defence of public service broadcasting and the argument has not been answered.  It has been defeated by the many supporters of the Right, the market and the money in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Bruton since it was his motion which proved to be the catalyst for this debate. It succeeded in gaining a partial concession by way of ministerial capitulation <Col N="1780" /> in this area which I hope will be responsible for leaving people in rural Ireland with the six-channel service they have enjoyed for the past few years, thanks to the technical ingenuity of people branded as illegals.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's motion set out to do two things which were vastly different.  It dealt with two totally different areas of broadcasting, telegraphy or television. Whether we like it or not, the illegal broadcasting stations, as they have been branded, have mushroomed throughout Ireland in response to community needs. They have found a way into the hearts of people, particularly in rural Ireland. They have identified with particular wants and have become so ingrained into the life of rural Ireland that their withdrawal would have led to a considerable feeling of loss and denial.  We accept that it is time to legalise them.  They have become very profitable commercial operations and they are considerable employers.  We lauded the Minister's attempts in the Bill to legalise them.  It was long overdue and welcomed by all. However, we do not accept that there is a need for a time lapse and that it is absolutely imperative to clear the airwaves. The problem is exacerbated because we find it extremely difficult, despite the Minister's assurance tonight and the commitment given on radio last Sunday, to see how the deadline of next March can be met.  We welcome the Minister's attempts but we do not accept that it is feasible or administratively possible.</P>
      <P>We should like to see a synchronisation between the blacking out of the illegal stations and the coming on stream of the licensed operators.  On the day the commission announce the new licenses, the full vigour of the law should be brought to bear against those who stay on the air without licences.  They should be ruthlessly dealt with and the penalties should be invoked to the full.  These private profit-making enterprises should be left on the air until such time as the replacement operations can take over. The Minister would have our full support in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1781" /> I as a rural Deputy resent the patronising attitude of the prime example of a Pale politician, Deputy Liam Lawlor. He first of all derided this side of the House for allegedly supporting illegals. He then lectured us on the obligations we had to support the Minister in his acts. Thirdly, he derided the quality of the service being provided by those who operate the deflector system in rural Ireland.  There is nothing wrong with the quality of the deflector system in rural Ireland.  The people who operate this system have managed to identify a signal in the sky and have redeflected and amplified it to give a top quality service to people in 120,000 homes throughout rural Ireland who otherwise would not have had the privilege of this type of service for the past number of years.  I venture to suggest to the Minister that irrespective of what licences are given to MMDS operators it is not technically feasible or economically viable that an alternative replacement system will be put in place to replace the system that the homes in rural Ireland enjoy tonight.</P>
    <P>I want again to compliment Deputy Bruton.  Were it not for this eleventh hour intervention we would not have this grudging concession and capitulation on the part of the Minister tonight.  What the Minister has done is given a nod that he is prepared to allow, <i>pro tem,</i> the existing deflector system to remain.  We are not legalising them, as Deputy O'Malley has said.  What we are doing is making less illegal an illegal system that is in existence at present.  I do not believe, irrespective of what the Minister says, it is beyond the administrative or legal capacity of the draftsmen in the Department of Communications to come up with a system that will temporarily or permanently legalise those systems once and for all.  As far as I am concerned, go deo go breá if we are waiting for MMDS. With all its faults, failings and technical difficulties, we will never have such a system in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>The arrogance of this Minister at the opening of his speech in accusing this side of the House of political opportunism takes the biscuit for brass neck.  He obviously had not read the end of his speech when he made that comment. Deputies will recall that this Minister came into the House in November 1987 with sham legislation.  It was only due to the tolerance of Deputies on this side of the House that it was not blasted out of the water on the first day.  The Minister finally agreed to sensible legislation, substantially taking on board amendments from this side of the House. That legislation is much the same as that which was moved here in 1985, which the Minister's party opposed.  It will make people laugh to hear why they opposed it &mdash; because the Government intended to appoint the commission.  Is that a monument to his party's lack of political opportunism in this area?  The reality is that the Minister is asking us to share his optimism that some of the stations will be on air in March.  Where is the policy paper on MMDS that he promised in May?  Where is his optimism realised in that regard?  What of his promise to have stations broadcasting by 1 January, which he stated in the Seanad in reply to this debate?  Where was his optimism there? The Minister is consistently offering more froth than porter when he is speaking to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that we are not going to achieve a March deadline.  All the Minister is seeking to do by setting the March deadline is put the commission under pressure to rush decisions that are of enormous long-term importance to the community.  He forgets the solemn requirements that we set for the commission and the stations when we passed that legislation.  The commission have to choose candidates, bearing in mind very complex criteria which we debated here at length, concerning their expertise, programme quality, ownership, the extent of news coverage that they would supply, and so on.  The commission are obliged to draw up codes of practice governing fair news coverage, advertising, party political broadcasts, fees, royalties and <Col N="1783" /> so on.  These are all duties of the commission. The Minister's recent disgraceful outburst against RTE's news coverage underlines the importance that there should be proper guidelines for news coverage on these new stations that are to come on air.  That is a duty we gave to the commission, one that must be observed and exercised, and that cannot be done within the March deadline.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind that these stations are required to have planning permission.  As the Minister well knows, that will take a minimum of two months. The stations also have to get individually made equipment to fit the frequencies that they will be allocated.  The only way the stations can be on air in March is by licensing the existing pirate stations, without any detailed scrutiny of applications that we in this House require should be done by the commission.  That is the reason we cannot accept that the Minister will achieve the March deadline.  There will be far too long a delay between the closure of the existing stations and the opening of the alternatives.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's change of heart on the MMDS system.  In all his lecturing about consistency and observation of the law he seems to have forgotten that his party spent five years of Government observing the lawlessness in this area.  He is now quite happy, by a nod and a wink, to change the date for the new penalties but he is not going to proceed with the law in regard to the deflectors.  Where is his consistency in that?</P>
    <P>The change that Fine Gael are proposing tonight will no way undermine the credibility of what the Government are seeking to do and what this House agreed should be done in the area of broadcasting.  The Minister changed the date for the closure of pirate broadcasting stations and deflector systems from March 1988 to December 1988.  He is now changing the date for another group. The credibility of this legislation will <Col N="1784" /> depend on the public's respect for the reasonableness of the approach he is taking.  If we take off the air stations that have been providing a service for many years, many of them providing services that people find very valuable and that attract a high level of listenership, with no prospect of early alternatives &mdash; that is the reality, whatever the Minister says about it &mdash; we will only undermine public respect for the law which will govern what should be a sensible, valuable, independent radio sector.</P>
    <P>All we are getting from the Minister is an attempt to rush his fences and to pretend that he did not squander time. Four months were squandered after the passage of this legislation when he did not appoint the commission.  He is now putting the commission under extreme pressure to do valuable and important work in assessing who should be the long-term broadcasters and what guidelines they should operate under.  He thinks that can be done in a few months.  He is forgetting about the requirements of planning permission.</P>
    <P>This is not respect for the law.  What we need is a sensible transition from the old to the new system.  The Minister recognises the desirability of having a short time gap between the old and the new systems.  He has already changed the date in respect of pirate stations.  All we are asking tonight is for him to do the sensible thing and allow a proper, phased transition from the old system to the new. We have consistently supported and helped the Minister and succeeded in getting decent legislation through the House instead of what he initially proposed.  The Minister should accept the motion that is before him and the intention behind it, to provide credibility for this legislation that will see us into the next century.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 21:</P>
    <P>In page 24, subsection (1), lines 36 to 44, and in page 25, lines 1 to 5, to delete paragraph (e) and substitute the following:</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this amendment adjourned before Private Members' Business I was making the point that I regarded the thresholds which had been applied under section 24 to be far too high.  The Minister indicated he had taken the thresholds from the Fourth Directive &mdash; this is the Directive which the EC has agreed in relation to disclosure of company information etc. While that may well be suitable for Britain or other major industrialised countries in the EC, when you apply it to Ireland you effectively exempt a large number of private limited companies as a result of the thresholds which have been applied.  As I said before the debate adjourned, setting the level of exemption at £2.5 million turnover with £1.25 million as assests and 50 as the number of employees, is setting it far too high.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he would have difficulty in policing the number of companies concerned for what are known as quasi loans and credit transfers because of the large numbers involved.  It is estimated that there are about 25,000 private limited companies in the State.  If the Minister decides that a company ought to be investigated and, if upon investigation the only indication of &ldquo;funny business&rdquo; relates to the use of company money through what is known as quasi loans or credit transfers, by exempting them under this section he effectively is allowing them off the hook; he is effectively depriving himself of the right to investigate and pursue that company for misappropriation of company funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite happy to allow the Minister to introduce an amendment which would exempt very small family run businesses where perhaps husband and wife, brothers and sisters or whatever would be running a small company and basically employing themselves, and they may make arrangements between themselves with regard to lending each other money, paying one another's expenses or buying one another carpeting for their houses, or video machines and &mdash; or whatever other transactions they may be involved in.  That is quite in order, but when you are dealing with a company who would <Col N="1794" /> have a turnover of £2.5 million and the number of employees close to 50 you are dealing with something very different, particularly in relation to employees whose future is being put at risk.  The Minister by refusing to accept our amendment is insisting that companies of this size will be exempted.  I ask him to explain why he has decided willy-nilly to take on board the criteria in the Fourth Directive or, as Deputy Bruton has pointed out, the thresholds which exist in the company law of the UK.  Why does he believe those thresholds apply equally well to the Irish situation?  I have argued, and the ICTU have pointed out, that there are far more small companies here which come under the thresholds the Minister has outlined than there are, even as a proportion of companies, in Britain or in other major industrial states in the EC.  I fail to see how we can justify the exemption of so many of our private companies.  It is providing a major loophole in the Bill and perhaps a major incentive for companies to attempt to shape their turnover, assets or the numbers they have employed by allowing this threshold to remain as it is in the Bill.</P>

      <P>It might be better if an overall limit were put on the total amount by way of loans or quasi loans that a company may give to directors rather than outlawing individual loans.  If the Minister is going to have difficulty in enforcing the law in regard to quasi loans he is going to have exactly the same difficulty in regard to the ordinary loans to directors which are being outlawed right across the board if they exceed £2,500.  It might be more practical, as a means of protecting creditors, if the Minister was to say that instead of this approach that if there is an excess of any category of loan in the company which is more than a given percentage, say, of a company's turnover, it constitutes an offence rather than attempting what may be virtually <Col N="1795" /> unenforceable, dealing with individual loans.  If the Minister was to require information to be given in the accounts about the overall amount of the quasi loans rather than the individual transactions and police that through the company accounts it would be much easier to enforce than the approach the Minister is adopting, given that the purpose of this is to protect creditors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise the question of the work conditions existing at Southern Unijig, a company which I previously knew as Southern Unijig (Ireland) Components Limited.  The reason I believe this issue should be of concern to the House is because employees of that company who were found through the Jobsearch programme work in conditions that are less than desirable.  I am also concerned that the practices should continue at the company. The company is situated on the campus of University College Dublin, at Belfield, in the job company innovation centre.  It is a matter of considerable concern that UCD, an institution of learning and enlightenment, allows the practices I hope to unfold tonight.  These facts were brought to my attention by a constituent, Mr. Anthony Grimes, Marion Park, Baldoyle. The House should know a little about Mr. Grimes to understand the insult that this sage represented to him and his family.  He is 46 years of age and has had 26 years of constant employment <Col N="1796" /> as a toolmaker/manufacturer with various reputable companies in the city such as Technicon, Unidare and Sambra Fyffe.  He was, through no fault of his own, laid off in April 1986 from Technicon, having spent nine years with them. He was obliged to look to the State for assistance for his family of two children, aged 14 and nine years, both of whom were at school.  Up to the time of his employment with the company Southern Unijig he was in receipt of an amount a little short of £90 per week.</P>
      <P>During the months prior to his employment with this company I had occasion to make representation to his constituency Member, Deputy Michael Woods, Minister for Social Welfare, in regard to the attention, close scrutiny, if not harassment by the Minister, through his Department, of Mr. Grimes.  Despite his excellent work record, good qualifications and many efforts to find employment, Mr. Grimes was being accused by the Department of Social Welfare of being engaged in some form of subterfuge and work.  Suggestions were made that because he had a glasshouse he was growing and selling vegetables when all that came out of the glasshouse were chrysanthemums for the local church.  It was suggested that he was earning a living from cleaning windows when, in fact, he was, through good mercy cleaning the windows of his mother's house, and those of another widowed lady in the estate where he lived.  There was a suggestion that because he had a mini motor car parked in his driveway he had other independent means despite the fact that the motor car was a modest gift from his father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faced with those accusations Mr. Grimes welcomed very much the letter, dated 5 April 1988, from FÁS to the effect that they were happy, through the Minister's Jobsearch programme, to say that a position had been found for him and that he should notify the office without delay.  He did so and was advised by the person in charge that he should ring a &ldquo;Mr. Murphy&rdquo; at Southern Unijig Components Limited where an interview would be arranged for him.  He rang that <Col N="1797" /> number and spoke to &ldquo;Mr. Murphy&rdquo; for an hour and a half and, eventually, was brought to the company in Belfield.  He was met by &ldquo;Mr. Murphy&rdquo; who talked to him and, ultimately, offered him a job. In fact, &ldquo;Murphy&rdquo; was not that person's correct name and even the office of FÁS was constantly given a wrong name.  The Minister, who was providing employees for that company, was dealing with a person who was using a fictitious name.</P>
    <P>The company, Southern Unijig Components Limited, was incorporated on 16 April 1987 with a possible potential share issue capital of £50,000 of which two of £1 each have so far been taken up.  The sole directors are Mr. and Mrs. Peter Traynor and the company is located at Campus Innovation Centre at Roebuck in UCD.  An interesting fact about the company, and Mr. Traynor, is its close association with another company which at that time was in difficulty due to industrial action.  I am referring to the company of Packard Electric in Tallaght.  Mr. Traynor had previous close associations with that company.  Labelling and packaging found at Southern Unijig, and retained by me, clearly indicate a close association.  The strong indication is &mdash; hence the reason for the <i>nom de plume,</i> so described by the UCD authorities, of &ldquo;Mr. Murphy&rdquo;&mdash; that there was an attempt to mask the people behind the company.  The origins of the company arose out of a desire to circumvent the industrial action faced by Packard Electric at the time and carry on the work piecemeal on the UCD campus.</P>
    <P>Mr. Grimes was advised by Jobsearch that there were a few basic conditions of work.  He was told that he could hope to support himself and his family on a basic wage of £170 per week, would work from 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. but that the work might prove to be of a temporary nature. When he met &ldquo;Mr. Murphy&rdquo; he was advised that the conditions offered were generally the same as those outlined to him.  However, after three days with the company he was presented with a written contract.  That document portrayed a somewhat different picture.  Firstly, he would be required to work from 8 a.m., <Col N="1798" /> as opposed to 9 a.m., to 4.30 p.m., as opposed to 5 p.m.  He was also told that he would be paid on a fortnightly basis, as opposed to a weekly basis and, particularly that he would be obliged to do all overtime expected of him by the company. It was indicated to him that due to the piecemeal nature of the work of the company, closely related to a bigger parent organisation, he would be required to do all overtime and take his holidays when the company decided.  He was not to be paid for any overtime and he would not be paid for any holidays he did not take up.  On the other hand, he would be given time off.</P>
    <P>Mr. Grimes was somewhat startled and took the contract home.  After eight days considering it he was presented with an ultimatum, sign the contract or no job. Had he at that stage decided to take a firm stand on the issue and not sign the contract no doubt, in view of the earlier accusations levelled at him, he would not have been considered by the Department for unemployment benefit or assistance. He would have had difficulty getting any further assistance on a second ground because it could have been argued that it was as a result of his own decision that he left employment, that he was not dismissed. At the end of the day the ultimatum he faced was, accept the job on the conditions offered or he would have no job and, in all probability, no assistance from the Department.</P>
    <P>The other interesting feature was that Mr. Grimes also established that the other six or seven employees on the shift were in a similar situation.  They had come from the Jobsearch programme, were about middle aged and were highly qualified for the jobs they were given and expected to do.  Though he had been employed as a toolmaker, it was made clear in the contract that he would be required to do all jobs his employers might direct him to do.</P>
    <P>This is a worrying feature even more so when one looks at what happened when he settled into his job.  Within a short period he was working overtime at the rate demanded by his employers, including Saturdays, so he was working <Col N="1799" /> five and a half days a week.  He lived on the north side close to the Howth peninsula, near Baldoyle, and was required to travel to the south side, a feature not to be overlooked.  The Department of Social Welfare have maintained the regime that unless people look outside their locality they will not be considered to be seriously looking for work.  A half hour was allowed each day by the company for lunch and that was the only break beyond a tea break in the afternoon at the workplace.</P>
    <P>However, the pattern of work was as follows: in April, he worked 18 hours overtime, in May 20 hours, in June 28 hours and in July seven hours.  That was 73 hours overtime but not a penny was paid for it.  Having been with the company at that stage for upwards of four months and having worked 73 hours overtime he could not expect one penny extra. All he got was £170 into his hand.</P>
    <P>However, when it occurred to the company that the employee might be entitled to time off and that the question of holidays might well arise, what happened? Coming to the end of the period of employment by the company he was dismissed. A letter dated 14 July was sent to him at a time when he was, in fact, laid off.  Two weeks previously he had been told he should take time off because at this stage the company's workload had decreased.  He was simply laid off and sent home, but the £170 continued to be sent to him.  Two weeks later on 14 July he was dismissed as of 29 July.</P>
    <P>The question I should like to ask is if the company's workload has increased and has the Jobsearch provided to this company more employees from their group of well qualified people.  For how long has this pattern existed whereby Jobsearch provides highly qualified people with long records of work and experience to companies such as this, and these people are then literally bullied and pushed about, kept for a short duration, and once their usefulness has come to an end on a seasonal or cyclical basis are dismissed into the unemployed circle and someone else is taken on so that there is <Col N="1800" /> no period of commitment in terms of other conditions, for example, the 12 months requirement to deal with unfair dismissal or the condition of two years employment to deal with redundancy. This pattern was clearly emerging in the short time Mr. Grimes was with this company and he certainly experienced this at first hand.</P>
    <P>I raised all of these issues in correspondence with the Minister for Social Welfare.  His answer to me was that as I had also written to the Minister for Labour he would await the outcome of that.  The function of the Minister for Labour is clear.  I have written to him regarding the conditions of employment and he has adequately answered me except for one outstanding issue which he has undertaken to answer.</P>
    <P>In seeking this Adjournment Debate I specifically wanted to highlight the role of Jobsearch in this saga of providing qualified men or women from the work-force, through this great scheme, for jobs where they are summarily dismissed and other people hauled in.  I wanted to chase down this issue, this concept that Jobsearch was such a constructive and useful mechanism, providing good placement employment.  Indeed, the Minister for Labour, in part answering for the Minister for Social Welfare indicated this point.  In a letter to me he said that the national Jobsearch programme was aimed at assisting the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed. That is so but let us be clear that it is there or should be there to assist these people obtain good and useful employment that will keep them off the dole queues in the future.  That is not what is happening, at Southern Unijig Components Limited in UCD.</P>
    <P>I raised the matter with the UCD authorities as an institution of learning and of enlightenment.  I thought it was incumbent on them to ensure that whatever institutions were invited onto their campus would adhere to some of the principles and conditions that have now been introduced into work practices and ensure that the type of regime, something from another era, which was forced on <Col N="1801" /> Mr. Grimes and his fellow employees would not exist on the campus.  I have to say that the response of UCD was disappointing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the contract and conditions of employment they indicated that these were all matters for another forum.  They said it was not for the college to rule on the legality or otherwise of this document.  This referred to the contract of employment presented to Mr. Grimes. Regarding the false name which they called in the terms a <i>nom de plume,</i> they said there were sound business considerations for using the <i>nom de plume</i> related in some way to the non-availability of a telephone.  This is a remarkable explanation to be presented with by such an institution of enlightenment.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, this man, Mr. Anthony Grimes, who has given good employment to companies in this city, who has contributed consistently, over a long period by way of taxes, PRSI contributions and so on to the State, found when he became unemployed for the first time in his working life that he was harassed by the Department of Social Welfare and crossquestioned on his means.  He was eventually placed in a job where he was exploited and abused.  He is now back on the unemployment queues which are ever mounting.  What are his prospects?  His prospects are that one day he may again receive another letter from the same agency saying that there is work available for him.  How can we seriously ask Mr. Grimes, or any one like him to have confidence in that type of system?  It is a sad day when these facts have to be outlined at such length in this House.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Minister for Social Welfare understands the extent to which his scheme is being abused.  I believe that Mr. Grime's case fully illustrates the dangers of not properly policing the system.  I had hoped this matter would have been taken by the Minister for Social Welfare and that his Department would appreciate the seriousness of the concern behind the motion.  However, I hope that the Minister for Defence, who is here on behalf of the Minister for <Col N="1802" /> Labour &mdash; I thank him for coming in and listening to what I have to say &mdash; will take it back to the Minister for Social Welfare to apprise him of the abuse that I suspect is far more widespread than in just one company and to have the matter investigated so that such abuse will not be continued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick West</i>): The specific allegation made by Deputy McCartan on behalf of a constituent in the context of a referral for employment under the Jobsearch programme has been investigated by the relevant inspectorates of the Department of Labour.  They investigated suggestions that the employment conditions as they pertain to working hours and overtime practices were not in compliance with the provisions of the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 to 1944.  Those specify a maximum working week of 48 hours plus an additional 12 hours overtime.  They also stipulate that an employee is entitled to a minimum break of half an hour in advance of overtime working with a duration of one and a half hours or more.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, has communicated with Deputy McCartan regarding the specification in the employee's contract in this case that overtime worked would be compensated by time off in lieu rather than through direct monetary payment.  There is legal uncertainty on the permissibility of such an arrangement and as the Deputy is aware that particular matter has been raised for clarification with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
      <P>Individuals are referred for job placement under the Jobsearch programme by FAS.  That programme has as its main emphasis a serious effort to find acceptable employment, particularly for the long term unemployed.  Placement officers of FÁS will have registrants referred to vacancies notified to them and endeavour to evolve the best match as between applicants and the requirements of the vacancy on offer.  They do not have any direct function in relation to the conditions of employment which operate in the job context itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> Where an employee feels that employment conditions which he/she is required to work under are not in accordance with the provisions of protective employment law the employee has an absolute entitlement to seek redress by way of complaint to the Department of Labour.  The fact that employees may have been introduced to a job through the Jobsearch scheme in no way whatever detracts from an entitlement in that respect.  I should point out here that the incidence of complaints notified to the Department of Labour relating to conditions of employment in jobs obtained under the Jobsearch programme is insignificant.</P>
    <P>I wish to underline again that any employee seeking redress under the employment protection law on the Statute Book will have that complaint very fully examined and where penalties or compensation is prescribed by law such sanctions or restitution will be delivered.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour thinks it <Col N="1804" /> would be unfortunate if the Jobsearch programme, which is informed by the very proper objective of seeking a return to work for those most in need of worthwhile and remunerative occupations, were to be characterised as an official effort to condone the behaviour of employers who do not abide by their responsibilities prescribed in law relating to employment conditions.  That is not now, and never has been, a feature of the Jobsearch programme and the Government would be centrally concerned to ensure that any rogue employer who sought to exploit a perceived vulnerability on the part of those most in need of gainful employment would be held fully accountable for and made to pay the full penalty for any such despicable approach.</P>

There are no proposals at present to reopen any of the stations which closed at that time.  Apart from the capital costs involved, the establishment of new stations tends to absorb Garda manpower which, according to the Garda authorities, can be used more effectively on outdoor operational duties.</P>
      <P>In so far as the system of patrolling is concerned, the Deputy is probably aware that there is a pilot rural policing scheme in operation in the Claremorris and Thomastown Garda Districts.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 67 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board 1987-1988 is, in my view, a very full account of the first year of operation of the board.  It sets out in considerable detail statistics relating to the various categories of complaints received and to the action taken or being taken in respect of them.  The total number of complaints received is 1,015. At first sight this would seem to be a matter for some concern but it is noted that the board's view, based on comparisons which they make, is that the number is not &ldquo;particularly large&rdquo;.  Obviously, the matter is one which will need to be carefully monitored over the coming years with particular regard to the number and type of complaints being made and to the resources needed to deal with them.</P>
      <P>The report raises a number of issues which have a bearing on Garda training, personnel management and operational procedures and I will ensure that these will be examined by the Garda authorities. The Garda Complaints Act provides that the board, within three years of its establishment, shall report to me on the working of the system of investigation and adjudication of complaints.  The board has stressed that the views expressed in this, its first report, are preliminary and may be altered in the light of further experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the question of contrived complaints, I note that the report indicates that the evidence to the board is that organised abuse of the Garda Síochána Complaints Act is on a relatively small scale and accounts for no more than 1% to 2% of the compaints received by the board.  The board also point out that, while about 13% of complaints finalised by them in the first year were found to <Col N="1614" /> be vexatious, in the great majority of these cases the complaints appear to have been made as an act of individual retaliation and could not be considered as part of any organised campaign.  The report makes it clear that where evidence exists that a complaint was made maliciously, the board will normally refer the papers to the DPP.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of resources, the position is that the allocation of resources to any particular State funded body must be considered in the context of the constraints which apply to all areas of public expenditure at the present time. Notwithstanding those constraints the 1989 financial allocation for the board represents a 20% increase over that for 1988 and an additional staff member has been assigned to the board within the past few months.  In addition, the question of the staffing of the board will be considered in the light of a review of the board's workload which is nearing completion.</P>

      <P>Induction training for newly recruited officers was introduced in the early seventies and this type of training has gradually been developed into the present 12-week course.</P>
      <P>As some of the staff members currently serving were recruited before the introduction of induction training and others when the induction course was shorter than it is now, it would not be possible to say how many officers did not receive the full 12-week course without a detailed examination of the records, which would be expensive in terms of scarce staff resources which are required for more pressing duties.  Where, as happens occasionally, officers are prevented from attending the full induction course because of exceptional immediate needs for extra staff in the prisons, every effort is made to recall them for the periods of tuition they have lost.</P>
      <P>In addition to induction training, short in-service training programmes are provided in most of the institutions: about half of the serving prison officers received in-service training of this kind in the 12 months to 30 November 1988.

      <P>Regrettably, six people have died in prison custody this year.</P>
      <P>I made quite a lengthy statement to this House on 23 June 1988 in reply to a number of questions which raised issues similar to those referred to in this question. As I said on that occasion, every effort is made by the prison authorities to identify offenders who may be at risk and, where such offenders are identified, they are given special attention by prison staff with the specific objective of minimising the risk of self-injury.  Vigilance on the part of prison staff and of those who work in the support services in the various institutions clearly has a key part to play in this matter and I am satisfied that all concerned are fully aware of their responsibilities in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report on each death is carefully examined within my Department with a view to establishing whether there was any action that might have been taken that might have helped to bring a risk to notice or that might have lessened any risk that was known to exist in the particular case.  Careful attention is given to previous cases to see if it is possible to identify patterns of behaviour which might suggest some new line of preventive action.  Any measure of this nature that can be taken is, of course, taken immediately.  This examination fully covers the background and circumstances of all prison deaths and seeks as its specific objective to identify means by which future tragic deaths of this nature can be prevented.  I do not see that any form of inquiry in addition to <Col N="1620" /> that and the public inquiry by way of inquest which is held in all cases, would serve any useful purpose.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to private sector involvement in infrastructural projects to be submitted for European Structural Fund assistance that I referred to in my statement to the House of 7 December on the recent Rhodes European Council.</P>
      <P>The position is that a workshop has been organised on &ldquo;Private Participation in European Structural Funds Projects&rdquo; in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, for Monday next, 19 December.  The workshop arises from the fact that for the first time the regulations governing the European Community Structural Funds permit the matching of privately financed projects of public interest which contribute to economic development.  This was a point we pressed strongly in the negotiations on the regulations.  The kind of projects envisaged include toll roads and bridges, marine facilities, caravan parks, tourist and leisure facilities, heritage and cultural centres, science parks and forestry projects.  Some 100 representatives of private sector companies who are involved in these activities or in related areas have been invited to attend the workshop.</P>
      <P>The workshop will focus in the morning on setting out the background to the development of private investment and involvement in projects aided from the Structural Funds through public/private partnerships and also through strictly commercial private investment.  In the afternoon there will be group sessions to discuss specific sectors.  Arising out of the workshop, specific proposals can be made and discussed on an individual basis to preserve commercial confidentiality.</P>

      <P>I received an application for an increase in the minimum producer price for liquid milk in early September. The Government examined this application and in the context of their decision to set up a national milk agency decided not to adjust the statutory minimum producer price.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that agreement has recently been reached within the industry on a voluntary increase in producer prices from 1 December 1988.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if his attention has been drawn to the fact that when recently bought cattle are included in a test on the farm on which they have recently arrived they frequently show up as reactors because they may have been tested quite recently on the previous farm on which they were kept and the remnant of the injection for that test may cause a positive reaction in the second test; and if he will investigate the posssibility of ensuring that animals are now shown to react in these circumstances and thereby be slaughtered unnecessarily.</P>

      <P>The Director of ERAD has informed me that the normal minimum 60-day interval is generally observed between tuberculin tests and that where <Col N="1630" /> recently bought in cattle react to a tuberculin test the reaction is unlikely to be due to any remnant of an injection from a previous test.  It is more likely to be due to either (a) the animal having been in the preallergic phase of the disease at the previous test or (b) the animal not being infected at the previous test but having picked up infection during the subsequent interval.</P>

      <P>A person in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance can qualify for a fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme, provided he is living either alone or only with dependants.  The person concerned lives with his sister-in-law who is in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance in her own right and is not therefore his dependant.</P>
      <P>I extended the national fuel scheme to some 30,000 recipients of unemployment assistance living alone or with dependants for the first time in October 1987.  This category was excluded from the scope of the scheme before then and its extension in this way was a major achievement in present circumstances.  Any further extension would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>Apart from the national fuel scheme there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme whereby assistance can be given where a family has exceptional heating needs by reason of ill health or infirmity and it would be open to the family in this case to apply for assistance under that scheme.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>A widow aged under 66 years in receipt of a non-contributory widows pension with three dependent children receives a maximum weekly rate of £85.70.</P>
      <P>A widower in receipt of unemployment assistance (long term urban rate) with three dependent children receives a maximum weekly rate of £70.80.  An additional £28 could be payable where the widower is maintaining a person over 16 years of age who is looking after one or more of his children and who is normally resident with him.</P>
      <P>Details of the number of widowers in receipt of unemployment assistance with dependent children are not available. According to the 1987 labour force survey there were 4,800 widowed/ separated men who were unemployed. Assuming that all of these are in receipt of unemployment benefit/assistance or analogous payments the cost of paying a widow's non-contributory rate of pension to them would be of the order of £4 million in a full year.  The cost in respect of widowers only is not available.</P>
      <P>The cost of granting pensions to widowers on the same basis as they are currently made available to widows would be of the order of £26 million per annum.</P>

    <P>The question of extending the coverage of the national fuel scheme to other categories of social welfare recipients would have to be decided in the light of all the <Col N="1637" /> priorities which exist and the scarcity of resources.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the way in which he proposes to extend the benefits of the scheme for dental treatment of spouses of insured workers to people in Wexford who cannot avail of it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, no dentists in County Wexford have yet signed the new agreement in respect of the extended social insurance dental benefit scheme, which provides for the treatment of the dependent spouses of insured persons.</P>
      <P>The extension of the social insurance treatment benefit scheme to the dependent spouses of insured persons was introduced in October 1987.  The extension enabled dependent spouses, mainly wives working in the home, to obtain dental, optical and aural benefits on the basis of their spouse's PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>There was considerable demand for this extension and an analysis of dental claims from dependent spouses in the meantime shows that their initial treatment needs are significantly greater than those who had already been covered by the scheme.  It is clear that many spouses had neglected their dental health previously because they could not afford the private fees.</P>
      <P>The Irish Dental Association opposed the extension and as a result many dentists were dissuaded from signing the new agreement covering the extended scheme.  No dentist in Wexford has yet signed.  Notwithstanding the embargo, however, 179 dentists countrywide signed the new agreement and some 95 per cent of these are actively treating dependent spouses.  A total of 31,500 dental claims in respect of dependent spouses have been received up to 12 December 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1638" /> The most significant proposal in the report of the Joint Irish Dental Association/Department of Social Welfare Working Group, was the proposal of the Irish Dental Association concerning the introduction into the scheme, of a form of means testing on the basis of the Health Acts criteria.  This is not appropriate in the context of a contributory insurance based scheme.  The report also shows that over 62 per cent of those covered under my Department's scheme have incomes which come within the guidelines laid down for qualification for a medical card.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the central barriers against reaching agreement between the Department and the Irish Dental Association have turned out to be the level of fees paid to the dentists under the whole scheme and the apparent opposition on the part of the Irish Dental Association to the existence at all of such a broadly based scheme for workers and their dependent spouses under the PRSI system.</P>
    <P>However, independently of the proposals made in the report, the Irish Dental Association have recently submitted a claim for a fee increase under the existing scheme to cover inflation since 1987.  This claim is at present being examined in the Department.  It is hoped that agreement on the overall issue may emerge in the context of discussions regarding this claim for a fee increase and this is being pursued.  I expect to meet the representatives of the Irish Dental Association shortly.</P>
    <P>It is realised that the continuing embargo by the Irish Dental Association is causing inconvenience to some dependent spouses, those in County Wexford in particular, who are living a distance from participating dentists.  In order to minimise this inconvenience, the Minister arranged from the outset for the Department to supply the names of their nearest participating dentists to dependent spouses who wish to claim dental benefit.  Dependent spouses can obtain these names by contacting their local social welfare office or by telephoning the Department.  These arrangements have <Col N="1639" /> been in effect from the start and are operating well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the progress which has been <Col N="1646" /> made in the computerisation of customs clearance procedures for exports and imports; whether he accepts the CII estimate of £60 million savings per annum to Irish industry as an achievable target following computerisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The computerisation of customs clearance procedures for exports and imports is a very complex project which can be tackled in a number of quite different ways.  In order to ensure that the most cost effective choice is made having regard both to the interests of the Revenue Commissioners and the wider national interest independent consultants were commissioned to investigate the options and recommend how best to proceed. The Revenue Commissioners expect to receive the consultants recommendations before Christmas.</P>
      <P>I cannot comment on how soon customs clearance procedures will be computerised until this report is examined nor can I confirm the projected savings referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 97, 98 and 99 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1647" /> Statistics are not yet available which would enable the information requested by the Deputy to be given.  Sections 27, 28 and 29 of the Finance Act, 1988, reintroduced relief granted under section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981, and associated reliefs which provided for the set off of the construction or conversion cost of providing certain rented residential accommodation against rental income. Relief was also provided in respect of the cost of refurbishment of substandard buildings for multiple residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>It is tentatively estimated that the cost to the Exchequer of the reintroduction of these reliefs in terms of tax foregone will be negligible in 1988 and may eventually reach a full year cost of £9 million.</P>

      <P>Tourism measures which are directly linked to exploiting the tourist potential of the region in which they are located are eligible for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). However, full particulars would be required in order to accurately assess any particular project's eligibility for ERDF aid.</P>
      <P>In addition, loans are available from the European Investment Bank for capital investment projects in the tourism sector. Such loans are made available either directly by the Bank or through global loans with financial intermediaries.  Information on the eligibility criteria for such loans and the general terms and conditions which apply is available from my Department.</P>
      <P>As part of the revised western package which is funded from FEOGA (Guidance) consideration is being given to a scheme to promote agri-tourism in the less favoured areas.  The intention would be to place the main emphasis in the scheme on the provision of collective facilities and local centres for the development, promotion and marketing of agri-tourism.  The scheme will have to be agreed in consultation with the EC Commission.  The matter is being expedited with a view to having it finalised as quickly as possible.</P>

As has already been indicated, staff will be transferring to these locations from mid-1989 onwards.  As of now, the number of volunteers for these locations leaves a shortfall on some grades, and various options to make up these shortfalls are being considered.</P>

In this new situation a traffic warden has been provided for the school and the children resident at Holy Angels are now accommodated at the same side of the road as the school.</P>
      <P>I might add there is a question about the future of institutional care for persons who have a mild degree of mental handicap. This inevitably raises the question of the long-term use of Glenmaroon.  While this is in doubt it would be unwise to embark on major capital expenditure there particularly in view of the competing priorities for the limited building funds available.</P>

      <P>In order to predict the birth rate a number of assumptions need to be made in relation to fertility and migration.  For these reasons it is impossible to make long range projections with any degree of certainty.  In the Central Statistics Office's document, &ldquo;Population and Labour Force Projections: 1991-2021&rdquo; published in April 1988, assumptions are used which give rise to a range of population projections.  It should be stressed <Col N="1667" /> that by their nature these assumptions, particularly for the longer term, are quite speculative.  The table below gives the average annual birth rate projected for <Col N="1668" /> each five year period between 1986 and 2010 for the medium migration assumption taken with each of the two fertility assumptions.</P>
