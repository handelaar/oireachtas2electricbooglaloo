      <P>I wish to oppose the guillotine being imposed on the Social Welfare Bill.  As far as I know, we have reached only section 6, and there are 89 sections in the Bill.  There is still ample time before Easter and I cannot understand why the guillotine must be imposed.  Could we not allot all day today to this Bill?  We have not been involved in the discussions to create a guillotine.  I oppose guillotines regularly and I certainly oppose one on the Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I was hoping that you might assist me in clarifying a matter.  Last week I tabled a question to be answered by the Taoiseach relating to the Attorney General's office. It is the tradition in this House that the Taoiseach answers such questions.  The particular question related to extradition arrangements between this State and Great Britain.  I will not go into the detail of that.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1988: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 5, lines 1 to 10, to delete subsection (1), and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;(1) Section 10 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution for paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (1) of the following paragraphs:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(b) Subject to paragraph (d) of this subsection, to subsection (7) and to regulations under section 7, where in any contribution year a payment is made to or for the benefit of an employed contributor in respect of reckonable earnings of that employed contributor, there shall be payable an employment contribution comprising&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  by an employed contributor, a contribution at a rate (to be specified in regulations) of reckonable earnings, the upper limit (if any) of which shall be specified in regulations,</P>
    <P>(ii)  by an employer, a contribution at a rate (to be specified in regulations) of that employee's reckonable earnings, the upper limit (if any) of which shall be specified in regulations and which may be the same or different to any upper limit specified under sub-paragraph (i).</P>
    <P>(c) (i)  The regulations referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (b) may exempt a portion of income under subparagraph (i) or (ii) of paragraph (b) or both, or either make no exemption or different exemptions.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Any regulations made under <Col N="708" /> this section (including this subsection) may be amended or revoked.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Where regulations under this subsection are proposed to be made, a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and no such regulation shall be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy J. Mitchell.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very simple section which makes provision for an increase in the earnings ceiling for the pay related social insurance contribution from the existing level of £15,500 of reckonable earnings to £16,200 with effect from 6 April.  The increase in revenue generated by this measure is expected to be some £2 million in the curent year.  I see this as a reasonable increase.  Let us consider the increases in the ceiling of contributions for the past number of years.  In 1983 there was an increase from £9,500 to £13,000 &mdash; £3,500 or 36.8 per cent; in 1984 there was no increase; in 1985 there was an increase of 6.1 per cent; in 1986 there was an increase of 6.5 per cent; in 1987 there was an increase of 5.4 per cent and in 1988 there is a 4.5 per cent increase, the lowest in recent years. Deputy Mitchell's amendments No. 16, 17 and 18 are related.  The first line of amendment No. 16 reads: &ldquo;In page 5, lines 1 to 10, to delete subsection (1), and substitute the following:&rdquo;.  That would have the effect of deleting the increase in the ceiling of £16,200, and I could not accept this amendment as it is phrased at present.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, in view of the fact that the debate on the Committee Stage is to be curtailed.  I should like to ask the Minister to be brief in his replies.  I get the impression that the Government have decided to engage in a filibuster to try to prevent us reaching some of our amendments.  Bearing in <Col N="709" /> mind that the Minister is getting co-operation from us in regard to this debate will he agree to be brief and not as longwinded as he has been?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The changes suggested by Members in their amendments are major ones and I must respond to them.  If the House accepted the amendments serious difficulties for the financing of the social welfare system would arise.  About three minutes before the Adjournment last night I commenced my reply to the many points made in support of these amendments. The suggestion in amendment No. 16 is that we should exempt a portion of income or make no exemption or different exemptions and that we should give power to make regulations, subject to the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not have any objection to that principle although other Members may object to dealing with such matters in that fashion.  It would give the Minister flexibility and make the system more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, another amendment proposes major changes to section 6.  For example, amendment No. 17 proposes the introduction of a turnover tax which will have wide implications.  If we adopt amendment No. 16 there will be serious <Col N="710" /> cost implications.  For instance, to exempt the first £1,000 would involve a cost of £125 million on the social insurance fund.  Exemption of the first £2,000 would involve a cost of £237 million and an exemption of the first £3,000 would involve a cost of £339 million.  I mention those costs to give an indication of the implications of accepting that amendment.  However, I will be reviewing that area but I must point out that a major change is involved.  I am sure the House would like an opportunity to discuss the implications of such a change in a full debate.</P>
    <P>A fundamental purpose of the social welfare system is to provide a comprehensive system of occupational protection for workers and their families. The system is also designed to ensure the widest community support for people who cannot meet their needs through their own resources.  The system is funded on a tripartite basis by contributions from employers and employees and a subvention by the general Exchequer. Employer contributions are an integral part of this system and they reflect employer obligations as employers and are required by internationally-accepted standards of worker protection.  It is important to realise that the contribution by employers is a standard part of social security systems.</P>
    <P>PRSI contributions by employers in respect of their workers represent a net cost rather than a gross one in most cases. This arises for two reasons.  First, the cost of employer contributions is reduced through being fully deductible for tax purposes, as part of overall wage costs; this tax relief is a direct Exchequer subsidy to employers towards the cost of their wage bill and associated labour costs.  Secondly, employers generally would have to make some provision in any event for worker pension, sick-pay, maternity and occupational injury.  The social insurance provisions for these risks effectively spread the insurance cover across all employers in direct proportion to the size of their workforce.</P>
    <P>Employer and employee contributions have traditionally been based on <Col N="711" /> employee earnings.  This provides a readily identifiable yardstick and facilitates collection of contributions due.  The amendment proposes to restructure the employer's contribution to one based on turnover rather than on payroll.  The effect of the proposal, if it were to be done on a neutral cost basis, would be to reduce the PRSI burden for certain firms and increase it for others.  In general capital intensive firms would end up paying more and labour intensive firms would pay less.</P>
    <P>Proposals on these or similar lines have been discussed and considered at a number of different levels in recent years. The main argument put forward for a change of this kind is that the present system is a disincentive to employers to take on extra employees because of the additional PRSI costs involved.  There are a number of general points that might be made in relation to that, as follows: (i), in gross terms, employers' PRSI costs only amount to about 7 per cent of overall labour costs and are equivalent to a small percentage of turnover for most industrial sectors.  The net cost is even lower when other factors are taken into account; (ii), decisions by employers to hire new employees as opposed to working more overtime are far more likely to be influenced in the first instance by market demand and by the prevailing wage levels and income taxation than by the marginal impact of their extra PRSI liability; (iii), labour costs in general and employers statutory social security contributions in particular are low in Ireland when compared with most European and OECD countries.  Therefore, labour intensive industries in Ireland should already enjoy a significant competitive advantage in relation to this factor at least.  The most recently published OECD comparisons indicate that Government revenue from social welfare contributions amounts to only 5.74 per cent of GDP compared with the EC average of 12.05 per cent and an OECD average of 9.21 per cent.  The employers' element of PRSI contributions, currently 12.33 per cent is the third lowest in <Col N="712" /> the EC and, (iv), any shortfall in social insurance arising from modifications made to the PRSI system would have to be made good through either a higher Exchequer subvention to the fund or through increased PRSI rates.  An increased Exchequer subvention would necessitate additional borrowing or increases in general taxation and higher employee contributions would reduce the disposable income of the PAYE sector which already contributes heavily to tax revenue.  An increase in the general level of taxation would be likely to result in demands for compensatory wage increases which would in turn negate any possible employment gains.</P>
    <P>While employers' PRSI contributions are generally classed in economic terms as a disincentive affecting labour, there is in fact no agreement among economists as to how the direct effect of PRSI changes on employment should be measured. Pay-related social insurance contributions were introduced in this country in 1979.  This resulted in significant reductions in the level of contributions paid by employers in respect of workers in low paid employment as compared with the flat-rate system before that in force.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare examined the effects of these reductions and stated in their report that there was no conclusive evidence that they led to an increase in employment.  The report further stated that the more limited argument in favour of a reduction in pay-related social insurance in labour-intensive industries is questionable in that there is little proof that this would actually have direct effects on employment. The commission recommended the continuation of the present system with some modifications as in their view it offers the broadest, most clearly indentifiable and most predictable base available.</P>
    <P>This issue was also examined by the National Economic and Social Council in early 1986.  The council were particularly struck by the absence of conclusive evidence on the likely employment impact of reducing employers' PRSI contributions and this was an over-riding <Col N="713" /> factor in determining attitudes towards the proposal.  The general feeling was that if the proposal were to be justified on employment creation grounds there would need to be a greater degree of certainty about its likely employment effects.</P>
    <P>Various international studies have been carried out and these have come up with broadly similar conclusions. A number of reports and studies on the question of having a contribution based on value added as a new basis for calculating social security contributions have been made in recent years. However, there are major questions about its practicability and suitability which have yet to be answered.  Among more important points which have been made are reservations that such a system would actually reduce costs in labour-intensive sectors; secondly, whether the value added system is appropriate for the services sector; thirdly, a system of contributions based on value added would mean that persons who do not employ staff, such as self-employed, some wholesalers, members of the professions, would be liable for contributions; fourthly, the practical difficulties in implementing such a system.</P>
    <P>Overall, most Council of Europe countries have serious reservations about this reform, doubting whether such a system would succeed in reducing the burden on labour-intensive firms.  Others stress the risk of fraud and point out that it could also have economic side effects such as price rises.  The various expert studies of this proposed system carried out at European level have also failed to show that it would relieve the burden on labour-intensive firms.  On the other hand, it is argued that it might lead to a fall in investment by penalising the most productive firms, with possible serious effects on employment and consumption. For these reasons, most countries have shown no desire to introduce this new basis for the calculation of contributions.</P>
    <P>Reports so far indicate the need for an in-depth study of the matter at European <Col N="714" /> level before any move in the direction proposed by this amendment could be recommended.  In addition to the global issues identified above, there is the more specific one, namely, that such a radical change in the financing of social security could not be adopted without detailed examination of the definition and calculation of turnover, which is not a straightforward matter.</P>
    <P>There is no definition of turnover in legislation.  It is generally taken to mean the value of goods and services to a third party, excluding VAT.  The proposed amendment would require that a watertight definition of turnover was drawn up to exclude the possibilities of abuse.  It is not clear that such a definition would not still be open to manipulation.  The proposal to base the employer contribution on turnover could also inhibit growth and productivity and could pose considerable problems for industry.</P>
    <P>The main criticisms of Irish industry is that they are not competitive enough and Deputy Mitchell's proposal could lead to a further deterioration here.  There are superficial attractions in a system which would transfer more of the financing burden from labour-intensive to capital-intensive industry but any proposal on these lines would need to be closely examined from an economic point of view and capital-intensive industries which are operating in a very competitive environment could be damaged as a result.</P>
    <P>A recently published ILO study entitled <i>Into the twenty-first century: The development of social security</i> discusses the economic effects of social security contributions and a quotation from that report is relevant to the general issue under discussions.  The quotation is as follows:</P>
    <P>We are well aware that employers feel that the high social security contributions they are compelled to pay raise their costs of production and thus reduce their competitiveness with producers in countries where employers do not have to pay such contributions or else pay them at a much lower level. <Col N="715" /> Thus, it is argued that high social security contributions are in part responsible for the present high level of unemployment in industrialised countries. This question has been extensively studied in a number of countries.  While it is true that employers might achieve a short-term gain if these contributions were lowered, it is not likely that this gain would be sustained in the longer term.  What was gained in lower contributions is likely to be paid out sooner or later in higher wages and salaries or in other wage costs.  If the argument were sound, countries within the European Community with low social security contributions would, over the years, have made great gains at the expense of countries with high social security contributions.  But this does not appear to have happened as a matter of history. The essential point is that it is total labour costs which affect competitiveness, and social contributions are only part of those costs.  International comparisons do not support the argument that there is any significant connection between social security contributions and high total labour costs.</P>
    <P>Is it true that higher employers' contributions particularly damage labour-intensive firms and encourage the replacement of labour with capital? First, it should be pointed out that firms making capital goods also have to pay the same high employers' contributions. Capital-intensive firms pay high employers' contributions indirectly on their raw materials, plant and energy.  Secondly, high employers' contributions may well cause cash wages to be lower than would otherwise be the case, so that total labour costs are not, in fact, increased by employers' contributions.  Thirdly, in so far as high employers' contributions encourage all firms to use more capital-intensive methods of production, this applies to labour-intensive firms as well.  This encouragement of investment may lead them to produce at <Col N="716" /> lower cost and thus to be more competitive in world markets.  For these reasons, the argument has little credibility.</P>
    <P>The question of employer contributions was also examined by the Commission on Taxation.  The Commission on Taxation recommended the introduction of a social security tax to be levied on all income, without a ceiling, including realised capital gains and taxable gifts and inheritances.  The Commission on Social Welfare rejected this proposal in favour of the present arrangements but did, however, recommend a widening of the base for social security.  Deputies will realise that in this Bill we are now taking this step.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation considered that compulsory social insurance contributions were more appropriately regarded as a tax.  They considered that the maintenance of completely separate social insurance contributions which apply to some incomes and not to others was inequitable and unnecessary.  In present circumstances, they recommended that the rate of social security tax should be about 5 per cent and that the balance of the fund should be raised from indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>The main benefits of the new system as seen by the Commission on Taxation were first, a simpler system for employers and public administrators; secondly, a more equitable system and also a redistribution of the nominal tax burden from employees to the self-employed; from the lowest paid to the higher paid and so on.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare also carried out an analysis and identified the following problems with the proposal. Some of these are valid in the case of the amendment we are considering now for a levy based on turnover.  These problems were, first, many employments would not have an income as the basis for calculating liability under the levy; secondly, the income base for calculating the yield to the social insurance fund would be much more uncertain than under the present arrangements; thirdly, if income were the basis of the levy it might leave <Col N="717" /> considerable scope for complex disagreement, as in the case of taxation, between contributors and the State about their income and this could lead to delays in assessment, appeals against assessment and so on; fourthly, the abandonment of the present system in favour of a levy on all income raises questions of equity.  The levy proposed might result in employers paying less than at present and this, when taken with the very modest contribution of corporation tax to total tax yield, was not seen as justifiable; fifthly, the Commission on Taxation, while recommending a social security tax on all income and accepting the levy as an earmarked tax, gave no views as to whether and on what basis contributors would be entitled to benefits.  The Commission on Taxation left unanswered the complex questions regarding the basis of social security levy entitlement as it would be in their scenario and yet argued for an earmarked levy; finally, in 1983-84, a 5 per cent levy would have yielded an estimated £410 million less than the existing funding system.  There would have been a significant shortfall to the fund.</P>
    <P>This is a very major proposal from the Deputy and I have given the main reasons why I believe it would have to be examined at considerable length and in details. For that reason I cannot accept the amendment as proposed here, while I have a certain sympathy with the Deputy in the areas at which he is trying to get. In relation to the question of exempting portion of income at some future stage when the information is available, I have no objection to taking powers, by regulation to make such arrangements.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be examining these questions in considerable detail.</P>
    <P>The introduction of PRSI for the self-employed is a major administrative undertaking which involves a lot of time on the part of officials in my Department and of the Revenue Commissioners.  We are also committed to transferring the sick pay scheme to employers which is another huge administrative undertaking. Deputies should bear in mind that <Col N="718" /> only a certain amount can be done immediately.  Nevertheless, I appreciate the difficulties and perhaps Deputy Jim Mitchell would like to introduce an amendment on Report Stage which would give powers to the Minister in the future to make some of these arrangements. I would look sympathetically on such an amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very depressed by the Minister's response.  One of the problems afflicting this country is that the whole body politic and the trade unions seem to be trapped in a conservative, old fashioned way of thinking and are not prepared to look at new ways of solving our problems.</P>
      <P>In a recent OECD report &mdash; to which the Minister did not refer &mdash; it was indicated that the Irish taxation cum social welfare system is the one most biased against employment in the OECD.  Is it any wonder, therfore, that we also have the highest rate of unemployment in the OECD?  What further depresses me is that the budget, the Social Welfare Bill and the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have not only ignored unemployment but have worsened it.</P>
      <P>I accept some of the Minister's arguments about the deficiencies of the social security levy on turnover as proposed by me, that is if the proposal was taken in isolation.  Unfortunately, we have to operate within the parameters of the Social Welfare Bill in this debate. Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are only two parts of an overall urgent and decisive package of reforms, the next legs of which would come in the Finance Bill to which I will briefly refer in a moment, and other matters which we discussed yesterday in relation to the reform of the family income supplement.  The amendments debated yesterday would have had the effect of making employment for the low paid more attractive and removed a lot of the disincentives to employment which still exist and which the amendments regarding family income supplement would have eased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 gives the Minister optional powers although I know there is <Col N="719" /> a deficiency in it because the Minister needs to get his new limit of £16,200 into operation immediately.  Perhaps I will not press this amendment but introduce one tomorrow on Report Stage which does exactly the same as amendment No. 16 but which also provides for the £16,200 limit immediately.  The effect of this amendment will be to give the Minister power to exempt, say, the first £2,000 of income.  The Minister has thrown out distorted and misleading figures.  He gave enormous figures for the exemption of the first £2,000.  Before I tabled this amendment, I took the precaution of putting questions to the Minister for Finance to find out the cost of such exemptions and how we could alternatively fund them.  My proposal will not cost the Exchequer any money, it is simply rejigging the social insurance rates and exemptions in a way that will yield the same amount of money as at present and will allow a concession which would greatly facilitate those on low incomes and, therefore, remove one of the disincentives and major anomalies in the system whereby, in certain categories, people are better off out of work than employed.  That is especially the case if you have a lot of children because under social welfare you get an allowance for each child which is not the case in the taxation system.  A married man with seven or eight children has the very same tax free allowance as one with no children. One must also take into account that his differential rent, family income supplement and medical card are judged on gross &mdash; not net &mdash; pay.  When such a person compares the money received from both systems he can be at a very major disadvantage if he is working.</P>
    <P>During the past few months at least four people came to me to say that they were giving up their jobs, in spite of the fact that there are 250,000 people unemployed, because they found they would be better off on social welfare.  I went through the figures with each person and I found they were right.  Amendment No. 16, together with the amendments relating to the family income supplement, <Col N="720" /> would better the position of those on relatively low pay, at least they would have more take home pay.  Those amendments ought to be accepted and the principle extended to differential rent calculations and medical cards.  We are not forcing anything on the Minister, we are giving him an optional power. Amendment No. 17 is a very radical proposal but that is what is needed to create employment or, more correctly, remove all the inhibitions to job creation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that a 5 per cent levy would yield £415 million less than the present fund.  This is typical of the way he plucks figures out of the air.  It is a load of rubbish.  If you abandoned all existing contributions from employers and employees, which yield £900 million, and imposed a 5 per cent levy, you would then be £450 million short.  Those are the Minister's views but that is not what is proposed.  Amendment No. 17 describes it as an alternative to all or part of the total sum payable.  It is clearly intended that he would reduce the employers' contribution by an equal amount to that used on the level of turnover.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in replies to me some weeks ago, said that the turnover base was £6,000 million.  Therefore, a 2½ per cent levy on turnover would yield £150 million.  Remember that these are not my figures but those of the Minister for Finance.  A 5 per cent levy would yield £300 million which is precisely half the total sum we get from the employers' contribution at present, which is approximately £600 million.  A 5 per cent levy would allow for a halving of the employers' contribution.  The process is complex and technical but there are simple ways of looking at it.  Let us take two different employers.  Employers A has ten people employed earning £20,000 per year which means that his total pay roll is £200,000.  Employer B has 20 people employed who are earning £10,000 per year and his total payroll is also £20,000 per year.  Both have the same payroll but one man employs twice as many as the other.  Who pays the most tax?  The answer is: the man who employs more people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> It is an absurdity that we actually tax employers on the number of people they employ.  Is it any wonder that we have 20 per cent unemployment on top of accumulating and growing emigration? We also had a trend in recent years, which the Minister did not refer to, as a way of bypassing social insurance, tax and other social legislation, whereby people were employed by &ldquo;contract&rdquo;, or &ldquo;consultancy&rdquo; or in the black economy. If an employer wants a job done and he employs somebody legitimately he has an immediate overhead of 12½ per cent.  This is a 12½ per cent tax on employment.  He also has to cope with the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act, the Maternity Allowances Act, the Equality Acts and all other desirable legislation. If he employs by contract &mdash; for example, Miss McGeever of RTE &mdash; or by consultancy, he can evade social insurance contributions.  Those two methods of bypassing are, at present, legitimate ways of evading the legislation passed by this House.</P>
    <P>The black economy option which is frequently used, or, alternatively the option of employing people and paying them high car expenses, travelling expenses, or meal allowances rather than salary is another way of getting out of the social insurance contribution or reducing it.  The Minister referred to the loopholes in what I am proposing, without referring to the incredible loopholes and problems in the present system, but all the loopholes which I have just mentioned would be set at nought by a levy on turnover.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the difficulty of defining &ldquo;turnover&rdquo;.  The Minister for Finance has no difficulty whatsoever.  He had no difficulty in the sixties when there was a 2½ per cent turnover tax which nearly brought down another minority Government.  The Minister is quoted as saying that this might push up prices.  It will not push up prices.  If you are reducing the employers' contribution by the same amount as you take in in the social security levy, you are taking the same net sum from industry in general.  You are doing it in a different way which is more <Col N="722" /> conducive to creating employment.  The employers' contribution being reduced by the same amount as the social security levy raises means that there would be a neutral effect on prices but you would have the benefit of the dynamics of a lesser tax on employment.</P>
    <P>The arguments for this are self-evident. I couched this amendment which the Minister has described as radical in a way that does not force the Minister.  It does not say the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; and it gives him the optional power of considering all the pros and cons before he draws up regulations. It also gives him the power to decide the parameters of &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; with the consent of the Minister of Finance.  The proposed amendment states:</P>
    <P>When making regulations under this section the Minister, with the consent of the Minister of Finance, shall define <i>inter alia</i> the amount of the percentage, the manner of computation of turnover and the date or dates for payment of the levy.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's response.  It is clear that by the end of this year, whatever successes the Government may have in reducing the budget deficit or the overall borrowing requirement &mdash; that has to be done &mdash; we will have higher unemployment and higher emigration.  We will have more poverty and more despair.  It behoves all of us in this House not to address this matter in a meaningless or in a longfingering way, but to look at a whole series of radical measures which will create jobs.</P>
    <P>Following the Chancellor's budget of last week, across the water and in Northern Ireland there has been a dramatic reduction in tax.  Some people may think that the reduction, especially at the top level, is too dramatic but it is something that we have got to live and compete with and we cannot ignore it.  If we ignore it the disadvantages that are already a feature of our economy in relation to employment creation will be exacerbated and worsened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> We must address urgently all the inhibitions to employment.  While it is outside the remit of this Bill I cannot ignore the enormous disincentive involved by the penal rates of income tax charged to people who are working.  Very few people want to take promotion because two-thirds of the extra money they would receive would go straight to the Government. If they work overtime, two-thirds goes to the Government.  Nobody feels like working and everybody is deflated and demotivated.  That creates it own dynamics.  It depresses effort, enthusiasm and interest.  These are the road blocks. It is as if we left trees lying about after the latest hurricane to block roads and still expected cars to get through without removing the road blocks.  They will not get through and the road to job creation is blocked along the way by a lot of garbage and debris.  Among the debris are our taxation system and our social insurance system.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider the amendment.  Amendment No. 17 merely gives him optional power to consider substituting a social security levy for the employers' contribution.  I do not think this should be seen in isolation.  It is one of three amendments taken together and it is very significant in relation to employment creation.  This must be considered in a wider context.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Finance Bill, which is due on 8 April, containing even more radical proposals.  One proposal which I would welcome, although my view might not be shared by all my colleagues, is provision for a significant property tax, the income to be used for a decisive reduction in income tax.  We penalise labour.  As the OECD say, we have the regime which is most biased against employment, yet we have the least tax on property.  There are straws in the wind but my guess is that the Government will avoid anything at all controversial. Meanwhile unemployment will continue to rise.  These are the sorts of radical proposals which must be considered.</P>

      <P>It is evident from the points raised during this debate that this is a very complex area which needs a great deal of careful thought.  The Commission on Taxation and the Commission on Social Welfare disagreed about what should be done because of the effects on different people.  The Commission on Social Welfare were particularly concerned about the protection of employees in any new arrangements.  Last night we had a very useful discussion on the family income supplement, rents and medical cards.  We will come back to those matters on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that employers' PRSI contributions here are among the lowest in Europe.  I have every desire to reduce the burden on both employees an employers.  The percentage increase in the ceiling is only 4.5 per cent, the lowest increase for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It brings in £2 million this year as against expenditure of £101 million in a full year.  I should not like it to be thought that we are imposing exceptionally high charges on employers. Deputies may not be aware that employers on the Continent also pay for children's allowances in many cases and they seem to be able to meet these kinds of costs in addition to the normal social security costs at a considerably higher level.  We must keep this question in context.  Any consideration must be based on ensuring that there is a solid social security system for employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the family income supplement as an incentive to employment.  The results of a review will be available reasonably soon and it will then be possible to look more comprehensively at this question.  In the meantime we will consider it again before Report Stage.  The Deputy is anxious to facilitate employees on lower incomes.  I gave the actual figures involved in exempting certain income from PRSI. <Col N="726" /> We could just exempt people from contributing under a certain income level, say, £1,000 to £2,000.  Our whole system is based on employment of 18 hours or more per week.  If it is below 18 hours it is regarded as being of inconsiderable extent.  If we based the system on the amount of money rather than hours it would have enormous ramifications for the whole system of benefits, entitlements and contributions.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to what the Deputy says about people on the lowest incomes and we will have to look at the question of whether the system should change in that direction.  Any such change would have to be considered and debated very fully because it would have enormous implications and would remove certain people from the system.  I see the protection of employees as my principal responsibility. I know the Deputy is taking a global view of changes in our society and I am happy to look at the matter in this context. However, I will always have to stand very firmly behind the employee and make sure that he or she is fully protected.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to people employed on a contract or consultancy basis.  By extending PRSI to the self-employed we are taking most of these people into the sytem.  The Minister for Finance is introducing self-assessment and a much more vigorous and comprehensive system of ensuring that tax will be paid.  This will involve a whole new collection system for PRSI.</P>
    <P>All Members of this House would like to see more people employed in labour-intensive industries and to facilitate that development in every possible way. Obviously there would then be an increased cost for those industries which were subject to turnover tax.  I can think of some where it would have an immediate impact and if we think back to the arguments on turnover tax they will come to mind fairly quickly.  I think it would be better to examine these points in considerable detail before coming back to the House with proposals.  That sort of change would require the introduction of a major Bill which would have to be fully considered by this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> As a result of the recent budget, 63 per cent of taxpayers will now be paying tax at the 35 per cent rate.  Therefore, major changes are taking place on that side also. I should mention that if the upper ceiling were to be removed entirely, which is now the case in the United Kingdom, the extra income generated would be £79 million in a full year.  That would allow a reduction of approximately 1 per cent in employers' PRSI rates.  That is another direction which it is suggested we should take from time to time but one can see also that it would have its implications in that those paying the higher rates of tax would also be paying higher rates of PRSI.  I think the Deputy agrees that this would involve a major change.  He says that we should be looking ahead but in looking ahead in that way we would have to ensure that any arrangements to be made would be fully discussed and considered before being adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few points in connection with the proposal put forward by Deputy Mitchell. It is an interesting proposal in that it attempts to address the problem of labour-intensive industries having to pay a fairly high tax or levy on payroll.  Capital intensive industries, such as in the financial or trading company areas, have very high turnovers and small workforces.  As I have said, the proposal is interesting in so far as it attempts to deal with that problem but I am not convinced that the intent would be met by what is being proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal that the levy be applied on turnover would leave the system open to a considerable amount of manipulation by employers.  We know from experience that where there are opportunities for financial gain through manipulation of the tax system, the social insurance system, the VAT system or any other system they will be taken.  All sorts of things are done within the tax and VAT system so that companies can gain financially. We would provide more scope for evasion by applying social insurance on the basis of turnover but the point which <Col N="728" /> the Minister made in relation to the protection of employees has to remain uppermost in the minds of Deputies in this House.  It must be made quite clear that the present levy of 12.5 per cent on payroll is not a levy on everything which a company takes in, it is simply a levy on what they pay out by way of payroll and is part of the social wage.  It is part of the contract that an employee will get X number of pounds into their hands while 12.5 per cent will be paid on their behalf into the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>There would be strong representations made by the trade unions to employers if that position were moved away from and I have no doubt that there would be a demand made that that portion of the social wage would be paid out in cash to the employee if it was not going to be paid into the social insurance fund.  Whether it would assist in having a neutral position as between labour-intensive industries and capital intensive industries is open to question.  The question as to whether we should adopt the position of giving a greater emphasis to one or the other needs to be debated very deeply.  I am not happy that it would be in the best interests of the working class to have a reversion to labour-intensive industry. Traditionally, labour-intensive industries are lowly paid and have the worst working conditions.  If this country is to trade effectively internationally we must encourage companies to invest in the latest technology and in the best possible productive ways in producing products which we could sell on the international market.  There is no other way to compete effectively.  As I have said, there should be much debate on what needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a situation where the tax system and the social insurance system was neutral as between labour and capital intensive industries but I do not believe that what is being proposed here today would achieve that.  As I have said, it would lead to many difficulties in both collection and assessment.  One further point I would like to make on this is that there is a need to ensure that whatever changes are made, their effect will not be <Col N="729" /> to reduce in any way the social insurance fund which is essential in order to maintain payments to those on unemployment benefit, disability benefit, pensions and so forth.</P>
    <P>Let me make one final point.  I made a similar point earlier on the question of pensions for self-employed in that the system needed to be neutral as between labour and capital intensive industries. We are going to introduce a system in which the self-employed would pay a 3 per cent levy on their income as assessed. At present an employee pays at the rate of 6.6 per cent.  Therefore a disparity exists which we will attempt later on to rectify.  I simply make that point to highlight that it is necessary to ensure that we do not go overboard as regards one or the other.  We should try to achieve a neutral position as between labour and capital intensive industries.  If certain areas need to be encouraged to invest in technology we should find ways other than fiddling around with the social insurance system to do this.</P>

      <P>There are two points I would like to make.  I agree with what Deputy De Rossa has said about this proposal. This proposal is an interesting one and looking at it from a number of angles, it could possibly be developed in a different way.  I too, am opposed to dealing with payments based on turnover.  At the moment we have quite a lot of difficulties in relation to P60s and P45s which are based on a simple pay roll.  If one were to get into the area of turnover it would be a real landmine area and we would increase the abuses by employers, or at the least, this would be put into the area of accountants seeking ways and means to avoid or reduce payments.  I appreciate that the Minister has increased the penalties and hopefully this will improve the position in relation to abuses but the whole area of issuing P60s and P45s in relation to the records that apply to workers should be tightened up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to labour intensive industries I would have liked to have seen reliefs for that sector as that sector includes some of our oldest industries <Col N="730" /> such as footwear, clothing and textile industries which are very labour intensive. As Deputy De Rossa said, these are the industries in which there are the lowest levels of earnings and the conditions of employment are lowest.  I am opposed to any change from the present system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments have highlighted what I said at the beginning about the reluctance of those who are supposed to be radical to look at truly unconservative solutions of our problems. An article by Paul Tansey in the business section of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 6 March last dealt with manufacturing output which has increased by 30 per cent in the last two years and pointed out that despite this employment continues to fall.  The article is headed, &ldquo;Output Grows but Labour is Waiting.&rdquo;  The business community have huge reasons for not employing people.  We have a very big employment problem and in the future we will have a crisis relating to increasing dependency.  We will have more and more unemployed and more and more elderly people and fewer contributors. There will be a major crisis if we do not do something now.  There is no doubt that the base for the social insurance contribution which the employers contribution provides is too narrow a base and provides many more loopholes for evasion that the ones which Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Bell outlined. Of course the proposal has some defects.  Any proposal will have drawbacks but I strongly contend that my proposal will have fewer drawbacks than the drawbacks in the present system.  We have a very serious unemployment problem which is getting worse.  Although Paul Tansey is not everybody's favourite economist, in the article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> he raised the pertinent questions. Why with our present surging exports and manufacturing output are we still having declining employment?  It is because the overall regime of tax and social welfare and other social legislation, and our remoteness from the continental market have combined to create a major <Col N="731" /> problem.  We must sort out these problems. The proposal to give the Minister power if he wishes to substitute a social security level on turnover is the first of a series of radical steps to be taken this year in order to begin tackling the unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>My proposal is relevant to surging trade figures.  Why is unemployment increasing when we consider our surging surplus and the balance of trade that we have had since 1985, compared with our balance of trade deficit of £1,500 million five years ago?  This is explained to some extent by the fact that our 10 per cent manufacturing profits tax is being used by international companies so as to minimise the value of their imports from other companies in the same group and to maximise the export value of their goods to other companies in the same group with the effect that higher profits are got here and there are artificially inflated export figures.  The fact that they pay 10 per cent tax on their profits here means that they can evade 50 per cent elsewhere.  That is legitimate but while we are committed to a 10 per cent profits tax until the year 2,000, I do not see why companies like that should not be asked to pay something towards the social cost of unemployment and towards our social welfare system. There is no doubt that companies like that, in addition to companies who are employing capital more than labour should have to bear a fair share of the total cost.  That would be nearer the neutral effect which Deputy De Rossa spoke about, than our present situation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell is given to colourful phrasing and his way of describing things is a bit strange.  In my local paper he has described the Bill as a product of apathy.  I thought the paper had got it wrong and had misquoted him but Deputy Mitchell now tells us that all the trade unions, the employers and ourselves are trapped in conservative thinking.  I presume that is everybody except himself.  That is a very wide ranging comment with which I could not <Col N="732" /> agree.  There is need for change and change is coming about.</P>
      <P>I note that in Deputy Mitchell's amendment the employee is not being catered for.  It is clear that it is not geared to protecting the employee but to protecting the employer.  There has to be a balance and employees must be protected. It is ludicrous to suggest that these amendments would stamp out fiddling. What will stamp out fiddling are proper legislation and proper fines and penalties for both employees and employers who breach the regulations and co-operation between trade unions and employers as is happening now.  The building craft unions have got together with employers on the sites and they have put up a special fund to try to eliminate fiddling.  Likewise the Minister is proposing fairly radical changes in the penalties.  We need this because raising or lowering the limits will not change the fiddler's attitude and the same scope will be there for fiddling.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said the Minister quoted enormous figures when dealing with exemptions.  The Minister rightly quoted enormous figures because the cost would be enormous.  The figure given was £125 million for the £1,000 exemption, and multiply that.  These are enormous figures and that the Minister quotes them is not strange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most dangerous things in this proposal is the overall levy on companies which will penalise the efficient, successful company.  It is difficult enough at the moment to trade and I take Deputy De Rossa's point that it is not always the labour intensive industry which is the good one to work for or pays well.  Traditionally industries such as the clothing industry and others pay poorly.  A more efficient company who will invest in machinery and equipment will be a good employer in most cases.  We could penalise these people who are efficient and prepared to invest in research, development and so on, because Mr. Tansey or somebody else has told Deputy Mitchell he should do it.  There is a grave danger which I mentioned last week when what seemed like a new proposal for loans <Col N="733" /> instead of supplementary benefit was made.  I said it was directly from the new British proposal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am fairly new at working at bringing in legislation.  &ldquo;Agreement in principle&rdquo; is a term we meet in local authority.  For a long time I have had a fear about giving the right to the Minister to bring in by regulation certain conditions down the line.  I trust this Minister but changes could occur down along the line and it is right to have proper debate here if we are to have radical changes.  Obviously, the Minister would be anxious to take the power to make his job easier but we must be careful about it.  Generally I am surprised that the first part of the amendment has not been disallowed considering the way some amendments were treated yeaterday, as they would radically affect the income base for the Bill.  However, I encourage debate on changes and we need to address any problems there, but I oppose these amendments as they are put down.  I see no problem about coming back during the year and having further debate on some of the issues and I am sure the Minister will keep them in mind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The article he mentioned by Paul Tansey in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> some weeks ago did not deal with social insurance.  It dealt with why output was growing apace and employment falling and the writer came to no conclusions. He simply raised the question.  My recollection of the article was that he left the question open as to whether the Government were pursuing the correct strategy <Col N="735" /> in their approach to the national debt and a whole range of other issues but the question of social insurance was not referred to at all in that article.  Perhaps the Deputy has the article there and can correct me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is it was not mentioned.  The reason I put down for output rising and employment falling is simply that those who are investing in new technology are winning the markets.  Those companies who are holding on to old fashioned methods and ways are in decline and shedding labour.  This must be looked at very closely.  I do not accept that fiddling around with social insurance is the way to tackle that problem. Perhaps the Deputy does not mean it to come across thus but it would appear he is arguing that the major cause of unemployment or loss of employment is the 12.5 per cent payroll tax which the employer pays.  Again there is no evidence for that.  There are plenty of complaints from employers about having to pay PRSI, but employers, like everybody else, will complain regardless of what has to be paid.  That is the nature of things, but on that basis we should not run to start changing a system without giving due consideration to all the implications those changes might have.</P>

      <P>My party are opposing this section.  With 250,000 people unemployed plus emigration, I am amazed at the inclusion of this section in the Bill.  It <Col N="736" /> is sad that this section is included.  It leaves me in no doubt where the Minister and his Government stand in relation to job creation.  The only hope we have of reducing the social welfare bill is through employment.  Yet there is a massive exodus of public and civil servants and the Government have gone to the extreme of borrowing huge amounts of money to finance it.</P>
      <P>Our only hope is to create a climate whereby more people will be employed. This Government are going about it by increasing the tax on employment and this is ludicrous.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at this section.  I admit the percentage is small, 0.07 per cent, but at this time we should be creating incentives for employers to employ more people.</P>
      <P>To keep the occupational injury fund solvent would take only a small amount of money from the central fund.  We in the Progressive Democrats are opposed to any measures that will discourage people from creating employment.  The Minister's logic is faulty in this respect and I am somewhat surprised at this.</P>
      <P>What kind of money are we talking about.  The only industries that are now creating employment are the small ones. Yet, these small employers have faced enough problems with employer liability insurance, many even being put out of business because of this terrible demand from insurance companies for employer liability.  Here we have the Government again creating further problems for the men and women who are investing their life savings to try to create a little industry, thus giving further employment.  The Minister should have another look at this. It is a principle rather than money that is concerned.  The Government should be seen to be creating incentives for people to employ and not, as they have done this morning, creating further disincentives to employers.  I ask the Minister to give this matter his serious consideration because this is a disincentive and will be recognised as such in the field of commerce.</P>

      <P>This section provides for <Col N="737" /> an increase of 0.07 per cent from 0.43 per cent to 0.5 per cent in the employers contribution to the occupational injuries fund with effect from 6 April 1988.  On the introduction of the PRSI contribution system in April 1979 the rate of contribution was fixed at 0.45 per cent.  The rate was temporarily reduced to 0.3 per cent in April 1981 as a result of accumulated reserves in the fund.  This is the kind of fund that the Progressive Democrats are always looking for.  In fact, the Deputy's colleague said that the social insurance fund was a nonsense and that there should be a fund that is self-financing and covers itself each year.  That is what the occupational injuries fund is. Here we have financial responsibility on the part of the employers for their own occupational injuries fund so this should be straightforward Progressive Democrat stuff.  That is what it is.  We are all being responsible.  If there are not as many accidents at work then not as much is paid.  We have reduced it repeatedly when there were reserves in the fund.</P>
      <P>As it happens, now there are more accidents at work and the responsibility is placed on the employers to meet the deficit which occurs in those circumstances. It was down as low as 0.3 per cent in April 1981 as a result of accumulated reserves in the fund.  It was increased by 0.1 per cent in April 1984 and by a further 0.03 per cent from April 1986 to its current 0.43 per cent to maintain the solvency of the fund.  I am sure Deputy Wyse likes those terms, to maintain the solvency of the fund.  I hope the Deputy will let his colleagues know that what we are doing here is maintaining the solvency of the fund.  That is what this is all about and that is why it is very hard to understand why the Progressive Democrats come in here and try to tell this House that we should find this money somewhere else.  What about responsibility? Under the Act the employers have a responsibility for this fund; it is not part of the whole social insurance fund.  They are relatively small amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked what would be the additional yield of contribution income. It would be £3.1 million.  The reduced <Col N="738" /> rate of occupational injuries contribution payable in respect of civil servants, because that is also involved here, will also be increased from 6 April 1988 from 0.14 per cent to 0.16 per cent and will be brought into effect by regulations.</P>
    <P>This is an adjustment to maintain solvency which we have all agreed we want to do.  For a person on £10,000 per annum it would be £7 a year or approximately 13p a week to maintain solvency.  At the maximum of £16,200 it would be just over £11 a year.</P>
    <P>What is the occupational injuries fund about?  It is about injuries that occur at work.  We are back to responsibility on the shop floor, responsibility at work.  Is the Deputy suggesting that that responsibility should be transferred to other taxpayers? This fund has always moved in such a direction and it covers such things as injury benefit.  Approximately 26 per cent of the expenditure in 1987 was on injury benefit and 48.7 per cent of the cost of the fund went towards disablement benefit and death benefit.  We are talking about serious injuries to workers in the workplace, not anywhere else.  Surely the Deputy and his party believe in responsibility being carried by the employers in that case at least, whatever about any other circumstances?  There are ways to reduce injuries and accidents at work.  I know the Deputy's colleagues sitting close to him, Deputy Bell and Deputy De Rossa, will give him a list of ways in which the circumstances at work could be improved to reduce injuries.  That can be done and if employers want to do it they have that option.  That is one of the reasons it is important that the occupational injuries fund be strictly an employers' fund which is funded by them to cover their workers.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the fund rises and falls from time to time depending on the extent of injuries or accumulated costs arising from those injuries.  The increase is a very small one and I do not know why the Progressive Democrats want to oppose it.  They say they want to oppose the whole section and to oppose this increase.  They want to oppose it in principle. What is the principle?  Surely the <Col N="739" /> principle the Progressive Democrats are talking about is totally opposite to the principles they tell people about outside this House.  They say outside the House that we should have solvency and financial responsibility and if there are other ways of reducing the cost, for instance, by reducing accidents then we should do that first.  Is that not what the Progressive Democrats would tell us?  Why then are they now saying that the ordinary taxpayer should carry these extra costs on the basis of principle?  I do not understand that and needless to say I do not agree with it.  I know it is part of the Progressive Democrats effort to try to create an impression publicly that they are against increases of any sort.  Did they make a mistake?  Does the Deputy want to go back and check with Deputy O'Malley, his party leader, to see did he flip on this, has he missed out on something?  I cannot understand how he came to that conclusion.</P>

It would be grossly irresponsible of me as Minister for Social Welfare to come in here and say there is a deficit in this fund and I want to pass it on to the worker, the general taxpayer or somebody else.  I am doing the fund a favour.  Elsewhere there was £375,000 left over from a scheme which has been wound up that was contributed by employers to another scheme and I am taking power to transfer it into the occupational injuries fund. Employers alone contributed that money and when their fund is running at a deficit is it not reasonable to put it into their fund and let them have the benefit of it?  The amount required is, therefore, reduced to that extent.  As I have said, I cannot understand how the Progressive Democrats have got themselves into this situation but that is the case.  If they wish <Col N="740" /> to oppose the measure then we will just have to vote on it but perhaps the Deputy might wish to talk to his colleagues before he does so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister in his approach.  Deputy Wyse is worried about the ecomomic factors involved. The Minister spoke of terms such as injury, disablement and death and these are frightening terms.  In the past one of my duties was as industrial safety officer in a very large, reputable company.  That brought me into immediate contact with industrialists generally, with training, with problems of industrial accidents and their results.  There are still people who totally disregard their responsibilities and there are cowboy employers.  It is only when you see the effects of these accidents and the pain and suffering caused as a result you realise that the economic factor is not very important.  The cowboys must be forced to get their act together and to behave in a proper fashion.  There are many ways, as the Minister has said, in which the situation can be improved and each improvement will mean that less money will be needed for this fund.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wyse spoke about the numbers of unemployed, the desolation and so on and he used this opportunity to give a party political speech rather than to deal with the measure before us.  There are hundreds of people who have been killed, disabled or badly injured at work.  In many cases this reverts directly to the employer, to lack of training, lack of proper initiation courses and lack of direct supervision because of penny pinching. This proposal is to give a very small increase in the fund to ensure that there is a safety net for the people who are injured at work and I support the principle of the employer paying the contribution. The option lies with the employers to save on the fund, on proper procedures, proper training and proper working conditions.  These things cannot be dodged and we need legislation to ensure that they are brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Insurance costs are extremely high but that matter is being looked at in a separate area, particularly in the case of <Col N="741" /> artificial costs where the money is not being paid to the people who are injured or to their dependants but to teams of lawyers and others.  That matter comes under a separate section but it has to be dealt with also.  Within industry the insurance costs could be kept down.  The premiums are directly related to the number of accidents occurring, to their severity and the compensation paid.  As I have said, the solution lies with the employers to control that fund and keep it down.  The Minister emphasised that where there was overfunding the rate was cut.  It is totally irrational now to complain about a very small increase in the percentage rate to compensate for the fund being down.  We must be consistent. There was no objection to paying it back when the fund was over-subscribed.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputy Wyse to withdraw his opposition to this measure.  I appreciate that he may say it is a further tax on employment but it is a tax controllable by employers.  If all employers became aware &mdash; many of them are not so aware &mdash; of the moves that could be taken to cut these costs we would have a better and a safer country for the industrial worker.  I will at all times move to protect the industrial worker and I make no apologies to anybody or to any party for that.  I will not listen to arguments about the numbers of unemployed or about anything else.  There is totally irrational opposition to this section and I ask that it be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>In my time I could probably claim to have dealt with more workers in a whole variety of different industries than most, if not all, other Deputies. During 25 years or so I have had very wide experience in dealing with legislation covering people at work.  If there is anything that can be put into any Act which would strengthen that situation I would be very much in support of it. This fund is very important and it is very important that it be self-financing, otherwise, it will act as a disincentive to employers who do not comply with the relevant legislation to give the necessary <Col N="742" /> protection to workers in their employment.</P>
      <P>What is unfair about contributions to the fund is that employers who do comply with the regulations, who do provide proper safety footwear and clothing, who instal proper extraction fans where there may be dust and other materials which would affect workers' health, effectively must contribute the same as the cowboy employer who does not comply with any of the regulations. Unfortunately, the Department of Labour factory inspectorate division would find it almost impossible to deal with all of the factories, workshops and so on nationwide, or to cope effectively with the lack of proper equipment and facilities for industrial workers.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I find myself taking a totally contrary view on this matter.  I contend that there should be severe penalties imposed on employers who do not comply with the regulations.  There are two Departments dealing with the important matter of the health of workers.  Yet there is a certain lack of co-ordination between the two.  I have never been satisfied that information furnished by the factory inspectorate division of the Department of Labour found its way to the Department of Social Welfare who must foot the bill or, indeed, <i>vice versa.</i> I suggest to the Minister that there should be more consultation in that respect.  For example, before grants are paid to employers by the IDA or Fóir Teoranta, the Department of Labour should satisfy themselves that such employers have installed proper safety equipment for their employees.</P>

    <P>I heard of a sad case only a few weeks ago of a relatively young man with eight children who, because his employer, a company in the bakery industry, would not instal essential extraction equipment, can no longer work, having been infected by flour, or baker's disease as it is called. That man will never work again.  The bakers' union having complained, the Department sent an inspector on more than one occasion to that establishment. The inspector told the employer, backed up in writing, that he must instal proper <Col N="743" /> extraction units but he failed to do so.  It must be remembered that the fund will have to pay disablement and injury benefit to that man, his wife and eight children for as long as he continues to live. Yet that employer pays the same contribution as another baker down the street who has installed the proper facilities.</P>
    <P>I concur fully with the Minister in this respect.  We do not go far enough in implementing the relevant legislation in order to prevent injury or disease being occasioned at work where the proper safety equipment has not been provided. Penalties for non-compliance with the relevant regulations should be very severe because we are talking here about workers' health.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the sentiments expressed by Deputy Wyse.  Possibly he is looking at the matter from a totally different angle. However, had he spent 20 to 30 years, as I have, dealing with workers on the factory floor, seeing them being maimed, disfigured or crippled because of lack of proper safety equipment and compliance with the regulations, he might feel differently. Indeed, I might add that we are the worst offenders in all of Europe in regard to ensuring implementation of the relevant legislation.</P>

      <P>Unlike the Minister I do not see a contradiction in the position of the Progressive Democrats in relation to this matter at all.  It is clear to me that what is being argued is not so much against the increase as against the levy being there at all.  That is quite in line with the position of the Progressive Democrats and, as far as I know, the Fine Gael argument as well &mdash; that labour should be deregulated, that we should remove all of the constraints on labour.</P>

      <P>I heard the Fine Gael spokesperson on labour speak to a meeting of a trade union association outside of congress, when he made it quite clear that he was unhappy with the <Col N="744" /> degree to which labour is protected.  He said he was unhappy with the obligation on employers to pay redundancy money, with employers being constrained by the legislation to unfair dismissal.  He was also unhappy with the constraints on employers with regard to safety, social insurance and a whole range of other matters.  That is the position of the Progressive Democrats as well.  Therefore, it will be seen that there is no contradiction in the Progressive Democrats' argument here today.  They are for deregulation of labour, in favour of circumstances in which an employer can hire and fire at will, with no responsibility to his employees because, of course, such would interfere with his profit margin.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell described these obstacles to employment as road blocks.  To be honest, I would prefer to see my sons and daughters on the dole than working for some employers I have encountered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to correct what Deputy De Rossa has said.  First, because people may express anxiety about the overall effect of certain provisions does not mean they may want to throw out all of the provisions of the Bill with the bath water.  I do not think anybody could possibly contend that Fine Gael are not committed to the welfare and protection of employment and employees.  Our concern is to increase employment.  If there are problems encountered in the implementation of some of the present arrangements, we should not be afraid to examine them and ascertain whether we can refine them somewhat so as to avoid some of their adverse effects.  It is only fair that I should make that point in the light of what Deputy De Rossa has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred earlier to my former position as Minister.  One of the problems I encountered as Minister, in charge of many State companies, was that of getting people to look at things differently, to change, in order to ensure their survival.  In that sector each of the companies for which I was responsible, with the exception of B &amp; I, is now in profit, doing very well, because with the co-operation of management and unions <Col N="745" /> we got them to change.  Similarly we must have the same open mind in regard to employment generally.</P>
    <P>While I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Deputies De Rossa and Bell, I sometimes cringe at their parties' unwillingness to face up to the need to change in certain respects.  I have no quarrel at all with their intent or motivation. Indeed, I sometimes feel I would be more at home there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat surprised by the Minister's attitude to this question. He appeared to get very excited.  We have had a very constructive practical debate so far.  I can well understand the Minister's anxiety <i>vis-à-vis</i> the position of the Progressive Democrats but I should have expected him to adopt a more responsible approach.  I did not come in here to make a political issue of any aspect of the Bill. We have not opposed all sections of the Bill.  What we are talking about is creating the incentive for employment.  I think that is a fair assumption in relation to the section.  The Minister started shouting and screaming about solvency and things of that kind.  I can well appreciate his U-turn.  Even when he was sitting on the other side of the House, we were his target.  He criticised our approach to different aspects of Government policy at that time.  However, I am not going to deal with that now because it would only make the issue a political one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that I, too, worked on the factory floor, both as an employee and in management and I know the dangers workers are exposed to.  I am fully aware, too, of the cowboy employer, the kind who was referred to by Deputy Dennehy, but I am aware <Col N="746" /> also of the majority who are honest-to-God employers, who, every day, are spending, extending and trying to create more employment.  Those are the people about whom I am really concerned.  I know, and I am sure Deputy Dennehy and every other Deputy knows, that many people who had the ambition to start their own industries found, when they went to the insurance companies, that it was not possible to go ahead because of the cost of employer liability insurance.  What have the Government done about that?  Surely we are highlighting something by our opposition to this section.</P>
    <P>I know that the amount of money involved is not substantial, the Minister said that, but it is not substantial either for a Government to prop up that fund as part of their contribution to creating the incentive for employment or to encouraging employers to create more employment.  That is all our opposition to this section means.  I was somewhat surprised that a political football was made of the whole matter and, worse still, that it was started by the Minister. I am surprised that he got so excited about it after our having had such a constructive discussion up to then.</P>
    <P>The basic principle of my party is to try to create the incentive to invest and to employ.  If the Minister wants to debate that we are always ready to do so. I was surprised that the Minister got so excited and made such a political issue of something which I felt the House should discuss when it was talking about creating incentives for employment.  I have no intention of withdrawing my opposition to the section.  It is our policy and we stand by it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that I only get excited about money.  As Minister for Social Welfare I need the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The fund will be short if we do not have the money.  Incidentally, <Col N="747" /> the amount currently paid out on an annual basis is £32 million so the total amount is not so consequential, it is very substantial.  This brings me back to what Deputy Bell said about there being enormous scope for responsibility in industry. I agree with what Deputy Bell said &mdash; Deputy De Rossa referred to this also &mdash; that a great deal of work could be done in that area to ensure that those who contribute to the lack of safety in industry are made to bear the penalty for that, especially if they are flying in the face of the recommendations and advice made available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about people in industry who die as a result of accidents or who are very seriously disabled and injured. Of course, there is far too much of that throughout industry and I agree with what Deputy Bell said in relation to that. The cost of that to the employer is £32 million a year but if he is responsible he <Col N="748" /> can cut down on that.  If we take £10,000 as an average salary, what is involved here is £7 per annum or 13p per week. The Deputy said that the reason the Progressive Democrats put this proposal forward is to encourage employment.  I cannot see how 13p per week would encourage employment.</P>

      <P>It is far more important to encourage people to be responsible and to ensure the solvency of the fund.  It is also important that we have prudent management.  I am sure that when the Deputy talks to his colleagues they will realise that things like prudent management and the solvency of the fund are important.  That is why we have to go ahead with this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 10, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>10.&mdash;The increase in the prescribed relative allowance payable under sections 50 (ii), 51 (2), 81 (3), 86 (3), 91 (3) and 103 (2) of the Principal Act shall be paid directly to such prescribed relative.</P>
      <P>In view of the restriction on time for the debate I will not make any comment on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to have the prescribed relative allowance paid directly to the prescribed relative. The prescribed relative allowance is an increase in pension payable to incapacitated pensioners who have living with them a prescribed relative who is providing full time care and attention to them.  Apart from the prescribed relative the pensioner must be living alone or only with children under 18 or persons who are incapacitated.  The prescribed relative must not be engaged in employment outside the home, must not be in receipt of, or entitled to, any other benefit, pension or allowance from the Department of Social Welfare and must not be a married person who is wholly or mainly maintained by his or her spouse.</P>
      <P>Persons in respect of whom the allowance may be paid consist of a brother, a sister, a half-brother, a half-sister, a son, a daughter, a stepson, a stepdaughter, a grand-son, a grand-daughter, a son-in-law, a daughter-in-law, a nephew, a niece, a brother-in-law or a sister-in-law of the pensioner.  The prescribed relative must not be a married person who is wholly or mainly maintained by their spouse.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the scheme is to provide a measure of additional income maintenance to a pensioner towards the support of the relative who is looking after him in this way.  It is akin to an increase in pension for an adult dependant except that the rate of the allowance is lower: £26.40 at present; £27.20 from July 1988 &mdash; the same rate applying in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payment of the PRA is based on need: <Col N="751" /> if the relative is working or on social welfare payment no allowance is paid. This is the basis for not paying an allowance in respect of a married daughter in the case where the pensioner is living with the family.  The allowance is paid to the pensioner, not the relative, and was never intended to compensate the relative for the service which he or she is providing.  Social welfare schemes are based on the criterion of providing income maintenance in situations of need, not on providing compensation to people for services rendered.</P>
    <P>While it is accepted that people looking after pensioner relatives are in many cases saving the State the expense of providing institutional care, it does not follow that the State should provide a level of financial compensation to the relative for the service they provide.  The general practice has been that families look after their aged relatives and it has never been accepted that the State should provide financial compensation for this. The social security system provides a measure of income support for various situations of perceived need with the fall-back of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme which is designed to ensure that no person falls below a certain minimum level of income.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult in many cases where pensioners are being looked after by their families to justify, on grounds of need, the provision of additional financial compensation.  The level of the non-contributory old age pension is £44, rising to £45.75 in July, and in a situation where a pensioner lives with his family only the pensioner's means are taken into account in determining the amount of pension payable.  In many cases the value of the pension would be quite significant when measured against the additional cost of maintaining the pensioner in the family.</P>
    <P>State support specifically for elderly persons in the home takes the form essentially of a variety of welfare services which are provided by the health boards. The main types of service available range from a home help service, a service provided by public health nurses, social <Col N="752" /> workers employed by health boards, a meals-on-wheels service and other backup services for those in need.</P>
    <P>The whole question of payment for looking after aged and disabled relatives in the community was examined by the Commission on Social Welfare.  One of the main criticisms of the scheme was that the allowance is payable to the pensioner rather than directly to the caring relative. The commission made two recommendations in this context, first, that all means-tested social assistance payments should be unified in a single social assistance payment and, secondly, that prescribed relatives should be entitled to claim social assistance in their own right and that the prescribed relative allowance should, therefore, be abolished.</P>
    <P>In this amendment the Deputy is, in effect, saying that it should be abolished in so far as the pensioner is concerned and transferred to the assisting relative. As I have outlined, that would involve a variety of changes.  It would constitute a fairly major alteration.  It would mean that the pensioners entitlement to the money they are at present receiving would be removed.  The Deputy will realise that this is something which needs to be considered more generally, to decide exactly on what sort of social assistance payment should be payable, in what circumstances it should be payable and what would be the effect of making that transfer.  It is something which I accept will have to be considered later, but which I am not in a position to undertake at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put two brief examples to the Minister, although I am sure he has encountered such cases in his own work.  Where a daughter is taking care of an elderly parent or parents, if she is in receipt of unemployment assistance then basically there is no problem. However, once the Department of Social Welfare discover that the person is taking care of an elderly relative then that person is automatically deemed not to be available for work &mdash; that magic phrase with which we all have to deal all the time.  Such a person is thus automatically <Col N="753" /> disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance.  Is the Minister saying he would consider that people certified as taking care of elderly relatives are, therefore, entitled to claim and be paid unemployment assistance without having to tell lies?  That is what is happening. Persons taking care of elderly parents have to tell lies in the employment exchange because if they say they are caring for the relatives they are automatically disqualified.  They have no recourse, because they cannot appeal against that decision unless the situation changes.</P>
      <P>At the moment in every area, I suggest, there is a shortage of geriatric beds and these are extremely expensive &mdash; this may not be the Minister's responsibility.  To keep a patient in geriatric or day care centre on a permanent basis in any of the newer institutions costs from £500 to £600 a week.  It would be preferable if these elderly people could be taken care of by a relative in the home and that that relative would, in his or her own right, be entitled to claim unemployment assistance. If that were so, the other allowance could quite easily be eliminated.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to that matter on the basis of saving the State a great deal of money.  I would much prefer to see these elderly people kept in their homes and taken care of by their own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few points to make on this topic, some of which have already been covered by Deputy Bell.  It is important to view this from the point of view of the pressure at present imposed on the health boards in respect of community care.  The very niggardly allowance given to pensioners and the incapacitated to support those who are caring for them in the home is contradictory in the light of pressure on community care.  The Minister for Health in his speech on the budget emphasised that health boards should ensure, under their budgets &mdash; cut back as they are &mdash; an attempt to develop community care facilities.  If nobody is available to care for the elderly and the incapacitated in <Col N="754" /> the home, then the whole basis of community care collapses.  It is important, therefore, that adequate income be provided for those who make a decision to care for their parents or relatives who may be incapacitated.  For that reason, there is need to look at this matter a little more closely.</P>
      <P>The second aspect is that for a variety of reasons the majority of people who are prescribed relatives are women.  We know, as has been mentioned on numerous occasions, the extent to which women are discriminated against in our society. To expect them, on the one hand, to take on the burden of caring for the elderly or incapacitated relatives and, on the other, to deny them an adequate income which would leave them with some dignity is wrong.  We should do whatever we can to eliminate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the recommendation from the Commission on Social Welfare was to provide for a unified social system scheme and that the prescribed relative scheme should be abolished and the person who would normally be the prescribed relative should qualify in his or her own right for social assistance.  That would be a sensible way to approach the matter.  Does the Minister intend to go in that direction?  Can he indicate how soon he expects such a reform of the system will be introduced? Certainly, as long as I have been in this House the question of the prescribed relative's allowance has been raised on every occasion on which there has been a debate on social welfare.  It is time we took the problem in hand to see how it can be remedied.  One of the strongest points made to me with regard to the prescribed relative's allowance is the fact that it is not paid to the person who does the caring.  Such people feel very sore about that, that because they take on that job they are then deprived of applying in their own right for assistance.  Some get a supplementary welfare allowance but in some cases it is very little.  That is not an adequate response to the problem. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is intended as a safety net, to <Col N="755" /> ensure that people who get into difficulties on a temporary basis can be assisted.  It is not satisfactory to expect a person who is not only doing his or her relatives a service, but also the community, to live in this way without rights in relation to income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>At health board meetings the main factor in regard to this matter is the question of paying the amount directly to the person involved. I agree with that principle, particularly where elderly people are involved.  They want to hold on to their money to bury themselves and they are reluctant to part with any of it.  It is an emotive subject which has been regularly discussed.  The Minister should look at the overall scheme to see what improvements can be made, particularly in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The Minister said very clearly that this payment is not intended as compensation for anyone looking after their parents or other relatives.  That distinction should be very clearly made.  Perhaps the Minister will look into this matter over the next 12 months so that changes can take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is general agreement about the desirability of doing something along these lines but we must be very careful not to pay people to look after their relatives as this could lead to all sort of problems.  It must be a question of genuine need and the commission recommended that it should be a social assistance payment to a person in his or her own right but still based on need.</P>
      <P>The transfer of £27.20 &mdash; from July &mdash; will probably be seen as inadequate in relation to social assistance.  A number of elements in that respect need to be examined and I give the Deputy an undertaking that I will look seriously at this.  I accept the point he is making but I am sure he also recognises that, in making a case like that, we must ensure that it would achieve the objective that the commission and the Deputy have in mind.</P>

      <P>Basically, the amendment only called for the payment to be transferred. The payment made to a separated wife of her part of her husband's social welfare benefit is made by the health board.  Instead of having to queue at the employment exchange, collect her money for herself and her children and then proceed to the health board to collect another £10, the amendment merely wants her to receive the two payments in the one office.  I am not suggesting that there should be additional payments and, therefore, I do not understand why the amendment was ruled out of order.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;reckonable emoluments&rsquo; in relation to a self-employed contributor, means gross emoluments;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>To some extent, the amendments are slightly crude because of the difficulty of dealing with a Bill in a restricted way. There are too many exclusions of certain incomes in relation to assessing the contribution to the self-employed pension fund and that is why we are putting forward these amendments.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate his attitude to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I deliberately held back my contribution until now but, unfortunately, I will not get a chance to make it.  The proposal by the Minister will cost the PAYE sector tens of millions of pounds.  The Minister may intend to increase the rates following the review provided for in the Bill between September and December 1990 but, unquestionably, any reading of the report of the National Pensions Board indicates that at 5 per cent, the prevailing rate, a 90 per cent collection success would be needed to break even at present costs.  The Minister may say we have gone beyond that and brought in unearned income as well. I am making allowances for that but in relation to income tax, health contributions and the youth employment levy, the success rate in collection is below 25 per cent.  In this case there will be a commitment to the self-employed sector to eligibility in the years to come which will cost a fortune.</P>
      <P>I agree with the principle.  I have no problem with the principle but we should be getting a contribution from the self-employed towards the cost of what are now non-contributory pensions.  The principal objective of the Minister when he made his announcement on 29 July was to reduce the net outflow from the Exchequer on pensions in general by getting a net contribution from the self-employed. It will cost us a fortune.  It is misconceived and ill thought out and that is why I hope my amendment which I will re-enter on Report Stage which calls for an actuarial report after three years and that no entitlements should accrue until that actuarial report arises will be accepted then.</P>

      <P>As regards the steps necessary at national level, the Government are considering the special administrative arrangements needed to co-ordinate adaptation to the single European market and the parallel deployment of the increased receipts expected from the EC Structural Funds in the framework of the cohesion objectives of the Single European Act and the implementation of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> We will be seeking discussions shortly with the European Commission with a view to ensuring that the work of the Services of the Commission and the action we take in Ireland are co-ordinated as effectively as possible for the same purposes.</P>
      <P>As indicated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in reply to questions on 2 March last, the Government will be initiating shortly a campaign to make the various economic sectors in Ireland aware of the challenges and opportunities implied by the 1992 deadline and to promote the taking of the necessary preparatory steps by these sectors.</P>

Will the Taoiseach consider setting up an all-party committee of Members of this House, plus the industrial, trade union, education and farming interests to see if we can identify the problems that need to be solved and do something urgently to solve them?

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take Questions Nos. 7, 19, 35 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office do not compile statistics on the number of Irish citizens who emigrate to specific destinations and consequently details are not available of the numbers who have emigrated to the United States.  Even an accurate estimate is difficult because of the fact that many who emigrate to the US are out of status and do not feature in official US data.  However, taking the total net emigration estimates produced by the Central Statistics Office up to April last and subtracting estimates of movement towards Britain and other destinations, the number of such citizens could be of the order of 40,000 to 50,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such figures clearly point to the existence of a very real problem for a large <Col N="770" /> number of our citizens in the United States.  Since taking office the Government have devoted considerable time and effort to this issue.  Our approach has been threefold: first, to develop our advisory services and to co-ordinate the activities of bodies working in the welfare area; second, to encourage city and church authorities to develop their welfare services; and third, to encourage moves for legislative reform.</P>
    <P>In so far as advisory and welfare services are concerned, we have set up immigration working committees under the auspices of our Consulates General at New York and Boston, increased the staff of our Consulate General at New York, and extended the advisory services provided by our consulates.  I am satisfied that the services provided by all our offices are being availed of by a substantial number of out of status Irish citizens. We have also had discussions with city and church authorities in New York and Boston who have introduced or developed programmes for illegal immigrants in those cities.</P>
    <P>In relation to legislative reform the Government, in the past 12 months, have had discussions with representatives of the US Administration and prominent Irish-American politicians.  The basic problem is that US immigration law does not provide opportunities for many of our immigrants to regularise their status. Accordingly, the Government have, from the outset, encouraged our friends in Congress to seek to have the legislation reformed.  For this reason we warmly welcomed the introduction of the original Kennedy-Donnelly proposals last year and more recently the achievement of Senators Edward Kennedy and Alan Simpson in having their Bill passed by an overwhelming majority in the US Senate. A similar measure has now been introduced in the House of Representatives and plans are already advanced to have this considered.  The objective is to have an agreed Bill passed by both Houses of Congress by the end of this present congressional session.</P>
    <P>From our point of view the most significant aspect of the Kennedy-Simpson <Col N="771" /> Bill is the creation of a new independent category of 55,000 visas to be distributed annually on a points basis.  I am hopeful that Irish citizens will be able to avail of a substantial proportion of these to enable them to live and work legally in the United States.</P>
    <P>As regards other countries Deputies will be aware that the major destination for Irish emigrants continues to be Great Britain.  The Government are very conscious of the problems faced by many of our citizens who emigrate to that country. To help alleviate their problem the Minister for Labour has provided £250,000 this year for funding the provision of welfare services through the Dion Committee which operates under the auspices of our embassy in London.  The committee, which consists of representatives of the Irish community in Britain, a representative of the Minister for Labour and embassy officials, maintains close contact with Irish welfare centres throughout Britain.  In this way it stays in touch with the situation relating to Irish emigrants in that country and endeavours to provide help where it is most needed.</P>
    <P>As regards other destinations, our embassies in the countries in question are, of course, always available for advice about living and working conditions in their countries of accredition should they be contacted by Irish citizens.  However, I understand that, apart from the United States and Britain, there is no evidence that any significant body of Irish citizens is encountering real problems in their adopted country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his long and detailed reply. I may have missed the point, but have the Irish Government approached the United States authorities regarding an amnesty for those who emigrated between 1982 and 1987?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This would require an amendment of the law, a reforming of the legislation.  It is what we have been at for the past 12 months.  I have taken a wide range of advice on this matter at all <Col N="772" /> levels particularly in the United States. The almost unanimous view is that the way to go about it is the way proposed in the Kennedy-Donnelly, now the Simpson-Kennedy, legislation which will provide 55,000 visas per year for what are called the traditional seed countries in accordance with certain training, educational, age and language criteria. Under these criteria we rate very highly, so the expectation is that, of the 55,000 visas a year allocated to seed countries, we should qualify for about 10,000 per year, and that should take up the backlog of those who are there out of status or illegal at the moment.  Ways and means of inducting them into the system of application under the new legislation are now being discussed by our friends in Congress.  The granting of amnesties, as the Deputy has suggested, would have to be done on a general basis across the board.  It could not be done particularly for the Irish or any other race within the context of the United States approach. So the approach we are adopting is one of maximising the Irish take-up of visas, giving us a certain advantage on the basis of the criteria I mentioned while not going down the amnesty road which would have to be generalised and include every race and every nation.  The United States would not, under any circumstances, tolerate selection of a particular race or nation or ethnic group for amnesty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the original Donnelly legislation of three years ago emigrants who were out of status in America were entitled to apply for visas as well, and the intention of the House of Representatives at the time was that there should be no problem about these people getting visas.  But when it came to the implementation of that legislation there were considerable difficulties for individual emigrants.  The Minister and the Department will be aware of what I am talking about.  Would the Minister take a note of all this and talk to the Administration in the US with a view to ensuring that when the Kennedy-Simpson legislation is passed these difficulties will <Col N="773" /> not arise?  While the intention was that those who were out of status should be allowed to become in status, if that is the correct word, it did not work out that way and I would not like to see the same thing happen under this new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in that the Donnelly legislation to which he refers was a &ldquo;lottery legislation&rdquo; which was once-off legislation and there was not a full take up of it.  We are looking at this matter very closely.  I agree with the Deputy that there appears to be a problem with people coming forward.  We discussed this with various Irish American societies, churches, trade unions, the Administration and politicians seeking to adopt ways and means of encouraging Irish emigrants who are out of status to come forward to participate in this new scheme.  The difference is that the new scheme will be a permanent ongoing scheme.  The scheme to which Deputy Barry refers was welcome, but it was a once-off scheme.  If the present attitude prevails it will be disappointing as there will not be a full take up of the 10,000 visas and this will have to change.</P>
    </Speaker>

They must devise ways and means of encouraging young people to come forward and participate in what will be a permanent scheme of legislation to meet their interests.</P>

We will certainly take up Deputy Barry's suggestion with the US.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The Government recognise that special legislation can be necessary to deal with terrorism, but we have pointed out to the British Government that the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act has been discriminatory and insensitive and has caused considerable resentment among law-abiding Irish people.</P>
      <P>I have discussed the Act at meetings with British Ministers.  On my instructions, my Department provided specific views to the British Government prior to the renewal date of the current Act. Views were also provided to Lord Colville who was appointed by the Home Secretary as an independent reviewer of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The particular issues which we raised with the British Government included: the low rate of charging of persons detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act which raises doubt as to whether all of these people were properly detained on suspicion of involvement with terrorism; the lack of information regarding detentions, including lack of notification to the embassy in London; the lack of access to legal advice in the first 48 hours of detention; the length of detention which at present may extend to seven days; the lack of private facilities for examinations at ports and airports; the lack of compensation for loss of earnings; the concentration of the use of landing and embarkation cards on routes to and from Ireland; the importance of respecting the use of names in Irish; the principle of exclusion orders and the necessity for tact and sensitivity in the manner in which certain of the Prevention of Terrorism Act powers are exercised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Act was first introduced, there have been a number of changes.  I would note that the scope of the Act now extends to international terrorism as well as to terrorism arising from the situation in Northern Ireland and that the number of detentions in Britain has greatly decreased.  In the first two years of the Act, 1,000 people per year were detained in Britain in connection with terrorism <Col N="776" /> arising from the situation in Northern Ireland.  Last year 184 people were detained.</P>
    <P>While the operation of the Act continues to give cause for concern, and at times strong concern, it is important to bear in mind that it does not affect in any adverse way the vast majority of Irish people living in Britain or the vast majority of the people travelling to and from Britain.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure Deputies that discussions will continue with the British Authorities on the points of particular concern to us and that my Department will continue to provide assistance on request to Irish persons affected by the Prevention of Terrorism Act legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if the list of proposals that were made to the British Government are the proposals made to Lord Colville when he was reviewing the Act the year before last?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in view of the recent disclosure in a media report (details supplied) of Libyan involvement in the arms shipment found on the <i>Eksund,</i> if he will sever all connections with the Libyan Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 33 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear in the Dáil on a number of occasions that the Government's over-riding concern is to assess at all stages what are the most effective means of ensuring that neither Libya nor any other country offers support of any kind, moral, political or material to subversive elements in this country.</P>
      <P>The Libyan authorities are fully aware of the unequivocal view of the Government that any support, moral or material, for the Provisional IRA from any source is unacceptable.  The Libyan authorities can be under no doubts as to the position of this, and previous Irish Governments, on that important point of principle.</P>
      <P>The French judicial investigation into the operation engaged in by the <i>Eksund</i> and its crew is continuing.  The Garda and the French security forces remain in close contact in order to ensure that all relevant information is made available to the Government as this investigation develops.  There have been no contacts between my Department and the Libyan authorities arising from the media reports referred to by Deputies.  Such reports are neither an adequate nor satisfactory basis for diplomatic action of the type suggested in the question.  As I have assured the Dáil in response to previous questions on this matter, when the full facts are available to them, the Government will carefully consider what further action may be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall <Col N="778" /> saying to me last May when I questioned him about the use by the Provisional IRA of a new explosive called Semtex which was alleged to have been procured by them from the Libyan authorities that I should not pay any attention to newspaper reports?  Does he now remember that in the past 12 months a number of references have been made to the fact that this highly dangerous explosive is available to the Provisional IRA and that some attention must be paid to it?  Does he also recall assuring us at that time that he would investigate the matter and report back to the Dáil?  Has he the result of that examination yet?  Does he not think it is now time to break off diplomatic relations with this country, the leader of which, in spite of the arrest of the <i>Eksund</i> in the past three months, still says he supports in every way the Provisional IRA?  It is time we brought home to them finally that we do not accept in this country support of any kind for a subversive organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, we have made our position quite clear to the Libyan authorities that we deplore and repudiate any effort made to offer any sustenance whatsoever to any subversive organisation in Ireland.  On the diplomatic relations aspect, the Secretary of State, Mr. King, was asked a question by Mr. John Marshall, MP for Hendon South, on precisely these lines yesterday in the House of Commons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in regard to arms having come in <i>via</i> Libya.  Mr. King mentioned a number of other very respectable countries.  I will quote exactly from what he said in regard to the supply of explosives and arms to Ireland, particularly Northern Ireland.  He said: &ldquo;I understand that weapons and explosives recently recovered in Ireland were manufactured in a number of countries including the Soviet Union, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, the United States of America, Belgium, France, <Col N="779" /> Great Britain, the Irish Republic, Norway and Portugal&rdquo; in addition to Libya.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the facts.  Certainly I would be very unwise and remiss if I proceeded in any way to withdraw diplomatic relations from a country with whom a number of countries all over the world, including ourselves, have trade relations, in advance of the ascertainment of all the facts.  I can reassure the Deputy and the House that the facts are being investigated at present by the French authorities in conjunction with our own authorities and we are awaiting the full picture before taking whatever action we may consider appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that the Heads of Government of the countries he has listed have declared their support for the Provisional IRA?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not dealing in idle rhetoric and the Deputy is as well aware as I am of the sort of rhetoric in which Moslem and Arab leaders sometimes engage.  That is part of the scene in the Middle East and North Africa.  I am not dealing in rhetoric.  I am dealing with the supply of arms and ammunitions and a long list of countries are guilty of the supply of arms not just to Northern Ireland or to Ireland as a whole but throughout the world.  I have mentioned some of those countries and they were mentioned yesterday in the House of Commons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious implication by the Tánaiste that these countries are supplying arms to an illegal organisation in this country.  That is the impression he is trying to leave.  There is a total difference between the United States and Libya and between Romania and Libya and their attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister, in giving the British response to this question, seems to indicate that the British have established the facts.  Have we not established the facts of the situation?  I am asking the Minister specifically: is it a fact that in recent months, arms for the Provisional IRA have come from Libya? Are we able to say that or not, or must we depend on Mr. Tom King's reply in the House of Commons?  Can we not carry out our own investigation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is this &mdash; I am now repeating myself and I apologise for so doing &mdash; there is at present an investigation being carried out by the French security authorities in which the Irish security authorities are participating fully.  That investigation is proceeding as of now.  What I was quoting was from a question yesterday in the House of Commons tabled by Mr. John Marshall which was to ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what evidence he has of the countries of origin of the arms recently found in Ireland.  Mr. King gave the list which I have outlined earlier in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If by this time the British are able to supply their evidence, have our Government not got evidence? Is it a fact that arms have come from Libya for the Provisional IRA?  How can the British have reached conclusions when we still have not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept <Col N="782" /> that there is a difference between the country of origin or manufacture of weapons and the country which supplies the weapons?  Will he accept that in this case we are talking about weapons of various origins being supplied by the Libyan Government to the IRA?  In the light of such weapons being supplied by the Libyan Government, will the Minister consider breaking off diplomatic relations with that country?  Finally, will he indicate what recent communications there have been directly between our Government and the French Government in order to ascertain up-to-date information as to the rate at which the investigations into the <i>Eksund</i> episode are proceeding and what information has been gained therefrom to date?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last question is important.  I should say that we are in regular contact with the French authorities. The investigation is being conducted by the French and Irish security authorities to the fullest extent and there is total co-operation on both sides.  I can assure the House that as far as a matter of this kind is concerned we take it very seriously.  Furthermore, we will take the right action when we have the proper facts available.  We want to ensure there is no subversive activity on this island &mdash; to the greatest extent possible to which our Government can so ensure &mdash; and our security forces are aware of that.  I am more than anxious &mdash; as much if not more than most Members of this House &mdash; and am fully aware of the importance of this but one does not proceed to withdraw diplomatic relations until the final file is available and the case made.  I reiterate that the security authorities both here and in France are preparing such a file on which our Government will take the appropriate decision on the security data available from those sources in due course.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that in view of the massive cuts of £11 million in this year's Estimates, which in real terms amount to a 40 per cent cut in our discretionary contribution, there is widespread disillusionment and despair felt among all the Irish groups working for world development who believe that if a similar cut is effected next year the future of the whole bilateral aid programme will be jeopardised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister of State make such a statement in view of the closure of the embassy in Nairobi, the dismantling of the aid development office in Sudan and the enormous cuts referred to by Deputy Griffin?  My question is very simple: how does he propose to respond to the non-governmental organisations' submission to him that any continuing cuts in the programme will endanger the very structure of the bilateral aid programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the closure of the embassy in Nairobi has nothing to do with Official Development Assistance; that is a departmental problem.  I reiterate for the Deputy again, the commitment of the Government to the maintenance and augmentation of Official Development Assistance as soon as economic circumstances permit.  I might say to the Deputy also that he is well aware that had the circumstances that have prevailed in recent years been allowed to continue, with Government expenditure continuing at the same rate, then within a year or two there would have been no <Col N="785" /> Official Development Assistance forthcoming at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a related supplementary.  In relation to our bilateral aid programme, how can the Minister of State justify the fact that there has been a 1 per cent cut in the allocation in the Estimates of his Department and a cut of between 30 per cent and 40 per cent in the development aid programme in the Department's Estimates?  Is this not an indication of the low priority both of our bilateral and multilateral programmes in the Department's Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I cannot agree at all.  The Deputy complained about the closure of the embassy in Nairobi earlier. I might add that that was omitted from the Department's official Estimate.  I can again reassure him of the Government's commitment to the Bilateral Aid Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's assurance is not very reassuring in view of his previous statements when he indicated that there would not be any cut and if he is as true to his words on this occasion we can expect further cuts in the immediate future.  Would the Minister not agree that the Government have reneged on their commitment to the Third World, that they have betrayed the poorest of the poor and those most vulnerable and, as a consequence, Ireland's credibility in international fora has been substantially reduced, if not totally eroded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

      <P>The meeting of 2 March to which the Deputy refers was a very constructive one between the officials of the two offices.  These proposals are being examined now and finality has been practically reached.  There have been regular telephone and other contacts since then without a formal meeting taking place and I hope that agreement will be reached fairly shortly on how to implement the safeguards &mdash; after all, these are new safeguards that we brought into the extradition legislation &mdash; the procedural ways and means of doing so and to ensure that the Act passed by this House works as smoothly as possible.

Can he confirm that at no stage prior to that meeting had the Attorney General's office in Dublin indicated in detail to the British Attorney General's office what information they required to satisfy the criteria of the Act and could he also confirm that by the time the Act was passed through the Oireachtas the Attorney General's office had not clarified, in their own minds, what criteria were required?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, having regard to the existence of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), he will recognise the present system of Ireland's diplomatic representation and accretion with the six member States of ASEAN with a view to giving one Ambassador overall responsibility for dealings with ASEAN group, having regard to their increasing economic importance in terms of trade with the rest of the world and Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The following states are members of the Association of South East Asian Nations: Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.  Ireland maintains diplomatic relations with each of these states.  Our Ambassador to India is concurrently accredited to Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.  Our Ambassador to Australia is concurrently accredited to Indonesia. Our Ambassador to China is likewise accredited to the Philippines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For practical reasons it would not be feasible at the present time to concurrently accredit one ambassador to all six ASEAN member states.  Having regard to the resources available to us, <Col N="790" /> the existing arrangements are satisfactory and there are no proposals to change them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the constraints that are on the Minister for Foreign Affairs' budget and his staff allocation but I think he would agree that it is necessary for this country to have a co-ordinated approach and for the diplomatic representation to be <i>au fait</i> with all of the ASEAN countries.  Can I ask the Minister to reconsider the statement he has made with a view to accrediting one ambassador to the six ASEAN countries and to perhaps reassigning some second level staff to that embassy to take on the necessary workload?  The economic implications for this country are enormous and both the IDA and CTT have identified that.  I leave it to the Minister to decide how best it could be done but I ask him to reconsider the response he has given to the House.</P>

      <P>I will certainly reconsider this matter.  I am already having it examined with a view to rationalising our representations in that area in accordance with our trade and investment interests in particular.  The only caveat I would enter in the matter is that there are enormous distances involved and that was the <i>ad hoc</i> basis on which the division was taken up to now.  It is probably the area of most growth in the world at present in so far as economic development is concerned and the fastest growing economic group of countries in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Along with our European partners, we are very conscious of the importance of the political aspects of the agreement on the elimination of intermediate range nuclear weapons. These aspects of the matter were considered in some detail at the meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen on 4 and 5 December 1987.  In the Declaration on East-West relations issued after that meeting the Twelve referred to the significance of the INF Agreement, expressed the hope that it would enter into force soon and stated that it was essential that this achievement on nuclear arms control should give further impetus to substantive progress in the whole range of present and future bilateral US-Soviet and multilateral negotiations on arms control and disarmament.  Negotiations are going ahead in all these areas.  This matter arose only yesterday at a meeting of Foreign Ministers in Brussels which I attended.  We are taking positive steps to activate in a more meaningful way the <Col N="793" /> Vienna process of CSCE which has become dormant in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  He is probably aware that the question was originally tabled to the Taoiseach &mdash; hence the reference to the forthcoming European Council &mdash; and it was obviously transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Would the Minister specifically outline what bilateral action the Government propose to take within the various Councils of the European Community to activate the Vienna process and what measures he has in mind as a result of the INF Treaty, which directly concern European nations in general and the European Community in particular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a full discussion of this matter yesterday and it is fresh in my mind.  The Twelve have adopted a united stance which places emphasis on the human rights dimension.  We are talking about all human rights, not just the spectacular human rights which get headlines, but human rights as they affect ordinary people.  I am talking about a whole range of rights ranging from freedom of persons to freedom of religion, freedom of trial, freedom of movement and so on.  The Twelve have prepared a comprehensive dossier and the decision taken was to contact the co-ordinator of the neutral and non-aligned countries &mdash; an Austrian member of the CSCE &mdash; with a view to adopting a unified approach not just within the Community, but also with the neutral non-aligned countries like Sweden and Austria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At coming meetings we should put emphasis on the whole range of economic and security matters on which decisions must be reached, such as the reduction in conventional forces and economic co-operation. All these areas are basically dependent on the very real advance in human rights.  Now is the appropriate time to exercise the necessary leverage in this respect if the Eastern European countries, particularly the Soviet Union, want progress in the economic and security areas.  As far as the western European <Col N="794" /> democracies in and outside the Community are concerned, their main interest is human rights from the Atlantic to the Urals and this is the appropriate time to press this matter.  There is very strong feeling in the Twelve at present that hopefully we will reach finality on these matters before the summer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give the House an assurance that the Irish representatives at that or other related Councils, will continue to encourage the Twelve to urge the Soviet Union and the United States to proceed with their talks for a gradual balance of disarmament on both sides and that such encouragement should not necessarily be intrinsically linked with progress on the human rights side?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

The Federal Republic of Germany is taking a very strong supportive line in this area and their Presidency of the Community, which they hold at present, is being utilised to the maximum extent to make progress along the lines the Deputy and I are discussing.</P>

      <P>I welcome the efforts by Secretary of State Shultz to establish a basis for negotiation between the parties directly concerned in the Arab-Israeli conflict.  The recent disturbances on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip have brought home once again the urgent necessity of seeking a political solution to the conflict so that progress can be made towards the achievement of a just, comprehensive and peaceful solution.</P>
      <P>Ireland, together with its partners in the Twelve, is of the view that the only solution to the conflict, including the present disturbances in the occupied territories, is by means of a comprehensive, just and lasting political settlement in accordance with the 1980 Venice Declaration and subsequent Twelve declarations. At a meeting in Bonn on 8 February the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve reaffirmed the support of the Twelve for the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations as the suitable framework for negotiations between the parties directly concerned.  I have made clear on a number of occasions Ireland's commitment to the convening of an international conference under UN auspices with the participation of the parties concerned and of any party able to make a direct and positive contribution to the restoration and maintenance of peace and to the region's economic and social development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all three questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="798" /> I, of course, regret that the national executive of the Prison Officers' Association have decided to serve strike notice with effect from 16 April next.</P>
    <P>Contrary to an impression which has been created, the question on which members of the POA were asked to vote in the recent ballot was not whether there should be a strike on 16 April.  Instead members were asked whether they were, &ldquo;prepared to embark upon a course of industrial action up to and including strike action if necessary&rdquo;.  It seems to me that the wording on the ballot clearly envisaged strike action only as a very last resort.  In the circumstances I am disappointed that, although the outcome of the ballot did not become known until yesterday, the executive decided to immediately serve strike notice.</P>
    <P>That being said, there is clearly a very real danger of the strike going ahead.  My Department have had consultations with the Garda Síochána and the Army to prepare to deal with this eventuality.  It would not be appropriate, for obvious reasons, for me to go into any detail about contingency plans but I should stress that every effort will be made to preserve basic facilities for offenders such as access to visits.</P>
    <P>The issues involved in the present dispute have a long history.  Successive Ministers for Justice have taken the view that the level of overtime working in the prison service has been excessive and, indeed, the Prison Officers' Association itself had made many public pronouncements to this effect and called for additional staff to be recruited.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances it was decided when this year's financial allocations were being settled that a new roster would be introduced and that 200 extra staff would be recruited to enable this.  Most of the 200 new jobs have now been filled and it was necessary in order to stay within the allocations to implement the new roster. This was designed, allowing for the cost of new staff, to achieve a net saving of £2 million.  I had hoped that it would prove possible to reach agreement with the POA on the form of a new roster but, in the event, this was not forthcoming.  In <Col N="799" /> fact discussions took place for over three years in an attempt to secure agreement on a new roster but I think most Members of this House will accept that the Government could not indefinitely allow the lack of agreement to stand in the way of providing jobs for 200 people.  Even with the new roster there is still £6.3 million available for overtime in the prison service this year and this works out at an average of £3,000 in overtime payments for each member of the staff.</P>
    <P>While I am, of course, anxious that the dispute be resolved the net issue remains that the new roster was necessary so that money could be spent on 200 new jobs rather than on overtime.  I cannot accept that such an approach necessitates financial compensation for existing staff but in any case the money is simply not available.</P>
    <P>I do accept, however, that the roster which was introduced recently is causing difficulties for staff.  That is why my Department have made clear to the POA that there is a much better roster available &mdash; from the point of view of staff &mdash; if the association would agree to its implementation.  I think members of the prison service would be doing themselves an injustice in embarking on strike action without having the alternative roster fully explored by their association.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that I cannot use the floor of this House as a forum for negotiating with the POA and, accordingly, there is a limit to what I can say about a resolution to this dispute.  I do believe, however, that with goodwill on both sides it should prove possible to avoid a confrontation on this issue but it would be unrealistic to call on me alone to intervene to prevent the threatened strike as though the POA itself has no function or responsibilities in this matter.</P>
    <P>In this context I should inform the House that some weeks ago at the request of the POA a mediator was appointed under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  I am at present considering having my Department contact the mediator requesting that further discussions take place under his auspices <Col N="800" /> between my Department and the POA in an effort to resolve the present dispute.</P>
    <P>I have no objections to having discussions with the POA directly but it would have been inappropriate for me to have had such a meeting while mediation was taking place.  Before agreeing to a meeting I would have to be satisfied that this represented the best hope for resolving the situation.  Obviously in the discussions which have already taken place my officials have been acting with my full knowledge and authority and my inclination at this stage is that it would be best for discussions under the mediator to continue.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I will explore every avenue under proper industrial relations procedures to seek a resolution to this dispute.  I would urge the national executive of the POA to do likewise so as to avoid a course of action that could have very serious implications for staff and their families.  I would ask staff themselves to think long and hard before taking strike action in circumstances where, from their point of view, there is a much better roster on offer.  Finally, I would ask Members of this House to accept that the approach of using the available finances to create jobs rather than on overtime &mdash; which is the basic issue at stake &mdash; is the correct one.</P>

      <P>In thanking the Minister for his detailed and lengthy reply, could I ask him about the nub issue that we can be involved in here?  As he rightly said, we cannot be involved in negotiation of this matter across the floor of the House. Is he aware of the clear statements put out by the association that they feel that the matters in dispute can be resolved in direct discussion and meeting between them and the Minister?  They have specifically asked for that course.  Could I, therefore, ask the Minister to confirm, as he suggested in his reply in a rather obscure way, that he is prepared to follow the best course at the 11th hour, of responding favourably to the suggestion from the association and agree to sit down with them and try to resolve the difficulty face-to-face across the table as they have <Col N="801" /> requested?  This seems a perfectly reasonable, appropriate, speedy and efficient way of dealing with an imminent crisis.</P>

      <P>With regard to the first part of Deputy Taylor's question, I am aware of the statements issued on behalf of the Prison Officers' Association.  I was made aware of this dispute only by way of a news broadcast yesterday at 1.30 p.m. when they gave notice of their intention to strike as and from April 16. Since then I have been watching all news bulletins and listening to them in the hope that I would know what they were saying, because I have not been given copies of their statements.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of Deputy Taylor's question as to whether I would be prepared to meet the association, I have said I would be prepared to meet them but up to now I could not because the request came for a mediator which we conceded.  Certainly under the C &amp; A scheme there was not any room for me as Minister to meet the Prison Officers' Association as long as the mediator was doing what he should do. In the event of the mediator not being acceptable, I will certainly consider the request for a meeting with the Prison Officers' Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago I raised this matter here but unfortunately the Minister was away at the time.  I warned the Taoiseach at that time that the Prison Officers' Association were coming up against the wire in terms of having a dispute.  I dropped a note to the Minister himself on that matter.  I was pleased to hear that mediation facilities are available.  Could the mediator be given powers of recommendation?  This is vitally important if we are to have a meaningful mediation system, combined with the withdrawal of his proposals for a limited period &mdash; and I stress that &mdash; pending further discussions.  What we all on this side of the House are trying to do is to prevent what could be a very serious strike.  It is not my intention here today to say anything that would not be helpful. Could we have a mediator who could <Col N="802" /> have a power of recommendation and could the Minister's proposals for the new rostering system be withdrawn for a very limited period &mdash; and I mean that &mdash; pending these discussions?  The discussions also should have a time limit on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Barrett and Deputy Taylor for their concern in relation to the strike threat.  I am very much aware also of what is involved. As I said last evening and say again today, I certainly hope that the Prison Officers' Association will have a rethink on this.  I said at the outset of my reply that when they balloted their members &mdash; and I read to the House the question on which the ballot was taken &mdash; a strike threat was to be the very last recourse.  However, as soon as the votes were in, it would happen to be the first recourse.  With regard to the question of the mediator, under the C&amp;A scheme, as Deputy Barrett knows full well, the purpose of the mediator is to get consensus between the two sides. That is as it was and as it has to be under that scheme.</P>
      <P>On the suggestion by Deputy Barrett that the roster at present in operation be withdrawn, the Deputy knows full well that I and the leader of his party who was my immediate predecessor have been trying to get agreement on a roster for the past three years and we have not met with any progress whatsoever.  There is no hope now in thinking that if the roster in operation were withdrawn we would be any nearer a solution in six to 12 months' time.  I can only say that, having regard to the financial allocation available to me to run the prison service this year by way of moneys for overtime, which is £6.4 million, this is the only way I can manage within the resources available to me.  There is no other money available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I again concede to the House that difficulties are being experienced in the implementation of this roster as at present in operation.  I repeat there is a far better roster available which can be brought in only with the agreement of the Prison Officers' Association <Col N="803" /> and which cannot be imposed.  I would be more than happy and prepared to sit down this very minute with the Prison Officers' Association to tell them that that is a far better roster for the benefit of their members which will result in an efficient prison service with everything running within the limit of the resources available to us.  I would ask them to help us to get that system under way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I also thank the Minister for his sincere response.  Any resolution of this problem should be in the context of the budget already allocated in the 1988 Estimate.  Having said that, problems of this kind will be ongoing until such time as we have a new management structure in the prison service and obviously that is not something that can be discussed in the context of this dispute alone.  Would the Minister be in a position to meet with the Prison Officers' Association while the mediation is going ahead?  I understand from the association, whose members I have met recently, that a meeting with the Minister would go a long way towards sorting out the existing difficulties.  Instead of talking to each other through the press, radio and television &mdash; and I sympathise with the Minister's position &mdash; if the Minister were to agree to meet with the Prison Officers' Association that would go a long way towards avoiding the all-out strike on 16 April.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for his response.  Is he aware of the consequences if this dispute is allowed to continue?  The Garda will be implicated which will reduce security in the city and, for that reason, the Minister should become involved.  The Minister said that there is mediation at present but the prison officers have given notice that there will be a strike on 16 April.  The prison officers are not looking for extra cash; they are concerned with the rota which has been imposed on them without prior notice.  I appeal to the Minister to agree to meet the prison officers to discuss the rota with them.</P>

I will give them a roster which will benefit their members to a far greater degree than the present one.  I have no hang-up in the world about meeting them here and now if it does not cost me money.  If the prison officers say publicly that any changes will not cost the Exchequer additional moneys, other than the £38.5 million provided for the prison service, I will be happy.</P>

In a nutshell, if I get the agreement of the Prison Officers' Association &mdash; and bearing in mind that I have been assured on behalf of the association here today that no additional funds are required &mdash; I will give a guarantee that there will be a separate prison rostering system which will meet the wishes of all the people involved.  It would be regrettable if people in the association believe, as a result of the discussion here today, that their position will be improved above and beyond that obtaining at present, having regard to the mediator's input.  It is unfair to the Prison Officers' Association.  There are serious issues involved and there is no additional money available to meet overtime payments in the prison service above and beyond the £6.3 million provided for.  I must work within that allocation. I have, as Deputy Enright said, already given additional employment to 200 young persons who were on the dole before that.  The situation can be improved for everybody involved if the new roster system which I have ready is accepted by them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section allows the ACC to have 20 per cent of their business in the form of lending as defined in subsection (1) to the non-agricultural sector. Why is the volume of business to be transacted with the non-agricultural sector expressed as a percentage of the total business instead of in terms of an absolute <Col N="850" /> sum?  For example, if the Agricultural Credit Corporation are doing particularly well in their non-agricultural business and are close to the limit of 20 per cent, they are obliged to enter into four times as much agricultural business in order to allow themselves to increase by a given amount their non-agricultural business because it is one of the limits expressed in the case of the non-agricultural business as a percentage of the whole.  One accepts that there should be a limit in that this is a State guaranteed operation but it might be more sensible to express the limit as a sum of money which could in practice be 20 per cent of the existing total business or, to be more flexible, 30 per cent of the existing total business.  It should be expressed as a figure in cash, not as a percentage.</P>
      <P>In regard to its non-agricultural business, can the Minister tell us what will be the extent of the State guarantee, if any, on the operations of the ACC in so far as they extend into new areas of business? Will it be acting as a bank in the non-agricultural sector with the benefit of a State guarantee or will the State guarantee which it currently enjoys be confined to its existing business?  If it is going to extend into new areas with the benefit of a State guarantee can the Minister explain the necessity for a State guarantee in that regard?  Presumably it will be only going into these new areas on the basis that it will be commercially viable for it to do so and not for any social or broader economic considerations.  If it is a commercial arrangement why would it need a State guarantee, if it is getting one?</P>

      <P>We will deal with the the section which deals with that aspect. The ACC has had a State guarantee since its inception and this change would not interfere in any way with that.  The State guarantee would still cover all lending by the ACC.  I have to confess that I do not know exactly how the figure of 20 per cent was arrived at but perhaps the Deputy may be able to help us in that.  I compliment him for introducing this idea <Col N="851" /> in the first instance and for preparing this section of the legislation.  It was drafted during his time in the Department.</P>

      <P>Section 2 will allow the ACC to lend 20 per cent of its moneys to non-agricultural borrowers.  That 20 per cent would amount to approximately £90 million.  Therefore, there is plenty of leeway and it will be some time before that figure is reached.  We were careful to ensure that there would be sufficient resources available for lending for agricultural purposes.  That is what is being fully protected in this section.  That is why there is a difference, and a guarded difference by law, between the 80 per cent and the 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in so far as it goes.  The ACC in the past could have been described as a single sector bank in that it was confined to lending to the agricultural, horticultural and fisheries sector.  At a time when farmers found it difficult to obtain finance to <Col N="852" /> develop their farms the ACC made this finance available.  As a result of being a one sector bank the ACC ran into considerable difficulties in obtaining repayments when agriculture started going through a difficult period.  Other financial institutions, such as the associated banks, also suffered losses in agricultural sector lending during that time.</P>
      <P>I presume that the ratio can be altered in the future.  I do not know whether the Minister could at a later date alter it by way of regulation or whether it would be necessary to bring forward another Bill into this House to do so but as the Minister for Finance has some control over the corporate lending of semi-State bodies I suggest that the Minister, where possible, should ask our semi-State bodies to conduct their business through the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I think that this Bill is very much along the lines of that thinking and I am anxious that our semi-State bodies, where possible, should consider seeking investment and conducting their business through the ACC.  The ACC is a semi-State body and if they can do this it would be to the benefit of everybody.</P>
      <P>The ACC has suffered some losses and faces some difficulties in the future.  It will have to make efforts to reduce its losses and in fairness it has already made some efforts to reduce costs.  There have been a number of lay-offs and office closures. It will be necessary for us to give them some assistance and this Bill is one way of doing so.  I think it will take between five and eight years to bring the ACC back into profitability, given the nature of their problems.  In my view, this Bill and this particular section of it are very welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The points made by Deputy Enright are worth considering. To change the 20 per cent, further legislation would be required.  The main reason for having the 20 per cent fixed was to protect agriculture which was the main reason for having the ACC there at all.  I take the point the Deputy has made as to the efforts of the ACC management <Col N="853" /> and board to reduce costings and administration throughout the country and at HQ and that their efforts are having the desired results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was involved in the original drafting of this legislation and agreed to the 20 per cent limit because I felt that getting the ACC out of agriculture solely was in itself an advance.  I must confess that I have some reservations as to whether there should be a limit as low as 20 per cent.  It seems that the benefits to agriculture of having the ACC exclusively or even 80 per cent confined to agriculture are, to say the least, intangible given that most of the farmers do their business with banks other than the ACC, and given that banking of its nature is something that should be conducted on fairly tight margins.  I am not convinced that there is really a need to have a separate bank dedicated to agriculture.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister outline for the House the specific benefits of having an agricultural bank owned by the State?  I know endeavours were made some time ago by the then President of the ICOS, now a member of the European Parliament, Mr. T.J. Maher, to bring Rabobank in here from The Netherlands to set up a co-operative agricultural bank.  I would prefer that sort of approach if there is a need for an agricultural bank.  It should be co-operative run rather than Government run.  It would be better in the long run for the future of the ACC, if the ACC were to be encouraged to go beyond 20 per cent in their non-agricultural business and as they develop profitably in that business they should reach a point where their balance sheet is such that the ACC could be sold.  There is no great advantage in retaining the ACC in the public sector, but obviously that is something that one would not suddenly do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that there should be a measure of long term thinking as to where we are going with the ACC.  The Minister should outline what he expects the Agricultural Credit Corporation to be doing in ten years time and who he expects to own it ten years from now.  Does the <Col N="854" /> Minister envisage minority or majority shareholding in the ACC being sold to outsiders whether they be agricultural or non-agricultural interests, Irish or foreign interests?  I recognise that if we were to put the ACC on the market with its present limitation of 20 per cent of its business only being capable of being transacted outside of agriculture one might not get the full potential long term value that one would wish.  If one were to contemplate having a figure larger than 20 per cent one could envisage the possibility of being able to sell shares in the ACC and this bank could then become a competitor with the associated banks.</P>
    <P>I know from bitter experience that when a subsidiary of one of the two large banks got into difficulty it was a matter that tended to touch almost the solvency of the financial system of the country. That is an unnatural situation.  It should not be the case that any one bank could be so dominant that anything touching its affairs adversely should have such wide implications for the State's financial position as was the case with the ICI-AIB affair.  Clearly it is desirable from the point of view of the management of the banking system that the Minister should be trying to introduce more banks and more diversity into the banking system.</P>
    <P>I would favour a situation in which the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Industrial Credit Company, either separately or together, would become full banks in full competition with the existing associated banks.  I am also in favour of allowing the building societies to become increasingly involved in the same area as the banks and <i>vice versa</i> with the purpose of getting away from the situation where banking is dominated by two large groups.  If we get diversity and if we get away from the oligopoly that exists in that market currently, and closer to a situation of perfect competition in the banking system, that would be desirable. We could in this House take a substantial step in that direction today by changing one single word in this section, and that is the word &ldquo;lesser&rdquo; in line 21, on page 3.  If we were to allow the Minister to set such larger amount as the Minister may <Col N="855" /> from time to time determine, then he would have the freedom to allow the Agricultural Credit Corporation to move more freely and fully into banking.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the debate that we needed an agricultural bank.  Do we really?  Who says so and why?  If so, why must it be owned by the State?  I happen to be a farmer by background and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I mean no disrespect to the ACC, but many people whom I know in the same business do not feel that they must deal with the ACC.  In practice they deal with one of the banks.  If one looks at the notices as to who is doing most of the seizures of farms at the moment, it is generally speaking, the banks.  That is evidence in itself.  The Minister should be more ambitious in trying to use this Bill as a method of restructuring and rendering more competitive the banking sector. Having made that general point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Killanin Commission have recommended a change.  I have put down an amendment which the Irish Bloodstock Breeders Association have looked at and told me, &ldquo;These amendments appear ideal to satisfy the requirements of the Killanin Commission on horse breeding.&rdquo; That is the amendment Deputy Noonan and I have tabled.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objective of the ACC is to lend money in advance.  Their problem is in regard to share capital and they depend on the State for finance.  One of the problems they have to face is that they have to pay a very high rate of interest for investors and they have paid quite generous interest to investors over the years.  That has proved wise in that they have obtained investments from different and diverse citizens of our country who invested with them, first, because of their high interest rate, second, they were State guaranteed.  The ACC have not the same multiplicity of offices around the country as have building societies, the commerical banks and An Post. People will not travel long distances to invest money; they like to go to the nearest location for that purpose.  I have <Col N="858" /> spoken about the problem of a multiplicity of offices which cost a great deal of money to maintain, pay staff and so on. I ask the Minister to consider favourably some type of provision for the ACC, as they are a semi-State body, on terms somewhat equivalent to those of An Post. In other words, moneys could be invested for a fixed time with some attractions or incentives to maintain the strength of the ACC.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy Bruton's point that many farmers invest with other financial institutions such as the commercial banks.  A large staff are engaged in the ACC, many of them agricultural graduates and some have worked in agriculture. The emphasis varies, but the ACC have been sympathetic to farmers, and I would like farmers to have some scope to meet people who are familiar with their problems.  Agriculture is at present going through enormous difficulties. The number of farmers who face major problems is large.  The point made by Deputy Bruton in regard to amendments is important.</P>

On Second Stage the Deputy was free to indicate what might be in the Bill but on Committee Stage the Deputy, unfortunately for him and for Deputy Bruton, is confined to what is proposed in the Bill and romanticising, theorising or philosophising about other things that cannot be in it does not appear to be a very gainful exercise apart from the fact that it is not appropriate.</P>

I do not think I can pursue it further and thank the Chair for allowing me to explain it to the Minister.  I would ask the Minister to see what can be done. The Department may not have the final say in the legislation but it is worth looking at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The points made by Deputy Bruton were partly answered by Deputy Enright.  He asked about the necessity for an agricultural bank.  It is there and we have to deal with it.  We are dealing with it in this way to permit it to lend outside agriculture.  Deputy Enright made the point about an increase in competition for investments; that is a normal commercial activity that has to be undertaken in this business.  The fact that ACC will now be lending outside the agricultural area will in itself begin to attract further increased deposits from areas outside agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since there was an amendment down I would like to say a few words about the points that have been made by both Deputies in relation to the Killanin report.  The recommendations in it relating to the use of bloodstock as security for loans raises complex legal and administrative issues which both Deputies have referred to.  Deputy Enright in particular went into great detail about it.  Among these issues is who would be responsible in the event of error in the register which would record ownership and charges against that ownership.  In view of the <Col N="861" /> high values of bloodstock this is a significant issue.  Another issue is how to establish a watertight system of identification of horses on the register.  The suitability of the existing passport system used by the turf club for the purpose of the register would have to be established and the need to give that system legal status would have to be clarified.</P>
    <P>Yet another issue is what arrangements should be made at bloodstock auctions to avoid the sale of an animal that is subject to charges.  These and other issues are being examined inter-departmentally. When this examination is completed the Government will consider it sympathetically, bringing forward any necessary legislative amendments, even though it is not particularly relevant to this section.  Perhaps in the long term it will be.  As the Deputies will know, many of the issues in the Killanin Commission report are being examined in the Department of Agriculture and Food and some in the Department of Finance and, we hope, there will be some acceptable solutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I have a little more information on why we need to extend the share capital of the corporation? There have been references here in the House to the problems faced by the corporation in regard to their accounts and in regard to their general position.  It may be that extending the share capital of the corporation is the wise thing to do from the point of view of the Exchequer, in the sense that one is giving a breathing space within which any problems there can be solved.  On <Col N="863" /> the other hand, it is not a small matter to have an extension of the share capital of this size in the circumstances of the corporation and I think it behoves the Minister to give a full explanation as to why he needs this.</P>
      <P>It is important to say that sections 1, 2 and 3 of this Bill stand perfectly logically on their own.  There is no need for section 4 in order to achieve the purposes of sections 1, 2 and 3.  This is a separate matter dealt with in the same Bill, but there is no connection to what we have just been discussing.  It is clearly a separate issue whether this extension should occur in the share capital of the company. I would ask the Minister to explain in some detail the current financial position of the company, the position in regard to their accounts and the auditing thereof and the justification, from the point of view of the Exchequer, of this extension of the share capital of the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Deputy may be correct in saying that section 4 has nothing to do with sections 1, 2 and 3, the fact is that the Deputy is long enough around here to know that whenever such legislation pertaining to any particular organisation is being discussed, if the situation warrants it the opportunity is taken to extend share capital or guarantees. That has been done consistently in my time here.  Section 4 provides for an increase in the authorised share capital of the ACC from £20 million to £35 million. The limit is being increased because the existing ceiling has been reached.  It is desirable that the State should have the power to increase its investment in the corporation should it find itself in need of additional equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prices in general have increased by over two and half times during the last ten years.  This would justify an increase in the equity limit to abot £50 million. Accordingly the limit of £35 million cannot be regarded as excessive. Whether the new equity limit provided for in this section or indeed the new limit on loan guarantees provided for in section 5 will be used in the future will <Col N="864" /> depend, among other things, on ACC's future financial results.  As stated in the Second Stage debate, the 1987 results are not yet available.  It is only when the audited accounts become available at the end of April that the results for 1987 will be known.  The outcome for 1987 depends on the level of bad debt provisions but preliminary indications suggest that insufficient profits will be earned by the corporation to absorb these in full. ACC's experience in this area is not unique; indeed it is the norm.  Banks both in Ireland and abroad have reported in recent years substantial additional provisions against their farmer loan books. Having regard to the experience of other financial institutions, it is perhaps not surprising that the ACC may experience a loss in 1987, bearing in mind the farm income situation, the adverse weather of 1985 and 1986 and the fact that up to now it has been a single sector bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Is the Minister in a position to outline to the House an approximate figure or an estimate of what he expects the losses to be as this information might be of benefit to the House?  I accept that there are problems and that is why I welcome this Bill.  One of the main problems is that the corporation are like any bank dealing specifically with one sector &mdash; there is a higher risk than if the business was spread across different areas.  I accept that there have been major losses over 1984, 1985 and 1986.  In spite of what has been said this year about profits in agriculture, many of the farmers whom I have met have not seen the rate of increased profits that has been spoken about by the Minister for Agriculture.  I doubt if the estimated increase in profits that was stated by the Minister is accurate.  However that is only a personal viewpoint and I am only going by what I have been told by <Col N="865" /> farmers.  I know a number of farmers who are in considerable difficulties, not farmers specialising in milk but in dry stock.  Problems also arise for people who have exceeded their quota of milk.</P>
      <P>The ACC have been making efforts to try to reduce costs.  Is the Minister in a position to state what progress has been made by the ACC in this regard?  The Minister has mentioned losses.  I would ask him what progress has been made to try to recover bad debts.  Is the Minister satisfied with the policy of the ACC in regard to negotiations with farmers who are in difficulties?  My reason for asking that question is that the commercial banks in each region have groups of people who are designated to visit different banks, arrange meetings with farmers and discuss the problems faced by farmers regarding their bad debts.  These people are able to make decisions without the individual case having to go to a board of directors.  In other words, a manager or an assistant manager of a regional office of a bank is able to make a decision if a farmer decides to sell land or if a business person decides to sell a business or a particualar asset to try to meet a liability.  The commercial bank is prepared to offer a discount on interest on its own initiative in the region office area.</P>
      <P>In dealing with my constituents I find that the ACC seem to have a problem in that when a farmer is faced with problems of repayments it appears as if the local area office has to go to ACC headquarters in Dublin and a board decision has to be made as regards how that individual farmer's problems are solved and whether they will grant a discount.  It would be better policy if the ACC had people who could make decisions earlier and in that way they might be able to obtain money at an earlier stage.  It would be better to resolve the problem earlier rather than later.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on these points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a proposal to increase by a significant proportion the amount of capital of the ACC.  It is a proposal which the Minister is characterising as a relatively routine matter and <Col N="866" /> perhaps it would be if it was taken in the context of any other corporation but in relation to the ACC I am not satisfied that in the present circumstances we should view it as a routine operation.  I do not think it is a routine operation.  It is true that every depositer with the ACC has a State guarantee and therefore any issues as to their profitability or the significance of the losses they are likely to make in any given year are not matters of huge concern to the individual depositer. To us, in our capacity as shareholders and owners of this company, their profit and loss situation is a matter of grave significance.  The Minister is an accomplished and suave advocate of the measure he is proposing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is a step with which we should take some degree of care.  The Minister is asking this House to give him and his colleagues in Government the right to put an extra £15 million into the ACC.  That is not just a theoretical proposition because at present we are told by the Minister that all of the existing authorisation to capitalise this company has been exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the circumstances in which the Agricultural Credit Corporation will require further share capital? If it were a profitable company it would not need further share capital unless it could show that it was going to give a return on that capital.  Companies go along with authorised share capital of different proportions to their profits, turnover and nature of their businesses.  On this <Col N="867" /> occasion the Minister is asking us effectively to nearly double the authorised capital of the ACC.  He says that this is a routine transaction.  The Minister says that he is not aware of any particular circumstances, save the exhaustion of the existing authorisation, which would require this step to be taken.  That is just not good enough.</P>
    <P>I reiterate what I said on Second Stage in this respect in relation to this section, that is, that I believe that this corporation is under-performing very badly.  On the trends available from their pre-existing annual reports and from what one has heard since I believe this corporation are doing very badly financially at present, that they will make a significant loss. There may be good reasons because of seasonal factors, agricultural cycles and the like that the ACC now find themselves in this position.  Also looking through the reports and, at the very least applying my knowledge to them, there are good reasons to suspect that some huge strategic errors were made in the manner in which the ACC was operated.</P>
    <P>In 1980 the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies was told that the ACC were at the crossroads.  The chief executive of the corporation informed that committee &mdash; when dispensing with the suggestion of Mr. Tom Maher, the President of the ICOS, that perhaps a totally different approach should be adopted to credit in agriculture &mdash; that they intended to become the dominant force in agricultural lending.  Their chief executive told the committee so at that time.  They set out on a programme of intensification of their activities.  They took to themselves new premises and saw themselves as expanding their role.  It seems that that was a fairly substantial strategic error.</P>
    <P>During the period that followed &mdash; when the extent of their difficulties was beginning to become apparent &mdash; their chairman in his annual report, which was laid before this House, as it has to be, indicated that he wanted this power, referred to in the first section, to diversify. <Col N="868" /> Our question now in relation to this section is whether we give the Government a right to subscribe additional share capital to the ACC.</P>
    <P>The Minister says to Deputy Enright that he is not in a position at present to give an informal account of the financial state of that corporation.  I cannot understand why he is not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because he has representatives on the board.  The Minister is being very suave but is not being as diligent in this matter as he ought to be. If he has representatives on that board, they are there because he is a shareholder in that company.  They are there because their function is to report to him on the state of their operations.  The Minister cannot put himself in a position of benign ignorance in this matter and say, &ldquo;I hear no evil and see no evil, I do not know what is the position in relation to this company and I will not tell the public what is the position in relation to this company until audited accounts are available&rdquo;. What should that be the case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that the Minister's nominees on the board know precisely whether it is any good of a credit institution.  They will have known precisely from 15 January onwards what last year's figures would be.  They are well aware of their general trading position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outstanding feature is the treatment of bad debts and the policy issues in relation thereto.  Bad debts and their treatment in accounts, of course, is a variable thing, an art of sorts.  I accept all that but I want to know &mdash; shorn of all <Col N="869" /> the decisions as to how they should be treated in terms of accounting &mdash; what is the substance of this corporation's financial position at present.  I think that information is available to the Minister and that he is reluctant to reveal to the House what information is available to him.  If it is not available to him, it ought to be because he has members nominated on that board.  If he is not aware of the contending different accounting policies in relation to provision for bad debts, which may or may not show different results depending on how the auditors apply their independent judgment to the matter, he ought to be aware of those things because he has nominees on the board.  I do not accept for one moment that it is good enough for the Minister to come in here and say, &ldquo;this is a routine matter, give me authority to capitalise this company further; I do not know anything until the audited accounts of this corporation are made available; I cannot tell you anything about their present financial state&rdquo;.  The Minister is doing something different.  He is coming to this House seeking additional capital authorisation which means he is effectively seeking to float additional shares in a corporation.  It is this House, as opposed to the general public, which will decide whether such authorisation should be given.  I reiterate that it is wrong to ask any Legislature &mdash; no matter how modest that country's means may be, no matter how humble the Members of that Legislature may feel about themselves &mdash; to authorise additional capitalisation of a company when they do not know how solvent or insolvent that company is, when they do not know in what respects the company's accounts give rise to any legitimate, rational hope that the company will ever be profitable.</P>
    <P>I appeal to other parties in this House to make this point to the Minister at the end of March following the year end for which accounts are being prepared, when the substance of those accounts must be available.  It is not good enough for a Minister to come to this House seeking further capital authorisation at a time when the real picture &mdash; shorn of how it <Col N="870" /> will be dressed up by its auditors &mdash; is clearly available to somebody, to the board members, the people who report to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister does know the real position of this company.  He ought to know.  I would be very surprised if somebody of his calibre was unaware of the real position of this company.  I think he has chosen not to reveal to this House the real position of this company because he is using the non-availability of audited accounts as an excuse for avoiding dealing with its real position.  He owes this House a duty &mdash; when he comes for authority seeking to invest further capital in a company &mdash; not to give 18 month-old information as to how the capital in a company &mdash; not to give 18-mation. Nobody would float shares in any stock market on the basis of what a company might have been doing 18 months ago when all the financial correspondents were saying that, in the meantime, it had hit very choppy waters. Nobody would do that.  If we are ever to bring commercial reality to anything we do with money I do not see why this House should make the same mistake as has been made before, and, doubtless, will be made in relation to other State companies.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that we should not vote any authority to the State to put further capital into this company unless we are satisfied that they need further capitalisation and that there is some strategy, as Deputy Bruton mentioned, as to where this company will be in five years time.  Do we want an agricultural bank? I suggest we should not have a bank solely designed to deal with agriculture.  Do we want them to be wholly owned by the State?  I suggest we do not.  Do we want to be in the position in five years time of having another Minister standing up with a begging bowl of capitalisation in front of him demanding that we give him authority to prop up this institution by putting taxpayers' money into it yet again?</P>
    <P>If they are facing into losses &mdash; and it seems from the Minister's statement he is at least now conceding the ACC are heading into significant losses, whatever <Col N="871" /> they are, &mdash; and if all of their authorised capital has been paid up, it is clear that this £15 million will be used effectively to pay funds into a loss-making company in order keep them solvent or going.  I want to know if it is worthwhile keeping them going.  I have heard no argument that has been addressed to that proposition by the people who have the responsibility of convincing this House that it is worthwhile keeping them going.  Is it worthwhile keeping going a company without any long-term strategic view as to where they are going and, say, in the context of the Single European Act, as to whether they have any future?</P>
    <P>I did not contribute on the last section because I did not think it was worth while going into what the ACC do with their money but I want to remark that it is naïve to believe that a company who cannot make a fist of one thing and have no expertise in another area are going to rescue themselves by diversifying into areas where they have no proven track record.  That is naïve.  I do not see here any strategy for recovery of the ACC and, therefore, we should not, in the present circumstances, give them any further moneys.</P>
    <P>I am not talking at present about the extent of the guarantees because that is a separate issue and it will come up in the next section but I do say that no argument has been made for the further capitalisation of this company.  I mean this seriously, when I say the Minister is failing in his duty to this House to tell us now in clear and unequivocal terms the real position of this company.  It is wrong that I am being told to wait for the audited accounts.  That is wrong.  It should not affect the Minister's attitude to the issue and it should not affect my attitude if the Minister has to come to me and other Members of this House for co-operation on this issue.</P>
    <P>I want to know what the position of this company is now and what their trading position is now, not 18 months ago when they were deteriorating but now before I decide how to exercise my vote on this issue.  I am indicating to the Minister that <Col N="872" /> unless he indicates in fairly substantial terms the financial position of the ACC we will oppose this section and the next section so as to get across the proposition that there should not be capitalisation of companies whose records give rise to considerable cause for doubt.  A blank cheque should not be signed and given to the Minister in these circumstances.  He has an equivalent and corresponding duty to give us up-to-date information but he is not doing so.  This business of talking about the audited accounts is a smokescreen to save that company from the embarrassment of their present position.</P>
    <P>The Minister could very easily say that at the end of 1987 their position was this, that if you take one view of the bad debt provision their losses could be so many million pounds and if you take a more stringent view the losses could be so many more million pounds.  He could tell us that is the nature of the company he is asking the House to put further capital into, that that is how he sees that company recovering.  We have had none of that: in fact, we have had the precise opposite.  We have had obfuscation, with the greatest of respect.  This is not a routine matter in terms of the timing of the measure.  I suggest that the Minister must come clean on this issue and now tell us everything he knows about the up-to-date financial position of this company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a slight difference of emphasis from Deputy McDowell in the sense that I do not think it is possible for the Minister or the Agricultural Credit corporation to conduct long-term business strategy in this House.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation need to diversify their lending and deposit-taking operations and get into conjunction with another financial institution, preferably from outside the State, with a view to using the expertise of that financial institution plus the contacts of the Agricultural Credit Corporation throughout the country, to develop a banking business that is more soundly and broadly based than the existing one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Agricultural Credit Corporation <Col N="873" /> were, for instance, in discussion with another bank, I can appreciate that the Minister would not wish in a debate such as this, to disclose that fact here.  I would like to know &mdash; and this is where Deputy McDowell is absolutely right &mdash; if there is any long-term strategy at all for the Agricultural Credit Corporation other than a bandage approach, of applying £15 million worth of a bandage today and maybe coming back in two years time to do the same and two years after that to do the same again.  I do not necessarily believe if a patient is in poor health that the only cure is to shoot him or ask him to drink four gallons of ice cold water. Sometimes that could have precisely the opposite effect to the one desired.  If I have a reservation about Deputy McDowell's approach it is that it is somewhat along those lines in the sense that if we deny them this bandage of £15 million the consequences of that could be simply to create a bigger problem for the Exchequer &mdash; which is my concern and I am sure Deputy McDowell's as well &mdash; than might occur if the corporation were encouraged to trade their way out of their difficulties.  The corporation are not going to trade their way out of their difficulties if no strategy is devised for getting them into a position where they are sufficiently diversified and have the international associations and expertise to do so.  I should like to hear from the Minister the plans, if any, the corporation have in this regard.  What are the Minister's plans in this regard?  I acknowledge that in the first instance it is for the corporation, and not for the Minister to come up with proposals of this kind.  It is not a matter for the Minister for Finance, who has plenty of other responsibilities to fulfil, to devise corporate strategies for the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It is not for him to tell them whom they should associate with in order to diversify, to become stronger in their expertise and become a more balanced banking business. It is clearly a matter for the corporation to do so and I should like to know what the corporation and board are doing in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is suspicious that this legislation is <Col N="874" /> going through the House almost exactly 12 months after the end of a year in respect of which the accounts have not been presented.  Why not wait for another month until those accounts are ready and present the legislation then?  If that was done the Minister would not have to answer any of the awkward questions Deputy McDowell and Deputy Enright posed.  Conversely, why not say to the Agricultural Credit Corporation &ldquo;I have got this legislation coming up and I must have the accounts.  Please let me have them before I go into the House&rdquo;.  Why did that not happen?  Why is this legislation being put through before the accounts have been presented?  Is there any reason the accounts are 12 months late?</P>
    <P>I have to say that accounts being late is nothing unique in the public sector. In companies with no difficulties I have known accounts to be four or five years late.  For instance, I remember a health board did not present their accounts until five years had expired after the date they were to be presented.  Practice has improved since then, but accounts being a year late is not exceptional.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Agricultural Credit Corporation it was to be anticipated that questions of the kind posed by Deputy McDowell would be posed.  Why then present the Bill before the accounts? Why not insist on having the accounts before the Bill is introduced?  Why ask us to buy a pig in a poke?  I do not go all the way with Deputy McDowell's refusal of the amount sought, but the House must press the Minister for a great deal more information than he has given.  It was not impossible for him to answer the question in broad terms as to the extent of the gap between the bad debt provision and the profits of the corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate repeating myself but obviously Deputies were not listening to me earlier when I talked about it being normal practice, not routine, when a Bill is going through the House, to take the opportunity, when a particular ceiling has been reached to <Col N="875" /> have a matter of this kind included.  What may or may not be done with the new authorised share capital or authorised limit remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>In so far as the accounts are concerned, I have said very clearly all that I can, and that is, that it is only when the audited accounts become available at the end of April that the results for 1987 will be known.  The outcome depends on the bad debt provision and I said I did not think profits would be sufficient to cater for them and that there might be the possibility that the ACC could experience a loss in 1987.  What more can one say?</P>
      <P>As regards the point made by Deputy Bruton that the accounts are late by 12 months, that is nonsense.  We are talking about the 1987 accounts.</P>

      <P>Deputy Enright asked about savings made in relation to administration.  A voluntary redundancy programme reduced staff numbers from a peak of 715 in 1980 to 479 at the beginning of 1986. The Agricultural Credit Corporation then embarked on a compulsory redundancy and overhead reduction programme in 1986 designed to secure savings of £1.2 million a year.  In the event, annual savings of £1 million were achieved through a reduction of staff to 407 without resorting to compulsory redundancies and through the closure of five branch offices and a reorganisation of the management structure, including a reduction in the number of regions from five to three.  This was completed last year.  It was basically through those efforts over the last two years that those results have been achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted what the Minister said about staff reductions, the closure of branch offices and efforts to economise by the Agricultural Credit Corporation. This corporation is a single sector lending organisation.  They have suffered considerable loss &mdash; let there be no doubt about that, and nobody in this House could deny it &mdash; because their business activities were confined to one area.  It has not been fully appreciated, except by people closely associated with the farming community, that many farmers have suffered losses, and they are not out of <Col N="877" /> the woods yet.  This has to be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>I have seen many warrants from the sheriff being forwarded to farmers in my constituency asking them for income tax. The farmers find this very alarming because in many cases they are unable to meet their commitments to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the commercial banks as well as meeting their ordinary living expenses and also meeting these tax demands.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that the major problem of the ACC is that they have been involved in one area only.  We all recognise that there must be a competent staff to run any organisation, but the ACC have reduced staff numbers and cut overheads.  Deputy Bruton referred to extending their area of activity.  I do not know if the Minister will accept this proposal to allow them to diversify, but the ACC were unable to compete with other institutions because their activities were confined to one area.  While it is only right that an agricultural bank must place major emphasis on farming, they must be allowed to diversify.  In those circumstances the Minister should consider granting an extension of the 20 per cent to farmers who wish to diversify.  Such a move would be in the long-term interests of the ACC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I resent the Minister's tone and approach to my remarks.  I made it quite clear that people who invest money have a State guarantee and that their position is utterly irrelevant because of that.  I made that clear for the benefit of the Minister and I should like to repeat that I was referring to our position as shareholders of the company.  I do not know whether the Minister listened to me but I thought I made that quite clear. I resent the Minister's suggestion and the implication in his remarks that I cannot query whether it is wise to put more money into the company which is going through a bad patch because to do so would in someway shake confidence in a State run credit institution.  That is nonsense, and highly defensive nonsense which surprises me.  It was wrong of the <Col N="878" /> Minister to put himself in the position of attempting to lay his body across that of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
      <P>I am perfectly entitled to query the wisdom of any investment.  I am entitled to query the financial state of any credit institution of the State.  I did not say anything which would suggest that this institution should in any sense be regarded as unsafe or a bad repository for savings.  I did not say that and it was wrong of the Minister to suggest that I did.  In fact, I said the reverse, that as far as depositors are concerned the ACC is a safe bet but from our point of view, as shareholders, it was manifestly not a safe bet.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that it was normal practice under the Companies Act to produce audited accounts and that is true but he went on to try to suggest in a flim flam of nonsense that precludes us, or anybody else, from finding out how a company is doing on an interim basis. That is rubbish.  Every publicly quoted company in stock exchanges around the world produce interim results.  For some reason three months after the year end at this institution we are not being told what the Minister knows.</P>
      <P>The Minister claims not to know the accounting position but that was a specious remark by him.  He may not know the exact position but he must have a very clear picture of what it is even to make the concessions he has made to us so far.  He must know that there is likely to be a loss.  Even to make the further concession that the extent of the loss is likely to be such as to eat up entirely whatever surplus there is in other areas, he must know the ball park figures for the company.  He must know what the contending versions of provision for bad debts can or could be.  The Minister must be in a position to tell the House what the worst and the best possible position in terms of provision for bad debts in the company is, depending on auditing policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject as wrong, incorrect and unfounded the suggestion that we must wait for the auditors to decide the issue. Auditors do not decide such issues; they <Col N="879" /> do not decide what the bad debts of a company are.  Auditors decide, to some extent, what a fair account of the bad debts are from the point of view of determining profit and losses for the shareholders of the company and the public at large.  All the figures, if they are available to the auditors to permit them to deal with the accounts, are available to the Minister.  I resent the Minister trying to bully me on this issue and suggesting that in some sense by querying the wisdom of the investment, because we know that there is something wrong but we do not know how wrong it is, I am knocking confidence in the institution.  That is incorrect.  I am not doing that but I am demanding that the Minister come clean and give to us on an open basis the position of the company before he asks for our authority to give the company further capital.</P>
    <P>In my view the Minister has more information than he has made available to the House and of that there can be no doubt. He is withholding such information because he feels justified in doing so.  The Minister is giving as a justification the fact that the audited accounts are not yet ready.  In my view that is not sufficient justification.</P>
    <P>I will not be bully-bounced or scared off from making remarks about this company or about the wisdom of investing further capital in it by virtue of the fact that it is a credit institution within the ownership of the State.  It may be that we should not have any such investments in an agricultural credit corporation but that is a different issue and one which should not be dealt with on Committee Stage. However, I am entitled to call on the Minister, before he asks us to give him authority to invest another £15 million in a corporation, to tell us what the up-to-date financial position of that body is.  It is wrong and without any justification for a Minister to say to the House that he cannot do that until he gets the audited accounts.</P>
    <P>It is not correct for a Minister to suggest that the views of an auditor on whether or not sufficient provision has <Col N="880" /> been made for bad debts are the only views we are entitled to hear about.  The Minister is entitled to form views as are his members of the board.  We are entitled to best case and worst case scenario figures; we are entitled to know the accounting policies, to be allowed evaluate whether they are justifiable and whether the accounting policies are generous or not to the company.  We are entitled to know whether they are liberal or conservative accounting policies but, above all, it is untrue to indicate by suggestion to the House that the Minister does not know the financial status of the company within global ballpark terms. He is aware of that status but is not telling us and at the same time he is asking us to give him authority to spend £15 million more, if needed, by way of capital to the company.  That, as far as I am concerned, is not a responsible thing to do.  Far from me being irresponsible it is the Minister who is being irresponsible with taxpayers' money.  He is asking the House to be irresponsible by giving him authority to recapitalise the company to a significant extent without getting the facts or being made aware of the state of the company.</P>
    <P>I completely reject the Minister's attempt to coerce me into remaining silent on this issue.  I reject his suggestion that we must wait for the audited accounts before we can be told anything about the financial state of the company. I reject the suggestion that the Minister should keep his cards close to his chest and not tell us as much as he knows about the position of the company when asking us for further capitalisation.  If he finds that embarrassing or thinks that in some sense it will undermine confidence in this institution all he has to do is postpone consideration of the Bill.  It is the Minister who is pushing the Bill through.  Many measures could be dealt with instead of this Bill.  We are being asked to deal with this matter on the blind without seeing the audited accounts.  We are told that they should be available soon and I would like the Minister to agree either not to seek further capitalisation at this stage or tell the House what he knows about the financial position of the ACC.</P>

      <P>We are not prepared to go along with the idea of not giving an increase in the share capital, for a reason which I think is sensible.  We believe that the company have certain difficulties but they must be encouraged to trade their way out of those difficulties.  The Minister has indicated that they have reached their existing equity limit and that they need an injection to provide a base for their share capital but to be based on lending. If we were to deny that to them we would, essentially, by that act, fold up the corporation. I do not think that would be financially prudent from the point of view of the State or the Exchequer.  The aim must be that such difficulties as the corporation have should be traded out of.  I hope the Minister will give some indication of an intention to ensure that the corporation make arrangements to engage themselves in consultations with others in the banking sector to develop their expertise and extend their capital base in order to get into the position of not needing any more share capital from the State.  Any further share capital which is needed for the natural extension of this corporation should be obtained by other means.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister can give an indication to the House before we pass from this section that he will be asking the board of the corporation to present him with a strategic plan for the corporation which would see them using the facilities under this legislation to extend their range of business into a more balanced shape and also to act in conjunction with other banking institutions.  Thus they will get the expertise they lack at the moment to engage in non-agricultural lending and thereby trade out of any difficulties they now have.</P>

      <P>A plan is in preparation at present for this year and for the next five years.  I should like to confirm again &mdash; and most exprienced personnel here will know &mdash; that before any increase in share capital is given by the Minister for Finance to any company it must be fully justified by that company and in the context, as Deputy Bruton said <Col N="882" /> rightly, of a corporate plan, a programme for a year or five years.  That is being prepared at the moment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton's remarks make common sense.  I had hoped the House would not divide on this issue. That would not be of any benefit.  The ACC have been making considerable efforts even in regard to staff reductions, reductions of branch offices and so forth. Agriculture has gone through a difficult period.  The Minister's tax amnesty has been very warmly welcomed and I consider it a good measure.  Again, there is a problem, as the Minister is probably aware.  To avail of the tax amnesty with regard to repayments &mdash; and this does not apply just to the farming community but across the board &mdash; a considerable number of people who are in debt and are availing of this tax amnesty for one reason or another are withholding repayments to banks, corporations and so on. The ACC form part of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made a number of suggestions to the Minister.  I shall go along with Deputy Bruton's point that the corporation should produce a plan.  I would urge also that the Minister agree to some of my suggestions, first to increase the ratio above 20 per cent in different spheres of business activity; secondly, to encourage other semi-State bodies to transact business with the ACC in regard to borrowing, lending and different types of business activities; thirdly, to allow the ACC to take in investments at least on the same level as other bodies such as An Post.  That is an area into which they <Col N="883" /> should be allowed to extend.  To prevent the ACC from extending their share capital would cause major problems for everybody.  It would not be in the interests of the ACC, the farming community, or the country.  It would not be <Col N="884" /> in anybody's interest just now.  It is essential, as Deputy Bruton very concisely put it, to allow the ACC to trade out of their existing difficulties.  That is putting it in a nutshell.</P>

      <P>I argued earlier on Committee Stage that the Agricultural Credit Corporation suffers from the fact it is unduly confined to lending to the agricultural sector and that some of its financial problems have arisen from the fact that it is tied to a sector which is prone and which will always be prone to cyclical problems in terms of profitability. Therefore, it makes sense that if the corporation is to develop it should be allowed to move into other areas.  I propose in my amendment, which is amendment No. 2, that there should be no limit <Col N="886" /> on the proportion of the corporation's business which the Minister could determine could be non-agricultural.  That is a sensible arrangement.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Minister at this time is not disposed to accepting that approach but I am glad that in response to arguments which were made by me and other speakers &mdash; presumably elsewhere also &mdash; he is prepared to raise the proportion of the corporation's business which can be non-agricultural.  I believe that by raising the proportion from 20 to 25 per cent the Agricultural Credit Corporation will now be able to engage in somewhere in the region of another £25 million worth of non-agricultural business on top of the amount it is currently allowed to engage in.  That is welcome and it means we are postponing the day when we will have to come back into the House to have this limit raised.  I hope the corporation will use this facility constructively.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important that the corporation do the following things.  First, it should have a corporate plan which sets out where it is going over the next five or six years and, secondly, it should seek to get involved with other corporations in the banking area to whom it can sell some of its shares or with whom it can enter joint ventures so that it could expand its operations both here and internationally. That is the way to get out of its current difficulties.  Ultimately, I would like to see a situation created as a result of a profit oriented performance by the Agricultural Credit Corporation wherein its shares could be made available for sale to the public.  It should be the objective to reach the point where it would become a truly publicly owned company, not publicly owned in the sense of its being owned by the State but rather by the public.  That can be achieved if we follow a strategic development plan for the corporation which would use this new freedom to go into non-agricultural lending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Adjournment of this debate I was dealing with cross-Border trade and how it affected people in Cavan-Monaghan and I had referred to the annoyance of the people in that <Col N="888" /> constituency at the imposition of an 8p per gallon increase in the price of petrol, when it was indicated that a change of Government would bring about a change of attitude in dealing with this problem. There was every indication that an incoming Fianna Fáil Government had an ace up their sleeve, but unfortunately it turned out to be a joker because it was the 48-hour ban that was imposed. Certainly it had a benefit for the coaches from Dublin, Cork, Galway and further afield but it did not benefit the Border areas.  There is grave disappointment in the Border areas as it was expected that so much would be done.</P>
      <P>In relation to electrical goods, the difference in price of televisions and video equipment as between north and south of the Border means that one cannot blame people for crossing the Border to shop.  It is understandable but regrettable. The VAT and excise duty on an ordinary 22 inch colour television in the South is equal to the original price of the television north of the Border.  We just cannot say we understand the problem and do nothing about it.  We must deal with the problem.  A lowering of VAT and excise duties by broadening the base of VAT collection would be of major benefit although it may not be welcomed by everybody.  It would be a way of sharing the burden rather than placing it on the immediate Border counties.  That would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carrickmacross Chamber of Commerce promoted a scheme where on the purchase of petrol in excess of £10 they awarded a voucher to be used in any business in the Carrickmacross area and this scheme was an outstanding success. A voucher scheme can be operated in the Border county areas.  I put a question to the Minister for the Environment asking him if he would consider reducing or abolishing rates on business premises in the Border counties and he replied that this was a matter for the local authorities. That is not good enough and I do not accept it.  The Minister knows full well that local authorities cannot afford to remove rates from commercial businesses because they are already starved <Col N="889" /> of cash and if they removed rates on commercial businesses it would mean that they would be defunct as regards operating because they would have no income.  For the first time in the history of this State businesses which were doing well over the years are now seeking to pay their rates by instalment.  At one stage they would have written a cheque for the rate collector and paid the rates immediately.  This is an indication of how hard people are finding it to get by.  The small family businesses, the backbone of the community in that area, whom I want to support and see thriving, are being gradually closed down.  When one travels through the towns and villages of the Border region it can be noted how dilapidated they have become because people cannot now afford to paint their houses and keep them to the standard they would like.</P>
    <P>I also requested the Government and the Minister for the Environment to include every town and village in the Border region in the environmental programme that is available to cities and large towns as a gesture from the Government to the people of that area and as an intimation that they appreciate the difficulties and that help is available.  I am making that plea again.  It is not good enough to say we understand the problem, that we are looking at it and that it will sort itself out by 1992, because by then many of those businesses will be gone.  We expect and demand a little more than that.  We have a problem that must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>A major industry in the Border region is tourism and tourism relates mainly to fishing.  Many householders in the area who have gone into the business of keeping tourists to supplement their incomes from small farms and so on have advertised in England and on the Continent what we have to offer.  Their initiative must be supported.  The main attraction of their advertisements was that free fishing was widely available for trout, perch and eels.  I compliment the Government for last year implementing a scheme for a £10 fuel voucher to attract tourists to this country but this year that scheme has <Col N="890" /> been counteracted by a £10 rod licence. There is no continuation of policy in an about-turn like that.  Last year tourists were offered a £10 voucher towards petrol costs and this year they are asked to pay for a licence to fish.  This licence is a major mistake by the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take note of what the people involved in the business have said.  They organised themselves into groups and met recently in Cootehill and Deputy Leonard was the only Fianna Fáil Deputy who had the courage to attend.  He came and listened to what the people had to say at an excellent and constructive meeting at which they pleaded that the Minister should drop this charge as they had already advertised on the basis that free fishing was available. They said they were not advised that a licence charge was going to be imposed.  That was a major mistake and it should be remedied.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Tourism and Transport even at this late stage to drop the charges for this year and meet the people concerned with the promotion of tourism in that region.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, and the promotion of agriculture, it is a sad fact that herd numbers are dropping rapidly despite all the talk from the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister of State and the massive grants for updating the factories.  In the 12 western counties the Minister should drop the off-farm income provision.  One cannot live on a small farm in the 12 western counties, or in the counties of Cavan and Monaghan, if one has not got an off-farm income.</P>
    <P>I looked through the projections for expenditure on the various EC schemes this year and the average herd size in that is nine cows.  It is not possible to live on a small farm supporting nine cows and raise a family without on off-farm income.  We should recognise and appreciate that those people are prepared to work their farms in the morning before going to a job and to work at them when they come home in the evening.  Are they <Col N="891" /> not the sort of people we want rather than people who are on the dole and who are not anxious to work?  I do not want to castigate people on the dole because many of them are in that position through no fault of their own, but there are people who will live off the dole and who do not wish to work.  The person who is prepared to go out and work should be given every encouragement.  Off farm income should not be an inhibition to headage payments. Any surplus funds those people have will be reinjected into developing the farms and building up the herds.</P>
    <P>With regard to the western package there is no point in trying to fool the people that more money is available this year.  That is not so.  We must be factual and straight about what we are promoting here.  Less money is available for a wider area but it will be more easily obtained when the red tape is done away with.</P>
    <P>I have spoken here on the amalgamation of ACOT and AFT.  The agricultural instructors are badly disheartened at present.  All small farmers should have free agricultural advice. Those are the people we are trying to promote.  The large farmer will be well able to pay for this advice.  How are we going to initiate two groups of farmers, the farmer who can afford it and the farmer who cannot?  I want to promote the small farmer, the man with the potential. His cattle numbers may be small and he could have quite a large acreage so the scope is there for development.  The large farmer will be quite aware of what is available to him and, yes, I certainly could not crib about a charge there.  For a farmer with under 30 or 40 acres free advice should be made available to help him develop his holding.</P>
    <P>The delay of seven months in payment of grants is not acceptable to farmers doing land drainage and building.  Either they have to borrow the money or have an undertaking with their contractor that he will do the job and as soon as the farmer gets the grant the contractor will be paid.  A delay of seven months is not acceptable in any business.  You will not get a month's credit now.  That is the way <Col N="892" /> business has gone.  Credit must be paid for; if you get credit you must pay interest on it.  There is no such thing any more in a well run business as free credit, yet the State is telling the farmers that if they do the job the State will pay the grant in six or seven months.  Many farmers are in an embarrassing position.  They have gone to the banks and the ACC seeking loans and have made commitments to repay as soon as the job was finished.  That may take four, five or six months.  When the work is complete application is made and now there is a seven months' delay.  I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to make those payments as soon as the work has been passed by the people who have gone out to inspect it.  I am delighted to see the Minister of State has come in. I am sure he is well aware in his own constituency that the delay of six to seven months on payment of grants is not acceptable.  It places a serious burden on many farmers and causes them serious embarrassment through no fault of their own.  They have the courage to say to their bank manager or the manger of the ACC, &ldquo;I want £3,000, £4,000, £5,000 to improve my farm.  I will get a grant for it.&rdquo;  Then they ask the contractor to do the job for them and promise him the final payment after they get the grant. Probably they have some money of their own.  It is not good enough that they have to carry this debt.  The contractors too are being put into difficulty when, having undertaken to do this work they have supplied gravel and materials and then people behind them are pushing for payment on the expectation of a grant.  It is a chain reaction.</P>
    <P>In the area I come from pollution is a major problem, and the grant mooted in the western package of 45 per cent is not sufficient to meet it.  I make no apology for being parochial.  I was sent here to represent people with a problem.  We have a county of hills and valleys and 365 lakes.  If you spread fertilizer and slurry and then get a wet day, run-off results. That is not so in the flat lands of Kildare or Tipperary.  It is a problem peculiar to Cavan and Monaghan.  We have a great deal to offer there in the line of tourism <Col N="893" /> and it can be spoilt by pollution.  I ask the Minister for Agriculture to recognise that and the Minister for Tourism and Transport to give special grants in that area since we have something to offer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Swift</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Boylan on his remarks but I would like to pass one or two comments on them.  I appreciate the problems of the Border counties but it should be placed on the record of this House that no Government have ever attempted to do as much in a short time for the Border counties as have this Government.  Even Deputy Boylan would acknowledge that.  That is not to say they will not have continuing problems, but this Government have made serious efforts to help those in the Border region, particularly the business people.</P>
      <P>In relation to petrol, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, in the last year has more or less forced the oil companies to reduce the price of petrol on several occasions.  That was not done previously to my recollection and the Government and Deputy Reynolds deserve great praise for it.</P>
      <P>I gave a general welcome to the provisions of the budget of the Minister for Finance.  It might be helpful if we recall, as a background to the budget, that it is a follow up to a budget of 12 months ago introduced almost immediately after the present Government came into office in very difficult circumstances.  In the previous four and a half years we had a Government of two parties and in that time we got the worst of all possible worlds.  Emigration, once again became a major factor, unemployment went through the roof and the national debt doubled from approximately £12 million to £24 million, so it is fair to say almost nothing positive was achieved from the economic point of view in the four and a half years of Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against that background the present Government came into office and immediately, with great courage and determination and at no little political cost to themselves, decided they were going to tackle the economic problems <Col N="894" /> that bedevilled this country and to make a serious effort to eradicate those problems within the lifetime of the present Government. As we all know, the Government are in a minority and it behoves us all, particularly the general public, to remember when the Government are being criticised or when Government backbenchers are asked which way they will vote or whether they will vote against this or that cut, that this Government can be voted out of office if the Opposition parties have the political courage to do so.  I believe they do not have that political courage or will.  That is amply demonstrated in the fact that the Government have lasted for 12 months in a very difficult situation and are bringing in very difficult measures.</P>
    <P>This is the first time in the last decade that a Government have done the right thing, not for themselves but for the country.  The efforts to reduce the national debt have been monumental, given the timescale involved.  In 1988 this Government will borrow £1,457 million. That is an enormous sum of money, by any standards.  There is nobody here who would not like to see us in a situation where we did not have to borrow money. But this amount is still almost £700 million less than was borrowed in 1986 which is less than 18 months ago.  The Government must be complimented on their efforts, particularly the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In Waterford, which is a very beautiful coastal county, tourism is a live issue. There is no Government Department that some Deputy would not like to see getting more resources, but I know and understand that the budgets for the various Departments have already been voted on and there is no extra money there.  I applaud the fact that there will be no extra money and no further borrowing, but I would like to see a shift of emphasis in the whole area of tourism. On one occasion at a joint meeting of Waterford city and county councils with members from the south-eastern tourist board I asked, in all innocence, the reason for the very prompt manner in which tourists who landed in Rosslare <Col N="895" /> Harbour were transported to counties like Kerry, West Cork, Galway and so on.  I was told at that time, and that is a number of years ago, that it was Bord Fáilte official policy at head office.  I do not know if that is accurate, but it is the answer which was given and the evidence is there to support the truth of it.  If that is so it is regrettable, particularly from the point of view of the counties of the south-east and my own county of Waterford where there is tremendous scope for the development of tourism.  I would like to see the Minister for Tourism and Transport concentrating more on the development of that region.  I understand the task force is bringing in its report quickly and this is indicative of the speed and efficiency with which this Government are working.  I would like to see special emphasis put on the south-eastern and eastern parts of the country with a view to developing our tourism potential. Whatever about the western counties, there is no doubt that we are vastly underdeveloped in counties like Waterford as far as tourism is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have a small airport in Waterford operating through Ryanair which is functioning very profitably.  In fact it was Ryanair's pioneer programme here.  I would like to see that airport developed. It will need funds to do so and, subject to what I said myself about the lack of additional resources, there are certain areas where capital investment can be made resulting in a good return on the initial investment.  I would like to see some Government funds directed towards Waterford Airport so that not just Waterford but the whole south-east can be developed.</P>
    <P>With the cutbacks one would have expected the Minister for Social Welfare to provide no increases in social welfare payments.  Therefore it was a tremendous achievement that the Minister was able to increase social welfare benefits payable this year by a staggering £110 million. It demonstrates the Government's commitment to the less well off in our community.  The increases of approximately 3 per cent more than kept pace <Col N="896" /> with the rate of inflation.  That was a tremendous achievement in this year, but the increase in benefits for the long term unemployed of 11 per cent is a really magnificent achievement in a year in which nearly all Government Departments have taken a substantial cut.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, and the entire Cabinet have to be congratulated for securing the dignity and the standard of living of the less well off in our community.  We realise that such benefits do not allow anyone to live in luxury, but in difficult times they can at least keep pace with inflation and in some cases go well ahead of the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>There is no industry more labour-intensive or more important in many constituencies than the building industry, and there were two important measures in this year's budget that will be a support to the the building industry.  First there is the slight move in one of the bands in relation to the rates payable for stamp duty on secondhand houses.  I compliment the Minister on his efforts in that regard.  It is the first time in many years that there has been a move in that direction. Speaking as a person who has had a great deal of experience in dealing with young couples purchasing their first homes and mortgaging them and so on, I think it is time we had a look at the whole question of the rates of stamp duty on secondhand houses, particularly in the case of newly married couples buying their home for the first time.  It is quite some time since the bands were increased to make it easier on couples buying homes.  A rate of 3 per cent on £20,000 in an age when it is unusual to buy a house for less then £25,000 is simply too much.  It is time the Minister for Finance had a look at the question of making a special provision in regard to the rates of stamp duty for young couples starting out.</P>
    <P>The reintroduction of the section 23 incentive is very welcome from the point of view of investment in the building industry.  It will be particularly beneficial in the bigger city areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, but I <Col N="897" /> suspect that the bulk of the benefit will be felt mainly in the Dublin area.  For that reason, and speaking on behalf of the building industry, a very labour-intensive industry, an industry with great potential, the Minister for Finance might consider for next year's budget a reduction in the rate of VAT from 10 to 5 per cent.  In my area most builders would have preferred that to have happened than to have the restoration of the section 23 incentive. While that incentive is welcome a reduction in the VAT rate as I have suggested would have been of more practical benefit.  Such a reduction alone, apart from helping builders and their companies, would have the potential to create employment in an industry which, it is fair to say, in the last five or six years has seen a substantial reduction in the number of people employed in it.  That is a matter which might be borne in mind in the future.  We realise that the Minister has a very difficult task but he might consider that matter in next year's budget or, please God, that of the year after if we are still here.</P>
    <P>One of the most heartening things that has happened in the last 12 months has been the reduction in the level of mortgage interest payable by the average family.  We are used to seeing headlines about health cuts and so on but we very rarely see a great deal in the media about the help that this Government, through their policies, have given to married people in particular in regard to paying their mortgages.  In some years there was a steady increase in the rate of mortgage interest payable to banks, building societies and even local authorities.  It was very heartening to see that trend reversed during the last year and to find the rate reduced, not just once by way of something like 0.5 per cent but on at least three occasions.  The indications are that that downward trend will continue.  That kind of progress is something that we had all been asking for in the previous years but without success.  The Government, through their policies, are now seeing the fruits of their labours.  The beneficiaries <Col N="898" /> of that reduction are the mortgage holders and that is something we welcome greatly.</P>
    <P>Another very welcome trend in this budget &mdash; I hope and believe it is a trend and not a once-off measure &mdash; is the reduction in the collection targets in income tax.  This Government have agreed to take £225 million less in tax over the next three years.  The Government who committed themselves to having two-thirds of the PAYE taxpayers on the standard rate of tax within a period of three years have practically succeeded in doing so in 12 months.  I think the figure is 63 per cent which is as near two-thirds as makes no difference.  That, by any yardstick, is a great achievement.  It is a tremendous achievement given the economic difficulties that I have already talked about.</P>
    <P>In my area and in several other areas of the country, Deputies and the public generally have been giving an unqualified welcome to the restoration of the Government programme on decentralisation. I would like to place it on the record that the previous Fianna Fáil Government had committed themselves to a programme of decentralisation &mdash; this included Waterford &mdash; but that when the last Coalition Government came into office they reversed that decision and, in Waterford's case, almost brought about a situation in which the site which had been acquired for decentralisation had to be sold off.  Through the efforts of local politicians and the city management we were able to retain that site and we were, therefore, in a position to be re-included in this Government's programme of decentralisation which was reactivated immediately they returned to office.</P>
    <P>This programme of decentralisation has tremendous potential for the locations which have been selected.  We hope to have several hundred people relocated in Waterford from certain Government Departments.  I do not suppose that I need tell the House what that will mean to the local economy in Waterford in terms of additional spending power, in terms of the business of shops and stores and in relation to the <Col N="899" /> house property market with the extra business that means for financial institutions and so on.  There is tremendous scope for Waterford and the other centres for development and for capitalising on this programme of decentralisation.  I welcome it.  I know that in some areas people have already started work on the programme.  I anticipate that in Waterford we will be starting the ball rolling by June of this year and we are all delighted with that.  We would like to see it happen quicker but we realise the difficulties involved.  We welcome the general trend and we hope to see that programme well under way in Waterford by the end of 1988.</P>
    <P>In relation to the drink industry, we were all invited to a meeting with representatives of the Vintners Federation of Ireland earlier today.  They made a number of points, one of which is relevant to this debate and which seems reasonable, that is, that the 25 per cent rate of VAT on the drink industry be reduced to 10 per cent, to be compensated for by a 15 per cent increase in the excise duty.  I do not think that would result in any substantial loss of revenue to the State. It is what the industry wants and it would cure many of their ills.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that request from the vintners.</P>
    <P>In general we welcome this budget.  It is an excellent follow-on to last year's budget.  It was introduced in very difficult circumstances.  I think by the time it passes through this House as a Finance Act it will be seen by the country at large as having had a large measure of support on both sides of this House.  It is a budget which gives practical expression to the need for patriotism in this country in exceptionally difficult times.  I see this budget as an exercise in practical patriotism, as a budget brought in, by a Government who are in a minority position, with great courage and determination and with the potential, if it is followed through, and if we have co-operation from all sectors of the community, to solve the problems of this nation, problems which are so great.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> It is significant that the signatories to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> ranged over a broad spectrum of opinion in our society, the farming and business communities, the trade union movement and the Government themselves.  It is heartening to see that people recognise there are major problems confronting the country.  While retaining their independence and right to criticise &mdash; in some cases voting the other way &mdash; in broad measure they are willing to support the Government in sorting out the national finances.</P>
    <P>Some people ask, for instance, in relation to the education cuts, what about the children?  I contend that children must receive something from us but if our national finances are not placed on a sound financial footing there will be nothing for us to hand on to our children. The primary duty of any legislator, if not the primary reason for anybody becoming involved in politics in the first place, is the creation of a better society.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Government in this budget are attempting to put the national finances in order following the course they adopted in 1987.  They are deserving of great praise and this budget warrants the support of all Members of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I have detected in the course of this debate a more constructive approach by all Members.  Heretofore the debate on the budget tended to be predictable, depending on which side of the House one sat.  On this occasion I have heard criticism of the budget from the Government side and some elements being accepted on this side of the House, particularly by members of my party.  I am delighted to note that kind of approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage it is difficult to say anything that has not been said already a number of times.  I want to take issue with one point made by Deputy Swift, that is in relation to the building industry. I accept that from the point of view of employment, job creation and the economy as a whole the building industry is of vital importance.  Rather than compliment the Minister and Cabinet on their <Col N="901" /> contribution to the building industry I would contend that this Cabinet have been responsible for the decimation of the building industry.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that over the past four and a half years the attractive housing grants available were a considerable boost to that industry.  It can be said that the construction industry, as we knew it, has moved to London, southern England and other places abroad.  I would contend that nobody could be sincere in complimenting the Minister and the Government on their contribution to that industry.  Over the past four years I can remember the present Minister for Energy and for Communications, Deputy Ray Bourke &mdash; then Fianna Fáil spokesman on the environment &mdash; express concern on many occasions at the state of the building industry, contending that if and when Fianna Fáil were returned to office there would be an immediate injection into that industry of approximately £300 million &mdash; sometimes the figure quoted was £500 million, there being a variation in the figure depending on who said it and where &mdash; because of that industry's employment content.  Let us not fool ourselves.  The building industry has ground to a halt.  Everybody in this House is aware of it and anybody who is not is living in cloud-cuckoo land.</P>
    <P>I hope to refer to other matters in the course of the debate on the Finance Bill. Whether one is in Government or Opposition, one is now aware that it is absolutely essential to come to grips with the national finances, that fiscal rectitude is a must.  There may be some differences of opinion as to the course to be adopted but the general principle is universally accepted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Swift referred to the record of the Coalition Government in regard to the national finances.  I would remind Members on that side of the House that when the Coalition Government attempted to come to grips with this very serious national problem there was not then much co-operation forthcoming from them.  However, the fact that the Government party are late converts to <Col N="902" /> the idea of fiscal rectitude is to be welcomed. Everybody is now aware that unless we do come to grips with this problem we shall reach a stage where our national finances will be beyond redemption. However, we have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>I would describe this latest as a very subtle budget, a clever one in many respects.  Provisions that had been abolished under the terms of the 1987 budget were reintroduced in the January 1988 budget, being heralded with great triumph.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to agriculture.  The former Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, introduced installation grants to assist young farmers to take over family farms, rendering them more viable, productive units.  Those installation grants were abolished in 1987 and reintroduced this year.  When replying perhaps the Minister would inform the House whether applicants whose applications had not been processed or approved but rather left in a kind of limbo will be reconsidered.  Will their applications be re-examined?  The abolition of those installation grants was a blow to the agricultural industry particularly when stamp duty was abolished.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the agricultural industry, like the construction industry, has huge job creation potential.  It worries me to hear the Minister for Agriculture and Food talk about the position in Europe where land is being set aside, taken out of production.  It is very serious that such an attitude should prevail here and on the Continent at a time when we are being ravaged by the effects of unemployment and emigration.  That is something about which we should seek clarification.  I am aware of the difficulties being encountered in agriculture in Europe but this constitutes a retrograde step particularly in regard to the creation of additional employment.</P>
    <P>The school building programme is a scandal.  For example, there was a figure of £6.7 million reintroduced in the 1988 budget, the public capital programme having being reduced by some £16 million <Col N="903" /> in 1987.  Many schools throughout the country were at the stage of being advertised for tender.  That meant that they had gone through the different phases up to the point where they produced the bills of quantity and then advertised the school for tender.  It cost a considerable amount of money to bring a school to that stage but, lo and behold, we now find that all that has been scrapped and done away with.  The position now is that all that work has gone for nought even though some contractors were about to be appointed.  Now the situation is being re-examined and a much less expensive scheme is being introduced by the Department.  That is a considerable waste of public moneys and the Minister should be asked to account publicly for that expensive change of attitude, particularly when a considerable amount of the groundwork has been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Many serious issues have been discussed in this House but this is probably one of the most serious.  The demographics will show that the teenage population in my constituency and in the constituency of my colleague, Deputy Flood, are the highest in the country. These constituencies have more than their share of social and economic problems and under age drinking is a problem which repeatedly comes up when one meets residents' associations, community councils and various concerned social leaders.  The Minister in his address to the House last evening and Deputy Barrett, by bringing forward this Bill, have rightly identified that some decisive action is necessary in relation to under age drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> The point at issue is what action is workable, practical and capable of being implemented.  There are a variety of views as to what should be done.  We now have the opportunity to take action when legislation is in the final stages of drafting in the Department of Justice and when Deputy Barrett has brought before the House for consideration a Bill which is almost the same as the 1986 Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  It would appear that, collectively, we in this House are at one that some action is needed.  We will have to be very pragmatic, decisive and realistic and ensure that whatever legislation we enact will be workable and will have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>We must approach this problem in a detailed, educational way, particularly at post-primary school level.  We have seen the impact of the health education programme on young boys and girls who now recognise the dangers and the health risks of smoking.  The cigarette manufacturers are now feeling the cold winds of change and the information coming through indicates that there is a drop off in the level of cigarette smoking in particular among young people because of very explicit advertising programmes and other health education programmes that have been brought forward within post-primary schools.  Under age drinking comes within the area of health protection and concern for health.  A major role can be played by those in the educational area in combatting under age drinking.  There should be a recognition of an educational programme alongside any Bill the Minister brings before the House.</P>
    <P>The role of the parent cannot be left to one side.  I suppose many of us in this House believe that much of the under age drinking can be laid firmly and fairly at the doorsteps of parents who have not exercised parental control.  I urge parents to recognise that what may seem like a misdemeanour now can become a serious illness in later years and can cause major difficulties as one goes through life. Under age drinking can set a train of absenteeism from employment and can lead to various other problems.  The abuse of alcohol can lead to a breakdown <Col N="905" /> in society, to economic problems and to vandalism.</P>
    <P>We consistently get complaints and representations from groups who highlight the fact that drink is being sold, without any due control to under age persons.  The Garda authorities do not seem to be capable of coping with the problem at present.  All sorts of reasons, excuses and facts are given as to why one cannot move against the people who are selling drink to under age teenagers. Hopefully, this acceptance of mediocrity will come to a conclusion with the enactment of legislation that will be implemented and made workable.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about whether there should be identification cards and how a publican is supposed to know whether a teenager is under age. In particular, it is difficult to draw that line in relation to young girls who wear make-up.  We would probably be better to err on the side of caution in this area. There are problems in regard to an identification card system.  Those who are opposed to them will say that big brother is taking over, that the State is beginning to exercise far too much personal control and that there is an invasion of privacy but that is going to be the penalty for helping to tackle this problem.  I believe that merit comes down on the side of trying to ensure that there is not a continuance of the present trend of illegal under age drinking with all the effects that may have in later life.  In later years many young people could rightly look at society and say, &ldquo;you gave me very little advice and protection at a very vulnerable age and I will carry the scars of this throughout my life.&rdquo;  When one talks to anybody in the health service or looks at the national bill for absenteeism and the burden on the health services which is caused by the excessive abuse of alcohol one realises that it is a major problem and one which must be tackled vigorously.</P>
    <P>On the positive side there is a greater recognition of health education and of sporting activities among people.  There has been major improvement in this area. We as legislators have to capitalise on that and implement as a matter of <Col N="906" /> urgency very strict legislation that will protect our young people.  I welcome the commitment given by the Minister in the House last evening that legislation will be brought forward immediately after the Easter recess.  I hope Deputy Barrett will accept the intent in that legislation and that it is in no way a reflection on the 1986 Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  I hope that the debate that has ensued in the interim and the experience that has been gained by the Minister and the parliamentary draftsman will make the 1988 Bill all the more effective.  There has been a lengthy debate about the other aspects of this Bill, namely the clubs, discos and off-licences which provide drink.  Those aspects will have to be dealt with in an overall Bill dealing with this subject.  That section of the Bill will have to be scrutinised in detail and I would favour strong action which would help deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>The young person who is abusing his health by taking alcohol is the person who is in need of protection.  There is no parental control, no recognition of coming home late, and possibly there is an alcohol problem in the family.  This is the young person we must try to protect. We cannot guarantee these people protection and we cannot guarantee to properly police the area, but we cannot err by backing off from taking definite decisions, as will arise if the publican has to exercise judgment.  He will be put in the invidious position of having to pick one or two teenagers out of a group if he thinks they are under age and question them.  In busy pubs this will be very difficult for staff, but if there is a clear identification procedure, that will be all to the good.  This is an area at which the Minister should look very closely to see how best he can reconcile the minimal invasion of privacy with protection of the individual in tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Stafford mentioned the sale of alcohol in off-licence premises. This is a cause of great concern because we believe this is where the greatest abuse lies.  We see outside licensed premises young teenagers having cider parties. It is this kind of issue which is causing <Col N="907" /> concern in large urban areas.  With proper policing by the community and the Garda we should be able to monitor the sale of alcohol so that those selling liquor to young people can be identified and heavily fined.  Local people can usually identify where these abuses happen. They know where alcohol is available, where proper controls are not exercised and where those in off-licence premises are willing, for the sake of a profit, to sell alcohol to young people.  There must be some control which can be exercised when these people are renewing their licences.  I would like to see a number of decisive paragraphs in the legislation to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>The educational area should be fully explored and, hopefully, some resources will be made available to tackle this problem. The advertising of alcohol on our television screens has gone overboard in the last number of years.  We have a range of lagers and other drinks presented as light refreshment but there is a very strong alcoholic content in those beverages. This advertising is aimed directly at young people who have disposable income.  The breweries and the vested interests are aiming at these people and they will leave no stone unturned by way of sponsorship and investment to get the name of their product across.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in the United States the Guinness Group's fastest growing product is Kaliber, a non-alcoholic drink.  There is an acceptance there that one does not have to drink alcohol to be with it.  Whatever moves can be made in that direction by the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues should be taken to ensure that the drinks industry play their part in tackling this abuse, which is often the cause of vandalism, house breaking and other problems for the settled community, and the old folk in large urban areas, some of whom I represent.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Barrett for bringing forward this Bill.  I do not think there is any difference of opinion between us, but I hope the Minister's legislation will have more teeth and will <Col N="908" /> be more comprehensive than the 1986 Bill which lapsed with the outgoing Government.  As promised, it will be before the House after the Easter recess and I hope it gets a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats will be supporting this Bill.  We welcome the opportunity to deal with the problem of under-age drinking.  It is a good thing that the Opposition in this Dáil are getting the chance to have some legislative effect.  It has been a long time since a Private Members' Bill passed through the Dáil, although we had one recently from Deputy Shatter and now we have another from Deputy Barrett. One of the good things about having a minority Government is that, hopefully, there will be a greater opportunity in future, particularly during the lifetime of this Dáil, for more Private Members' Bills to be taken on board and to become part of the legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Barrett for producing this Bill.  There is no doubt that under-age drinking has caused great concern to communities, residents' associations, families and so on.  Last night the Minister said it was not possible, even if it were desirable, to legislate for virtue or for the ideal situation and I agree with that but we must look at the problem of under-age drinking in the context of a society where most things, particularly social life, centre around alcohol, the availability of alcohol, the consumption of alcohol and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 9 February last I asked the Minister for Justice about the special exemption orders granted in recent years.  Although I know there are a number of these exemption orders in force in hotels, restaurants, discos, and so on, I was surprised to learn that in 1987 45,014 special exemption orders were granted and 1,398 occasional licences.  Those figures are alarming because they indicate an overdependence on alcohol being available in order, first, sometimes for those functions to take place and, second, to be a success, particularly a financial success. Whether one is in a sports club, a political organisation or whatever, if one wants to <Col N="909" /> get a response from the public to a social function, one is forced to apply for an occasional licence or exemption order so that drink will be available into the very late hours.  It is a pity that we, as a country, are so dependent on alcohol.  I do not say that out of a sense of virtue, but because there is no doubt this is having a severe effect not only on our young people but on our economy generally.</P>
    <P>Most employers will tell you that absenteeism on Monday morning in particular, after the weekend drinking, is very high.  We have a very serious alcohol problem and we need to deal with it from the point of view of education, health, reaction and alternative facilities for young people.  In many urban centres there is very little for a young person to do except hang around the local pub. From an early age it becomes almost necessary for him to go to an establishment where drink is available to have a social life of any kind.  We have not provided sufficient facilities for young people and we are to blame for the overdependence many of them have on bars, pubs and places where alcohol is available. I agree with those who suggested that greater use should be made of the proceeds of the national lottery to provide alternative recreational and social facilities for teenagers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor referred to the great success of Kaliber and non-alcoholic drinks in the US and Europe.  The success of them is an indication that there has to be some kind of alcohol resemblance for young people to consume a certain product. Drink is associated with being adult, mature and independent.  That is how it is advertised.  The glamour attached to it, and the secrecy that surrounds it, is very much part and parcel of the type of craving that young people have as soon as drink becomes available in their social circle.  That is not just a feature of this country because, generally speaking, the way drink is advertised around the world leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor suggested that it would be very hard for publicans to establish the age of young people but his reference <Col N="910" /> to girls with make-up was a sexist comment. Generally speaking drink is advertised in a sexist way.  When I was a teenager the big craving was Babycham. That drink is still available but we do not hear very much about it.  Young people have moved on to other sophisticated and glamorous products that are often over sold but certainly over advertised.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the Bill is the need to introduce a law and enforce it.  At present it is illegal to sell alcohol to persons under the age of 18 but even with that law in 1986, according to the report of the Garda Commissioner for crime in that year, only six charges were brought against licensees for a breach of it and five convictions obtained.  That is a very low figure given the extent of the problem. The law is not being enforced.  We must introduce legislation that is capable of being enforced and in that context I should like to deal with a number of provisions in the Bill.  I enthusiastically welcome the intent and the thrust of the Bill but it enters into a grey area in some respects.  It may be impossible to enforce some of its provisions if they are passed in their present form.</P>
    <P>The Bill places an onus on a licensee to ensure that those served with alcohol are over the age of 18 but without the introduction of a type of identity card here I do not think it will be possible to enforce that central provision.  In my view it will cause many problems for publicans. They will be placed in a difficult position if we do not have an easily identifiable card for people over a certain age.  There is no doubt that if a publican is to be careful he or she will have to refuse drink to people as old as 20, 21 or 22 because it will not be possible to be certain of the age of such people.</P>
    <P>We should take on board the suggestions by Deputy Barrett, and others, about identity cards.  Somehow we do not like being restricted.  We have a general sense of lawlessness about ourselves.  We adopt many of our systems from the British; if they do not have them we do not introduce them.  The paranoia displayed in recent days about this issue was unnecessary and shameful.  It goes back <Col N="911" /> to the type of attitude that we do not want any laws to govern ourselves.  The fact is that the easier it is to identify a person the less draconian other laws will be.  If it is easy to identify a person we will not have to have long periods of detention for identification purposes. Many people are against the introduction of identify cards because they consider such a system to be draconian but in my view it would eliminate the need to introduce other draconian measures. People should take that on board.</P>
    <P>Members of the NUJ display a laminated identity card on their cars and they have not objected to them.  The staff of Leinster House, and officials of other public offices, are issued with identity cards and they have no objection to them. People travelling to European countries carry their passports and they do not object to having to do so.  The introduction of identity cards here would remove the necessity for carrying a passport when travelling in EC countries and we should bear that in mind.  Identity cards would also help us deal with problems such as social welfare fraud, tax evasion and so on.  I am not suggesting that everybody should be given a number at birth but they should be given identity cards from the time they reach 16 years.</P>
    <P>We will have to move in that direction not just because of the provisions of the Bill but because identity cards are desirable. A debate on an identity card system should be a meaningful one.  We should not have people going over the top on this issue.  That is the only way I could describe some of the comments I read about such a proposal.  Those comments were not reasonable and they should not prevent us introducing an identity card system in the future.  The question of who would issue the card will have to be discussed later but we should not put this matter on the long finger simply because there may be difficulties involved in getting the scheme under way.</P>
    <P>With other Members I attended a meeting arranged by the Vintners Federation of Ireland today when the provisions of the Bill were discussed.  I asked <Col N="912" /> some of the representatives if they could enforce the provisions of the Bill.  They admitted that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce the provisions if we did not have an identity card system. In my view the absence of such a system will mean that those between 19 and 22 will have to carry a passport, a birth certificate or some other form of identification when seeking admission to licensed premises.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (1) (a) states that the holder of a licence shall not sell or deliver intoxicating liquor to a person under the age of 18 years.  I should like to ask Deputy Barrett to tell the House, when replying, what he means by the word &ldquo;deliver&rdquo;. Does he mean give to, provide for or serve a person under that age?  In my view the word &ldquo;deliver&rdquo; should be clearly defined.  The section also states that people under the age of 18 cannot drink alcohol other than in a private residence. That means that at the wedding of a brother or sister, on the occasion of a family get-together in a hotel or at a Sunday lunch with parents a young person cannot have a glass of wine or a beer.  If a young person on a Sunday picnic with his or her family wants to have wine or beer he or she will be prohibited from drinking it.  I do not think anybody wants such a draconian measure introduced but if we pass the Bill in its present form that will be the law.  We must ensure that the law is adequate if it is to be properly enforced but I do not think anybody intended this or any other measure to have that effect.  Many young people go abroad on holidays or are involved in exchange arrangements with foreign students and they become accustomed to having an occasional glass of wine or a beer.  People in other countries have a more sensible attitude to drink in the home and to drink in moderation.  Children at a much younger age take the occasional glass of wine or beer and do not go over the top when they become of age.  They have a more sensible attitude to drink.  If that is the case, whether in a public place or not, it should not be prohibited by the provisions in this Bill. I do not want to go through the Bill as <Col N="913" /> a lawyer would, saying this or that is wrong and this or that is impossible.  Far too much of that is going on.  If people make a reasonable effort to bring in measures the general thrust of which we would support we should be positive rather than negative.  I am making these comments simply in that context, but there may be problems.</P>
    <P>Section 8 places a requirement on the holder of a licensed premises not to allow a child on the premises at any time except in the company of a parent or guardian and except between the hours of 10.30 a.m. and 8 p.m.  This applies except for access to particular facilities attached to the premises.  I am wondering if those provisions are a little restrictive.  Is it really necessary to go that far?  Section 120 of the Children Act of 1908 prohibited children from being in bars except when these were closed.  As we all know, that is not enforced and rightly so.  It would inconvenience families, particularly when they are involved in leisuse activities or on holidays, when there is a leisurely attitude to a child being in a bar on a Sunday afternoon or in the early hours of the evening.  It is right that we are not as restrictive as the present law would require.  There may be circumstances in which after 8 o'clock it is desirable that a child be with his or her parents in a public house.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with special exemptions. Generally, this would refer to places like hotels with special licences for discos and so on.  The Bill states that persons under 18 cannot be present at all where exemption orders apply.  That would mean that in an hotel room, for instance, or in a lobby of an hotel where alcohol is consumed, a child would be excluded.  The Bill says that anywhere alcohol is either sold or consumed where special exemption orders apply everybody under 18 years of age is excluded. That section should be examined to see whether its restrictiveness would cause problems.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem in relation to the employment of persons in licensed premises.  The Bill refers to the word &ldquo;employ&rdquo;.  Does that refer simply to <Col N="914" /> somebody who is being paid?  Generally speaking, the relatives of a licensee would probably not be working for money. Does that mean that they are or are not employed?  Either way, to restrict close relatives to being in the premises once they are 16 years of age is far too restrictive. I know of cases where members of the family of publicans who are much younger than 16, from 11 years old depending on the maturity of the individual, can help out by clearing glasses and so forth.  That kind of activity does not cause any problems.  This matter should be examined.  Some members of the Vintners' Federation have told me that it is generally the case that people start learning their trade as a barman at the age of 16 or certainly from 16 upwards.  If that is the case, it would be very restrictive to limit the age to 18 years.  There are situations where for family or financial reasons people at universities of the age of 16 or 17 or people at school may work one night a week, or on a Saturday, in the lounge part of the premises.  Generally speaking, they do not have a problem with alcohol because of their experience.</P>
    <P>Section 11 gives particular powers to the Garda Síochána.  I very much welcome this section which is badly needed. The present law is such that if gardaí come upon a cider party in a public park they are totally powerless to seize the goods.  Gardaí have time and time again told me at meetings which I have attended that there is nothing that they can do in these cases.  I would like Deputy Barrett to refer to the situation where licences are run in conjunction with, for example, grocery shops, supermarkets and so on.  The Bill mentions that where the bulk of the business comes from the sale of alcohol young people are completely excluded, except in the company of their parents.  When 55 per cent of a business comes from the sale of alcohol and 45 per cent from groceries, at no time other than in the company of a parent or guardian during the hours of 10.30 a.m. and 8 p.m.  can a child go in to get a message.  If you want to send somebody to buy cigarettes in an off-licence, that <Col N="915" /> will also be precluded.  It would be no harm to look again at that section.</P>
    <P>Let me now deal with the panalties. Deputy Barrett has sought to increase penalties and I welcome that.  However, if you want to enforce the law to its full potential you will eventually come up against the problem of total forfeiture of the licence or of doing nothing at all.  The courts have a discretion and after two endorsements the Garda do not bother any more because the courts do not want to enforce total forfeiture on account of the burden placed on the licence holder and on the premises.  I suggest that, instead of withdrawal of the licence in certain circumstances, which should be available in extreme cases where there would be continued flouting of the law, the premises be closed down for a week, a month or some such period.  This was mentioned by Deputy Taylor.  Threat of a suspended licence could be quite successful. Certainly, it would be a greater deterrent than the £50 and £300 fines and would be more workable than the present restrictive measures.  I am not saying that extreme measures are not necessary in some situations but, generally speaking, if a good case is put up for the keeping of a licence on the grounds of hardship to the family or the employees, the courts do not enforce total forfeiture.  Apparently, there has not been a withdrawal of a licence for quite some time and, in all, very few licences have been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The measure is a much needed and welcome one.  Deputy Barrett and his party are to be congratulated on giving us an opportunity to discuss this legislation and, it is hoped, to pass it.  I would refer to the comments of the Minister last night. Because he will be bringing in similar type legislation he thought that we should have a useful debate but after Easter should take on board the Government's measure.  The Progressive Democrats do not support that view.  We will be supporting this Bill in Committee and if it goes on to a special committee of this House we will be putting forward amendments to try to improve it, to make it <Col N="916" /> more workable and to remove some of the grey areas which are causing concern.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister for Justice said last night about the need to look generally at the whole question of liquor licences and enforcement of the present law and the introduction of laws that are real and practical and will have an effect. I understand no new licences have been granted since 1904 except in the ten exemption categories where the population has increased, where the public house is within a mile of another or where a pub has been demolished or burnt.  It is a strange position which should be looked at.</P>
    <P>I note from statistics supplied by the vintners' federation that in Dublin city and county, for example, where the population exceeds one million people there is a total of 834 licensed premises. Yet, in the rest of the country where the population is twice that, there are 9,643 licences.  I understand why that situation exists.  I live in a small village where the population is about 2,500 and within a mile there are four licensed premises. That is generally a feature of rural areas. There are far too many public houses and it is one of the things we are most associated with internationally &mdash; Ireland and its pubs.  There is a discrepancy and, as a result, new public houses in the Dublin area tend to be enormous.  The idea of the small, family-run public house is almost gone in Dublin.  The licensing laws should be looked at so that they can be made more effective and free of the restrictions placed on them under present legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this very important debate on a subject that has been pushed aside for far too long.  I compliment Deputy Barrett on bringing this Bill forward to give us an opportunity to critically examine the whole question of the abuse of alcohol by under-age drinkers. The debate will serve a useful purpose because we have failed to deal in any significant way with a rapidly growing problem over the past ten to 20 years. As legislators, we must devise ways and <Col N="917" /> means of imposing effective control on the abuse of alcohol by under-age drinking.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a reminder that for a number of years the problem has been growing significantly.  I represent an urban constituency and it is the single greatest problem referred to at meetings of one kind or another when we meet the public as part of our duties as public representatives. The complaint consistently put forward is that there seems to be few powers available to the Garda to deal with the problem which has been getting out of hand in the area with which I am familiar.  I know from listening to other contributors that that is the case not just in large urban areas but also in rural constituencies.  We must ask why allegedly between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of young people are excessive drinkers. In order to deal with the problem we must try to find the answer.</P>
      <P>Is it that young people see an ambivalent attitude on the part of adults, their parents or the elders in the community, towards the consumption of alcohol? They are given to understand that it is not really a great crime to over-indulge consistently in alcohol abuse.  Perhaps that is why young people have not adopted a sensible attitude towards the consumption of alcohol.  We must carry a certain amount of the blame for the growth of this very serious problem which affects very young children.  Many children of 12, 13, 14 and 15 are seasoned drinkers which is desperately sad.  We must try &mdash; not just through legislation &mdash; to cope with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the by-products of this abuse which I have seen at first hand &mdash; and which has been referred to by other contributors &mdash; is the growth of cider parties. This phenomenon has developed over the past five to ten years, particularly in larger urban areas.  It causes severe problems for the community affected because in the aftermath of these parties there is very serious vandalism of public and private property.  Senior citizens feel very threatened and fearful as a result of these practices and very often they are prisoners in their own homes.  These parties <Col N="918" /> have sprung up in developing areas, in parklands and open places and there seems to be very little power available to curtail such activities.  This is consistently referred to at meetings of residents' and tenants' associations.  These practices arise largely because alcohol is available to young people from many licensed premises, supermarkets, off-licences and so on.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people in the licensed trade conduct their business properly but, unfortunately, in practically every area there is an outlet which is known to have an easy attitude to the sale of drink to those who are under age. Very young people are drawn to these areas seeking intoxicating liquor for the various parties to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Going back to the adult attitude to drink, the cider parties are really an extension of past practices by adults. There was a growth in the number of beer festivals which were no more than an excuse for over-indulgence in alcohol consumption.  These festivals were largely developed by adults for their own enjoyment but young people could not fail to have been influenced by them. Weekend music festivals were also held which produced good music but also much over-indulgence in alcohol.  The two seemed to go hand-in-hand.  These festivals have been held at weekends over the past 20 years although they seem to have dwindled recently.  They suggested to young people that the abuse of alcohol did not pose any great problem and they probably considered they would be able to control the intake of alcohol just as their parents appeared to have done.  Of course we all know that is not the case.</P>
    <P>The easy availability of alcohol concerns us all and I wonder if its sale in places like supermarkets is appropriate. I see no reason for supermarkets being allowed sell alcohol, which may be very attractively packaged and sitting side by side with the essentials of life.  It is going to be extremely difficult for the large supermarkets to police the legislation effectively even if they have a desire to do so.  As we know, some of these supermarkets are extremely large and are very <Col N="919" /> busy on certain days of the week.  This will make it very difficult to adequately supervise the sale of alcohol.  If you have two or three people rushing through a very busy checkout point it is going to prove practically impossible for the management to properly control the sale of drink.  That is a question which needs to be addressed and perhaps the Minister could address it in the legislation he intends bringing forward.  I believe that the number of outlets will have to be curtailed so that the legislation can be properly enforced and policed.  It will prove very difficult to enforce the legislation if there is a multiplicity of outlets, be they off-licence premises or supermarkets. That is an issue which is going to have to be addressed in any legislation brought forward.</P>
    <P>Young people see adults abuse alcohol when they go out for a night and travel by car.  These young people question in their own minds the wisdom of such practices. We have all seen the results of those practices in the carnage on our roads. Young people can get the false impression that alcohol can be trifled with.  Because of this adults have got to adopt a different attitude in their use of alcohol.  We have got to take into account that young people are influenced by our behaviour, the very people this legislation is aimed at protecting.</P>
    <P>There are one or two aspects of the Bill which I would like to comment on. Previous speakers have referred to identity cards I have no objection to the issuing of identity cards and, as has been mentioned already, most of us already carry identification of one kind or another be it a passport, a bankcard or membership card of a sporting organisation, club or library.  If we are going to a particular place and need identification we will always make sure that we have the appropriate identification with us.</P>
    <P>Problems could arise if the carrying of identity cards is made compulsory. Would it be possible to go half way in order to meet the serious objections that some people might have on the necessity to carry identity cards and introduce a <Col N="920" /> scheme where people would voluntarily carry an identity card?  This already happens in business.  If a sales representative of a company wishes to enter the premises of a would-be customer he would be expected to have with him proper identification such as a card bearing his photograph and the name of the company he was representing.  I see no reason that the carrying of identity cards in order to properly police the intoxicating liquor laws could not be made voluntary also. Those who do not wish to carry such identity cards would have to face the consequences of a refusal on the part of a licensee if he or she was in doubt as to the age of the person seeking to be served with drink on their premises.  That is one way the problem in regard to identification can be overcome.</P>
    <P>I agree that it can be extremely difficult to decide on whether a person is under or over 18 years of age and the carrying of identity cards voluntarily could solve many of the problems in this regard.  I think most people would accept that there is a necessity to carry suitable identification and that without it there may be problems in their being served drink at the festive occasion they were going out to attend.  We can get over this difficulty without causing too many problems for those who may have objections in principle to the carrying of identity cards.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the seizure of alcohol by the Garda Síochána in cases where they believe the legislation may have been infringed.  This is a very important inclusion in the legislation.  We have all seen young people carrying intoxicating liquor and heading off to an area which is well known in terms of cider parties.  Unfortunately, up until now the Garda Síochána seem to have had very little power to deal with a situation just developing which, as everybody in the community knows, in a matter of two or three hours is going to cause serious problems.</P>
    <P>The difficulty which I see in section 11 (1) (a) is that it proposes to confer powers on the Garda Síochána in relation to people infringing the legislation who are <Col N="921" /> in possession of drink in a public place. This may cause problems.  As we all know, it is very easy to identify a park as a public place but what about a derelict house which is privately owned?  Will this Bill cover that type of premises and would the Garda Síochána have the power to enter into these premises?  If they are not to have such power there is a serious defect in the Bill.  There are many derelict and vacant properties in our cities and towns which are in private ownership and very often these are used for the type of practice that I have referred to.  We have got to give to the Garda Síochána the power to enter these premises and seize intoxicating liquor from young people in cases where it appears that the legislation has been infringed.  If that is absent from legislation there will be a major weakness in it.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister when bringing forward legislation, to consider this issue very carefully, otherwise the Bill could be considerably weakened particularly relating to larger urban areas where there is a predominance of such semi-derelict properties.  Of course, public property at times, is also available for this type of practice.  Will the Garda have power to move into, for example, a local authority house which may have been vandalised and which is being used to hold cider parties and for other related practices, where the communities around these properties are being terrified out of their homes at night time?  The communities who raised these problems with me will want any legislation produced to deal with that type of situation.  They will be disappointed if the legislation does not confer powers on the Garda to deal with such a difficulty.</P>
    <P>In relation to penalties for the infringement of the legislation by the licence holder, we have to make it clear that a licence holder has to be careful as to how he or she operates an establishment selling intoxicating liquor.  Up to this, people could abdicate their responsibility by saying that they did not really know. We have to delete that word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; and put a greater degree of onus on the <Col N="922" /> licensee to ensure that no infringement of the legislation takes place on his property by the sale of intoxicating liquor to under-age people.</P>
    <P>The larger urban areas have grown in the last ten to 15 years.  Alongside the development of larger housing estates, roads, schools, churches and so on have been provided.  Along with that we see the smaller shopping centre and the development plan type of neighbourhood public house.  I am very critical of the development of huge licensed premises on the outskirts of our cities.  There are some very large establishments easily capable of holding a thousand or more people.  That is detrimental to any community. The pub becomes the dominating building; it dominates the community, the Church, the school and the houses. These huge establishments should not be allowed.  I would far prefer to see smaller licensed premises suitably located in individual housing estates without causing inconvenience to anyone there.  That would be a far better development than subjecting communities to these huge premises which are largely impersonal. The crowds which gravitate to those premises cause real problems for the residents in those areas.  In relation to the granting of licences, the Minister could address this problem and lay down guidelines as to the size of new licensed premises, in an effort to bring some order into the development of such establishments. We have one such establishment in Dublin claiming to be the biggest public house in Europe.  I do not know if that is a great boast for a licensed premises, but we have such a one on the outskirts of Dublin.  In a smaller, more personal, well run establishment, the licensee knows his patrons and is therefore in a better position to police the sort of legislation we are talking about here and which the Minister for Justice has promised after Easter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment in his address last night to bring forward suitable legislation.  I hope it will be expanded beyond underage drinking alone.  Several other issues that impinge on each other need to be dealt with now, rather than taking one single issue and <Col N="923" /> introducing legislation to deal with that alone.  It was right that the Minister should take this opportunity to undertake a total review of the whole licensing system in so far as it affects the sale of intoxicating liquor to under-age people, the opening of licensed premises and so on.  It is time to address those issues.  This Bill dealing with a single issue is probably premature, although to start the debate on the wider issue it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with the praise that has been given to the Fine Gael spokesman on Justice, Deputy Seán Barrett, for producing this Bill.  The debate on intoxicating liquor has been going on for a long time.  During the lifetime of the previous Dáil a joint committee on legislation undertook an extensive examination of the licensing laws and spent quite some time dealing with the many submissions from all facets of the trade, the licensed vintners, the vintners federation, Irish hotels, Irish ballrooms and the restaurant association. On the other side there were people who were concerned about the health of the community, people like the ID card group in Mayo, the No Name Club, the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association and the National Council for Alcoholism. There has been extensive debate in parliament since 1982 about this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent days this matter was highlighted by a pastoral issued by the Bishops of Ireland which was read in the churches, in which there was trenchant criticism of the abuse by young people of alcohol.  Some people felt that the bishops were a little too critical.  Indeed, I have seen cases where there has been substantial improvement in the attitude of young people to alcoholism and to alcohol abuse.  I would not like it to go from this House that the Members of the Dáil feel that all young people are abusing alcohol, or that there is a plague among them and that we have to get rid of it. Many young people act responsibly and they view the abuse of alcohol in a different light from what people did some 20 years ago.  Deputies have expressed the <Col N="924" /> feeling that some young people are chasing the crack every weekend but I do not think all of them do that and I compliment the many young people who become involved in community and social work, who do many good things in their local communities and help old people.</P>
    <P>However, the people most in touch &mdash; I referred earlier to the bishops &mdash; seem to be more and more concerned.  Perhaps in this House we should have been just as concerned and we should not have delayed legislation to deal with this one problem.  Since this Bill has been introduced I have been heartened by the obvious consensus in this House on this problem.  Last night the Minister said he welcomed the discussion initiated by Deputy Barrett.  Deputy Harney on behalf of the Progressive Democrats supported the Bill and Deputies on the Government side of the House have spoken favourably on it.</P>
    <P>Because the Minister is to bring in an extensive Bill dealing with intoxicating liquor I appeal to him to go ahead with Deputy Barrett's proposal and allow this legislation to be followed through because the problems immediately affecting young people are addressed in this Bill.  Solutions to current difficulties are proposed and running in parellel is a discussion on ID cards.  The time is ripe for the Minister and for this House to go ahead and support this initiative.  Indeed the most trenchant criticism before the Committee on Legislation came from people who had established the concept of ID cards in Mayo who illustrated in very stark terms some terrible happenings that young people had experienced even in the west.</P>
    <P>Fr. Morahan is a priest well known in GAA circles &mdash; I am certain the Leas-Cheann Comhairle met him when he was associated with the GAA &mdash; and I must give him credit.  He helped to change one famous rule in the GAA book.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>In this other rule he is trying to champion the ID cards and I <Col N="925" /> support him in that and hope he is successful. The ID group have been, apart from the clergy, people who have pressed most consistently for a change in this legislation which has been in existence since 1924.  Can we afford to delay further?</P>
      <P>It is clear from what the Minister said that the new Bill to be introduced in this House will be very extensive.  The previous speaker wants the Minister to have a look at the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; used in a section of Deputy Barrett's Bill.  With all the details to be undertaken by the Minister in his reform of intoxicating liquor law, that section of the legislation will not be in place by summer.  Outbreaks have occurred during the summer when young people have on occasion gone on wild parties after the leaving certificate results have come out.  I thought that was all right when it was left to leaving certificate students but in recent years the intermediate certificate students went on rampage after the results came out.  I would like to see the Garda getting the powers sought in this Bill.  I would like licensed vintners and people who sell alcohol to be made aware of the public disquiet over the sale of alcohol to people under 18 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister illustrated his goodwill, but he can give a positive answer when this debate is drawing to a close.  I would like him to support this Bill and let it proceed.  Discussion on the Order of Business on successive mornings has illustrated that the parliamentary draftsman who is putting legislation together currently is having difficulties in many areas. If it has taken 60 years to bring in a Bill on this side of the House on intoxicating liquor I am certain we will experience a few more hiccups before the Minister produces his document.  In the interests of the young people he should support Deputy Barrett's Bill.  I will not press him further on that.  I know him to have an interest in the well-being of young people.  He is interested in sport facilities and outdoor activities and has taken a <Col N="926" /> full part in those matters in his constituency. He knows people are very anxious about this matter.</P>
    <P>In future we can limit the numbers of people who fall for the craze of alcohol by providing more leisure activities for them.  I support fully the claims made last evening for greater investment from the national lottery funds in community halls and community games where small injections of funds can have really beneficial results.  Deputy Barrett last night spoke about non-alcohol bars, the development of that atmosphere and so on.  For instance, youth leaders in my constituency are always anxious to hold local discos in community halls.  They feel that if they can keep young people in such surroundings for as long as possible they can keep them away from the obvious attractions of public houses, and where such is the practice the vast majority of young people respond favourably.  I have seen it at work in parishes, where, for instance, clubs have won major trophies in county championships.  The community leaders have asked young people to desist from alcohol on nights of celebration and to stay out of the pubs and they have responded fully.</P>
    <P>The practice of the filling of the cup and passing it around has been dropped by the GAA and I commend them for that.  As well as that competitions have been set up by Scór.  There are also competitions in dance routines, particularly Irish dancing, so there are means of giving young people proper example.  But as Deputy Barrett pointed out, there is unfortunately a need to put in restrictions. Deputy Barrett took the age of 18. We had problems with that in this House in regard to the age of majority.  Is it not time that we changed the 1924 Act which permits at section 11 (4) (c) &ldquo;the sale or delivery to a person over the age of fifteen of Intoxicating Liquor delivered in a corked and sealed vessel containing not less than one reputed pint?&rdquo; We have to make a reasonable effort now and acknowledge some of the fine work and research that has been done.  Doctor Brendan Walsh, in his submission to the legislation committee, listed statistics and <Col N="927" /> other records analysing the effects of absenteeism and so on by the abuse of alcohol.  Some of the results were alarming.</P>
    <P>One area where we have fallen down is in regard to physical education in primary schools.  If physical education was given the importance it is given in other countries some of the effects of the abuse of alcohol would become very apparent to young people and they would be discouraged from indulging in it.  In Ireland we seem to neglect this area which should be part of our everyday life.</P>
    <P>When the national lottery was introduced the emphasis was on sport but there is a serious need for physical education and for teachers both at primary and second level to get directly involved. In the current drive for fiscal rectitude in the Department of Education they probably do not want to hear about putting any new subjects on the curriculum but the lack of physical education is a serious defect in the education of young people. This leads to their going to snooker halls during their lunch breaks.  Playing pot black at lunch time in public houses leads to the abuse of alcohol.  The county councils and the local authorities have been remiss in not enforcing the law with regard to the change of use of public houses and I would ask the Minister for the Environment to have another look at this law; gaming of this sort should be excluded from public houses.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Barrett on bringing in this Bill.  It is an initiative that has been desired by many for a long time. The Minister has an opportunity now to push this matter ahead.  We have dragged our heels on it for far too long.  I appeal to the Minister to allow this Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £80,000,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the payment of lump sum and related payments resulting from early retirements in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already outlined to this House the basic approach underlying this Government's decision to initiate a scheme of voluntary early retirement in the public service.  It has been apparent for some time that this State has built up over the years a range of schemes and programmes designed to meet needs and <Col N="930" /> problems which emerged from time to time but that we were less assiduous than we might have been in dropping or curtailing schemes when their aims had been largely attained, or had become less critical. This Government have faced up to that problem since coming to office and have scaled down activities in the light of the new order of priorities necessitated by our financial situation.</P>
    <P>Public services in all countries tend to be labour intensive.  It would, therefore, be pointless to drop or curtail public services and at the same time to retain the full complement of staff employed to provide them.  The taxpayer would be meeting a largely unchanged bill while getting no or less services in return.  If schemes are dropped or curtailed the staff numbers engaged on them must fall.</P>
    <P>The pattern of growth of our public service and the age structure of its major occupational groups means that we cannot afford to rely on natural wastage to bring about the justifiable fall in numbers. It is abundantly clear that if we retained surplus staff until their normal retirement age the savings intended to arise from the curtailment of services or from enhanced efficiency would be significantly diminished.  The retention of personnel in numbers greater than reduced work requirements demanded would be wasteful for the Exchequer and the taxpayer.  It would also be demoralising for the people involved.</P>
    <P>The rise in public service numbers has contributed significantly to the budgetary difficulties which confronted this Government.  Employment levels in the public service, including the local authorities, peaked at almost 221,000 in 1982. Despite reductions in particular sectors the fall from that peak achieved during the period 1982-86 averaged out at about 600 a year.  During 1987, however, due to the combined effect of natural wastage, career breaks, the total embargo on recruitment which I announced in the 1987 budget, and the early retirement scheme, numbers employed in the public service fell by 6,500 to approximately 211,500.  The number of people who left <Col N="931" /> the public service in 1987 under the voluntary early retirement scheme was 1,135.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my recent budget speech I expect numbers to fall further by some 9,000 during 1988.  This fall will be consistent with having public service agencies operate within their budgetary allocations.  This reduction in numbers will be achieved by a combination of natural wastage, public servants taking career breaks and the voluntary redundancy scheme.</P>
    <P>Approximately 2,600 people, including 340 non-industrial civil servants, have availed of the scheme to date in 1988. The costs of redundancy lump sum payments are borne in the first instance by the direct employer.  It is necessary to have this Estimate passed now to allow the Exchequer to recoup these costs to the employing agencies.</P>
    <P>This Government are the first to bring forward a scheme to deal with excess staffing, other than by natural wastage, across the whole of the public service. The matter has frequently arisen in various parts of the private sector.  Strategies to deal with it in a positive way have been evolved and implemented over the years in Ireland and abroad.  Employers finding it necessary to reduce their work forces have found that among their employees there were many who were willing to accept early retirement on suitable terms. The experience to date with the public service scheme has confirmed that this is so there also.</P>
    <P>The early retirement scheme for public servants was initially confined to specific areas or groups within the public service where it was clear that staff surplus to actual requirements existed.  This entailed the exclusion from the operation of the scheme of substantial elements of the public service where staff surpluses did not exist.  People working in those areas whose personal circumstances made the prospect of early retirement attractive wished to have the scheme extended to them.  Many of them approached their employers and public representatives to explore the possibility of having the <Col N="932" /> scheme extended.  On the basis that retirements in these areas would be used primarily to provide alternative employment opportunities for personnel in areas where the problem of surplus staff had not been fully catered for by the scheme of voluntary early retirement, it was agreed to extend the scheme to a limited category of staff &mdash; those over the age of 50.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Civil Service, arrangements are now being made through the Civil Service Commission for competitions restricted to public servants in areas where substantial numbers of surplus staff exist, from which posts vacated by early retirement will be filled. The posts in question cover the main general service and specialist areas of the Civil Service and offer a remarkable range of choice for staff in bodies such as ACOT, AFT, and An Foras Forbartha who are being invited to apply for them. I think it important to emphasise that the overall costs of the retirement package make it impossible for me to agree to fill all the posts which have been vacated under the scheme and that the very restrictive regime which I have found it necessary to apply to vacancies otherwise occurring in the Civil Service is in no way being modified.</P>
    <P>The application of the scheme in each public service organisation is a matter for the management of the organisation in question, subject to the approval of the relevant Minister.  It is local management who decide in the first instance how widely the terms of the scheme will be offered in each organisation and also the criteria to be used in deciding whether or not to accept applications.  In general, the scheme is to be applied in such a way as to ensure that organisations will live within their budgetary allocations, while maintaining vital services.</P>
    <P>In the health area, the terms of the scheme are available to all personnel aged 50 or over, although key personnel are still to be retained.  The package is also available to other personnel who are identified as surplus to requirements.  The application of the scheme is initially the <Col N="933" /> responsibility of local management, subject to the approval of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Almost 600 employees in the health area availed of the scheme in 1987 and it is expected that a further 1,500 will leave under the scheme in 1988.</P>
    <P>In the education sector details of the voluntary early retirement package have been made available to primary and post primary teachers.  The processing of the over 3,600 applications received to date is now taking place.  This figure does not include applications from vocational teachers as the closing date for them is 31 March 1988.  In addition, the school-by-school review of the effects of the pupil teacher ratio changes at primary level is being carried out by the Primary Quota Review Committee.  In accordance with a resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on 9 March a meeting of the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is to be convened in order to examine the implications of the decision to increase the pupil-teacher ratio in the vocational and community-comprehensive school sector.</P>
    <P>In the context of the 1988 Estimates local authorities were asked to maximise savings on manpower costs through natural wastage, redeployment, career breaks and job sharing in the first instance. Having exhausted all such options local authorities were then authorised to offer voluntary redundancy or early retirement to staff other than key staff or those required to maintain essential services in areas where staff surpluses were identified. At this stage, applications for voluntary redundancy or early retirement from an estimated 1,900 staff, including officers and servants, have been accepted.  As I have previously indicated, the Central Bank has agreed to make advance payments of surplus income to the Exchequer, so as to assist the Exchequer in meeting the exceptional costs of the redundancy programme.</P>
    <P>In the normal course the Exchequer receives from the Central Bank each year the surplus income earned by the bank in <Col N="934" /> the previous year, less certain appropriations to the reserves of the bank. Under the arrangements now agreed with the bank the Exchequer will receive in 1988, in addition to the normal payment of the surplus income from 1987, an advance payment out of the surplus the Central Bank will earn in 1988.  The additional surplus income from the Central Bank will come into the Exchequer as non-tax revenue in the normal way and has been included as such in the budgetary figures.</P>
    <P>The advance by the Central Bank will be repaid.  Repayments will be financed out of the annual savings to the Exchequer from the redundancy programme. Therefore, the exceptional lump sum payments financed by the Central Bank will not increase the national debt or the cost of servicing it.</P>
    <P>The repayments will take the form of four equal annual deductions by the Central Bank from the normal payments of surplus income for the years 1990 to 1993 inclusive.  This repayment period was agreed by the bank so as to allow the full impact of the savings to come through to the Exchequer and to ensure that realised savings are adequate to meet repayments to the bank.</P>
    <P>The bank also provided £8.4 million in 1987 to finance the lump sum payments which arose last year under the scheme. Similar financing and repayment arrangements to those that I have already outlined, in respect of the 1988 Central Bank advances, will apply.  This amount has also been included as non-tax revenue in the outturn for the 1987 budgetary figures.</P>
    <P>I commend the Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Many regard as economic lunacy the pay policy of the present Government, based on a twin-pronged approach which involves trading jobs for increases in pay and, in addition, providing substantial public sums to encourage early retirement from the public sector.  In a country with an unemployment level of 250,000 this approach simply does not make sense.  Therefore, it <Col N="935" /> is clear that the question of redundancies cannot be taken in isolation.  This must be examined in the context of our overall unemployment figures, our payroll costs, the level of our services and, in particular, the need for sufficient support in the productive sectors of our economy from which the necessary growth so desperately needed must be achieved.</P>
      <P>In countries like Holland &mdash; which have successfully come to terms with their problems <i>vis-á-vis</i> public finances &mdash; an exactly opposite approach to that being observed by the present administration was taken.  In that country there was a cut in public sector pay of 3 per cent.  It was only by pursuing that course of action that the Dutch were able to come to grips with their problem.  There is a question as to whether we are any different.  I believe that ultimately we will have to face that prospect here.  There is an absolutely clear connection between the number of jobs and the level of salaries; increases in the latter automatically involve reductions in the former.  All those who are genuinely interested in proposing and supporting a solution to our unemployment problem will have to face this fact and have the courage to implement the necessary decisions.  Only then will we be able to face our young people with an effective manpower and employment policy and a reasonable prospect of ensuring them a livelihood in their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against that background we must consider the second leg of Government payroll policy and the public service early retirement payments we are now debating. On this issue it is proper to recall that the difficulties of numbers in the public service arose primarily because of the policies implemented as a consequence of the 1977 Fianna Fáil manifesto. Following the return of Fianna Fáil to Government in 1977 we had the ludicrous position of huge additional unnecessary numbers being taken on in the public service and semi-State bodies, health boards and local authorities, who were all being harassed and harangued because of their tardiness in taking on <Col N="936" /> extra numbers into their ranks which they did not need and which the taxpayer certainly could not afford.  The explosion in numbers was such as to put an unbearable stain on the public finances which resulted in the enormous leap in our borrowing requirements.  On that score it is somewhat disingenuous for the Minister to gloss over this point in the course of his introductory remarks when he implied that the problem had arisen because of the curtailment of certain schemes.  Of course if schemes are dropped or curtailed there will be a reduction in numbers. But that is not the prime cause of our current problem, which I believe is related directly to the absolutely crazy policy following the return of Fianna Fáil to Government just over a decade ago.</P>
    <P>The chickens have now come home to roost.  It is perhaps ironic that it is another Fianna Fail Government who find themselves in a position of proposing such extreme measures, at such enormous cost, to bring about a reduction in numbers. When talking about a reduction in numbers, as one who served for a short time in the now defunct Department of the Public Service, it is proper to recall that the last Coalition Government &mdash; in the face of quite considerable opposition at the time &mdash; commenced the job of reducing public service numbers.  This was done by the imposition of the embargo and other measures.  Principally reductions arose through natural wastage. As a consequence of this policy significant savings were effected without the enormous expense associated with the present redundancy programme.  I acknowledge that the present programme does have, as an objective, a much more accelerated pace of reduction in numbers in the public service.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the Minister's proposals, his main concern focuses on the financing of the redundancy package.  In presenting his budget the Minister stated that he hoped to achieve an outturn for 1988 which would reduce the current budget deficit to 6.3 per cent of GNP and the Exchequer borrowing requirement to 8.2 per cent of GNP.  It really makes nonsense of these objectives and figures to <Col N="937" /> have major Government expenditure on a redundancy package which is not provided for within those figures.  The cost of the redundancy and early retirement package is not provided for at all in the official figures which are, as it were, off balance sheet.  Indeed I question the propriety of funding the redundancy arrangements in this fashion.  I believe that in due course the Comptroller and Auditor General may have comments to make on this approach.  Essentially the Government are drawing down from the Central Bank's reserves sums of money which would otherwise be available to the Exchequer in ensuing years.</P>
    <P>A simple analogy would be the position of an employee who wanted to go on holiday and sought an advance from his employer which would be deducted from his salary in the months after his return. It is clear that this is a device to borrow money without having the amounts included in the Government's balance sheet.  Here again the Minister is somewhat disingenuous in his presentation when he tells us that the advance by the Central Bank will be repaid.  Is he suggesting that if we arrange borrowings, those will not be repaid?  I believe the presentation is such as to avoid the Minister admitting the basic fact that he is drawing down moneys in advance which amount to borrowings.  I suppose a rose by any other name will get the Minister by but I believe it is less than clear-cut to both adopt that approach and present it in that fashion.  The whole operation is questionable and it certainly does not inspire confidence in those who lend money to the State.  The Government can be seen to be playing fast and loose with the reserves of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the redundancy and early retirement programme which are a major cause for concern. Essentially, in many instances some of the brightest and best are leaving the service.  As somebody who knows the Civil Service and some of the public service quite well, I know there are some very fine people there.  Of course, as is natural in any such organisation, there are some people whom the organisation <Col N="938" /> could do without.  However, there is no fear that those people whom one could do without will apply to leave.  What is very obvious is that some of the finest people who were there have left the service. This turns logic on its head.</P>
    <P>The normal approach nowadays is for business and firms to head hunt individuals who are needed for the requirements of their operations.  I strongly question the wisdom of the approach adopted by the Government, in particular, in the area I know best &mdash; and I am referring of course to the agricultural scene &mdash; where upwards of 500 people in AFT and ACOT have already accepted the redundancy package.  People who have developed an international reputation working on behalf of the country are now being shed from the service at a time when we are entering a crucially competitive phase in the development of our agriculture and food industry.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which needs to be looked at concerns the manner in which semi-State bodies implement the redundancy and early retirement package.  Is the funding to be provided from the Central Bank to enable them so to do?  The figure involved could be very enormous indeed.  I understand that in Bord na Móna about 30 per cent of the staff, or 1,300 in all, have applied for voluntary redundancy.  How is this to be funded?  It is important that the Minister tell us fully what his strategies and policies are in this regard.</P>
    <P>Further problems, will, of course, arise in relation to the payment of pensions to those people who are applying for voluntary redundancy now.  Most of them will be entitled to pensions in the years ahead.  Where is the funding for this going to come from?  I want to refer again to the situation in ACOT and AFT, whose budget has been so cruelly slashed.  How will the new farm body cope with the additional pension provision for the years ahead?  The Minister for Agriculture and Food indicated that about 1,000 redundancies in all would be sought.  Taking average figures, this would involve a pension provision of around £7.5 million a year.  Where is this annual sum going to <Col N="939" /> come from?  Already the organisation are finding it impossible to cope with their existing £20 million Exchequer provision. I have been told that the money will have run out by July this year.  Where is the money needed to pay the pensions for this year and all the years ahead going to come from?  The Minister in his speech referred to the fact that the fall in numbers will be consistent with having public service agencies operate within their budgetary allocations.  If the pensions are lumped on top of ACOT and AFT it will not just be a question of trying to force a pint into a half pint glass but trying to force two pints into a half pint glass.</P>
    <P>As in other areas of Government policy, such as PRSI for the self-employed, the full implications for the future of this approach have not been fully teased out by the Minister and Government.  There are enormous overhanging problems which, as a consequence will have to be faced by future Governments.  Generally, we are dealing with a scheme which is filled with flaws and, of course, was obviously introduced without thinking out the full implications. In the years ahead the public sector will be enormously affected as a result of this approach on the part of the Government, apart altogether from its effect on the economy.  I am thinking of the productive sectors of the economy and, in particular, the effect on agriculture of the cuts in the research and advisory service.</P>
    <P>Looking at the situation from that limited context it is very clear that the brain drain will continue and I would be interested to know if the Minister has introduced any provision to ensure that those employees who are regarded as essential will be retained in the service of the State.  What, for instance, is the position of the senior officials in the Ministers' Department who deal with money markets?  They are people of enormous skills and surely the Minister is not going to encourage them to leave his Department, encouraged by State gratuity and pensions, so that those skills will be available to, as it were, the opposition in those very markets.  This is the one example <Col N="940" /> which bears on the question of whether there are some categories of State employees who are regarded as being of such essential importance to the State that they will not be offered the scheme.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago the then Fianna Fáil Government took a leap in the dark, against all advice from the Opposition, in relation to the enormous expansion of numbers in the public service.  That policy contributed very substantially to the enormous financial difficulties facing this country.  The present Fianna Fáil Government are taking a further leap in the dark in obtaining advance payments from the Central Bank of enormous sums to provide public service early retirement payments.  I fear that the consequences of this approach will be just as disadvantageous to the country in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to say, as I said last December in the debate on the Estimate which we are now considering again, that I support the notion of reducing public service numbers and everything I say this evening is to be put in that context.  I also support public spending that is open to scrutiny and that stands up to that scrutiny.  That is why I feel there are a great number of questions that must be asked about this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister who adverted to this, and also Deputy O'Keeffe, that during the past ten years the public service grew inordinately.  That happened because services grew.  A decision was taken, albeit in a different era, to build up numbers in the public service as a method of pump-priming but for a variety of reasons that failed and we are now seeing that it failed quite dismally.  I was extremely surprised to hear Deputy O'Keeffe, who was in Government with Deputy Desmond on my right for a number of years during that period &mdash; and while he and his colleagues were in Government the national debt actually doubled &mdash; berate the present Government, the Government of ten years ago and other Governments besides his own for allowing, first, the debt to rise and, <Col N="941" /> secondly, the public service numbers to rise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The services provided and the numbers providing them greatly contributed to the debt rising.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the essence of where the Government have gone wrong. We in the Progressive Democrats have advocated from our inception that one must take control of public spending by looking at one's own house, and that includes the public sector as a whole. That is why I made the statement at the start, that I support a scheme which would reduce the numbers.</P>
      <P>However, the sum allowed in this Vote, £80 million plus £8.4 million last year, is, I submit, grossly excessive.  The Minister in his budget speech predicted and he referred to it tonight, that the public service would reduce by approximately 9,000 in number this year.  What does he then foresee as a saving for the pay bill this year?  There has not been reference to that figure at any stage.  I know to a certain extent it depends on the grades of those who retire, take career breaks or otherwise take advantage of the scheme, but I believe some costings, some projections, should be made public.</P>
      <P>For instance, if we are to measure it against the repayments to the Central Bank which the Minister has assured us are going to take place on a yearly basis between 1990 and 1993, how can we be certain that the Exchequer can fund that from savings in the pay bill until we know what the figures are?  We know, because the Minister has told us, where the money is coming from.  It is coming from the Central Bank in a roundabout way which none of us would have suspected was possible in the beginning, and we know how it is going to be repaid because he has told us that &mdash; in four equal payments, but it should be shown as part of the national debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe when he says this is obviously a debt the State has incurred, when the Government borrowed from the Central Bank.  Because they acknowledge from the beginning that the repayments of this debt are to come from a particular source, does not mean it is not a debt.  It is absolutely a debt.  May I give an example of how ludicrous it is to write that off as not part of the national debt?  It is somewhat similar to saying that if we can earmark precisely the savings envisaged which would enable us to pay the interest on any part of our foreign or domestic debt or repay the capital on that debt, we do not have to write it into the books.  That is exactly what is happening here.  This is off balance sheet financing and there are no two ways about it.</P>
    <P>I want to look at whether the scheme in itself and in its terms is over-generous or, it could be argued, simply enticing. My opinion is that it is enticing in the extreme.  I do not believe public servants need to have the kind of terms they were offered in order to leave.  The Minister said there are many public servants, as there are people in other organisations, at various stages who wish to leave of their own accord.  They do not need the over-generous terms that are on offer.</P>
    <P>I am not a proponent of compulsory redundancy in this instance.  I am very much in favour of voluntary redundancy and redundancy on terms that are suitable, but in this instance I believe they are going over the top.  For instance, a principal officer in the Civil Service, aged 51, with 33 years' service, on a salary of £26,000, can expect a lump sum of £39,000 and a pension of £250 a week, about £13,000 a year.  After tax that package is very attractive.  In fact, it is so attractive that it is no wonder we are losing managerial staff throughout the Civil Service in areas where we cannot afford it.  We will find that we are making a mistake by almost pushing them out in the numbers in which they are going.</P>
    <P>As I said, I think these terms are over-generous. There are many civil servants who themselves see that it is a mistake to have done this, there are many civil <Col N="943" /> servants who are questioning the way this scheme is being financed and there are many civil servants for whom it goes completely against the grain.  I have to ask whether this is a responsible course of action.  If the IDA or CTT or some other State body were to embark on incurring a debt of £80 million without projections or costings, with the whole thing shrouded in mystery, with a leave-it-to-us, with a belief that it will work attitude and that this loan will be repaid in time by the savings envisaged, even though we do not know what they are, you can imagine what a normal civil servant's view would be to that transaction.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a detrimental effect on the essential services being provided by the public sector to the public, not necessarily by the existence of a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme but by the lack of redeployment which followed.  I have mentioned this on a number of occasions in this House but there is still no central co-ordinating section or group to work with all the Departments and to make sure that areas are pinpointed quickly where there is staff available and staff moved into the areas where they are needed.  We have had a number of examples of that problem in the last year.</P>
    <P>In the Department of Social Welfare, one of the most heavily over-burdened Departments handling £1.6 billion this year, there is one accountant employed. The staff numbers in the social welfare services office have increased by 132 since last year, about 4 per cent against a background of 250,000 people unemployed, not to mention all the other benefits which have to be administered.  I note from a recent parliamentary question I asked that there are still 54 vacancies in that Department resulting from the restriction on promotions.  Obviously redeployment is simply not working for this Department.  Staff should be immediately deployed to the Department of Social Welfare.  We all know that.  The people in the Department of Social Welfare know it, and the Department of Finance seem to acknowledge it, but nothing <Col N="944" /> has happened.  I see no reason those vacancies should not be filled in a Department which is particularly over-burdened.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed some moves to strengthen Revenue.  We had the very strange decision with the anti-evasion unit for VAT being disbanded and the people moved into the Collector General's Office.  For the life of me I cannot see the reason behind that.  That is redeployment in a negative direction, because we have a further squeeze on those who are already in the net and are abandoning chasing those not in the net.</P>
    <P>In education we do not know how many teachers will be needed.  There is a review body sitting, yet the Department are in the process of going through the applications for early retirement.  We may find ourselves making redundancy payments and paying pensions to teachers, and in the end find that we have to hire new teachers.  At that time the cost to the Exchequer will be far more than it need be, and the planning will be shown to be very shortsighted, to say the least. The package for teachers should be suspended until the review body have reported and decided how many teachers we need.</P>
    <P>In the Department of Justice we are in danger of losing a very substantial number of principal officers, perhaps as many as one-third, thereby endangering particularly important sections of that Department.</P>
    <P>This is not to say I do not believe people should move out of the service but I believe this scheme is unplanned and unco-ordinated.  There is no proper co-ordination between the Departments. There is still no committee of secretaries of Departments meeting on a regular basis, co-ordinating the policy which the Government wish to implement, and which was envisaged in the White Paper on Public Service Reform.  This would be invaluable at the moment, but it is not in existence.</P>
    <P>Lastly I would like to refer very quickly to the effect of this scheme on public servants.  Morale in the public service is at an all-time low.  One of the reasons for <Col N="945" /> that is that the early retirement scheme was handled badly.  Civil servants see most of their colleagues leaving and promotional vacancies remaining unfilled.  I have no doubt that if those vacancies were filled it would be possible to restore morale.  It is possible to continue with the embargo and not employ people from outside but promote from within the service. There is no doubt that a slimmer service is needed and most public servants realise that that is possible but the plan must be well motivated and cohesive. The public service is losing to the private sector many people they trained in technology at huge expense.  While that is taking place there is still over-staffing in many Departments.</P>

      <P>The management of public service numbers is a complex operation and in terms of providing money it has taxed the best Ministers for Finance we have had.  In terms of managing that money the best efforts of those involved is taxed.  A change in the system requires flexibility, a lot of imagination, a great deal of tunnel vision in going ahead and implementing policies.  I regret to say that the Minister for Finance has expounded one quality, that of tunnel vision.  The other qualities are absent.  There is no management concept in this operation. There was no selectivity or inter-departmental consultation.  I understand that in the Department of Finance a decent memorandum on the subject has not been introduced, not even one that would go beyond six pages.  I do not know what is expected from the former DPS, the exception being that they are expected to supply the odd figure in the hope that they will not be asked for another one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have any objection to a rigorous control of public service numbers by way of well established methods. Natural wastage is a classical method that has been availed of for many years.  It was a masterful approach by successive Ministers for Finance and Ministers for the Public Service.  I do not have any objection to a one-in-three embargo.  I operated such an embargo for four years in the Department of Health and for <Col N="946" /> three years in the Department of Social Welfare and in that period we ran both Departments well.  I would not object if the Minister said that instead of a one-in-three embargo he was going to impose a one-in-four and may go to a one-in-five embargo.  I would not object if he said that he was going to be very rough and tough up the line but that did not happen.</P>
    <P>The background to the new scheme is very simple.  Health were faced with mandatory redundancies because there was no money for that Department. Health sent a memorandum to the Minister with mandatory redundancies written all over it and the Cabinet baulked at it and decided that they had better omit the word &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;.  Three or four Cabinet Minister were involved but meanwhile the Minister for Finance thought it was a good idea and suggested that the voluntary aspect should be applied to the whole of the public service.  About a month later the Minister for Finance got an even better idea and suggested voluntary retirement at the age of 50.  I nearly jumped out of my skin when I heard that.  I will be 53 next May but the Minister would not offer me voluntary redundancy from the Dáil with seven added years.</P>

      <P>I was not offered a lump sum payment.  However, as a result of that scheme the Minister has landed himself in an appalling mess.  He then had to decide how he would pay for that scheme bearing in mind that he could not increase the national debt, the budget deficit or the provision for public service pay and pensions.  He decided to have a word with the Governor of the Central Bank with a view to borrowing £80 million from him. The Governor, being the bright person he is and having been Secretary of the Department of Finance, warned the Minister that he would have to pay the <Col N="947" /> money back.  The Minister replied that it would be paid back between 1990 and 1993, or maybe 1995.  In telling the Governor that the money would be paid back in equal moieties the Minister coined a new phrase, &ldquo;accelerated advance surpluses of the Central Bank&rdquo;, reminiscent of the notorious phrase, &ldquo;self-financing subsidies&rdquo;, introduced by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I do not have any objection to a rigorous selective application of control of public service numbers but I would be damned if I would say to a teacher aged 51, &ldquo;there is £30,000 and a pension for life for you so that you can emigrate to the UK where you will pay 25 per cent in tax or so that you can go to live in Spain where the tax is less and enjoy yourself for the rest of your life.&rdquo;  I understand that 3,600 teachers are laughing all the way to the bank because the Minister for Finance made an eejit of himself, in that classical sense.  I understand that the number seeking early retirement is growing by the day.  Anybody would try to get out of the public service on that basis. What will this cost?  The average payment this year will be £20,000 and 9,000 public servants will have left by the end of the year.  Of that number about 4,000 will qualify for the early retirement payment. The remainder will be on career breaks or will have reached retirement age.  The Minister will have to provide £80 million for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the policy of the last Government the number of public servants was being reduced.  Without this notorious package we were reducing the number by about 5,200 annually.  The package was not necessary.  The Minister has told us in the course of his speech that repayment will be financed out of the annual savings to the Exchequer from the redundancy programme.  What savings?  How much will be saved per annum?  It should not be that difficult to give us that information. For example, we are aware that next year the Minister will have to provide an extra £7 million for public service pay, £15 million for special pay and <Col N="948" /> between £20 million and £23 million for increments.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Government are up to.  Fianna Fáil indulge in a type of zig-zig approach to this matter.  We have had a decade of zig-zagging from them.  In 1977 they could not take on public servants quick enough.</P>
    <P>When I was appointed Minister for Health in 1982 I sought information from the personnel section and I was shown letters from the late Deputy Colley congratulating the dear Minister for Health at the time, Deputy Haughey, on taking on an extra 4,000 employees for the health services.  Deputy Haughey rode on the back of that into the leadership of Fianna Fáil &mdash; he sent a letter to every applicant.  He got the name and address of every little trainee nurse and of the local Deputy and sent them letters. Eventually the matrons were saying there was not canteen space to feed the nurses or accommodation for them in nurses' homes and that there was nobody for them to look after, but that was Fianna Fáil policy.  Fianna Fáil then had the nerve to come into this House and talk to us about doubling the national debt when we came here in 1982 and from then up to 1986 battened down the hatches in an effort to bring the system under control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The national debt in the process did grow, but in the present process it is growing at another £80 million of borrowing which must be repaid. It impacts on the overall indebtedness of the State because on the non-tax revenue side it is money foregone in the years in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are more serious aspects.  The public service are demoralised.  They do not hold us politicians in much esteem at this stage and I do not blame them.  They must think that we are the greatest yahoos of all time in terms of management of the public service.  No other European country has done this.  If other European civil servants for example, in <Col N="949" /> the Scandinavian countries, were offered these terms, they would be jumping like lemmings into the North Sea.  In Dublin County Council 600 or 700 of the staff are leaving.  The very large potholes are going to grow ever bigger and it will cost four times as much to fill them in when they reach a certain dimension. Reinstatement of our roads instead of conventional maintenance is to a factor of four and the Department of Finance know that.  But the Government say these people should be let go, let retire to their public service haciendas in Benidorm, where their children will visit them in summer and where they will have a great time on their public service pensions. That is the nonsense that is going on.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education do not know whether they are coming or going. I sympathise with the Minister for Finance in this regard because while the Minister for Education never knew whether she was coming or going, the Minister for Finance, in fairness, has a fairly tough vision of what he wants. However, he made a bad mistake here. There are 3,600 educational staff wanting to leave the public service and the Minister for Education tells them that Circular 20/87 is in full operation, that she does not intend to withdraw it.  She will not come into the Dáil to say anything about it and is chuckling in the corridors because she will not have to come near the House until 19 April.  Meanwhile, the central review body are up in arms and the situation is in a shambles.</P>

      <P>There are times when I despair.  I regard the Minister for Finance as one of the most responsible people ever to have occupied that post.  He tried desperately in 1981 and only missed succeeding by a hair's breadth.  That was a terrible shame.  He came back into office and has done many excellent things, but this one is a bad and silly mistake.  The scheme should be dropped for what it is, an enormously costly hot potato of total irrelevance, and one which will not in any <Col N="950" /> way contribute to the effective management of the public service.  In the Department of Health alone, to take one example, an assistant secretary is gone, along with 16 senior officers and a principal officer and there is nobody left to manage their budget.  They now have no financial expertise.  The policy is to let them emigrate, or do what they want.</P>

      <P>It is rather difficult to know where to start in dealing with this Estimate.  As many previous speakers have pointed out, the decision seems to have been taken in panic.  There has been no planning whatsoever and this is the type of operation which before its implementation, needs intensive and very detailed planning in every section and area of the public service.  It has been rushed in to deal in a purely monetarist fashion with a problem, without seeing the dangers looming ahead.  Without some coherent economic planning strategy on the part of the Government, this could result in enormous long term economic problems for the country, apart from the effect of spending £80 million rather unnecessarily in what I have referred to as a panic measure.  It simply does not make economic sense to make public servants redundant in this blanket fashion, voluntarily or not, without dealing with the whole area of productive employment, redeployment and so on. The Minister's speech is simply unacceptable. He had a short 20 minutes in which to address the problem and skimmed through what could have been given in five minutes.  He gave us no idea of his thinking in implementing this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> In reply to a question last February, he gave a little more detail which he should have given here tonight as regards the thinking behind accepting any particular redundancy.  He listed four considerations which will be taken into account in each case, all of which are important.  If they were taken into consideration, they would result in many fewer redundancies.  The first consideration, was whether the granting of the application would reduce the strength of the cadre concerned to a non-viable level.  Some of the cadres will be destroyed completely, let alone reduced to a non-viable level.  The second consideration was whether direct net Exchequer receipts would be put in jeopardy by the granting of the application. Before even the redundancy package is implemented, the staff of the Revenue Commissioners have been reduced by 14 per cent and they are just not capable at the moment of dealing with the collection of taxes.  That aspect is not being considered at all.  The third consideration was whether public safety would be put at risk or genuine hardship caused by the granting of the application.  That was not put into effect when the firemen had to go on strike in order to maintain a safe service, not by way of any benefit to themselves but simply because redundancies in the fire service rendered the service unsafe for the people of Dublin. Safety was being put at risk and genuine hardship being caused, but that was not taken into consideration.  The fourth consideration was whether an applicant in a situation where one of the above criteria applied has specialist or technical qualifications and/or expertise for which it is not feasible to compensate by redeployment. That is the area of the over-fifties. I wonder how the Minister will apply that criterion and how many would actually be allowed to take redundancy if those proposals were put into effect when considering applications.  The Minister, in not giving us any idea of what he was about, treated us with absolute contempt. He should have given us some <Col N="952" /> detail of his thinking, planning and strategy, Department by Department.  Even in 20 minutes he could have given us some idea of the way in which he was implementing this measure.</P>
    <P>We fully support the need for a highly efficient and effective public service.  I have always maintained that in relation to State companies, particularly in relation to commercial State companies, there is a need for efficiency and cost effectiveness at all times.  We recognise that, as a result of changes in society, some areas of the Civil Service are short of staff and that there could be a surplus in others.  This is what leads to considerable scope for redeployment in the Civil Service.  There are problems but the Minister should be prepared to deal with them in order to enforce redeployment. As I said, revenue collection is one area where redeployment would be self-financing, a famous phrase used by Fianna Fáil in Opposition.  A team, later disbanded, proved to be self-financing when they collected £7 million or £8 million in a period of eight or nine months. That area does not seem to have been examined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I referred to monetarism and it is clear that the thinking of the Minister for Finance is involved in this because, when one goes through each Department, it is obvious that it was not a question of trimming them to make them more efficient, but of dismantling them.  The Minister said that 600 workers had left the health service in 1987 and we know how bad things were that year.  He said that 1,500 more are expected to go in 1988.  There was no reference to the devastating effect that the loss of 2,100 health workers would have on the level of care to the famous sick, old and handicapped about whom the Fianna Fáil Government were so concerned just over a year ago. It seemed to be a matter of deciding to cut jobs, and that is unbelievable, especially in the health service, where there is such wide scope for saving money in other areas instead of the jobs which provide the service to the people who need it.  This is all the more maddening <Col N="953" /> when there are areas in the health service crying out for reform.</P>
    <P>The cost of drugs in this country is higher than in any other country in Europe, five times dearer than in France. The health service is being ripped off by drug companies, right down to the pharmacist, but nobody is prepared to face up to this.  Our health service is totally controlled by the consultants who can hold a Minister up to ransom, as the previous Minister for Health well knows. There are areas in which millions can be saved but in chopping 2,100 jobs we are cutting a lifeline to many people who will die from lack of attention.</P>
    <P>In the teaching area, no one can give any good educational reason for dropping teachers when we already have the highest pupil-teacher ratio in Europe.  It is even far higher than Northern Ireland, the &ldquo;unfree&rdquo; part of our country.  We have a far higher pupil-teacher ratio and a far worse educational service than they provide in the North.  This was the case even before the redundancies and the Minister said that 3,600 applications have been received to date from the primary sector alone.  According to my information, many of those applications are to see how much they would get and they may not be genuine.  Perhaps the Minister is rubbing his hands with glee because so many teachers want to get out of the system but he does not seem to have thought of the destruction this will cause to our educational system and to the great number of children who will be affected. There is no question of the Minister being able to say that there is a surplus of teachers or that the system will be more efficient as a result of these losses.  There is no question of more efficiency; we will simply have to pay them less and save in that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister should remember how Waterford Glass pushed themselves to the wall by precisely the same type of thinking in regard to a redundancy package. They are now fighting for their life, they have almost destroyed themselves with their £40 million redundancy package. Only for the fact that they acquired Wedgewood, they would have gone into <Col N="954" /> liquidation.  Perhaps the Minister thought that because this was done in the commercial world it must be right.  However, Waterford Glass were wrong and they now realise it.  Furthermore, there will be less handcrafted products than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that 1,000 applications have been accepted from workers in local authorities.  Already in Dublin Corporation the redundancies of last year and the embargo over a number of years have caused an enormous strain.  The level of services has gone up but the numbers of people to provide them have gone down.  There is such enormous pressure on workers that the local government public services union have a work-to-rule operating because they are unable to deal with the enormous amount of work.  Of course, the manager is being screwed by the Minister for the Environment, and if there are further redundancies it will be impossible to provide essential services. The Minister said that essential services would not be affected but that is not the case.  Nobody thinks of essential services until something goes wrong in relation to water or sewerage.  All these areas are under enormous pressure.  We can laugh at the potholes on our roads but there will be no laughter if the sewerage or water systems break down.  The Ombudsman had the number of his staff reduced from 16 to eight.  That type of petty cut really sickens me.  Public services are being cut unnecessarily and I believe the Minister is making a major mistake economically in doing this.</P>

      <P>Reference was made to the brain drain and Deputy O'Keeffe emphasised the loss of talent to the public service through early retirement and through those leaving to take up other jobs.  Management throughout the public service were provided with guidelines which precluded the application of the scheme to those who could not be done without.  While we do not deny that many talented people have left on the early retirement scheme, it has been noticeable that the retirees have included staff of varying capacities. The complaint has sometimes been made that the public service has drawn over the years a disproportionate share of people with talent.  We do not see a scheme which allows or encourages some of that talent to migrate to other work as being in any way a loss to the community.  If that talent can be drawn out of the public service and put to use elsewhere in a manner which generates a new creation of wealth, what objection can there be?  If the scheme allows a hitherto undetected seam of entrepreneurial talent to be tapped for the benefit of the community as a whole, so much the better and everybody should agree with that.

      <P>All those who are not guilty, please put up their hands.  Deputy Mac Giolla is not guilty of anything.  Reference was also made to the Central Bank and to the arrangements which are being made.  I would like once again to emphasise and to stitch into the record the importance of this arrangement.  Under the arrangements agreed with the Central Bank for the financing of the lump sum payments arising out of the voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme, the bank will make advance payments of surplus income to the Exchequer so as to assist the Exchequer in meeting the exceptional costs of the programme.  The arrangements are in accordance with section 63 (7) of the Currency Act, 1927 which provides that the Central Bank may at any time pay into the Exchequer such sums on account of surplus income as may be agreed upon by the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the normal course the Exchequer receives from the Central Bank each year <Col N="958" /> the surplus income earned by the bank in the previous year less certain appropriations to the reserves of the bank. Under the arrangements agreed with the bank the Exchequer will receive in 1988 in addition to the normal payment of the surplus income for 1987 &mdash; the income for 1987 is estimated at £106 million &mdash; an advance payment of the surplus the Central Bank will earn in 1988.  A provision of £80 million was included in the 1988 budgetary figures under this heading. The repayments will take the form, as I have said already, of four equal annual deductions by the Central Bank from the normal payments of surplus income for the years 1990 to 1993, inclusive. There is no question of raiding the reserves of the bank in connection with the financing of the voluntary redundancy programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  The agreement with the Central Bank involves the Exchequer receiving in 1988 part of the surplus which the bank will earn in that year instead of waiting until 1989 for it.  Therefore, it has nothing to do with the reserves and it is not a debt.  The advances of surplus income by the Central Bank are from the profits of the bank and not from the reserves.  The repayments of these advances will be made from the savings arising from the voluntary redundancy scheme.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley, Deputy Desmond and others are saying that the voluntary retirement terms are too generous and that there are signs that the voluntary package operating in the public service is costing far too much. The example quoted was a Civil Service principal aged 51 with 33 years service on £26,000 who would get a gratuity of £39,000 and a pension of £13,000 per year, which after tax was very attractive to those with talent who would get alternative employment.  The two points that Deputy Colley and other did not mention was that under the existing pensions code the same officer could leave with a guarantee of a frozen pension and lump sum based on his or her 33 years service which would become payable on his or her 60th birthday.  The extra cost to the State consists of the cost of paying the lump sum earlier than would normally arise and the cost of pension for seven extra years.  These costs are offset by the fact that taking the public service as a whole, staff accepting the early retirement package are not being replaced.  We have a pension cost instead of a salary cost so that the pay back period is of the order of 3½ years.  Deputies said we made a bad mistake and there was no planning but the opposite is the case.  This is a very good scheme.  It is very popular and it is well worthwhile and very much in the long-term interests of the Exchequer and the taxpayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the chair for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the conditions in Moylough national school which is near Tubbercurry in south Sligo. As the Chair is aware, it is not my practice, except by way of parliamentary question, to raise essentially local issues in the Dáil.  I raised the question of Moylough national school because the conditions there amount to a national issue. The conditions are a national disgrace and a national scandal.</P>
      <P>The name of Moylough is famous nationally.  This is where the Moylough Belt Shrine, which is one of the great treasures in our National Museum was found.  I am afraid that the name of Moylough is now likely to become infamous because of the desperate condition of the school there.  This could very well be referred to as something of an ancient shrine or monument itself except that it is not as well preserved as was the Moylough Belt Shrine even though that was in the bog for centuries.  I know the difficulties the Minister of State has in this respect.  I know of the parsimonious allowance he was given by the Minister for Finance to provide for the building of schools at any level.  Now, all over the west of Ireland the building of schools has practically ceased and schools are so rare on the ground that the sight of a new school being erected is likely to become a tourist attraction in the years ahead. However, even with the lack of money, Moylough is an exceptional case and the Minister for Finance who comes from the same constituency knows all about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three main problems.  The first problem relates to the rats, a total plague of rats.  There are about 90 pupils present during the school hours but if there was a roll call of the rats there after school hours they would far outnumber <Col N="962" /> the pupils.  The reason for this is the nature of the building.  It is a building 100 years old and unfortunately it is a playground for rats.  There is a soft timber floor and no sub-floor and there is the old style of wainscotting which means that there are vast spaces which constitute a playground for the rats.  They frolic in these spaces during school hours and come out after school hours.  I do not know if rats as a community go in for community centres, but if they do, it is certain that Moylough national school is the swinging centre for them in south Sligo.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to exaggerate how bad the problem is.  The rats have now become extremely bold and every day there is a competition as to who gets the lunch, the pupil who brought it in or the rat.  The teacher is not immune to the attacks and despite the protection of his desk he has lost his lunch to the rats on occasion.  The children cannot leave their schoolbags in one classroom while they move off to another otherwise their bags will be attacked.  I have seen the attacks that have been made on the plastic protection around their lunches.  I was very surprised to see that the rats in Moylough national school have a particular liking for soap although I do not know if they, have it for starters or for dessert.  I have also seen the result of their activities in chewing their way through a three inch door during the Christmas holidays when the school was empty and through a television cable which was in their way.</P>
    <P>Deputies might well ask, why they have not been exterminated and why some action has not been taken.  The teachers, parents and local people have tried every known means to get at them but without success.  They have tried traditional local methods and newer scientific methods with no result so far.  Indeed, the plague of rats is on the increase.  It is probably because of the nature of the ground underneath where they have free movement from perhaps a quarter of a mile away through the tunnels they have there now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> The second big problem with Moylough national school is a structural problem. The roof is leaking all over the place.  The first thing that meets any visitor going in there and meets the pupils and teachers in the morning is a plastic bucket strategically placed to catch the rain.  It is not a very pleasant sight to see in this day and age in a national school.  No window in the entire school, either in the older part of the building which is about 100 years old or in the part built ten or 15 years ago, is capable of being opened. You can easily see the difficulties that creates especially during the summer.</P>
    <P>The third difficulty is in regard to the toilets which are built in a block outside separate from the school in a particularly exposed area.  In frost of any sort virtually the toilet blocks are frozen over and cannot be used by pupils or teachers. Fortunately, this winter was exceptionally mild and, as a result, no great difficulty was created in that respect.  On the other hand, in a particularly wet winter such as we have had when the rain is falling the pupils have to wear wellingtons in order to get to the toilets. That is another difficulty.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise to the Minister of State that this is not a question of repairs.  It has been suggested that some essential repairs be done to tide things over until perhaps a new school could be built but this would be a total waste of money as the school is in such a bad condition.  As it is over 100 years old it is beyond the period when repairs should be considered.  That would be very foolish. Even in these times of tight finances it would be a false economy.</P>
    <P>The people around Moylough are not a community given to agitation.  They are willing to accept hardship and have been extraordinarily patient but they were finally driven to action.  When they were driven to it they organised a very good campaign for representation to public representatives and otherwise but they were driven to it because they feared for the health of their sons and daughters, because of their natural anxiety for their <Col N="964" /> welfare so that they could go through primary school in a relatively satisfactory manner.  They were not looking for any sort of luxuries, just for basic requirements. They did not simply wait around as many communities might do for the Government to get them out of the difficulty. They collected a large sum of money for a small community and all the people gave very generously.  Of course, they knew the exact situation there and they were quite willing to put their hands in their pockets and produce the necessary sum.</P>
    <P>This is not an area of wealthy people by any means, though it has produced some very wealthy people but mainly they had to go abroad and emigrate to become wealthy in the first place.  One of them went to this school and to whom I am glad to pay tribute was the late Matt Gallagher who gave the magnificent gift of the RHA Gallagher Gallery to this city of Dublin which will be opened now for the Millennium Year.  It is one of the greatest gifts ever bestowed on the city.</P>
    <P>The local people in their anxiety to get something done got the local builders, of whom there are a number in the area, to tackle the job at a greatly reduced cost, if the type of machinery required could be introduced for that.  I understand there are difficulties in that regard but this indicates the great independent spirit of these people and their self-reliance which I suppose was born of the difficult circumstances in that area and in my native area of Aclare which is not very far away from there.  Throughout the entire area of south Sligo are an independent proud people who are willing to do their share as far as their needs are concerned.</P>
    <P>Another thing that should go on record here is that despite the awful conditions I am talking about, and no one will try to ignore them or pretend they are not awful, this has been an extremely successful school in all ways.  The primary school has a very dedicated teaching staff under Brian Cahill and in its purpose as a centre of learning and teaching for the pupils who come there it has been very successful and able to compete in any type of examinations or otherwise with <Col N="965" /> any other area throughout the country or in the west.  It has been very successful at sports.  In recent times the school won the Patrick Brennan Cup which is very much sought after among the schools of the area.  It is called after a former master of Moylough school, Patrick Brennan, who became a legendary figure in GAA circles in Sligo.  In his later years he was totally blind but he had such dedication to football that he continued to go Sunday after Sunday to all sorts of football matches, be they parish matches.  championship matches or inter-county matches, always accompanied by a friend who acted as a reader of the match.  He was one of the principals in the school and the school is living up to the great tradition he set as far as games of all sorts are concerned.</P>
    <P>The school is one of the best in the county for music thanks to the dedicated staff there.  On St. Patrick's Day just gone by a marching band from Moylough school aged from four years to about 14 years marched proudly down Fifth Avenue in New York as special guests in the St. Patrick's Day parade there.  Of course, this was a tremendous thrill for the children to be part of what is by any standards one of the great ceremonial parades anywhere in the world.  It was a glamorous day for Moylough parish and will go down in the history of the parish for all time.  It was one of the historic days for the parish.  The other such day in more distant times was when in 1945 the Moylough Belt Shrine was found in a bog near the school and became one of our great treasures.  This year it will form part of a major Irish exhibition in Australia for the Bicentennial.  The pupils in the band are now coming back and a great treat for the parents who were so proud of their children marching in that parade, many of whom went to the States with them, would be a simple announcement from the Minister of State tonight that he was willing to tackle the question of a new school for Moylough in the immediate future.  That would be appreciated far more &mdash; though it is hard to believe &mdash; than the great honour of marching down <Col N="966" /> Fifth Avenue for a young marching band is this ceremonial parade.</P>
    <P>No argument at all can be made against the need for a new school in Moylough. There is an argument as far as finances are concerned but I know the Minister of State and the Minister got an extra £6 million &mdash; perhaps that had to be shared between primary and second level &mdash; but certain conditions were attached to that. I have read those conditions with great care and I believe Moylough national school would fit totally into every one of them.  The Minister of State should seek to put some of the money into Moylough national school.  If he cannot get it, if that money is already gone &mdash; I know the demands that exist all over the country for schools and they can put forward great needs &mdash; he should appeal or ask the Minister for Education to appeal to the Minister for Finance.  He comes from the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim and knows of this school and I am sure he could not resist a plea if it came from the Minister for Education to do something about Moylough national school.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is the area that gave our National Museum here beside us in Kildare Street the Moylough Belt Shrine, one of the great treasures there at the moment.  The area is willing to do its share in providing the money necessary from subscriptions from the local community. Although I know the Department of Education have reservations about the machinery and I do not know if it would be the best idea, the local community are most conscious of the need to take exceptional steps in order to get a school fit for teaching in this day and age.  The Moylough national school, as we know it, is not a fit place for the teaching of pupils.  But teaching is going on there with great success despite the hardships and difficulties.  The people are now asking that they be given a new school to which they believe they are entitled.  They are not a people given to agitation.  They only got involved in seeking the school through public representation and letter writing of one sort or another out of sheer desperation.  I am sure the Minister of State has got some <Col N="967" /> of these from the parents.  I hope the Minister will have good news for me now with the announcement of an early start to Moylough national school.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for giving me those three minutes.  I know Moylough school very well.  Listening to Deputy Nealon one would think there had been no such problem there in the last four or five years but the problem has existed for a number of years.  I was in Moylough school the week before the Moylough band left to travel to America and they were presented with the county council flag to display on their march on Fifth Avenue.  I know all about this school and the recommendation from the Department of Education was that the best thing to do was to build a new school rather than spend any money repairing the old one.  I fully agree with that.  Money would be well spent on building a new school at Moylough.  I hope the Minister will try to find the necessary finance.  I am sure that before too many months or years pass we will have a new school in Moylough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke to Deputy Nealon about this some years ago and he was making arrangements at the time for the Moylough belt to be put on display in the school when it was built.  We are well <Col N="968" /> aware of the school now because we have been hearing of the rat infestation there. Money can be saved on building schools. In Tubbercurry a new extension was built by a local contractor.  In Moylough the people are willing to get a local contractor who could build the school at a much reduced price.  The recommended price in 1974 was £200,000 but I believe a local contractor could build it for much less and that is where we can save money in education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>We were all very proud of the Moylough band and their performance on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to thank Deputies Nealon and Brennan for the very eloquent case they made in regard to Moylough School. However, I would have to take Deputy Nealon to task on the insinuation that the present Minister for Finance is holding up this very important project.  It is a little sad that because he is a Deputy for the constituency the insinuation should be made that because of the financial cutbacks it is the Minister for Finance who is holding up this project.  I want to set <Col N="969" /> the record straight.  The present proposal for a new school dates back to 1983 when a site was offered by the school authorities and found to be acceptable.  The Office of Public Works initiated the architectural planning and the project has now reached a stage where tender documents have been prepared.  In fact it took five years to do an amount of work which could have been done in six months.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the situation in Moylough is indeed very bad I would have to say that during that five year period no action was taken.  It is a bit unfair for Deputy Nealon to come in here tonight and insinuate, as he does, that there has been no progress in regard to this school and that the Minister for Finance is holding up progress when in fact five years have elapsed &mdash; there were rats during this five year period in this school &mdash; and absolutely no progress was made. That is a reflection on Deputy Nealon and should be written into the record.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister and I took over in the Department we have been very concerned about the lack of progress in a whole range of schools throughout the country and we have attempted to tackle that problem and tackle it against a background where our budgets have been cut this year from £30 million to £15 million and where we have been given an extra £2 million in the budget for a number of primary schools such as this one which are in diabolical condition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>So that is how you tackle the programme.  Halve the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party is in full agreement with our party on the need to solve the financial problems of this country first.  What we have succeeded in doing is in making quite significant progress by reducing by half the cost of primary schools from what it was during the period of the last Government when we were literally building &ldquo;Rolls Royce&rdquo; schools in a very small number of locations throughout the country while at the same time allowing the list to grow longer and longer.  One of the first things I did when I came into the Department <Col N="970" /> was to ask for an indication of the length of time it would take to clear the bad projects in this country if we were to continue at the pace of the two years before my appointment.  I was told it would take eight years to deal with the Moyloughs of this country under that system.  I am glad to say that despite the financial cutbacks we have been able to reduce substantially the cost of school buildings and that, therefore, we will be able to make some progress in regard to schools such as this.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the situation in Moylough.  This school's position has been brought to my attention by Deputy Brennan and in particular by the Minister for Finance.  In fact he has called me to his office to find out what progress can be made.  As a result of the personal interest of the Minister for Finance, I have asked senior officials from the Department to visit this school and to report back to me on what improvements or otherwise can be carried out in the immediate term.</P>

I can, however, assure both Deputy Nealon and Deputy Brennan of my interest in having an improvement in conditions effected at Moylough national school and in the light of the comments which both Deputies have made here tonight I am asking that the report be expedited.  I will arrange to advise both Deputies on the developments.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, Deputy Nealon had this problem on his desk, as Minister for the constituency, from 1983 to 1987.  Deputy MacSharry, as Minister for the constituency for some months, now has the matter on his desk and we will only have to wait and see who can make progress with this project, on which we all want to see progress made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 21, 22 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>I have made clear in the Dáil and Seanad on a number of occasions since the outbreak of the present disturbances the Government's deep concern at events in the occupied territories and the importance which we attach to matters affecting the rights of the population of those territories. I have said that I share the widespread sense of outrage at the harsh methods of riot control employed by the Israeli security forces which are marked by excessive violence and acts of brutality against individuals.  Our concern has been conveyed to the Israeli authorities in the course of a number of bilateral contacts in Dublin and Tel Aviv since the beginning of the present unrest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition in the framework of European Political Co-operation the Twelve have conveyed to the Israeli authorities our shared concern for the population of the occupied territories.  On two occasions since the outbreak of the <Col N="809" /> present violence, on 18 December and again on 12 January the Presidency's Ambassador in Tel Aviv has expressed to the Israeli authorities the views of the Twelve at the rapidly and seriously deteriorating situation and urgently called on the Israeli authorites to ensure the immediate protection of the inhabitants of the area.</P>
    <P>At a meeting in Bonn on 8 February the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve had a thorough discussion of the situation. The declaration which they adopted expressed their profound concern at conditions in the occupied territories and their conviction that the <i>status quo</i> in the territories was not sustainable.  They deeply deplored the repressive measures taken by Israel which are in violation of international law and human rights and called for the cessation of such measures. A copy of the declaration has been deposited in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>The response of the Israeli Government to these <i>Démarches</i> has been cast in terms of the security preoccupations of the State of Israel.</P>
    <P>The position taken by Ireland on four resolutions dealing with human rights violations in the occupied territories which arose at this year's session of the UN Human Rights Commission was consistent with our long standing policy of concern for the human rights of the Palestinian population.</P>
    <P>The texts of the four resolutions, copies of which I have placed in the Dáil Library, are complex and lengthy.  They deal in considerable detail with the situation in the occupied territories. However, they also refer to and reaffirm a range of resolutions adopted by the UN and other international fora to which Ireland and other western members of the UN Human Rights Commission have not subscribed.  The resolutions also endorse other positions to which we could not assent and they condemn Israeli practices in terms which we and other western delegations consider polemical to an unnecessary and unhelpful degree.</P>
    <P>The Irish delegation therefore, in abstaining chose a course of action which reflected our deep concern for the human <Col N="810" /> rights of the population of the occupied territories while, at the same time, marking our inability to assent to all of the elements set out in the resolutions.  This was made clear in the explanation we made of our vote.</P>
    <P>In taking this position, we went further in marking our concern for the human rights of Palestinians than did most other western delegations.  Most of the western members of the 43 member Commission voted against the first of the four resolutions. The eight negative votes were cast by Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, UK, FRG, Norway and the US.  We, for our part, decided to abstain as the most effective and appropriate way of representing Ireland's position.  In this we were joined by Spain, Costa Rica and Japan. No western member of the Commission was among the 31 delegations voting in favour of the resolution.  In the case of the second resolution, which deals with the applicability to the territories of the 1949 Geneva Convention on the treatment of civilian persons in time of war the US voted against and Ireland together with the remaining members of the western group of delegations abstained.  A similar voting pattern applied to the third resolution which deals with violations of human rights in the Israeli occupied Syrian territory of the Golan Heights.  In the case of the fourth resolution four negative votes were cast (UK, US, FRG and Norway) while eight others, including Ireland and the rest of the western members of the Commission, abstained.</P>
    <P>Our approach to all four resolutions reflected accurately and effectively the widespread public concern at recent events and our long-standing position of sensitivity to and understanding for the Palestinian population of the territories. Moreover, our approach was guided by our belief that the only solution lies in the context of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region which guarantees the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and all that that implies and which also guarantees the existence and security of the state of Israel.</P>
    <P>In consultation with our partners in the <Col N="811" /> Twelve, we are continuing to monitor closely developments in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem and will continue to avail ourselves of all appropriate opportunities to make clear to the Israeli authorities our concern for the population of the occupied territories.</P>

      <P>There is understandable disquiet in the United States about the series of recent incidents affecting Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations.  The deep concern of the Friends of Ireland in Congress was evident in their St. Patrick's Day statement.

      <P>The Government, through the embassy and our consulates in the United States as well as through ministerial visits, maintain close contact with the Administration, Congress and responsible Irish American organisations in regard to the situation in Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations generally.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the programme of action of the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement.  It contains a large number of proposals for taking further measures which could conceivably be adopted in order to apply pressure on South Africa for peaceful change.  The Government consider that the most promising of these is promotion of a Community wide ban on imports of South <Col N="816" /> African coal and of South African fruit and vegetables.  This is why we continue to press among the Twelve for these measures.  As far as the measures mentioned by the Deputy are concerned, a cessation on exports of oil to South Africa was one of the measures agreed on by the Twelve member states of the European Community in September 1985.  Exports of computers and electronic equipment from Ireland are controlled with the aim of ensuring that they are not for use by the South African security forces.  This is done by requiring Irish exporters to seek assurances to that effect from the South African purchasers before an export licence is issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I would add that such a limitation on the supply of sensitive equipment to South Africa was among the measures agreed on by the Twelve in September 1985.</P>
      <P>South African goods enjoy no preferences in trade with the Community, being treated in exactly the same way as exports from any other GATT signatory. The Government do not consider that advocacy by Ireland of expulsion of the South African Ambassador to the European Community would be an appropriate step to take at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed Dáil Éireann on 8 December 1987 Ireland believes that the Heng Samrin regime cannot legitimately claim to represent the Kampuchean people because it was installed by military intervention by an outside power.  This view is shared by our partners in the European Community.  On the other hand Ireland does not recognise the Democratic Kampuchea coalition since this includes the Khmer Rouge faction, whose appalling record prevents its recognition by this country as representing the Kampuchean people.</P>
      <P>The presence of in excess of a quarter of a million Kampuchean refugees in Thailand places a heavy burden on that country.  The European Community continues to support the programmes coordinated by the United Nations Border Relief Operation which is aimed at easing the lot of these refugees.</P>
      <P>The Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea has now lasted for almost a decade in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the fundamental principles of international law.  In these circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to initiate action within the Community to provide reconstruction and development aid to Vietnam or to a Kampuchea which is so occupied.  It should, however, be noted that, although official European Community assistance is not provided to the Vietnamese Government or to the Heng Samrin regime, the Community continues to provide various forms of humanitarian and emergency assistance to the people of Kampuchea and Vietnam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland remains convinced that the <Col N="819" /> basis for a just and lasting solution to the conflict in Kampuchea is contained in the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea which calls for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the exercise by the Kampuchean people of their right to determine their own future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply of 8 December the activities of honorary consuls and honorary consuls general are mainly concerned with the provision of consular advice and assistance to Irish citizens resident in or visiting their consular areas and with the provision of visas to intending visitors to Ireland, when such visas are required.</P>
      <P>Where possible our honorary consuls assist in the promotion of foreign earnings including those from tourism.  My Department, in co-operation with Bord Fáilte, ensures that they are provided with up to date tourist literature and that any queries on tourism they may refer to Dublin are answered promptly.</P>
      <P>I think I should add, since it may not be widely appreciated, that these are solely honorary appointments and that apart from a purely nominal stipend honorary consuls are in receipt of no remuneration from the State.  Notwithstanding this they provide a service for our citizens overseas, and many shoulder an onerous task on our behalf.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware a ban on coal was one of the package of measures looked at by Heads of Government at the Hague Summit in 1986 but it subsequently proved impossible to achieve consensus among the Twelve on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Conference in Hamburg on 29 February and 1 March in which I participated was the fourth in a series and part of a process of closer political dialogue and economic co-operation between the member states of the European Community and the states of Central America and particularly the Contadora Group which has been underway since 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> The purpose of this dialogue and co-operation is to assist the Central American States in overcoming the serious problems of the region.  A very good and constructive atmosphere prevailed at the Hamburg Conference, as is reflected in the political statement and economic communique which were adopted.  In their political statement the participants confirmed their support for the efforts of the Central American States to put into effect the Guatemala Agreement of last August, including the establishment of a Central American Parliament.</P>
    <P>The major focus of the economic and development side of the agenda was the immediate plan of action prepared by the Central American countries to deal with the region's most pressing development needs.  The plan is divided into two parts &mdash; the first part being an emergency plan concentrating on food aid, the creation of a fund for the economic reactivation of Central America, energy security, external debt and assistance to refugees and displaced persons.  The other part proposes a multi-annual economic reactivation plan and provides for a series of measures, particularly in the areas of intra-regional trade, the promotion of extra-regional exports, the development of the industrial, agricultural, forestry, fisheries and tourist sectors.</P>
    <P>The Community welcomed the fact that the countries of Central America had submitted the immediate plan of action and stated its readiness to co-operate in its implementation.  As the plan forms part of a wider plan for Central America agreed by the UN General Assembly and currently being negotiated in that context, the Community will need to co-ordinate its response with other countries and international organisations which are taking part in the effort.  For this reason it was not possible to finalise a specific package of Community measures at the Hamburg meeting.  However, the Community made clear its willingness to respond to a number of aspects of the emergency plan, especially the provision of food aid and special emergency aid to those Central American countries which have particular food security problems. <Col N="822" /> The Community also indicated its readiness to increase aid to assist the voluntary repatriation of refugees and resettlement of displaced persons and the two sides agreed the criteria that would be applied to such assistance.  The Community also declared its willingness, in close co-operation with the European Parliament, to make a specific contribution to the practical and technical organisation of the proposed elections to a Central American Parliament.</P>
    <P>As regards that part of the question relating to food aid from Ireland in the form of dried milk, I refer the Deputy to my reply to questions covering this general issue on 16 February last, when I pointed out that the subject of Irish food aid was the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy in the first instance to my reply of 16 February 1988 to Question No. 24 on this matter.</P>
      <P>The person in question, who was detained briefly by the US immigration authorities in January 1988 for working in breach of her visa regulations, was fully briefed by the attorney she engaged and by the Consulate General at New York on all the options open to her in the circumstances.  The person choose to remain on in the US for a formal hearing before an immigration judge.  When this took place on 4 March she was given the option of &ldquo;voluntary departure&rdquo; by 11 April 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain that &ldquo;voluntary departure&rdquo; is a form of waiver of formal deportation, granted at the discretion of the immigration authorities and is not granted in all cases.  Voluntary departure should not form a permanent bar to her <Col N="823" /> return to the US should she ever apply for a proper US immigrant visa.  It would seem most advisable that the person should avail of this opportunity to leave the US without having a permanent mark on the record.  Failure to depart by the specified date could expose the person to arrest and detention followed by formal deportation.  The latter would form a permanent barrier to her returning to the US under any circumstances.</P>

      <P>Decisions to entitlement to benefit are given by statutorily appointed deciding officers and are made under specific provisions of Social Welfare Acts or regulations.

This is primarily done to assure the cliamant that the decision is not a purely discretionary one but has a proper legal basis and to enable the claimant to formulate a proper appeal should she or he wish to do so.  It is acknowledged that references to legislation in this context should be as helpful as possible to the individual applicant.

These new forms will explain more clearly how decisions have been arrived at and take into account the points raised by the Deputy.  With the exception of unemployment payments all the main payment schemes are now computerised. The computerisation of unemployment payments is being developed as rapidly as resources allow.  All Dublin employment exchanges now have computerised payments and this is being extended to exchanges outside Dublin on a phased basis.  As part of this project and to provide a sound basis for one-stop-shop arrangements, a nationwide network connecting local offices to the central computers in Dublin is being developed.  This network will enable members of the public to obtain detailed information on any type of claim locally and will reduce the need to communicate with headquarters sections in Dublin.

    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1 March 1988 the contribution year governing her claim changed to the <Col N="830" /> 1986-87 year.  Because of an administrative error the Department's record only showed 46 credited contributions for 1986-87 which entitled her to payment at a reduced rate.  However, a further five unemployment credits have now been added to her record which qualifies her for benefit at the maximum rate.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance intermittently since 1982.  He last claimed unemployment assistance on 10 September 1987 and was in receipt of payment up to 7 November 1987, apart from a period in the beginning of November 1987, when he indicated he was employed.</P>
      <P>He signed off the unemployed register for one day each week from 7 November 1987 to 1 March 1988.  Following a review of his claim a deciding officer disallowed his claim on the grounds that he was not unemployed.  Evidence available to the Department indicated that the person concerned was employed with a firm of accountants.  He appealed against the disallowance on 12 March 1988 and arrangements are being made to have his case submitted to an appeals officer for determination.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment that the reason physical education is not included in any of the three <Col N="849" /> phases of the council's proposed work plan is that the plan relates to the specific task of putting in place a unified system of assessment and certification to replace the existing day vocational (group) and intermediate certificate examinations.  At this stage, therefore, the plan deals only with those subjects which are currently examined as part of the public examination system.</P>
      <P>The council are considering the broader curricular issues of physical education in the school curriculum.  An initial exploratory meeting with interested parties is scheduled by the council for later this month.</P>
