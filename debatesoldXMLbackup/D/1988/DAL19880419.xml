      <P>I take it that it is not part of the Taoiseach's democratic and political philosophy to announce to the House the details of the programme, if he has one, which he hopes to implement in the coming session.  Do I take it that it is not part of the Taoiseach's philosophy to give Members of this House the opportunity of debating the legislative programme?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in my philosophy.  We have given the Whips a list outlining the situation with regard to current legislation and they can discuss what will be in the programme. In other words, we will take the views of the Opposition parties into account in deciding what should be enacted between now and the summer recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the House should have the opportunity of raising this issue with the Taoiseach and be given a full and comprehensive reply.  May I raise one issue about which I have a particular concern, that is, the ACOT-AFT merger Bill?  Can I take it that sufficient parliamentary time will be allocated during the coming session to ensure that the Bill can be fully debated and passed by the Oireachtas before the summer recess&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect the Taoiseach to have answers about all the Bills which might be in the programme, but would he consider asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce to expedite the Companies Bill, published in 1986, which has been in the Seanad almost all that time?  I acknowledge that the Taoiseach does not have complete control over the Seanad Order Paper, but would he try to have that Bill brought before the Dáil before the summer recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be very desirable.  The Seanad are at section 90, and there are 189 sections.  I have been in touch with the Seanad people a number of times to have it expedited and I will continue my efforts in this regard.</P>

      <P>When these negotiations between the Whips are taking place, will the Taoiseach be mindful of the fact that The Workers' Party are not privy to those negotiations?  Will he give an indication to the House that we will not have a collision of programmes as we have at the moment where we have a Private Members' Bill dealing with one aspect of intoxicating liquor and the Government colliding head-on with their Bill, leaving the House in some disarray. It would be better if the negotiations between the Whips could bring order to the alliance which exists between the Opposition so-called and the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not be aware of it, but it has happened from time to time here &mdash; and it is not a bad practice &mdash; that Opposition parties bring forward proposals for legislation which are very often subsumed into legislation by the Government.  As I said, this has happened from time to time and I do not see any objection to it.</P>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the plans, if any, the Government have to ensure that Ireland achieves the maximum benefit from the new structural funds for under-developed regions agreed at the most recent Brussels Summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the Government is to ensure that the framework regulation on reform of the structural funds, which is to be adopted by 31 May 1988 will bring the maximum possible benefit to Ireland. The regulation will reflect the undertakings secured at the last European Council in Brussels that a special effort should be made, through the funds, to help the least-prosperous regions, and that Ireland should qualify under this principle.</P>
      <P>An important feature of the Commission's proposals is that assistance from the structural funds should from now on be predominantly to support programmes as compared to the largely project-by-project approach up to now. The intention of the Government to move towards this programme approach, beginning with an initial set of programmes for certain areas or regions but gradually extending to embrace the entire State, was announced in October last.  More recently, there was an announcement of a decision by the Government, in fulfilment of an undertaking in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, to implement an integrated programme for rural development in selected pilot areas.  These decisions ensure that we will be properly geared and organised to take maximum advantage of the additional resources and of the new arrangements under the structural funds, once these are adopted by the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> I should add that, in view of the importance of the measures to meet the requirements of the internal market and the parallel deployment of our increased receipts from the structural funds, the Irish position is being closely co-ordinated, ministerially, within the framework of the structures for that purpose established by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the role, if any, of local authorities in the matter?  Will she indicate if there is any intention on the part of the Government to introduce a function for regional authorities?  Will she indicate, in so far as the existence of geographic integrated programmes is concerned, whether every part of the country will be covered by an integrated programme or whether particular geographic areas will be favoured by being included and others not by not being included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset the Commission's proposals will mean that each member state which has a least developed region within its ambit &mdash; that includes the whole of Ireland &mdash; must produce a regional development plan. We have to prepare such a plan for the State as a whole.  Under that umbrella there will be operational programmes comprising some national and regionally based programmes for specific geographic areas.  We have organised and announced three of those already, one for Dublin, one for the west and another for the greater Cork area.  It is not envisaged that separate regional authorities will be set up by the Government and the role of local authorities has already been defined in the three areas selected for operational programmes under the structural funds.  Represented on the steering management committee for the Dublin programme will be the Dublin city and county manager.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to seek an assurance from the Minister that those parts of the country which are not included in one of the three selected areas for integrated programmes, Dublin, the <Col N="1174" /> greater Cork area and the west, will not lose any money by virtue of the fact that the Government have not chosen so far to present integrated programmes covering, for instance, the rest of Leinster, the rest of Connacht-Ulster, or the rest of Munster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When I announced the decision, on behalf of the Government in October last, to change from a project-by-project approach for part of the country to a programme approach I said that decision did not mean that funds would be transferred from areas which were not included in a programme area to areas which were.  I also said that the three areas announced represented a first step and that the intention was that the entire State would be covered by a programme approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that what we are talking about is extra funds and not the transfer of existing funds will the Minister go so far as to say that not only will no funds be transferred from the areas already benefiting to those which have been chosen but that the areas not chosen will get an equivalent amount, proportionately, of the extra funds to the areas which have been chosen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister in due course quantify the amount of extra money she expects to flow to those who have been chosen and to those who have not been chosen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement to the Dáil after the Brussels Summit the Taoiseach said that the decisions on the structural funds would mean a substantial increase, running to hundreds of millions of pounds, for this country.  It is not possible to quantify the amount until such time as the framework regulation has been set in place and adopted by the Council.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate why an integrated regional plan for the south eastern area has not been submitted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that question when I said it was decided that three areas should be chosen for the three programmes.  We have not had a programme approach here before and the Government would have been illadvised to have transferred the whole country from a project-by-project approach to a programme approach and dividing the country into regions.  We can learn from the first three programmes and it is the intention to cover the State by a programme approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>What criterion was used to exclude the south eastern region from the submission?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no criterion used to exclude any area.  The Government made a decision to select certain areas.  That decision does not mean that the areas not included in a programme will suffer or will be disadvantaged in any way.  I announced that in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Community have taken a very jaundiced view of that response?  Will the Minister indicate whether the Community are equally concerned that the proposed increase in the social fund will be aggregated in total into the Exchequer at national level rather than, as happens now, being dispersed into the regions concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the House, the draft framework regulation is under discussion by a Council working group and it will go from there to COREPER and, finally, to the Council. There will not be a decision on this until the end of May.  I am pleased to say that <Col N="1176" /> the German Presidency is pushing ahead to meet the target of the end of May.  I should like to tell the House, in response to the Deputy's previous supplementary that we are the first member state to have initiated an integrated rural development programme and to have selected pilot areas for inclusion under a rural development programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister for Communications has finished his intervention I should like to ask the Minister of State about the approach of the Government to the administration and management of programmes, in particular the integrated rural development programmes.  Is the approach to be one that is centrally controlled or will the Minister accept, as I do, that fundamental to an approach to regional development is the need to have the administration and management of such programmes within the regions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the operation of the programmes, two of which are outside Dublin, it is the Government's intention to ensure that there will be proper regional representation on the steering committees for those two areas.  For example, local authority executives will be included with local private sector interests.  The <Col N="1177" /> Department of Industry and Commerce will be one of the co-ordinating members of the steering committee for Dublin. It is envisaged that in the regions the regional manager of the IDA will be the representative rather than a representative from the central Department in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice his views on whether it is necessary to review and amend the law in relation to charities in Ireland; and if he will indicate his proposals in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>My responsibility in relation to charities is confined to three areas: (a) the Charities Acts, 1961 and 1973, which provide for the jurisdiction and powers of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests in relation to charitable trusts; (b) the Street and House to House Collections Act, 1962, which provides for the <Col N="1178" /> issue of Garda permits to take up collections in specified areas and, (c) the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956, sections 27 and 28 of which provide for the issue of Garda permits and court licences, respectively, to hold lotteries. Only lotteries held under court licence (section 28) are required to be for a charitable or philanthropic purpose.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, I could not undertake, in response to a parliamentary question, to indicate what my views were in relation to the amendment of the law in particular areas.  Proposals in this regard are announced in the ordinary way following Government approval only. However, I can say that I have no proposals at present in relation to the areas of law covering charities for which I have responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>To put the Minister's mind at rest I should point out that I am directing my question to him on the basis that originally when I raised this matter with the Taoiseach in June last he refused to deal with it and transferred it to the competent hands of the Minister.  Would the Minister accept that the charity business, if one might describe it as such, is very large indeed &mdash; quoted to be of the order of £100 million?  Would the Minister accept that because of problems obtaining in that area, with no statutory definition of what constitutes a charity or any system of registration such as obtains in other countries, there is cause for concern, in particular about the activities of professional fund raisers and that, in those circumstances, action is necessary? Furthermore, will he accept that this is particularly worrying for the genuine people involved in the charity area who rely on public trust and confidence and who have raised these various concerns and that action is necessary to respond to those concerns?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I outlined in my reply my responsibilities in this area.  The Deputy is also aware of the fact that there are a number of other Government Departments with <Col N="1179" /> a significant involvement in the area of charities.  For example, some healthrelated charities are grant-aided by the Department of Health.  The Department of Finance are responsible for taxes and legislation in respect of charities.  The Department of Foreign Affairs would have to be consulted in relation to charities providing aid to the Third World. The Department of Social Welfare are responsible for inter-action with St. Vincent de Paul-type groups.  I mention that for the information of the Deputy and in order to allow him appreciate my responsibility in this area.  Of course I am aware of the position obtaining.  I am aware that there was a television programme presented recently that caused certain disquiet in this area.  I am also aware of proposals that were submitted by GORTA in April 1987 with regard to specific changes they have asked be considered.  I am aware also of the Deputy's efforts, when in Government, to give this matter attention.  I am aware, for example, of his proposals for an inter-departmental committee &mdash; I think it was back in 1986 &mdash; which he tried to get under way.  I readily understand the reasons such committee did not get off the ground.  Because I am concerned I am examining a number of areas at present.  When I am in a position to bring proposals to Government I will do so and shall make an announcement in due course.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister accepts and agrees with my submission to the last Government of October 1986 &mdash; that an inter-departmental committee is necessary because so many different Government Departments are involved &mdash; also because of the danger of a major scandal developing in this area &mdash; would he undertake to raise with his Government the suggestion I had made in October 1986, and which was accepted by the then Taoiseach, that an inter-departmental committee be set up to examine the various problems involved, for instance, whether we should have a <Col N="1180" /> proper system of registration, accountability and so on?  Would the Minister undertake to shoulder that cudgel at this stage and ensure that action follows on the part of the present Government, accepting that it is not a matter solely lying within the domain of the Department of Justice but one in which that Department do have some responsibility?</P>

      <P>At present ten new public weighbridges are operational.  Two of the weighbridges concerned came into operation in August and November 1987 only respectively.  Details of the number of weighings in 1987 at each of the locations in question are set out in the form of a tabular statement which it is proposed to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I might add that it was never intended that these weighbridges would be manned continually by the Garda in view of the many other demands on Garda time and resources and because the most effective way to enforce the relevant legislation is to operate the weighbridges in an unpredictable pattern.  Under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, a weighbridge can be used only to check vehicles stopped within a five-mile radius of the weighbridge. I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, is considering extending this limit to ten miles in the context of an amending Road Traffic Bill.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister happy with the investment of public funds in the construction and introduction of new public weighbridges bearing in mind the vast number of private weighbridges throughout the country which could be utilised by his Department if deemed necessary?  I am not sure exactly what amount of public funds was injected into the construction of such weighbridges in recent years, particularly in 1987.

These are only available during working hours and cannot be readily used to weigh the vehicles of the owners or of their customers.  The Garda have also been equipped with pilot sets of mobile axle weight pads which can be used to enforce the maximum vehicle weight regulations outside the five mile limit. <Col N="1184" /> Successful prosecutions have been brought in a number of District Courts and the typical fine imposed is in the order of £250 per overloaded axle.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to Question No. 50 on 8 March 1988.  The question of whether stun guns are prohibited weapons within the meaning of the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1971, is still being examined by the Garda authorities in consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I understand that their consideration of the matter is almost completed.  In the light of the advice which I receive from this examination, I shall consider the action that needs to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>This dangerous weapon has been freely available to the public over a long period and yet a Garda report has not yet been finalised in regard to this matter.  Will we have to wait until a tragedy occurs from the use of such a gun before something is done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the thrust of the Deputy's question.  The stun gun most commonly available in this country is the <Col N="1185" /> Nova XR 5000 which has been examined by the Garda ballistics section.  It produces an electric pulse which sends out frequencies to the neuro-muscular system and temporarily interrupts voluntary muscle control, causing the person to fall unconscious to the ground.  The cost of this unit is about £160.  Having regard to my concern in this area, the matter is being examined by the Garda authorities in consultation with the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I hope to hear from them very shortly and then I will take whatever action is necessary to deal with the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, I have written to his Department on a number of occasions about the use of stun guns.  They have now been outlawed in Britain and, as a result, this country has become a dumping ground for stocks that were available in Britain and which can be sold here cheaply.  I am sure I speak for all sides of the House when I say he will have our full support in bringing in any legislation which he thinks necessary to immediately ban the use of stun guns.  The legislation should also make it an offence to carry a sharp weapon such as a knife.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice his views on whether it would <Col N="1187" /> be desirable both in the interest of effecting economies and making greater use of Garda manpower to privatise photography, fingerprinting and other Garda activities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the considered view of the Garda authorities that privatisation of technical support services for the Garda Síochána, such as fingerprinting or photography, would not be in the best interests of the force for reasons, among others, of security and confidentiality. The Garda authorities also consider that in the case of most of the technical services required by the force, experience in police work and procedure is necessary.</P>
      <P>A measure of privatisation exists in the repair and maintenance of the vehicles in the Garda fleet.  The use of commercial garages for this work has been extended in the past 18 months or so and the question of further extending this arrangement is being kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will use the Minister's word and ask him if he thinks it would be appropriate for civilians rather than gardaí to carry out this work?  I refer to civilians working within the Garda authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

      <P>Civilianisation or privatisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We will, of course, be looking at the question of civilians working in these areas but that will only arise where it is possible to employ them. However, the Garda advise me that it is their considered view that in certain areas civilians would not be welcome for the reasons I gave in reply to the question. This would apply to the Technical Bureau, photography, fingerprinting and ballistics where it is essential for staff, as well as having specialist knowledge, to have knowledge of ordinary police work and procedures.  The work of the photographic section includes mounting surveillance operations of subversives and <Col N="1188" /> criminals which sometimes involves work for protracted periods at nights and weekends. The members involved have to give evidence in court in regard to murder, kidnapping and other serious cases.  The same argument applies to fingerprinting and ballistics.  With regard to the depot garage and workshops, as I said during the past 18 months there has been a great move to employ outside agencies to do this sort of work.  The radio section is serviced by radio technicians specially recruited as members of the force for this type of work, for very good reasons.  With regard to the towing away of illegally parked vehicles, I understand this may well be privatised and if it releases gardaí for other work perhaps we will see where we are going there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister add to his brief the following consideration &mdash; while I sympathise with him in general on the idea of civilianisation &mdash; that in the event that Deputy McDowell's suggestion were adopted the State quite easily might not save any money because it would have to pay these civilian experts in finger printing and photography for their court attendance and hanging around for hours or days on end waiting for their evidence to be called?  It is questionable whether any economy could be achieved through this route.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that provisional figures indicate that there was an increase in the level of residential burglary in the sixmonth period ended 31 March 1988 in comparison with the corresponding period ended 31 March 1987.</P>
      <P>While a trend of the nature indicated must be of concern I believe it is relevant to make the point that, following the implementation of a number of crime prevention measures, the level of such crime has, in fact, decreased by approximately 20 per cent since 1984.  Also, the provisional figure for such crime for the full year 1987 is fractionally lower than the corresponding figure for 1986.</P>

I will send the figures to the Deputy if she wants them.  There are quite a number of figures.</P>

      <P>The Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, obliges local authorities to provide and maintain in their functional areas such courthouse accommodation as the Minister for Justice shall direct.  To remove that responsibility from local authorities would requre legislation.  While it is not normal practice to indicate, in the context of parliamentary questions, whether legislative changes are being considered in particular areas, I think it appropriate in this particular instance to make it clear that I have no proposals of the kind in question.</P>

      <P>The Minister will agree that many of the rural courthouses are in a very poor condition and are not in accordance with the degree of dignity which the law requires, that the provision of proper courthouses is essential and that many of the local authorities, in the present cutbacks situation as a result of this Government's policies, are not in a position to maintain these courthouses in a reasonable manner.

I have been in a number of these in the rural parts the Deputy is talking about.  Certainly there is room for improvement but the basic facilities are always there.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will give an indication of the cost of the administration of justice in Ireland under the following headings: (a) the cost of criminal legal aid (b) the cost of civil legal aid (c) the cost of salaries of administrative staff (d) the cost of buildings and accommodation (e) the cost of payments to jurors (f) the cost of salaries of judges and other such categories; if the cost of the administration of justice has increased in the last ten years at a rate greater than or less than the consumer price index; if so, the extent of the divergence; and the approximate breakdown of the court costs as between criminal and civil matters.</P>

      <P>The amounts provided in the Estimates for 1988 are as follows: (a) £2,200,000; (b) £1,920,000; (c) £9,479,000; (d) £1,097,000; (e) £52,000; (f) £2,693,000.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of the courts system has increased over the past ten years by some 280 per cent compared with an increase of 167 per cent in the consumer price index.  Among the main reasons for the divergence are the fact that there was no civil legal aid scheme at all ten years ago, the exceptional increase in criminal legal aid over that period and the allocation of additional judicial and related resources.</P>
      <P>Because of the flexibility within the courts system in the handling of civil and criminal business it would not be feasible to provide a reliable breakdown in costs as between criminal and civil matters. The figure at (d) relates to accommodation for which the Commissioners of Public Works have responsibility; it does not relate to accommodation provided by local authorities, separate figures for which are not available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me ask the Minister first the reasons for what he described as the exceptional increase in the cost of criminal legal aid over the last ten years. Will he indicate whether the increases in the cost of the administration of justice which here are almost 80 per cent higher than the increases in the cost of living are of a magnitude similar to the increases in other comparable European countries or whether the cost of the administration of justice is increasing disproportionately faster in this country?</P>

      <P>With regard to whether I have any information on a comparison between our costs and those of other countries I have not got that information but if we have it available in the Department I will send it to the Deputy.  With regard to the estimated cost of the courts system which increased over the past ten years by 280 per cent as against 167 per cent in the CPI, the main reason for the divergence is the fact that there was no civil legal aid scheme.  That scheme has been introduced within the past ten years. The exceptional increase in criminal legal aid over that period and the allocation within it was responsible for that high percentage, that 280 per cent, together with the allocation of additional judicial and related resources.</P>

      <P>While I thank the Minister for his reply I ask him if he will be surprised to find I was somewhat dismayed that he did not have, at least in rough terms in his head, comparable information about the cost of the administration of justice relative to other countries. In view of the fact that he and other Ministers are allegedly spending all their waking hours worrying about cost control at present, why is he not conscious of the relative cost of the administration of justice?  Let me press him further for information in reply to a specific question I asked him.  He chose to describe the increase in the cost of criminal legal aid as, and I quote if I may at Question Time, &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo;.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 31 and 38 as well as Priority Question No. 45 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Private Notice Questions on 23 March, I outlined to the House the background to the present dispute. The position, briefly, is that the Government decided, in making the 1988 financial provision for the prison service, that the overtime provision should be £6.3 million and that 200 extra staff should be recruited in conjunction with the introduction of a revised rostering arrangement.  The 200 extra jobs have <Col N="1200" /> now been filled and it was necessary, in order to stay within allocations, to introduce the new roster.  Negotiations had been taking place with the Prison Officers' Association for over three years on a new roster but it became clear after this time that there was no prospect of agreement.  The lack of agreement could not be allowed to jeopardise the creation of jobs for 200 people.</P>
    <P>When I last spoke to the House about this matter a number of Deputies suggested that I should meet directly with the Prison Officers' Association in an effort to resolve the dispute.  I explained that while I had no objections to having discussions with the association my inclination was that it would be best for the time being if discussions under the mediator were to continue.  In the event mediation proved unsuccessful and I then met with the association on a number of occasions in an effort to resolve the dispute.</P>
    <P>During the course of these meetings I put forward a wide range of proposals in an effort to meet the concerns of the association.  Last Friday I made the following offer as a means of settling the dispute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Justice to appoint a person to carry out an independent review with the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>To review the rostering arrangements in the Prison Service with a view to devising a roster which would meet most efficiently and cost effectively the operational requirements of the Prison Service, taking into account the concerns of staff.</P>
    <P>First meeting within two weeks with a view to reporting within six months.</P>
    <P>Industrial action to be deferred pending consideration of the outcome of the review.</P>
    <P>In the event of the POA making any claims based on the outcome of the proposed review, those claims would be processed under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That offer was intended to meet the publicly expressed view of the association <Col N="1201" /> that the issue in the dispute was not money but the imposition of a roster and that the intervention of a third party in relation to actual rostering arrangements would settle the dispute.  At the same time it was designed to ensure that any claims for additional remuneration as a consequence of a new roster would have to be dealt with under normal industrial relations procedures such as the conciliation and arbitration scheme as it could not be accepted that special arrangements beyond those available to other staff should be made available to the Prison Officers' Association.</P>
    <P>In the end &mdash; and much to my disappointment &mdash; my offer proved unacceptable to the association which put forward counter-proposals all of which I could accept with one exception: the insistence by the Prison Officers' Association that the person carrying out the review should be allowed to make recommendations in relation to compensation and remuneration.  It was clear that the key issue &mdash; on which agreement could not be reached &mdash; remained money in one guise or another.  The Prison Officers' Association wanted special arrangements &mdash; not available to other staff &mdash; to be put in place to enable them to get extra money.  This was clearly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I very much regret that the offer I made to the association failed to resolve the dispute especially given the public statements made by the association as to how the dispute could be settled.  Pickets were placed on a number of prisons a short time after the talks broke down late last Friday night and the withdrawal of labour went ahead at 8 a.m. last Saturday.  The House will generally be aware of developments in the prisons since then.  I am sure all Members of the House will want to join with me in thanking the governors and their support staff in the prisons, the Garda and the Army for the tremendous efforts they are making to deal with the present situation.  As to the dispute itself, I will, of course, continue to explore ways to achieve an acceptable resolution.</P>
    <P>I think I should say in fairness to all concerned that the central issue is Government pay policy.  The essential <Col N="1202" /> problem is that the association are seeking special arrangements outside the scope of normal industrial relations procedures in the Civil Service.  The inevitable effect of any concession on this matter would be to completely undermine Government pay policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am disappointed that the offer made was not acceptable to the Prison Officers' Association.  Is the offer of the appointment of a third party to review the roster arrangements still on the table?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Very much so.  I went so far as to agree that they themselves could nominate the person to review the roster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm newspaper reports that prison officers on strike at Cork prison were able to view the escape being made by prisoners at the weekend?  Have the Department investigated this matter and can they confirm that this was the position?  If there is an all-out strike, is the Minister satisfied that he will be in a position to ensure that prisoners will be fully secure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I visited Cork prison for a number of hours yesterday and no suggestion was made to me which would in any way indicate that prison officers saw anyone escaping over a wall.  That suggestion was not made to me and I was somewhat taken aback this morning to hear the radio reports to which the Deputy refers.  I have asked that this should be inquired into and I cannot comment until I have further information.  I spoke to 40 or 50 prison officers outside Cork prison and one officer said that rumours to the effect that they saw someone escaping over the wall were not true, yet the general secretary of the organisation says the opposite.  I am not involved in the rumour business and I am checking it out.  Until I know the facts I cannot say anything further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of an all-out strike taking place at the weekend, which neither I nor anybody else would wish to see and for <Col N="1203" /> which I cannot see any reason, the security of the prisons would very definitely be safe.  I have already expressed my thanks to the governors and their support staff and to the Garda and the Army and everybody who has been involved in running the prisons since the strike began.  I would also like to thank the prison officers for seeing that there was an orderly hand-over to the Garda and the Army.  We appreciate their assistance in this very important matter.  I have been in a number of prisons and spoken personally with the people involved.  The secretariat in the Department of Justice are in constant communication with the entire prison network.  Nobody wants a long drawn out strike, least of all I.  I have enough to do in dealing with other problems.  I am more than prepared to sit down with these people and anybody acting on their behalf to see if we can come to an agreement.  I was certain we had agreement last Friday night but then an element was introduced which was totally contrary to Government policy on pay issues.  This I could not accept.</P>

I will give him the opportunity to ask a brief question but I must now go on to deal with Priority Questions.  A brief question from Deputy Taylor.</P>

      <P>While accepting that we cannot go into the merits and demerits of this dispute at Question Time, it appears that the Minister is now at loggerheads with the POA.  That is very unsatisfactory in view of the disturbances which have taken place in the prisons.  We hope they will not be repeated.  Is there any contact at present with the POA?  If not, will the Minister not agree to accept a mediator to try to resolve this dispute?  Will he give a commitment to the House not just to review the rostering but to review the whole dispute and try to negotiate an agreement between the two parties involved, namely the Minister and the POA?  Will the Minister initiate this move as a matter of urgency?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say to Deputy McCartan, who should not be interrupting, that tragically we have deaths in prison on occasion.  The Deputy is being grossly mischievous if he tries to insinuate that these two deaths took place as a <Col N="1205" /> result of the situation we are now in.  With regard to disturbances, I have spoken with people involved in running the prisons and I am clearly advised by the officials of my Department, who are doing an excellent job in this entire area, that the situation within the prisons as of now is as good as one could expect it to be.  I should not like anyone to make play of that situation.  Prisoners are receiving visits in the normal way.</P>
      <P>Some difficulties were experienced with visits in Cork prison.  I understand from the governor there as late as last night that when the people called to visit the member of their family, the family member in question did not for reasons of his own respond to the call to come and see the visitors.  I want to say to Deputy Taylor that he will be disappointed that I am not in a stand-off position with anybody.  I never have been and I do not intend to put myself into that situation, even to oblige Deputy Taylor. Neither would I nor could I accept Deputy Taylor's suggestion of a mediator and the role he sees for the mediator, bearing in mind that I have already told him, even if he did not need to be told, that to do as he suggests is totally contrary to Government policy on matters such as this.  The Deputy should know that.  He is here long enough to know it and he knows what is involved.</P>

      <P>I and the Government are willing to have an outside person, the nominee of the Prison Officers' Association, to devise a roster within the shortest possible period of time and any appropriate claims for compensation of any sort can be dealt with under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  It is the Government's intention to see to it that <Col N="1206" /> the conciliation and arbitration scheme will not be by-passed and if the Deputy thinks the Government are going to decide otherwise, then he is very wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 46 and 49 and Question No. 43 together.</P>
      <P>I should make it clear at the outset that I did not appoint a committee as indicated by Deputy Barrett in his question.  The position is that, during the investigation of the John O'Grady kidnapping last year, certain shortcomings became apparent in the organisational structures of the Garda Síochána and in the planning and execution of operations.  The Government decided that the Commissioner should provide a full report on the conduct of that investigation and that there should be a review of the organisation of the force by its top management with a view to remedying these shortcomings. At the request of the Commissioner, that review was carried out by three of the Assistant Commissioners of the force.  As I announced last week, the Commissioner has presented to me, his proposals, based on that review, for a reorganisation of structures at Garda headquarters and for changes in practices and procedures in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  I have fully approved those proposals.  The following is an outline of the major changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two Deputy Commissioners will be relieved of certain day-to-day headquarters branch responsibilities thus enabling them to concentrate to a greater extent on their roles as senior force managers. They will have responsibility for development of policy and planning with regard to administration and operations <Col N="1208" /> respectively and each will have responsibility for the work of three Assistant Commissioners.</P>
    <P>A number of changes will be made also in the structure of various headquarters branches.  The most significant change is that there will now be a single Crime and Security Branch which will have responsibility for the collation, assessment and recording of all intelligence in relation not just to subversive crime but to ordinary crime as well.  Information for all Garda sources will flow into a common intelligence pool for which this branch will be responsible.</P>
    <P>There will be a new Force Services Branch dealing with provision of computer, telecommunications and technical services to the force as a whole.  There will be a new emphasis in the work of Personnel Branch on the assessment of personnel and on personnel welfare.  The Research Section in the force is being strengthened and relocated at Templemore.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner's proposals for the Dublin Metropolitan Area are designed to improve performance generally and, in particular, the utilisation of all detective resources.  There will be greater co-ordination of activity between the Special Detective Unit and the Central Detective Unit.  The new Assistant Commissioner being assigned to the DMA will have as a top priority the improvement of the professionalism of both units.  All operational procedures in the DMA will come under scrutiny with the aim of ensuring that as many uniformed members as possible are visible on the streets.  The community policing policy will be extended and it is intended to examine the present divisional structure in the DMA with a view, in particular, to having the main city centre area covered by one division, instead of two as at present.  The Assistant Commissioner in the DMA will also have a special function in relation to crime prevention, neighbourhood watch and community relations.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner has also reported on the John O'Grady kidnapping investigation and that report contains a number of further proposals designed to <Col N="1209" /> overcome shortcomings that came to light during the investigation.  Overall, procedures with regard to the investigation of kidnappings and other serious crimes are being examined and brought up-to-date and procedures related to the location of checkpoints and cordons and manning of them are being radically reviewed and made the subject of detailed instructions.  It is also the Commissioner's intention to hold regular conferences of senior officers to discuss current policing problems.  Structures in divisions and districts outside Dublin will also be examined with a view to concentrating Garda resources in the areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, I have approved the Commissioner's proposals and he is confident that they will have a significant impact on Garda performance. I am satisfied that the proposals will strengthen the management of the force and that there will be a much greater emphasis on operational policy, on planning and on performance review. The implementation of the Commissioner's proposals has commenced and will be monitored and evaluated closely and carefully to ensure speedy progress and effectiveness.  No additional expenditure is envisaged arising out of the implementation of the Commissioner's proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for his reply.  Will the Minister not agree that the setting up of this investigation arose as a result of a great deal of concern which was expressed both inside and outside this House by the various representative bodies of the Garda Síochána and by the Minister when he publicly said that he had severe doubts about some of the activities of some members of the Garda Síochána in the course of the O'Grady kidnap affair?  Will he not agree that it is only right and proper if he answers us by saying that he intends to carry out an investigation and that we should behave in a responsible manner by staying quiet as a result of that guarantee that we, in turn, should be given a full <Col N="1210" /> and comprehensive report on the investigation and the findings into such an investigation?  We find ourselves in the position that we are being fobbed off with this promise of an investigation but we will not be able to see the report that is produced.  The Minister will agree that a great deal of concern has been expressed by members of the Garda Síochána who are very anxious that the image of the Garda Síochána is maintained but who find that the report of the investigation is not going to be made public?</P>

The Garda Commissioner got three of his Assistant Commissioners to do an investigation for him.  He submitted a report to me based on their findings which has been accepted in its entirety.  I am satisfied that the proposals will strengthen the management of the force, that there will be a much greater emphasis on operational policy and on planning, and of course performance will be reviewed on a regular basis.  This a major breakthrough because, for the first time, we have now all information with regard to ordinary and subversive crime coming into a central pool, and we are now satisfied that proper use will be made of that sort of information.  That is what we would all like to see, and I wish the Garda well.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides a statutory basis for the taxation provisions which I announced in the budget on 27 January.  It also includes a number of new incentives to help develop the economy as well as some other technical tax provisions.</P>
      <P>Before turning to the main provisions of the Bill I would like to review briefly the developments since the budget and the economic prospects for the year ahead, as well as to say a few words about the general issue of tax reform.</P>
      <P>The recently-published Exchequer returns for the first quarter of the year indicate that we are fully on course to achieve the 1988 budget targets.  The overall Exchequer borrowing requirement in the first quarter was £536 million. Allowing for seasonal patterns in Exchequer receipts and expenditure, the borrowing requirement was very low &mdash; representing only 37 per cent of the target for the year as a whole.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The corresponding percentage at this time last year was 51 per cent.  In fact one has to go back to 1984 to find a better relative position at the end of the first quarter.</P>
      <P>The drop in the level of borrowing is a direct consequence of the tight expenditure control and coherent overall budgetary strategy adopted by the Government since coming to office.  We are now building on the success of last year and I am confident that the budgetary targets will again be achieved in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as indicating that the budget targets are on course, the Exchequer returns also demonstrated the excellent results of the Exchequer's funding programme in the first quarter.  By the end of <Col N="1381" /> March the Exchequer had raised virtually all its borrowing needs for the year as a whole, with minimal recourse to net foreign borrowing, at £97 million, was at its lowest since the late seventies.</P>
    <P>The good budgetary figures, and the strength of the Exchequer's funding position, gave a further boost to market confidence. This growing confidence in domestic markets helped to create the positive climate which enabled the Central Bank to cut its official interest rates &mdash; by three-quarters of a percentage point &mdash; on 11 April.  This was quickly followed by reductions in interbank and Associated Bank rates.</P>
    <P>At this point, key interbank interest rates are up to six percentage points below their level of 31 March, 1987. Whereas in March 1987 these rates were four percentage points above the corresponding UK rates, they are now below them.  This is a major change in the space of a year and interest rates are now at their lowest level for ten years.</P>
    <P>The growing confidence is not confined to the financial markets.  The reaction from business and other circles has been equally positive.  There is growing acceptance that the Government are on the right path in pursuing the closely-related objectives of improving the public finances and revitalising the economy.  I have every expectation that 1988 will see a continuation of the economic progress made in 1987.  I expect to see further strong export growth.  Córas Trachtála have recently forecast a 9 per cent growth in the volume of exports, with a heavy emphasis on exports to our EC partners. With strong export growth, both the trade surplus and the surplus on the current account of the balance of payments should strengthen.</P>
    <P>A further reduction in inflation to 2½ per cent or less, on average, this year is also in prospect.  The annual inflation rate to February of 1.9 per cent is very encouraging and means that inflation here is now below the EC average.  Lower inflation as well as the reduction in interest rates and the income tax concessions in the budget should improve the prospects for growth in private consumption.  In addition, the <Col N="1382" /> climate for private investment has improved considerably and I look forward to a significant rise in the volume of private investment this year.</P>
    <P>Overall, the volume of gross domestic product is expected to grow this year by between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent.  This would mean that, taking the two years 1987 and 1988 together, the volume of GDP would grow by over 2 per cent per year, a very creditable performance particularly in view of the scale of budgetary adjustment undertaken.</P>
    <P>It is clear of course that there are significant structural and competitiveness weaknesses in the economy that we must continue to address if employment performance is to be stepped up.  Achieving improved competitiveness is, therefore, a key element of our strategy.  With the low level of inflation now prevailing and the significant income tax relief awarded in the budget, there is no justification for employees or employers to seek or agree pay increases above the parameters agreed in the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> In the short term, improved competitiveness is one of the most effective means open of improving employment prospects.  The Government are, of course, continuing to pursue with the utmost vigour all possibilities of encouraging viable developments at a sectoral level.  Indeed, some of the key provisions in this Bill are framed with that objective in mind and I shall return to these later.</P>
    <P>Despite the significant progress made towards remedying the problems of the public finances I want to make clear that we cannot relax.  The level of outstanding debt remains very high.  We still have a significant budgetary gap to close if we are to stabilise the debt/GNP ratio and break clear from the debt spiral which has been pre-empting so much of our resources &mdash; resources that could otherwise be used to create employment.  This is the only way we can create more room for manoeuvre, reduce interest rates still further, get down the overall level of taxation in the economy and bring about sustainable growth and increased employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> The Government remain firmly committed, therefore, to the fiscal targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The precise size of the budgetary adjustment that will be needed in 1989 will depend on various factors, including how the economy performs for the rest of this year and developments at the international level.  It is fair to say, however, that the adjustment will have to be of significant proportions, probably of the same order of magnitude as in 1988.  Arrangements for a repeat of last year's expenditure review procedures, with a view to securing the necessary savings, are already in train.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the constraints to which I have referred the 1988 budget represents an important new phase in the Government's programme.  The tax changes that I have announced, and which are incorporated in the Finance Bill, represent a major step on the road to tax reform.  The combination in the Bill of significant income tax reductions, a major revamping of the corporation tax code, and the radical overhaul of the tax assessment and collection regime marks a significant movement in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The result of the changes in income tax provided for in the Bill is that in the current tax year nearly 63 per cent of taxpayers will be paying tax at the standard rate.  I am sure Deputies will agree that this represents considerable progress towards the Government's objective of having two-thirds of taxpayers paying tax at the standard rate only.</P>
    <P>I assure the House, however, that this year's tax changes are the beginning, not the end, of the Government's intentions in regard to tax reform.  The overall level of taxation here is still far too high.  This in turn reflects the excessive level of public expenditure, notwithstanding continued substantial borrowing which must also be phased down.  While the room for manoeuvre is narrow, because of the budgetary constraints, the Government want to reduce the overall level of taxation as soon as possible, so as to encourage initiative and enterprise in the <Col N="1384" /> economy.  The task of reform will also be made easier according as the economy resumes a higher growth pattern.  Taxpayers must share in the fruits of this growth.  Pending a reduction in overall tax, there is still much more we can do to restructure and improve the present system.</P>
    <P>In the restructuring of our tax system, we must also have regard to the proposals for harmonisation of indirect taxes in the European Community, as part of the moves towards the creation of an internal market in 1992.  The proposals create particular difficulties for Ireland because of our heavy reliance on indirect taxes.  Discussions in the Community on the Commission proposals, and on how the problems facing countries such as Ireland might be tackled, are still at a preliminary stage but I will keep the House informed as the discussions develop.</P>
    <P>There is continuing pressure for tax incentives to encourage business and we now have a wide range of these incentives in our tax code.  They are expensive in terms of tax foregone, and they are a factor in our high tax rate structure. Incentives are necessary but they must be on a selective basis as is provided for in the present Bill.  The deciding factor in each case must be the balance of advantage to the economy and I am satisfied that the incentives in this Bill will boost economic activity.  I would, however, welcome discussion in this debate as to how Deputies consider that the tax base should be widened.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to individual sections of the Bill and to draw the attention of the House, in particular, to the more significant items.  Full details of the individual sections are contained in the explanatory memorandum I have circulated with the Bill.</P>
    <P>The first three sections of the Bill implement the income tax changes I announced in the budget.  The changes go far beyond what was required to honour in 1988 the commitments made by the Government as part of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Reliefs costing just over £30 million <Col N="1385" /> would have been adequate to fulfil our commitment this year.  In the event, the reliefs in the Bill will cost £91 million in 1988 and £152 million in a full year.  On a cumulative cost basis, the reliefs will cost over £400 million over the next three years, compared with the £225 million undertaking agreed in the programme. These figures demonstrate the Government's determination to achieve the targets set out in the programme.</P>
    <P>On other specific aspects mentioned in the programme, the Bill also fulfils Government commitments.  The PAYE allowance is being increased from £700 to £800, while the 35 per cent rate band is being extended by £2,000, from £9,400 to £11,400, in the case of a married couple, and by £1,000, from £4,700 to £5,700, in the case of a single person. We have also provided for increases in personal allowances of £100 for a married couple and £50 for a single person, with comparable increases in the widowed, widowed parent and single parent allowances. In this context I might mention that, following a commitment I gave to the House last year, section 3 of the Bill provides for an improvement in the position of widowers taxed under single assessment in the year in which they are bereaved: from now on, such widowers will be put on the same footing as widows in similar circumstances and will be entitled to the equivalent of the married personal allowance in that year.  Finally, the Bill provides for increases both in the general exemption limits and in the two higher exemption limits which apply to persons aged over 65 and over 75 years.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 to 6 of Chapter 1 deal with other items of importance.  Section 4 provides for the renewal of the £286 PRSI tax allowance for the current year.  Section 5 removes the prohibition on part time directors and employees from participating in the approved share option schemes provided for in the Finance Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>Section 6 includes the process known as plant micro-propagation or plant-cloning in the relief for investment in corporate trades, more generally known as the Business Expansion Scheme.  Deputies <Col N="1386" /> will recall that this process became eligible for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax under last year's Finance Act.  The Government are anxious to ensure that this innovative industry, which is only just beginning in Ireland, can exploit its full potential for the benefit of the economy by being able to generate the equity capital it needs through the Business Expansion Scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill gives effect to the extension of the deduction at sources system for certain professional fees to payments for in-patient treatment by medical professionals under health insurance policies.  This extension was signalled in my Budget Statement when I indicated that the measure would be introduced in respect of payments under insurance contracts with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  The Government have decided, however, that in the interests of equal treatment the withholding tax should apply to specified payments by all health insurers licensed under the 1957 VHI Act.  In the main the licence holders are &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; schemes, providing cover only for employees, retired employees and their dependants. Total membership of these schemes is estimated at less than 50,000 as compared with about 400,000 policy holders in the VHI.</P>
    <P>The section sets out how the withholding tax will be applied.  The main features are as follows:</P>
    <P>Deductions will be made at a rate of 35 per cent, with effect from 6 June next, from payments under health insurance contracts in respect of fees to medical professionals for services to in-patients of hospitals in the State;</P>
    <P>to facilitate the medical insurer in making the tax deductions, the insurer will be required to pay the balance of the relevant claim &mdash; after deduction of the tax &mdash; direct to the medical professional concerned rather than the subscriber;</P>
    <P>there will be no change in the existing arrangements for payments by the insurers to subscribers for maintenance <Col N="1387" /> costs in hospitals, and the withholding tax will not apply to these payments;</P>
    <P>the subscriber will remain liable for any uninsured balance of the professional fee and the deduction at source system will not apply to this payment;</P>
    <P>where a subscriber pays fees directly to a medical professional, the professional is required to refund to the subscriber any excess of the total amount paid by the subscriber and the health insurer &mdash; including withholding tax deducted &mdash; over the amount of the professional's fee;</P>
    <P>the Minister for Finance is empowered to make regulations to secure the smooth operation of the deduction scheme for payments made by health insurers;</P>
    <P>the health insurer and the subscriber are indemnified from any claims arising from the deduction of the tax.</P>
    <P>Since publication of the Bill it has come to my attention that the Bill as drafted does not encompass certain forms of in-patient professional treatment for which benefit is paid under VHI policies.  I will introduce amendments on Committee Stage to rectify this.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed as to the effect this measure will have on holders of health insurance policies.  I would like to stress that the measure does not affect the existing rights of subscribers under health insurance contracts.  The coverage provided under insurance policies will be as before and the only change will now be that payments to medical professionals for in-patient treatment will be made directly to the professionals involved on behalf of the subscriber.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that medical consultants may feel it necessary to increase their fees because of the new system of deduction.  I must emphasise that there would be no justification for any such increase in fees.  The withholding tax already applies to payments to other professionals and the system is <Col N="1388" /> simply being extended to include payments to the consultants by health insurers.  The new system involves no more than a payment on account in respect of tax due at a later date on the payments in question.  Thus, no additional tax liability is imposed on the medical professional who will get credit for tax withheld under this system.  Substantial legal protection for subscribers is written into the legislation.  The Government will, of course, monitor the operation of the arrangements so as to guard against abuses and make sure that the legal protection for subscribers is adequate.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill also adds a number of bodies to the list of accountable persons for the purposes of the deduction at source system.  Deputies will note the inclusion of voluntary private hospitals who are grant-aided by the Department of Health.  This change will put such hospitals on the same footing as health board hospitals already operating the deduction scheme.</P>
    <P>In the budget I announced a comprehensive package of inter-related measures which the Government propose to take to bring about a major and permanent improvement in the tax assessment and collection system.  These changes are now being given legislative effect in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The main changes are set out in Chapter II, comprising sections 8 to 20 of the Bill, and arise from the decision to introduce self-assessment for corporation tax and for income tax for the self-employed. As I indicated in my Budget Statement, because of the extent of the changes involved and the numbers of taxpayers affected, a full system of self-assessment must be phased in over a period to avoid undue disruption and protect revenue yield.  The Chapter II provisions of the Bill represent, however, a major initial step on the road to full self-assessment. The key features of the new arrangements are:</P>
    <P>in general there will be a mandatory obligation on self-employed and corporate taxpayers to make a return of <Col N="1389" /> income; there are specified exceptions to this obligation;</P>
    <P>there will be a requirement to pay advance tax.  Advance tax payment is essentially the same as the existing procedure under which the taxpayer specifies his own estimate of his tax liability in advance of that liability being finalised;</P>
    <P>there is provision for the estimation of advance tax by the tax inspector and, if the taxpayer wishes, he or she can replace this estimate by the taxpayer's own estimate;</P>
    <P>formal tax assessment will generally be made by the inspector only when a tax return is completed.  If the taxpayer so wishes he may compute his own tax on the basis of the return of income that he is submitting;</P>
    <P>the provisions establish rules for payment of tax, submission of returns, charging of interest, the levying of a surcharge in the absence of a return and for the making of appeals in specified circumstances.</P>
    <P>The overall objectives of the new arrangements are to place more responsibility on taxpayers for meeting their own tax obligations, to reduce the levels of estimated tax and to streamline and significantly reduce the numbers of appeals.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that while a substantial part of the overall statutory framework for the move to self-assessment is being put in place, the computation of his own tax by the taxpayer himself is not a mandatory requirement at this stage.  The taxpayers concerned will indeed be receiving new forms on which they can themselves compute and pay tax, but completion of the form and payment of the tax due on that basis will be a voluntary, non-statutory arrangement for the present.  I should mention that the Revenue Commissioners are already operating, with a volunteer group of tax practitioners, a pilot scheme for the computation of capital acquisitions tax.  The purpose of these voluntary <Col N="1390" /> schemes is to determine the practical considerations which would arise from the introduction of full self-assessment on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The move to new return and assessment arrangements is accompanied by two other measures aimed at eliminating tax arrears and improving collection. These are the incentive to clear up arrears of tax provided for in section 68 of the Bill and the introduction of power for the Revenue Commissioners to attach the financial assets of tax defaulters, which is provided for in section 69.</P>
    <P>The combination of the new arrangements for tax assessment and the introduction of the power of attachment will mean that tax defaulters will face a much more hostile climate in the future.  This is only as it should be: we need to achieve a better balance in the system in favour of the majority of taxpayers who settle their tax obligations.  In the changed circumstances defaulters are being given a once-off incentive to clear their arrears of tax.  The incentive arrangements set out in section 68 provide for the waiving of certain outstanding interest charges and penalties, where the taxpayer brings his total liability to income tax, sur-tax, corporation profits tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, value-added tax, PRSI, health contributions, employment levy and income levy up to date at any time between 27 January 1988 and 30 September 1988.  The main taxes not covered by the incentive scheme are capital acquisitions tax and stamp duties.  These are not included because they are not subject to the same collection problems as the other taxes to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The incentive scheme ends on 30 September 1988 and the power of attachment will come into force on 1 October 1988. I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been a huge volume of inquiries in relation to the incentive and I am confident that it will make a very significant contribution to the clearance of arrears this year.  The initial impact of the incentive scheme and of the improvement already made in collection arrangements is reflected in the <Col N="1391" /> good performance of tax revenue receipts in the first quarter of the year.</P>
    <P>Section 69 of the Bill gives effect to the power of attachment.  The section provides that, where the Revenue Commissioners believe from information available to them that a third party has an amount of money owed to a tax defaulter, they may direct the third party to pay the amount to them or to pay the actual amount of tax due by a defaulter, if less. The power of attachment will thus provide the Revenue Commissioners with a speedy and cost-effective response to default.  This is essential if the fight against tax default and tax evasion is to achieve success.  The power of attachment is available to Revenue authorities in other countries, notable the United States and New Zealand, and its introduction here was recommended by the Commission on Taxation.  It will be particularly welcomed by the vast bulk of taxpayers who comply fully with their obligations and who will have nothing to fear from this new power.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline briefly for Deputies the main features of the attachment process.</P>
    <P>There is a starting date of 1 October next; thus as I have indicated earlier taxpayers may avail of the incentive arrangements to clear arrears before the new power comes into operation.  The power extends to the employment levy, health contribution and PRSI as well as the main taxes.  The power will not be used in respect of wages, salaries, pensions or social welfare payments.  The taxpayer will have a one-month grace period following default before entering the period during which attachment may be used. The taxpayer will receive prior notice that he is entering the attachment phase. To implement attachment the Revenue may give a notice to a debtor, including a financial institution, to make a return and pay over to the Revenue, from a debt due to the taxpayer, the amount in default or, if less, the amount of the debt. Payment must be made within ten days of the notice being received.  The debtor does not have to indicate how much is <Col N="1392" /> owed to the taxpayer where this exceeds the amount in default.  The Revenue Commissioners must have reason to believe that there is an amount owing to a defaulter from a third party and they will continue to rely on their existing powers of information in operating the power of attachment.  Only one notice of attachment per taxpayer can be in force at any one time and attachment will not apply to amounts in dispute or in a liquidation or bankruptcy situation.</P>
    <P>Chapters III and IV of the Bill contain several provisions aimed at encouraging development of various sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>I announced in the budget that the tax relief known as &ldquo;section 23&rdquo; was being restored for a further three-year period. This measure, provided for in section 24 of the Bill, allows expenditure incurred after budget day on constructing new residential accommodation for renting to be set-off as a deduction against all rental income, including that derived from the particular &ldquo;section 23&rdquo; property.  The maximum floor area limit for flats of 90 square metres, which previously applied, is being retained, but without the former restriction as to number of bedrooms required.  Going beyond what was announced in the budget the Government have also decided to renew for a similar three-year period the earlier reliefs for certain costs incurred in the conversion and refurbishment of property for rental accommodation.  Thus, expenditure on converting a qualifying building into two or more residential units will be allowed as a relief against all rental income, while that incurred on refurbishment of qualifying property will, as previously, be an allowable deduction against the income from that property only.</P>
    <P>The overall effect of this package will be to provide a timely and significant boost to the construction industry and encourage the provision of moderately priced rented accommodation.  It will also assist the improvement of low cost residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>A further measure which will help the construction industry and the process of <Col N="1393" /> urban renewal is the two-year extension of the time limit originally applying to incentives in the designated areas in the five county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  This is provided for in section 23.  The various tax and other incentives will now be available for qualifying expenditure up until 31 May 1991, in common with the other nine recently-announced designated areas.</P>
    <P>Section 27 of the Bill gives exemption from income tax and capital gains tax for investments made by pension funds in financial futures and options, in order to facilitate the participation of pension funds in such transactions.  Section 32 enables certain non-manufacturing companies located in the Shannon Customs-Free Airport to qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax in 1990.  This special rate has been available to new companies which have set up in the airport since 31 December 1980.  Section 32 provides that similar treatment will be given to existing companies located in the airport when their present tax exemption arrangement expires in 1990.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of measures which are designed to assist the development of the International Financial Services Centre being established in the Custom House Dock area.  Before outlining these measures, let me bring the House up to date on progress in regard to this project.  To date, two certificates have been granted to companies which will locate in the centre.  In addition, some 20 further projects have been approved in principle.  These 22 projects involve definite employment commitments &mdash; to be written into the certificates &mdash; amounting to over 700 jobs. This is a very positive result in a relatively short period and is indicative of the great interest, support and goodwill which exists in relation to the centre.  I am confident that the coming year will see further substantial progress, resulting in many more projects and job commitments, and this will be helped by the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There appears to be some confusion among Opposition Deputies about the <Col N="1394" /> procedure for granting certificates to companies establishing in the centre.  The relevant legislation is drawn up on precisely the same basis as that governing certificates for companies in the Shannon Airport zone.  There is the same requirement for ministerial approval.  The Shannon legislation has been on the statute book since the late fifties and there have never been any charges or unfair ministerial decisions in regard to Shannon certificates.  There is no basis for supposing that things will be otherwise in the case of the IFSC.</P>
    <P>In fact, there is a very formal process of approval for IFSC companies before a ministerial decision is given.  As is widely known, we have established a Certification Advisory Committee which is representative of my Department, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Central Bank and the IDA.  All projects must be submitted to this committee and examined by them before they are submitted to me with a recommendation for approval.  Obviously, in deciding on an approval, I will have regard to the recommendations of the committee and this is a major safeguard against arbitrary or unfair decisions.</P>
    <P>Section 33 of the Bill removes the requirement, which has proved to be unnecessary, that activities which are to be carried on in due course in the Custom House Docks area should be located in temporary accommodation not owned by the relevant company pending the availability of suitable premises there.  Section 33 also extends the special 10 per cent rate of corporation tax in the centre to speculative commodity trading which is essentially financial in nature.  Section 34 allows a deduction for tax purposes for interest on loans paid by a company in the centre to a non-resident parent company. Section 35 grants an exemption from withholding taxes on interest payments made by companies in the centre to lenders outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also want to give notice of my intention to introduce amendments on Committee Stage to bring the investment income of life assurance companies and the income and capital gains of unit trusts <Col N="1395" /> located in the centre within the ambit of the 10 per cent rate.  All of these measures will, as I have said, be of benefit to the promotion of the centre as an attractive location for international financial services.</P>
    <P>Section 38 makes a novel provision for the repatriation to this country, free of tax, of dividends earned abroad by the subsidiaries of Irish companies.  The intention is that the repatriated funds will be used for investment here with direct benefits to the economy.  I would emphasise that in order to avail of this new relief, it will be necessary to show that repatriated funds are directed towards the maintenance or creation of employment here.  Each individual application will have to receive, on a case by case basis, the prior approval of the Minister for Finance for its investment plan.  The repatriation of funds under this scheme will result in a further addition to liquidity in the economy.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides for the increase from £4,000 to £6,000 in the capital allowances and the deduction for running expenses for motor cars.  Section 45 renews for a further three-year period the favourable treatment of expenditure incurred on the construction of multistorey car parks.  The existing relief, of a 50 per cent initial allowance and 4 per cent annual allowance expired on 31 March last, and its continuation will give a boost to the provision of off-street parking.</P>
    <P>The Bill implements the major changes in the corporation tax structure which I announced in the budget.  The main elements of the changes are provided for in sections 30, 42 and 43 of the Bill.  These are a phased reduction in the first-year capital allowances for plant, machinery and industrial buildings, from 100 per cent to 50 per cent, and a parallel reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax from 50 per cent to 43 per cent.  These measures are very much in line with the trend internationally towards lowering the tax rates, on the one hand, and available reliefs, on the other, and it is the Government's firm <Col N="1396" /> belief that these changes will improve the equity and economic efficiency of the tax code.  The fact is that our tax incentives and exemptions have been rather generous, and have in practice tended to encourage capital investment at the expense of employment.  The reduction in the standard tax rate will assist employment creation and, in particular, will act as a stimulus to the services sector which is recognised as an important source of new job opportunities.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing major changes in the reform of the corporation tax code there are also a number of related measures which I will briefly outline.  In line with the reduction of the standard rate to 43 per cent, most lower rates of tax will be abolished under section 30 of the Bill.  However, the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing and certain other activities is not affected.  Under section 47 the reduction in capital allowances will not apply to contracts entered into on or before budget day, or to projects which are in course of negotiation with, and approved by the industrial development agencies by the end of this year.  Likewise, the special building incentives in the designated areas for urban renewal, and qualifying services activities in the Custom House Docks area and in Shannon, will not be affected.</P>
    <P>The arrangement introduced in 1981 whereby distributions paid by a company had firstly to be paid out of profits which had benefited from the 10 per cent tax rate &mdash; the Primary Fund &mdash; is being terminated.  It no longer serves its original purpose, now that full advance corporation tax is in operation.  It is now proposed, in section 29 of the Bill, that tax credits will be treated as coming proportionately from the tax mix of profits available for distribution.  Tax credit rates for shareholders will, of course, be reduced under section 28 following on from the phased reduction in the tax rates themselves.</P>
    <P>Section 36 provides for special exemption from corporation tax for five years for the profits of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta arising from their gas trading activities. The purpose of this exemption is <Col N="1397" /> to enable Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta to service and pay off their debts.  This exemption formed part of the arrangements agreed for the ICI-NET joint venture operation.</P>
    <P>In the budget speech, I announced that it was proposed to impose, on a once off basis, a levy on the investment income of pension funds.  The detailed provisions giving effect to this are contained in section 49 of the Bill.  Following discussions with representatives of the pensions industry, the basis of implementation of the levy has been changed from that set out in the budget. Instead of being charged on actual income and realised gains, the charge will now be based on an imputed investment yield calculated by reference to the asset value of pension funds as of 1 January 1988.  In addition to the exemption for small self-administered schemes, there will also be a parallel exemption for nongroup schemes run by life assurance companies. I am satisfied that the revised provisions will, overall, present fewer problems for pension funds, and their administrators.  The changes now proposed will not affect the expected yield to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Turning to excise duties the Bill confirms the budget changes.  Section 54 provides for the repeal of section 43 of the Finance Act, 1968, which provides for the remission of road tax on vehicles converted for use by disabled drivers.  This remission is to be subsumed in the proposed new scheme of assistance towards the mobility of the disabled.  Discussions between the Minister for Health and representatives of the disabled drivers are continuing.  I hope that agreement on the scheme can be reached in the near future. I want to stress that the decision to rationalise the existing scheme of assistance was not aimed at saving money but at eliminating unfairness and distortions which have been a feature of the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill, comprising sections 56 to 59, confirms the VAT changes announced on budget day and which took effect on 1 March last.  The imposition of a 5 per cent rate on electricity has not <Col N="1398" /> resulted in any price increase for domestic consumers because of the matching reduction in unit costs, while businesses have actually benefited because they can reclaim any VAT paid.  As I stated in my budget address, this will enhance business competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the rate of farmers' flat rate addition from 1.7 per cent to 1.4 per cent has given rise to some adverse comments from farming interests but, as I have indicated on previous occasions, I could not allow the continuation of this mechanism at its former level while significant arrears of tax related levies remain unpaid by the farming community. The solution is clear.  If the problem of the arrears is resolved I will be willing to look again at the matter in the context of next year's budget.</P>
    <P>The corporation tax contribution from the banking sector is still at an unsatisfactorily low level, despite an appreciable increase in bank profits.  The bank levy has remained at £25 million since 1983 and, in the circumstances, will now be increased to £30 million for 1988.  Section 60 gives effect to this.</P>
    <P>Section 62 of the Bill makes provision for the £10 duty on ATM cards which was announced in the budget.  In the period since my Budget Statement I have received a number of representations in connection with this measure.  I have given due consideration to the points raised and while there is some validity in the case made I am not convinced of the merits of the alternative proposals put forward for raising the projected yield elsewhere within the banking sector.  The provision of banking services by use of electronic methods will continue to develop and this is something which has to be considered as part of the overall issue of the taxation of financial services.</P>
    <P>Section 67 brings the tax treatment of securities issued by Bord Telecom Éireann and Irish Telecommunications Investments plc into line with the treatment of those of a number of other commercial State bodies, for example, the Electricity Supply Board and Aer Lingus. The purpose of the section is to enable ITI and Bord Telecom Éireann to raise <Col N="1399" /> more of their borrowings in unguaranteed form and so curb the growth in the contingent liabilities of the State.</P>
    <P>Section 70 applies to income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and stamp duties the general principle of the Status of Children Act, 1987, namely, that relationships between persons are to be determined without regard to whether the parents of any person are or have been married to each other, unless the contrary intention appears.  Deputies will recall that a commitment was given that the taxation implications of the Status of Children Act would be dealt with in a Finance Act.  I am happy to be able to introduce a suitable provision in this year's Bill in fulfilment of that commitment.</P>
    <P>In this opening address I have dwelt on general economic issues and tax reform as well as outlining the more significant elements of the Bill.  I look forward to the opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss in more detail the individual sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This Finance Bill, like its predecessors, implements the provisions of the budget. There are few changes from the budgetary announcements, and consequently the mistakes of the budget are incorporated in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The Government say they expect that 256,000 persons, on average, will be unemployed in 1988.  The Government say, too, that 30,000 persons will emigrate each year, over the next three years.  Not only do the Government proceed with the implementation of their policies, as if this level of unemployment and emigration was acceptable, they act as if it were of no consequence.  In his budget speech the Minister for Finance, addressed neither the problem of unemployment or of emigration.  There is only a token reference to these problems in his speech today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At no time, since the State was founded, have we been able to organise our affairs, so that all our people can get <Col N="1400" /> jobs: only for a very short period of our history has the flow of unwilling emigrants been stemmed.  But now for the first time ever, we have a Government who are totally ignoring the plight of a quarter of a million people unemployed and who are seeking to institutionalise emigration.</P>
    <P>We know from bitter experience, that emigration is a consequence of an under-performing economy, but never before have a Government sought to make the emigration of the young a plank on which economic policy rests.  Fine Gael do not accept this approach.  We do not believe, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs does, that there is not room enough for all our children on this island.  We do not believe the country is too small to accommodate them all.  We will not accept the deliberate reduction of our population as making any contribution to the solution of our economic problems and we will oppose any such policy.</P>
    <P>We need growth in the economy.  The budget and this Finance Bill are based on zero growth.  Without economic growth our problems will continue; 20 per cent of the work force will queue for the dole; and the best and brightest of our children will leave the country; those in employment will face an intolerable tax burden, and there will be little disposable income. Our education, health and social welfare services will continue to be starved of resources; we will have high cost low efficiency services and the economy will continue to stagnate.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill does nothing to change this prospect.  The Government are now pursuing a one item agenda: reducing the burden of the national debt. We welcome the diligence with which the one item is being pursued and we hope that the Government continue to pursue it, but unless the economic agenda is extended the economy will not grow and our real problems will continue into the next century.  We must attack the roadblocks to growth in our economy.  The problem of the national debt is one such roadblock, and we will continue to support the Government in tackling it.  There are others, however, which must be <Col N="1401" /> attacked with equal vigour because their removal is essential to economic growth. These are the reform of the taxation system and, in particular, the income tax code, the cost of transport, especially internal road transport, the cost of energy, the cost of telecommunications and the cost of wages.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest disappointments of the Finance Bill is its failure to commence the reform of the income tax code.  Our taxation system is crippling.  It is destroying the work ethic.  It is a major contributory factor to emigration, and, in my opinion, it is the foremost inhibitor of economic growth in the country.  It is a major disappointment that the Governement did not take the oportunity in the Finance Bill to make major proposals for reform.</P>
    <P>The last year has been unusual in Irish politics in that the Governemnt have succeeded in making progress in controlling the national debt, with the help of the Opposition parties, in particular Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats. Fine Gael now perceive the reform of taxation, and especially personal taxation, as just as important as controlling the debt, and we are disappointed at the lack of courage in the Government's proposals. The key problem with our income tax system is the low level of income at which persons move to high marginal rates.  When we add PRSI to these high tax rates persons on quite moderate incomes pay rates of 55¾ per cent and 65¾ per cent respectivley.  This year, following the implementation of sections 1 to 5 of the Bill, single people will pay these rates on reaching a gross income of £8,550 and £11,450 respectively.  In the UK they would pay a standard rate of 25 per cent on the first £19,000 approximately earned, and a higher rate of 40 per cent subsequently.</P>
    <P>It is usual at budget time to distribute tables to illustrate the effect of tax changes on individual taxpayers.  The typical example is frequently the married couple, one spouse working with two children. It is interesting to note that this taxpayer respresents 8 per cent of the work force.  Single people subject to the <Col N="1402" /> penal marginal tax rates which I have described account for 46 per cent of the labour force.  Is it reasonable to expect single people on the average industrial wage to pay tax rates in excess of 55 per cent?  Is it reasonable to expect single people who have a gross income of £220 a week to pay tax at a rate more than 65 per cent?</P>
    <P>To a large degree our industrial policies are people based.  The IDA advertise the excellence of our highly qualified young people.  Will the young Europeans stay on to work here under such penal tax rates?  Will the highly qualified, who are also the potentially high earners, stay, when a far more benign tax regime beckons just a £75 return flight away? Will not our emigration problem be now compounded when those who are being forced out are joined by those who are being attracted out?  We cannot succeed with a people-based industrial policy if those with &ldquo;get up and go&rdquo; get up and go.  We cannot build with sheep if the shepherds have left.</P>
    <P>There is now evidence from all over the country that workers with certain key qualifications are leaving because of our penal income tax system.  There is also evidence that companies are finding it increasingly difficult adequately to reward key management staff.  There is evidence that industries which are willing to establish here are setting up in the UK because of our high marginal income tax rates.</P>
    <P>We have established a corporate tax regime which is highly attractive to manufacturing industry but it is paralleled by a personal tax regime which is totally unattractive to the key people who work in manufacturing industry.  Consequently, our industrial development programme is not as successful as it could be, and in certain companies an inordinate amount of time, especially financial management time, is involved in developing tax avoidance schemes to enable the company adequately to reward key personnel so as to maintain their services.</P>
    <P>When we take our income tax code, together with our system of PRSI, and examine their joint macro effect on <Col N="1403" /> industry, the consequences for employment are obvious.  We favour capital over labour.  We favour machines over people. We favour the profitability of the corporation over the reward of the workers who have made the corporation profitable. We force wages upward, as workers seek to claw back some of their tax losses through higher gross wages.</P>
    <P>If no other roadblock to economic growth existed here our income tax system on its own would be sufficient to prevent us achieving the growth rates of comparable OECD countries.  We must change it.  I accept that it is very difficult for a Government radically to change our income tax code.  There are no massive unused resources available for tax reductions.  Reform can only be achieved along the lines of the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>I believe only a package of reforms presented to the people can work.  If a gradual approach is adopted the losers under the new regime will identify their losses far quicker than the winners will identify their gains.  As Opposition parties support the losers Governments lose votes and there is no compensating increase in their support from those who win from the new regime.  There is now, however an opportunity for the Government which is unique.  The main Opposition Party have been supporting the general policy of the Government and against that background the timidity of the Government's tax proposals is amazing.</P>
    <P>The Government merely engage in fancy footwork to fulfil their obligations under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> They have changed allowances and bands in a minor way.  The cost of their proposals is £90 million.  This £90 million is collected from the taxpayer by taxing his pension fund, putting VAT on his ESB, duty on his ATM cashcard, by making his VHI more expensive and by reducing the rates of VAT rebate to farmers. They are all robbing Peter to pay Paul proposals.  What the Government put into the right pocket they have taken from the left and pretended it was tax <Col N="1404" /> reform.  It is not.  It is a missed opportunity seriously to reform the income tax code and the Government who have not acted in the Finance Bill which is, in effect all their own work, will live to regret it.  I believe there will be no real growth in the economy in the absence of radical tax reform.</P>
    <P>In my budget speech, I dealt in detail with the cost factors in our economy which make us uncompetitive.  Since then some progress has been made both by the ESB and Bord Telecom in reducing the cost of electricity and telecommunications. Much remains to be done.  The decision in the Finance Bill to impose a 5 per cent VAT charge on electricity, together with the Government's ingenuity in getting the ESB to repay in full a £30 million loan to the Exchequer this year, runs counter to the progress that has been made in reducing energy costs.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest roadblocks to growth is the uncompetitiveness of our transport, both access transport and internal transport.  If our economic growth is to be export led, we must be competitive in our transport costs.  At present we are not.  It costs 60 per cent more to transport by lorry a metric tonne in Ireland than in the UK.  A combination of higher excise duties on fuel and on tractor units of articulated vehicles, together with delays at customs and a poor road infrastructure, all contribute to this problem.</P>
    <P>Again, Government policy accentuates the situation.  There is no relief or incentive of any sort to reduce transport costs in the Bill and the cutting of the capital programme on roads will ensure a continuation, indeed a worsening of existing conditions.</P>
    <P>I wish now to discuss the specific proposals of the Bill.  I have already discussed sections 1 to 6 in the context of what I have said about income tax.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 7, when the withholding tax on professional fees was introduced last year Fine Gael opposed it.  The experience of its operation over the last year has reinforced our <Col N="1405" /> objections.  It is operating most unfairly. When last questioned about the matter in this House the Minister for Finance admitted that no repayments had been made to professionals from whose fees deductions had been made in excess of their tax liability.</P>
    <P>Section 7 renders a bad situation worse.  The tax as introduced obliged accountable persons to deduct 35 per cent from fees due to certain professionals arising from a contract of service.  All accountable persons were Departments of State, State companies or State agencies. In extending the obligations of Part I of the Finance Act, 1987, to Voluntary Health Insurance the Minister for Finance is not merely adding one more State agency to the list of accountable persons, he is extending the scope of tax beyond its original concept.  In so doing he is in breach of commitments given by him and the Taoiseach to this House in the course of the 1987 budget debate.</P>
    <P>The contract of service in the case of the VHI is not between the insurer and a member of the medical profession, it is between the insurer and the VHI member.  Both the <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> position is that the VHI pay the patient on foot of insurance cover and the patient pays the medical consultant.  To force the VHI &mdash; under the provisions of this Finance Bill &mdash; to pay the doctor rather than the patient and to withhold 35 per cent of that payment and return it to the Revenue Commissioners constitutes a gross interference in the relationship between the VHI and their members, a relationship on which the success of the VHI was based.  The Government are seriously mistaken in interfering in this relationship and should think again.</P>
    <P>I fear that medical fees will be increased by the medical profession in an attempt to recover the amount of fees withheld.  I fear that patients with full cover will in future find they have in practice 35 per cent less than full cover.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the attempts made in the section to indemnify VHI members against any attempt to legally recover 35 per cent of fees withheld.  However, I do not believe this indemnity will work.  The <Col N="1406" /> payment of fees by patients to doctors is seldom an issue in our courts.  The patients are at their most vulnerable in such circumstances.  Legal indemnities will not solve the problem because pressure exerted on patients is not legal pressure.</P>
    <P>If the Minister considers that the tax collection agencies of the State are unable to collect the income tax due on foot of VHI paynments I contend the problem is easily solved.  I understand that the VHI are now prepared to supply to the Revenue Commissioners a list of those medical practitioners who benefit from VHI payments together with the amount of these payments in each individual case.  In the past the VHI were unwilling to do so.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Those with vested interests should not trot them up and down the floor of this House.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider introducing an amendment along those lines.  I would ask him to omit <Col N="1407" /> section 7.  I should like him to draft and introduce an alternative section along the lines I have suggested.  If he does not do so I will be drafting an amendment along those lines anyhow.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of Chapter II of this Bill.  Self-assessment to tax liability is Fine Gael policy.  When Deputy John Bruton was Minister for Finance in 1986, he invited the International Monetary Fund &mdash; in their capacity as international consultants &mdash; to advise on the matter. This chapter is drafted against the background of that advice.  We support the chapter in principle but will consider putting forward amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In general we welcome the provisions of Chapter III.  We will introduce an amendment to section 21 on Committee Stage to seek to encourage farmers to increase beef herd numbers.</P>
      <P>We welcome the increase in benefit-in-kind relief on company cars proposed in section 22.  The motor car industry is extremely depressed at present.  Therefore, measures to stimulate demand for new cars are vital.  Moreover, we believe the Minister has not gone far enough.  I intend to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage, the purpose of which will be to assess benefit-in-kind on the engine capacity of company cars rather than on the market cost.  This will involve no extra charge on the Exchequer but will act as a stimulus to the sale of new cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the reintroduction of the provisions of section 23 of the Finance Act 1981, together with associated sections, in an attempt to stimulate the building industry but I do not believe it will have much effect because there are now so many tax avoidance devices available that were not available in 1981. Although it is my belief that the reintroduction of these provisions will not be effective, any measure to relieve the gloom of the battered building industry is to be welcomed.  I am confident that, when the news of the reintroduction of section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981, is carried on Radio Saudi Arabia members <Col N="1408" /> of Irish construction companies will pause in their labours, will turn towards Mecca and pray for the Taoiseach and his Ministers, remembering the balmy afternoon in the Berkeley Court Hotel when they were promised a 5 per cent VAT rate and an injection of £200 million into the construction industry.</P>

      <P>We support the changes proposed in corporation tax contained in Chapters IV and V.  The trading of reductions in accelerated capital allowances against lower rates of corporation tax is welcome.  I should like the Minister to provide full figures here.  It appears to me that the savings effected from the reductions in accelerated capital allowances would enable the Minister to reduce corporation tax to less than 40 per cent; the quid is there but the <i>pro quo</i> is not there in full. I should like the Minister to give us full details and figures in this respect because it is my opinion that the Minister could reduce the rate below 40 per cent rather than the 43 per cent proposed</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Chapter VI, I note that section 49 deals with the proposed pension fund levy.  This proposal is different from that contained in the budget and constitutes an improvement thereon. There are many aspects of this section I will wish to explore in the course of the Committee Stage debate.  The effect of the proposal on pension funds will vary.  I will be seeking assurances that no pension fund will be put at risk of insolvency by the implementation of his levy.  I shall <Col N="1409" /> also be asking the Minister to confirm that this measure is proposed for one year only.  I shall revert to this levy on Committee Stage.  But, as I understand the position, the exemptions now provided would exempt pension funds with an asset value of something in the region of £1 million.  I should like the Minister to give more detail on how the £5,000 answer to the mathematical formula contained in this Bill, providing the exemption, translates into the assets of a pension fund.  I think the relevant figure is of the order of £1 million.</P>
    <P>I shall discuss certain aspects of Chapter VI, Part I on Committee Stage.  My party are opposed to the provisions of section 54 which provide for the repeal of section 43 of the Finance Act 1968 which, in turn, provide for the remission of road tax on vehicles converted for use by disabled drivers.  Fine Gael see no good reason why this scheme should be moved beyond the remit of the Revenue Commissioners.  Our spokesman on Health, Deputy Allen, has already stated our policy on this matter.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are opposed to the proposals in section 58 to reduce further this yéar the percentage levels at which VAT is rebated to farmers not registered for VAT.  We opposed similar proposals in the 1987 Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The changes in VAT rebates in 1987 and 1988 are quite substantial.  They represent an extra tax take, in 12 months of more than £8 per statute acre.  Approximately 3,000 farmers are now registered for VAT.  They tend to be the larger or more specialised farmers.  Tax codes should be transparent and this proposal in section 58 is covert taxation.</P>
    <P>I turn now to section 62, which imposes a £10 stamp duty on bank accounts against which an ATM cashcard is issued. This is a variation on the budget proposal which sought to impose a £10 duty on the card rather than on the account.</P>
    <P>The proposal, in either manifestation, is most shortsighted.  Banking is expensive in this country.  Our banks need to cut their overhead costs.  Any tax discrimination against cost saving technology is contrary to the interests of both <Col N="1410" /> banks and customers.  Charges will increase and profits will fall.  Any movement from ATM service to counter service by customers will significantly increase payroll costs and will militate against the many advantages, both present and prospective, which ATM banking provides,</P>
    <P>Other issues also arise.  Workers in many companies have agreed to payment of wages by cheque rather than in cash. The security advantages of this are obvious. Claims by trade unions to allow workers time off during working hours to visit banks to cash cheques or draw cash are met in many companies by the provision of ATM cashcards, to enable workers to bank outside bank opening hours.  The imposition of the £10 duty reopens this industrial relations issue.</P>
    <P>All students, but paricularly students in receipt of ESF grants or VEC grants are particularly affected by this proposal. These grants are paid directly into bank accounts, and without an ATM cashcard it is difficult for students to withdraw money.  It was generally believed in this House that the Minister would not proceed with this proposal.  There was reason for this belief as remarks both by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach were interpreted by the media as signals that the Government had had second thoughts.  These interpretations were not contradicted.  I would like to hear the further views of the Minister on this stamp duty as I am sure he would be reluctant to have an election over a £10 note.  Section 69 is the most radical proposal in this Bill.  The powers which it proposes to give to the Revenue Commissioners are draconian and the Minister has not convinced me that they are necessary.  The power to attach and make deductions from payments due to tax defaulters, of amounts due in relation to tax, is an extreme measure.</P>
    <P>We will need to establish very clearly the scope of the proposal.  Will it enable the Revenue Commissioners to make deductions from payments due to farmers for delivery of milk to a dairy co-op or the sale of animals at a mart or to a meat factory, if the farmer is a tax defaulter? <Col N="1411" /> Will it enable the Revenue Commissioners to make deductions from the payments due by a customer to a company on foot of the supply of goods and services, if the company is a tax defaulter?  Will it enable the Revenue Commissioners to make deductions from money held by a solicitor in respect of the sale of property, if the vendor or purchaser is a tax defaulter?</P>
    <P>Previous Ministers for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners themselves have said that, when issuing assessments, they deliberately exaggerate the amounts they consider due, sometimes by as much as a factor of five, to encourage speedier tax returns.  Will this policy continue?  If it does will the exaggerated assessment be the basis for the attachment order?  If not, is it the amount owed, or the amount which in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners is owed, which is attachable?</P>
    <P>I note that money in a financial institution, held to the credit of a tax defaulter for his benefit, is considered a payment from which deductions can be made.  This raises serious issues.</P>
    <P>When the deposit interest retention tax was introduced, non-disclosure of accounts was extended to all financial institutions.  Will this now be changed? How can bank accounts be attached unless knowledge of who holds which account and how much is in it is available to the Revenue Commissioners?  Is full disclosure being introduced by the backdoor, without consideration of the ramifications of such a move?  If not, will the Revenue Commissioners go on a national trawl of financial institutions, by means of attachment orders, until they find an account to the benefit of the tax defaulter?  Will attachment orders be made to head offices of financial institutions rather than to individual branches, thus putting the onus on the institution to establish whether money to the benefit of a tax defaulter is held in any account under their auspices?  Is the post office a financial institution under the terms of this section?  Has the impact of this proposal on the availability of <Col N="1412" /> credit been examined?  If it has will the Minister inform the House of his conclusion? As the proposed section gives a prior right to the Revenue Commissioners over all other creditors, will the provision of credit in certain sectors of the economy quickly dry up?  Will this not have a very serious effect on certain economic activities and will not a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners, that tax is paid be in future a prerequisite for the obtaining of credit?</P>
    <P>The existing priority of the Revenue Commissioners in the liquidation of companies or in cases of bankruptcy is justified but I am uneasy that, without the winding up of a company, the Revenue Commissioners should now be given priority over all other creditors, which will have a most serious effect on the availability of normal trade credit in the economy.  Is it the intention that the powers of this section will be developed to Revenue sheriffs under subsection (18) of this section?</P>
    <P>I will have further more detailed questions on Committee Stage, in the meantime I expect the Minister for Finance to answer the questions I asked today, when he concludes this debate on Thursday.</P>
    <P>I have argued in the course of my speech that there will be no real improvement in our country in the absence of economic growth, and that the Government have not taken action to remove the obstacles to growth.  I would like to conclude by outlining briefly the financial situation as I see it and as the Government prepare the 1989 departmental Estimates.  The Minister briefly referred to the situation but I should like him to expand on it on Thursday.  My predictions are based on stable international interest rates and zero domestic growth.  The ongoing commitments of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are as follows: Pay will cost £80 million, social welfare £75 million, tax relief £75 million, i.e. a total of £230 million.  Each one per cent reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement will require £175 million in cuts.  To reduce the EBR to 6.2 per cent of GNP will require cuts of £350 million. As expenditure cuts have a negative <Col N="1413" /> buoyancy effect on revenue, gross cuts of almost £500 million will be necessary to do this.  The buoyancy effects of cuts required to fulfil the commitment of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are neutral.  Therefore, the Government need to make public expenditure cuts in excess of £700 million to continue the progress towards stabilisation of the debt GNP ratio.  A tall order indeed.  If that is the case, we should all know early in the year.</P>
    <P>If we take the once off measures introduced in the Finance Bill, Exchequer borrowing requirement will be around 8.9 per cent of GNP.  Therefore, I presume that the Government's starting point will be nearer to 9 per cent than to 8 per cent. Consequently, they will have further to travel to get down to 6 per cent.  Also, is an extra pay day looming in 1989 for the public service which will mean another £50 million or £60 million?</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would expand on his rather cryptic statement at the commencement of his speech today that cuts of similar magnitude to those made this year will have to be made next year.  Perhaps in 1988 we will achieve very high growth rate but the Minister did not seem to think so when he talked about GDP growth of between 0.5 and 1 per cent.  I presume that translates into a GNP growth rate of less than 1 per cent even at its most optimistic.  Perhaps there will be higher growth rates in 1989 but there is not much sign of that yet.  I hope too that if there is growth it will, unlike the growth rate of 1987, be bedded in the real economy and will have a real benefit on disposable income and consequently on the buoyancy of revenue.  Perhaps people will begin to spend their very high levels of savings and this will help the Minister in increased revenue buoyancy. However, I am worried about the magnitude of what is emerging.</P>
    <P>Another thing that worries me is that the Government have now established a long list of no-go areas when it comes to expenditure cuts.  As a result of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> they are committed to certain pay increases, social welfare increases and increased tax <Col N="1414" /> relief.  The serious effects of the cutbacks on health and education services over the past 12 months may make them reluctant to make further cuts in these areas.  The capital budget has been almost abolished so there is very little scope for cost cutting measures there.  The big question as we go through this Finance Bill is what the Government's intentions are for 1989 and where they will go to find in excess of £700 million of cuts in public expenditure. The economic agenda is extremely narrow at this point and it would be in all our interests and the interest of the country if the Minister were to extend the agenda along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill, as the last speaker pointed out, is not full of surprises except that in a global sense it is surprising that it has not addressed itself to some of the fundamental problems which confront our economy.  This is an occasion on which the Dáil makes its annual assessment of the taxation system. While, as has been pointed out, in many respects it is merely the implementation of the budget announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day, we must recognise it is the only occasion on which we, as legislators voted in by the people to make decisions about our tax system, have the opportunity to pass judgment on the system of taxation itself or to reform it for that matter.</P>
      <P>Viewed in the light of tax reform, this Bill is a very modest proposal indeed. While it is agreed that last year the Minister had to introduce a budget and Finance Bill in hurried circumstances which, it could be argued, prevented him from setting out any grand strategy for tax reform, the same excuse does not avail him this year.  That we have a taxation system which badly needs reform is generally agreed.  The Irish taxpayer faces the highest initial tax rate of all OECD countries and reaches the highest marginal tax rate experienced by any OECD paid taxpayer in the context of his country's annual average industrial wage.  The consequences of our cripplingly heavy tax burden are apparent to everybody throughout the industrialised world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> There is a dramatic shift to low standard rates of personal taxation which is not confined to Margaret Thatcher's Britain and it is not a matter of Lawsonomics, as they are now called.  It is not the hallmark of a sternly blue tinged Government because, as has been pointed out on many occasions in this House, there are increasing signs that Governments of a different political hue, for instance, the Labour Government in New Zealand, have seen the light and realised that in the context of taxation there are no longer in an increasingly interdependent world economy opportunities for fiscal independence of the kind which obtained heretofore.  Looking at an avowedly leftist Government such as those who hold power in New Zealand and what they propose in relation to personal taxation and the situation they had to confront in terms of massively increasing public indebtedness, a small population and an agriculturally based economy with many features similar to our own, one thing becomes remarkably clear.</P>
    <P>Tax reform will not be a reward for economic and financial fiscal stringency and rectitude.  It will not be the fruit of a recovery.  In my and my party's view it is part of the process towards recovery itself.  There will be no substantial recovery while the fiscal climate is hostile to economic activity.  There will be no progress towards creating employment and greater participation in the economic life of the country if we wait for tax reform as an unexpected bonus, as the light at the end of a tunnel through which we are travelling.  That is a mistaken understanding. Tax reform must be part of the process of recovery, not its fruit, and we are making a big mistake as a Legislature if we believe we can postpone tackling the taxation issue until some time when we believe there will be more room to manoeuvre.</P>
    <P>There is never room to manoeuvre politically except perhaps when 80 per cent of a parliament are willing to support a programme of radical tax reform.  Political circumstances are more important <Col N="1416" /> in many respects than economic circumstances. When will there be political circumstances more conducive to radicalism on the part of a Government than those obtaining now?  Even if we had a snap election and even if right around to where I sit was occupied by Government Deputies, would there be more opportunity for radicalism?  Is it in some sense the case that the minority status of this Government forces them to be fiscally conservative now?  I do not believe that is the case.  I believe that now is the time and opportunities are being lost daily in this House to take the necessary radical steps.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Noonan's statement that incremental tax reform is not possible and is a strategy which is probably politically self-defeating.  I agree with him entirely that a population will not take to incremental tax reform where they can perceive all the negative consequences and none of the positive consequences of a tax reform package.  I agree entirely with his thinking that there is no such political opportunity as that created by putting together a major package of taxation reform and putting it before the people as one &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; measure. That is the experience internationally of Governments both right and left.  If you want to achieve a radical transformation of the taxation system you must present a package.</P>
    <P>Viewed in this light, the Government have proposed as their fiscal target a tax reform which means effectively that 66 per cent of people should be paying tax at the standard rate.  That means 33 per cent of taxpayers should remain above the standard rate of taxation.  Given that last year 43 per cent of people were paying tax above the standard rate, we are really talking about changing the marginal rate of 10 per cent of taxpayers. That is not the stuff of which a radical tax reform is made, whereas it can be achieved by small movements this way and that of the bands and does not require a dramatic transformation in the tax base itself, in the method of calculation of taxable income, or in the allowances or deductions which can be made by people. <Col N="1417" /> The proposal to bring 66 per cent of people to the standard rate of income tax presented by itself is not a worthy aim and is one which will prove in the last analysis, if achieved, not to have remedied the really damaging effects of the Irish taxation system.</P>
    <P>The introduction of self-assessment for the self-employed and the realistic amnesty which the Minister proposes are welcome developments which have been advocated by my party since its foundation. I commend the Minister for them and I commend him also for the proposal to put in place attachment orders for noncomplying taxpayers.  That was a proposal which my party were the first to make and it was also set out in the report of the Commission on Taxation, as the Minister has pointed out.  It is a necessary weapon in the armoury of the Revenue Commissioners but, as Deputy Noonan has said, it is a draconian measure.</P>
    <P>One of the things which sometimes strikes me &mdash; and I hope it is not too cynical a thought &mdash; is that the reason we have to some extent been able to cohabit with the viciously progressive system of taxation this country has endured for the last decade at least is the inefficiency of the revenue system.  When the revenue system becomes more efficient and gets all these new weapons and tools to do its job more efficiently, as it indeed deserves, the pressure for tax reform and the political necessity to reform the tax system will grow.  It is not simply a matter of the increased yield from taxation, due to efficiency in its collection and the ending of avoidance, evasion or default, being made available to reduce tax.  The very fact of the Revenue Commissioners being able to recover money quickly, operating efficiently and being in a position to extract payments due to the Exchequer will, by itself, increase the pressure for tax reform because of its consequences.</P>
    <P>In relation to the attachment procedure it is worth pointing out that in many respects it will be used by people to force payment to them on an advance <Col N="1418" /> basis, rather than that which was previously agreed, in order to defray tax bills.  If I owe the Revenue Commissioners money and another person owes me money I can inform the Revenue that that debt is due to me and in that sense I can make the Revenue Commissioners my debt collector and get money from people who thought they were, due to commercial positions or commercial strength, in a position to resist pressure of one kind or another. I would instance the case of a supplier supplying goods to a supermarket chain but who is owed money by them.  He will be able to do things to the supermarket chain in future which he could not have done in the past.  All he has to do is to hand details of the moneys owing to him to the Revenue Commissioners and secure payments.  There will be some people who will be surprised by the consequences of that.  I am aware that in some circumstances certain credit terms are allowed but where these have been exceeded and where the sum is due there will be a sort of domino effect in terms of people using the Revenue Commissioners as collectors for their own debtors.</P>
    <P>In relation to the withholding tax on professional fees the Commission on Taxation suggested that withholding taxes should be used as widely as possible where it was fair to do so.  I have no objection to withholding taxes in principle. However, the effect of the measures introduced last year was to slap many sorely pressed individuals on to what was in effect emergency rate taxation.  This is causing hardship and the Minister admitted on two occasions in questioning from me in this House earlier this year, that virtually no moneys have been returned on foot of the hardship clauses.  The consequence is that a considerable number of people, and they are not the wealthy, in real terms they are frequently young professional people who are providing services through the GMS who do not have a large margin on which to work and who have a considerable number of liabilities have been put onto emergency taxation.  That is the consequence of the <Col N="1419" /> withholding tax.  In many cases it is proving to be unjust in operation.</P>
    <P>It is logical, however, if you are going to apply the withholding tax to medical fees funded by the State to seek equity among various recipients and I believe it would be illogical and unfair if people were to be treated very differently on the basis that they were providing medical services directly for the State or through a State insurance system.  To many people, the direct financial relationship between doctors and their patients is not as sacrosanct as is now being claimed.  The VHI is for many people seen as virtually the equivalent of a State voluntary health insurance system.  They do not see themselves as dealing on a private basis with their own medical practitioner.  In that context there is something to be said for achieving equity as between different members of the medical profession.  I see a huge difficulty in that since the sums are to be recovered directly from the patient, since there will be a cash flow problem, since there is no effective way of controlling the sums charged by a consultant to his patient and since the moneys paid by the VHI are recognised only to be a part reimbursement for the moneys due by the patient to the consultant in many cases, it seems that there is a very significant danger that fees will be increased to take account of the financial embarrassment which the withholding tax will cause to many members of the medical profession whose incomes are chiefly derived from voluntary health insurance and that the loser in this process will be the patient.  It is all very well for the State to apply withholding tax to the fees of barristers appearing for the Director of Public Prosecutions because it was not open to the Bar to say: &ldquo;We will increase our fees to the Director of Public Prosecutions in those circumstances and that will relieve us of the embarrassment caused by the withholding tax&rdquo;.  In the case of an individual who has a direct financial relationship or the right to call for a direct payment from the person on behalf of whom he is providing the professional service, it <Col N="1420" /> seems to me that he has an indirect method open to him of reimbursing himself for the real cost to him of the increased tax load implicit in the withholding tax system.  As Deputy Noonan said, and I agree with him completely, no indemnity is worth anything to a person in those circumstances because the pressure to pay the specialist's fees does not derive from the threat of legal action.  It has much more to do with moral pressure and the relationship of trust and a human relationship between the doctor and the patient or the doctor and the patient's wife, husband or parent and in those circumstances it seems there is an opportunity which the Minister should be aware of for people to get around the effect of this particular imposition of taxation by moving the cost elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The arrangements in relation to hospital consultants' fees are extremely clumsy.  I hope the Minister will accept proposals for their simplification if not in the course of this debate, on some other occasion.  Something must be done to make the system more safe from the point of view of the patient and more orientated towards keeping their financial interests in the foreground.</P>
    <P>Nor is comparison of our tax system with those of other countries simply an opportunity for fiscal envy.  We have, on many occasions recently, read many newspaper editorials on how the British budget was unfair, imbalanced or whatever. For me it is not simply a matter of coming to a view that I would prefer to live in a low tax economy.  In the context of the Single European Act we have to face up not merely to harmonisation of indirect taxation but also to the equally strong economic pressures there will be for harmonisation of direct taxation.  Of course they are not part of our obligations under the treaty or under the Single European Act but if the fiscal climate is very much less favourable in an economy from which capital enterprise and labour can freely move to a nearby and more favourable fiscal climate, by necessary implication there is a curtailment on our direct taxation sovereignty.  We cannot act anymore as if we were an island in <Col N="1421" /> relation to direct taxation.  We live in a Europe where direct taxation is on the way down and is being standardised at low rates.  It is not open to Ireland as an economic option to carry on with our tax system the way it is.  We deceive ourselves in the context of the Single European Act if we think that Ireland can possibly maintain cripplingly high rates of tax on work, investment and essential inputs such as energy and telecommunications costs without repelling foreign investment and exporting economic activity itself.  No amount of EC subsidies can redress an economic imbalance which arises out of a hostile fiscal climate for investment, work and savings.  Nor can we expect to be accorded a totally one-sided treatment by the Community in the context of a single Europe.</P>
    <P>There is no point in repeatedly heralding and applauding the very welcome doubling of the Community's regional and social funding for this country while at the same time maintaining that we will not have anything to do with tax harmonisation because of the cost of this process to the Irish Exchequer.  Although the Single European Act commits us to a process of harmonisation of indirect taxation, I believe the Government are in error in persisting in the position that Ireland cannot afford harmonisation. The cost is put in today's paper at £470 million and it is suggested that we cannot afford this as a consequence of economic or fiscal adjustment in the context of the Single European Act.  I would express the opposite view.  I suggest that Ireland cannot afford not to adopt a strategy the purpose of which is to ensure that this island is on broadly equal terms with the rest of Europe as a location for investment in economic activity.  That involves changing our direct and indirect taxation. It is our view that our geographical disadvantages must be compensated for and not compounded by our tax system.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake too to assume that the money foregone by VAT and excise harmonisation is money thrown away by the Exchequer.  In any event there would be an element of buoyancy in tax receipts <Col N="1422" /> which would inevitably arise from harmonisation or at the very least from a proximation of tax rates.  Secondly, the tax base in Ireland is narrow and has to be widened.  Thirdly, the moneys gone must be spent by the beneficiaries, the people who are no longer taxed at the high rates we have for indirect taxation. Although one has to accept that the pattern of expenditure will be more importoriented and less likely to be spent on essential services now provided by the State either free or heavily subsidised, it is my view that this country has to undergo a political revolution, a revolution of political attitude.  The State, in the context of the European Community and the Single European market, cannot afford to give to the haves, and therefore as between the haves and the have nots there must be a focusing of the redistributive function of Government.  The haves will have to realise that the consequences of low taxation are low subsidy and low handouts from the State.  That is the inexorable consequence of a low tax regime.  It is not a choice that is open to us to make.  We cannot opt out of the general world drift in direct or indirect taxation.  We can only steer a slightly different course and then only to a very marginal extent.  Those are iron laws of economics by which we are bound, like it or not.  No amount of whingeing about fairness or unfairness in relation to low rates of taxation can undo the fact that we are only a few minutes flight from an economy which has a wholly different tax structure.  We cannot expect resources, people or enterprise to remain in this country regardless of the disadvantage in relation to taxation under which they labour.  We cannot expect that our economy can follow an entirely different course with high personal taxation and high indirect taxation without regard to the consequences.</P>
    <P>This means that we have to make some very harsh political decisions, not harsh in the sense of taking away from the have nots in society but harsh in terms of destroying our own illusions about the services and the degree of redistribution which can be given to the haves.  In <Col N="1423" /> addition to other features I have mentioned and the £470 million implicit in the harmonisation of VAT rates, we have to take into account that there will be an economic benefit in direct transfer payments arising from the doubling of the Regional and Social Funds.  I accept that the money will mainly be expended on capital projects and will be of little assistance to the State in funding current liabilities but in the last analysis in terms of total resources available to the economy as opposed to the Government, we must take this into account.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to reduce the higher rates of corporation tax.  I agree with Deputy Noonan that it is possible that the robbing Peter to pay Paul process in relation to capital allowances and the rate of corporation tax may not have been entirely resolved in favour of the taxpayer.  There may not be a strict equality between the concessions given and the reduction but that remains to be seen.  If we believe in a sane and rational defensible system of corporation tax and tax in general we must hope to see the day when corporation tax will also approximate at the standard rate of income tax.  I believe that will inevitably be in the region of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reintroduction of section 23 reliefs.  When I suggested this last year I got fairly short shrift from the Minister but I am glad he has changed his mind on the matter.  In the context of urban renewal section 23 reliefs are not sufficient. The Government rightly got rid of the Metropolitan Streets Commission, a body with very limited powers and a limited lifespan, but unless there is a positive active urban renewal corporation with powers to acquire and develop land and to infill sites with the co-operation of the private sector many of these incentives will go unused and will not realise their full potential.</P>
    <P>One of the most disappointing features of this Finance Bill is the duty on the automatic teller machine cards.  My reasons for suggesting that this measure is foolish are sixfold.  It increases the need <Col N="1424" /> for liquid cash in the economy and there by keeps money away from investment. It prevents the development of the banking sector in accordance with modern trends.  It retards the law in relation to the reform of wage payments.  It imposes extra security costs on the State, the banking sector, employers and traders.  It prevents the establishment in Ireland of the cashless society.  It militates against overdue reform in relation to unnecessary overmanning in the banking sector. The same revenue could easily have been generated by a different form of levy on the banks, be it in the form of an increased levy on cheque cards or increased cheque duty or a combination of both.  There is some merit in the position the Minister advances that there has to be some yield from the financial services sector in terms of tax to the economy and that the tax yield is, relatively speaking, low.</P>
    <P>This measure is a retrograde step.  The consequences of it will be that a process which was accelerating will be retarded. In particular, it will be retarded in the places where it could have done most good &mdash; stop the payment of wages in cash, stop the necessity to send people from factories up and down to banks with £2,000 or £3,000 in their cars, stop people from having to lay out on tables large sums of money and run around the table with pennies and coins in their hands, stop robberies and also stop wasting people's time, which is an additional imposition on the cost of employment and manufacturing in this country.  These things could and should have been avoided.  The Progressive Democrats will oppose that measure and if the other Members of the House also oppose it the Government would be well advised to think of an alternative way to raise those moneys.</P>
    <P>In relation to the taxation of pension funds, it seems to me that nobody but the most gullible could possibly believe that this is intended as a once-off levy.  The measure is discriminatory in that it punishes those who have made provision for their pensions by saving.  I should like to remind the Minister that there are many <Col N="1425" /> people, particularly those in the public service, who have unfunded pensions. There are particular cases to which people with longish memories can point where people decided to work for a semi-State body with a funded pension fund, on the one hand, or opted, on the other hand, to remain employees of State bodies.  People in one of those groups are now going to have a 6 per cent levy on the income of their pension funds while people in the other group are going to carry on with an unfunded pension which is much more expensive in many ways to the taxpayer and does not represent the same degree of savings or effort on the part of those persons.</P>
    <P>Even with the reforms the Minister has suggested and the exclusion from the system of the vast majority of small pension funds and individual persons pension funds, it still seems to be wrong to tax the so-called income from pension funds which, in fact, is calculated without reference to the solvency of those funds or to their liabilities.  Many Irish pension funds are, technically speaking, insolvent in that their present liability or anticipated future liabilities are unlikely to be met for many years by the assets available to them.  In that context, to go to trustees, which pension funds really are, and to take from them 6 per cent of their income when they are not providing adequately for the obligations which they have undertaken and when the money would, when finally paid, in any event be taxable in the hands of the recipients is unfair and discriminatory, This part of the Finance Bill should be, and will be, opposed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The proposal to end the excise rebates for disabled drivers is an example of a harsh and insensitive economy.  The health boards to whom an alternative scheme is to be entrusted simply do not have the resources to fund the alternative. Anybody who is conversant with the position of health boards, who knows what they do and do not have to do with their money and the pressures that are on them in relation to the application of the resources available to them will understand immediately that to take <Col N="1426" /> from the Department of Finance the administration of the scheme in these circumstances and to hand it over to what is in effect a frontline agency labouring under extreme difficulties is inevitably putting the whole scheme into danger.</P>
    <P>I know it sounds a bit ridiculous to give a person who is immensely wealthy excise rebates or a deal in terms of tax, irrespective of his or her needs, but implicit in any scheme of general application is the problem that some people who do not need it will receive it.  On the other hand, for the disabled &mdash; those people who have difficulty moving about and who have difficulty walking ten yards, if they can walk at all &mdash; the very process of participating in the economic life of the country, getting to and from work, not remaining at home and not needing help, is a daily struggle.  Society is making a mistake in removing from them a financial incentive which was designed to increase their mobility in order that they could lead as normal a life as possible in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister when he says this is not a money saving measure. I believe it is a money saving measure. There is no clamour on the part of any group in society for this change and if there is no clamour for change and if the motivation for it comes from the Government, in the last analysis the only explanation I can think of is that it is motivated by economic considerations.</P>

      <P>I was replying to what the Minister said in his speech, that it was not a cost cutting measure.  I was indicating that I disagreed with him and thought it was a cost cutting measure.  I may be right or I may be wrong but I am entitled to express my view if he is entitled to express the contrary view.</P>
      <P>I should indicate that the Finance Bill, as presently drafted, contains a number of matters which will be opposed by the Progressive Democrats.  I ask the Minister, in particular in relation to those matters which I have addressed, to show some flexibility and not to make them a matter of confrontation in this House. Under the rules of this House we cannot put down amendments to show where the money could come from alternatively, even in relation to the stamp duty on the ATM cards, but I have no doubt that the money is available and that a fairer system could be devised.  We will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage but we will oppose the individual measures to which I have referred: the pension fund levy, because it is improperly worked out; the ATM cards; and the proposal to reform the law in relation to disabled drivers.  I ask the Minister to consider between now and Committee Stage whether, in relation to the individual matters which are not at the heart of the Finance Bill in any real sense, he could see his way to qualifying them or altering them with a view to taking on board what I believe is the consensus view of this House that they are, as presently drafted, misconceived to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chapter II of the Bill in relation to the first element of self-assessment is a tremendous achievement. It marks the beginning of sanity in our tax system. The rules which heretofore obtained whereby one could get away with anything and it was up to the Revenue Commissioners to discover it are beginning to end and the process of self-assessment, though not completed here, is so necessary to any real tax reform in this country and the revolution of attitudes in respect <Col N="1429" /> of the obligations of people to the Revenue Commissioners.  It would be churlish of me not to congratulate the Minister on introducing those measures at this stage.</P>

      <P>The one memorable phrase in the contribution of our colleague, Deputy McDowell, was his reference to the iron claw of economics. The last time I heard that was in an Alf Garnett television programme.  The sacrosanct aroma that one tends to give to the iron claw of economics in this House requires some sober analysis.  For example, what is so ironclad about a principle whereby out of some 50,000 companies registered in this country only about 9,000 pay any tax at all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Alf Garnett must certainly be the main shareholder in 40,000 of them because he seems to pay no tax. I have not believed that there is a particular unique taxation system whereby, in order to run an economy such as we run in this country, we have to give £900 million last year in specialised tax relief to industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the reduced manufacturing tax rate of 10 per cent cost some £124 million in lost revenue to the Exchequer.  We have a unique export sales tax relief which costs us the best part of £400 million in 1987.  We have this glorious section 84 tax-based lending to allow the banks to get away with murder in the international financial services sector which we will come to later on. What do we do?  We are so worried that the banks here might not be making money that we have to introduce section 84 tax-based lending which helps the banks to reduce their tax bills.  Allegedly <Col N="1430" /> this money is passed on to industry but in practice it is a device to help the banks to pay less tax and that cost us this year over £70 million.  By the time we are finished with the Custom House Docks site it would be up to about £90 million without a job in sight.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that there are many tax reliefs in existence which have been built up over the years by successive Governments and which have never been the subject of a truly rigorous examination in terms of their impact on enterprise, their impact on employment, their impact on entrepreneurial endeavour, in terms of what makes a person become an entrepreneur and engage in industry and exports and create employment, enjoy the operation in the process and contribute enormously to the economy. Instead, we have a succession of Finance Bills which bear very little real relationship to our economic and social development.</P>
    <P>We have a uniquely unbalanced tax system.  We have PAYE workers who have an income tax number stamped, so to speak, on their backs every week; tax is deducted at source and they have no escape.  Simultaneously we have virtually a &ldquo;no tax&rdquo; regime for the agricultural sector or the fisheries sector.  We have a unique anomaly, carefully protected by successive Taoisigh and Ministers for Finance, whereby we have a bloodstock industry which offers a tax haven to the super rich; those who can afford to have a few horses pay no tax at all.</P>
    <P>If one looks at farm tax generally, this year it is purely nominal even after the introduction of the 3 per cent PRSI and income tax.  If one takes the reduction in VAT refunds, the total situation still remains that for about every £ we get in tax from the farming community we give back directly about £15 in subsidies.  That is the reality.  There is virtually a non-tax regime in agriculture.  While last year farmers paid about £40 million in income tax there was still about 12 times that given back in social subsidies.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am sorry to have to say to the Minister for Finance, a most assiduous Minister for Finance, that he has lost <Col N="1431" /> a double opportunity.  He lost one last year in the 1987 Finance Bill.  He has lost the opportunity again this year to bring in very fundamental reforms in terms of a population paying its taxes and I am not very sanguine about self-assessment. The capacity of Irish people to avoid and evade payment of tax is unique in western Europe and self-assessment is not going to cure the malaise despite the confident predictions that it may do.  In fact, I would nearly predict that it may make a bad situation worse.</P>
    <P>We now have a two-tier tax system whereby those in certain income categories pay very little in taxation and those in the PAYE net pay very substantial levels in income taxation.  We have heard a great deal about a two-tier health system.  We have it all over the place.  It does not matter whether we are talking about health where there is £48 million in tax relief to the VHI and the sole contribution of that tax relief is to enable people to jump the queue, to get ahead of a public patient in hospital.  If that £48 million was maintaining the public system there would be a degree of parity, of equality of treatment.  That is the reality and one could take it right down the line.</P>
    <P>If you have enough money you can have higher education for your children convenanted and you will get very substantial tax relief.  You will be able to afford that level of higher education. There is a two-tier system of education in operation at that level.  If you want better housing and have substantial disposable income &mdash; while admittedly there is a ceiling on mortgage interest relief &mdash; there is a standard rate in operation and you can gain substantial benefit at the top marginal rate as far as mortgage interest relief is concerned.  Such mortgage interest relief is costing this year about £160 million.</P>
    <P>The fundamental reforms are really difficult to bring in politically.  This tricking around with pass cards to the extent of £6 million is a cosmetic exercise.  The very necessary fundamental reforms in our taxation system have not been introduced in the Finance Bills of 1987 or <Col N="1432" /> 1988.  The bringing in of self-assessment is no cure for the breakdown in the administrative system of tax collection. As we know, the system has been giving at the seams in recent years.  The Bill has provision for a degree of PAYE tax relief, but I am not happy about its extent or the manner in which it will be applied.</P>
    <P>There are married couples living on about £7,000 a year.  Many politicians and economists believe in a low wage economy.  I think we have one such politician here.  There are others who believe in a low social welfare economy.  They believe that if you keep depressing the social welfare benefit the so and so's will go out and get jobs.  The philosophy is to cut social welfare and the unemployed will get up off their backsides and get jobs and simultaneously to cut tax at the top level for those at the 58 per cent rate or those with perhaps £50,000 a year, give them a huge lump of tax relief and they will keenly go out to create jobs. The proletariat, who are presumed to be too lazy to work, will get jobs through the wonderful entrepreneurs getting tax relief.  Such Thatcherism is rampant here now.  It has virtually an 80 per cent political endorsement, but not a public endorsement.  This Thatcherism, this Norman Tebbittism, is imported into this country in the belief that if you reduce social welfare payments people will seek work and become mad devotees of the phrase &ldquo;incentive to work&rdquo;.  The fact that this social value is perverse and wrong in terms of an iron law of economics does not seem to matter.  The public perception is that we live in a society where it is dog eat dog and if my neighbour has no job, no bread on the table, no Sunday joint, that is his problem.  When it comes to taxation and taxation relief the cry is &ldquo;give me back my money.  I see no reason why I should pay for anybody else who might be unemployed, or on low income, or suffering illness or the trauma of old age.&rdquo;  We the politicians have pandered to an enormous degree to this philosophy. We have even set up a political party to cater for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental philosophy behind the Finance Bill which must be exposed.  Let us take the £91 million in tax relief as an example.  If you are earning £15,000 to £20,000 a year, you get some relief; if you are earning from £6,000 to £14,000 a year you get a paltry £1.40 a week.  The Bill has been drafted in favour of the better off.  Married couples with one spouse working, earning from £6,000 to £14,000 a year, will get a miserable £70 per annum.  Couples earning £15,000 to £30,000 a year will have a reduction, on average, of not less than £411 per annum.  That is some social equity.  That is what gives the Government a 43 per cent support in the opinion polls.  Those who have want more and will vote for that down the line and those who have not are not around to participate in opinion polls because they are so busy trying to earn a few bob and are not particularly impressed by opinion polls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reality. There are not many middle class people carrying out opinion polls going into the homes of the deprived, many of whom have lost the facility even to fill in the forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to a statement made by the Minister for Finance, namely that this year the volume of GDP is expected to grow between one half per cent and 1 per cent.  That is a strange contrast to what the Minister said last year in his Finance Bill, which was: &ldquo;Money is flowing back into the economy and this will be reflected in new investment and new job <Col N="1434" /> opportunities.&rdquo;  There has been no money flowing back into this economy.  As the Minister well knows, there was a zero growth last year in the volume of consumer expenditure.  In retail sales last year there was a drop of 1.7 per cent. You can talk to any shopkeeper who will endorse that.  In investment expenditure there was a drop of 1 per cent last year. There was a drop in Government expenditure, in Government overall consumption, of 2.25 per cent.  Far from there being new job opportunities, there was a fall of 1.5 per cent in employment. We had an increase in unemployment of 4.6 per cent.  That was the outcome in 1987 of the Finance Bill which enshrined that philosophy.  There was growth this year of a half of 1 per cent in GDP.  Of course, that means a drop of 1 per cent in GDP overall at the end of 1988.  That is an admission at this stage of the year that our economy is still in a substantial decline.  That is something that is quite alarming in terms of economic policy. The Minister in his speech says:</P>
    <P>It is fair to say, however, that the adjustment will have to be of significant proportions, probably of the same order of magnitude as in 1988.</P>
    <P>I was accused last week of being irresponsible, mischief-making and of scaring the daylights out of the elderly when I predicted that about £150 million was being sighted in the guns of the new review body headed up by the Department of Finance, for the expenditure review commencing now, in terms of budgeting for 1989.  I was assailed as being utterly irresponsible.  The Minister on the Finance Bill tonight admitted that I was correct in what I said.  The Minister said also in his speech:</P>
    <P>Arrangements for a repeat of last year's expenditure review procedures, with a view to securing the necessary savings, are already in train.</P>
    <P>We all know that the bulk of expenditure reductions in 1988 have not yet come through this year.  In the autumn, at local authority level and at education level, the Minister will face a very traumatic period <Col N="1435" /> as the people who are currently expressing satisfaction with the Government are affected, as with a dose of salts, from the working through of the cuts in health, social welfare and in education.  Looking at the sums for next year, we know that the Minister is giving a little preview in his speech of what is in store for us.  We should consider the £70 million of public service pay for next year, plus £28 million in increments, plus £15 million on special payments, which are inevitable, plus the fact that it is not envisaged that the Minister will go ahead next year with the pensions levy which will bring in £16.5 million this year.  In the heel of the hunt the Minister will reinstate this levy next year because he will have no option, depsite his once-off implication today.</P>
    <P>We should also consider that the Minister for Education, having made a bags of the Education Estimate, has overshot by about £17 million for 1988 already, according to first budget trends report which the Minister got.  We should also remember that there is a carry over into 1988 of at least £55 million on the social welfare increase given in the budget and that there is a requirement of £60 million for a full year's tax relief in addition to the tax relief in this Finance Bill.  We should also add to all of that this giveaway of benefit in kind on motor vehicles which this year will cost a miserable £600,000 but which will cost the Minister £7 million next year, and £14 million the year after. One should also add the fact that the Minister screwed £31 million this year from the ESB &mdash; the ESB were much less politically kind to us &mdash; but that he will not get it next year because that was a once-off capital repayment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude my comment on this note.  When one adds all this <Col N="1436" /> up one can readily see why the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance are working themselves up into their mid-year tizzy for further major reductions in the area of public expenditure. My comment of last week was responsible and appropriate and was a warning in due time to the people of what is to be expected.  One would have thought in that circumstance that the Minister would have been very circumspect in the Finance Bill and that he would not give away much.</P>
      <P>If there is one giveaway which is a public national, and international scandal it is in relation to the Custom House Docks site.  I was involved in negotiations on the Custom House Docks site as was Deputy Noonan.  We were involved in a responsible manner.  We are directly concerned with the revitalisation of the inner city areas of Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and the Custom House end of the Dublin area.  With that in mind we brought in four specific tax reliefs as a major incentive for that area.  We offered full remission of rates for ten years in relation to new buildings.  That is a substantial relief.  We considered that carefully and we had lots of memoranda from the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance right through 1985 and 1986 in relation to that. Looking at it calmly and without panic we then agreed that if people built on that site and put up substantial reconstructed and reinstated buildings and the value of those buildings shot up to perhaps five times their original value, we would give a full remission for a further ten years on the increase on the valuation of reconstructed buildings.  That was a very generous concession to get things moving on the Customs House Docks site.  In addition we gave capital allowances for commercial development, on capital expenditure incurred on commercial buildings and structures, namely buildings used for the purpose of carrying out any trade, profession, business or other undertaking.  We agreed that these allowances would apply in relation to the Custom House Docks site and all the designated areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> As the Minister knows, in 1986 we decided in relation to capital allowances that an allowance of 100 per cent would apply to the Custom House Docks site and in designated areas other than in Dublin the allowance would be 50 per cent.  Finally, we decided to give a double rent allowance against trading income. These allowances were to apply within five years of the approval of a planning scheme for this site.  That was generosity over and above the normal allowances for designated areas, in the case of the Custom House Docks site.  That was a major package of incentives.  We published this package and got a reasonable response and a reasonable degree of interest.  The Taoiseach in his pre-election advice when, for the first time in his political career, he became enamoured of financial advisers and economists of stock exchange ilk, decided to go one better.  The Taoiseach did not give a package of four specific propositions.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach decided that he would have to introduce a few more biggies in the Finance Act, 1987, to attract the big boys in, not just the Bank of Ireland who were going to set up there anyway because of the rates reliefs.  In the 1987 Finance Act the 10 per cent rate of CPT was extended to cover income derived from certified international financial services which were to be carried on at the Custom House Docks site. One outstanding Senator of stockbroking fame smiled when he read about that in 1987.  I know bankers and the economists advising them who could not believe their ears when they heard that they would pay CPT at a rate of 10 per cent if they transferred their treasury transactions out of, say, Irish Life to the Custom House Docks site.  Two licences have been issued to date and the IDA have been driving the Chase Bank out of their minds in an effort to get them to make an announcement.  They made this announcement at a conference in London just to keep them happy.  That was concession No. 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concession No. 7 was given on the day before the contract was signed for the building of the international financial services centre.  The big boys put the screws <Col N="1440" /> on the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and his officials and told them they were going to go back to London, while the Irish banks consortium told them they were going back to Baggot Street or Ballbridge &mdash; they did not have very far to go.  They demanded from the Government further concessions in respect of group relief which the Minister for Finance conceded abjectly against the advice of his Department.  In reply to a question which I put down to the Minister in respect of the Custom House Docks site on 17 February 1988 the Minister said and I quote from the Official Report, Volume 378, 121:</P>
    <P>. . . the development consortium and the Customs House Docks Development Authority sought an assurance that no restrictions would be placed administratively or otherwise upon the capacity of the owners of the buildings to be provided in the area to claim capital allowances on the buildings in question under section 42 of the Finance Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>Do you remember section 42 of the Finance Act, 1986?  I remember it; we had many a discussion in Government on it. The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>This assurance was given by me and is reflected in the proposed changes in the corporation tax code announced in my Budget Statement of 27 January last, specifically as regards group relief. It is not possible at this early stage in the development of the Customs House Docks area to estimate the cost in terms of tax foregone of the concession given, but I am satisfied that it was necessary in order to ensure the success of this very worth while development.</P>
    <P>That was concession No. 7 but still the big boys would not bite.  The Taoiseach is off to New York again where he is going to meet a few more &mdash; more chased than Chase &mdash; and he will endeavour to make a further announcement on further people coming to the Customs House Docks site.  In the meantime the Minister <Col N="1441" /> has issued two licences and 24 are awaiting approval in principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that we will get the figure up to 24 when the other concessions are given.  I will now go on to deal with concession No. 8.  The Minister has now decided, under section 33 of this Bill, that the requirement in regard to activities which are carried on in the Custom House Docks area located in temporary accommodation not owned by the relevant company pending the availability of suitable premises is to be removed.  Why is the Minister removing the requirement?  We argued about this last year.  The Minister inserted it into the Finance Bill last year and is now taking it out this year.  Why?  Because, again, some of the big boys have told him, financially speaking to get stuffed and that they will not set up there unless that provision is also taken out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to concession No. 9. We have reached a concept, not a new concept because the number of chancers in this game have to be not just seen but met to be believed, of speculative commodity trading.  There are individuals who are engaged in speculative commodity trading and they have no intention of going down to the Custom House Docks site unless the 10 per cent CPT rate applies to them also, and fair dues to them.  I do not see why they should not get in on the act.  If others have got away with it why should they not get away with it?  They have said to the Minister for Finance: we will go down there too; we will even come home from America and from London and will go down there if the 10 per cent CPT applies to us.  We <Col N="1442" /> have to out-do Nigel Lawson, Norman Tebbit, Margaret Thatcher and even Ronald Reagan in terms of tax appreciation and we have to apply the 10 per cent CPT rate to speculative commodity trading which, as the Minister has said &mdash; I like his phrase &mdash; is essentially financial in nature.  That is another one of those Department of Finance definitions.</P>
    <P>We then come to concession No. 10. Section 34 allows a deduction for tax purposes for interest on loans paid by a company in the centre to non-resident parent companies.  If I were living in Cork in a barren industrial estate like Ringaskiddy, at this stage I would be going for a long walk off that pier.  I would be saying to myself, how in the name of God are we going to get all those concessions?</P>
    <P>I now come to concession No. 11. Section 35 grants an exemption from withholding taxes on interest payments made by companies in the centre to lenders outside Ireland.  I know a person who went to England with £800,000 but the English would not take the money from him because they thought it was stolen or subversive money and they sent him back home with it.  He went to the Revenue Commissioners and gave them £0.5 million.  He has £300,000 left and his conscience is now clear.</P>

      <P>No, he wanted to avoid paying tax here.  The reality is that one can set up one's lender outside Ireland and make an interest payment to that company.  The Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the special certification advisory committee will not know about it.  One can then borrow money from there, pay interest and avoid DIRT and withholding taxes on interest payments made.  It is simple enough.  It is like PARC, a subsidiary of <Col N="1443" /> Aer Lingus, saying to nurses; if you come to Baghdad we will pay your money into the Isle of Man and you will not have any income tax liability.  That actually happens and that is an interesting matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what we called a mixed economy.  That brings me to concession No. 12.  I have sympathy for the Minister for Finance.  I remember a famous Minister for Education in this House who used to have an announcement every day but after the first 100 days he ran out of them and after the next 100 days he was nearly run out of Government. The Taoiseach wants to have this great, unique, special, entrepreneurial example glittering down on the seafront of Dublin with all those yuppies coming in on their short haul flights, buzzing down the runway from London and back again, namely the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, the Minister for Finance must be embarrassed, to say the least, because no sooner was the Finance Bill published than the people of my namesake got at him again and said: &ldquo;We have to give a few more incentives.  Irish Life are acting bolshie.&rdquo;  The Government cannot make up their mind whether or not to privatise that company.  It is a dicey political decision because the unions might get truculent and the <i>National Programme for Recovery</i> might be in a terrible state.  They, therefore, decide to bring the insurance companies into this operation which I regard as nothing more <Col N="1444" /> than an international financial scam.  That is what this measure is all about.  I will come to the tax foregone in a moment.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister going to do?  This measure is so rushed through that he has not even put it into the Bill for Second Stage debate.  He is going to bring it in on Committee Stage.  He proposes to locate life assurance companies and unit trusts in the centre and they will get the 10 per cent tax relief.  They will qualify for the 10 per cent rate of CPT.  I might say to the Minister that I loved his measured modesty when he finally said in relation to this measure: &ldquo;All of these measures will, as I have said, be to the benefit of the promotion of the centre as an attractive location for international financial services&rdquo;. Irish Life will uproot themselves from Abbey Street and bring their filing cabinets across the road.  They could get a trolley from the Department of Social Welfare or the gardaí in Store Street could give them a hand because they only have to move about 70 yards.  They will bring their investment income from life assurance and automatically their tax rate will drop from 43 per cent to 10 per cent on income derived therefrom.</P>
    <P>These 13 concessions will be introduced in the space of 12 months.  We gave four concessions and left it at that.  We were not going to mess around anymore. The other nine concessions have been given by the Taoiseach in order to attract international financial institutions into this country and have them all located adjacent to the Custom House, bounded by Sheriff Street.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister has issued two certified licences to date to these companies to locate in the centre and 22 further projects have been approved in principle.  The Minister has said that these 22 projects involve definite employment commitments to be written into the certificates, amounting to over 700 jobs.  I have almost 20 years' experience in this House, five or six of them in Government, and I know that many of the job commitments written into so-called certificates and IDA applications are not, for the most part, worth the paper they <Col N="1445" /> are written on.  Chase is one of the companies which made a big hoo-ha.  They were being hammered to death by the IDA to give a job commitment.  They have given one to keep them quiet. Frankly that figure is phoney.  I do not care if the director, former governors of the Central Bank, or anybody else is on the validation and certification monitoring committee.  The boys &mdash; and I know a number of them &mdash; are laughing all the way to the pass machine because the poor old punter pays £10 a year.</P>
    <P>The estimate of tax foregone on corporation profits tax alone for the financial institutions on the basis of the concessions given at the Customs House Docks site is in the region of £24 million. They are clocking it up.  They maintain that in two or three years time, with a few dozen people there drinking champagne, as well they might, they will have a net gain of £24 million.  At that stage the Taoiseach should become a governor of the banks, they will give him that appointment in gratitude.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a parallel analogy.  The week the Taoiseach decides to go to America to fund raise &mdash; all the correspondents are being sent with him; I do not know what they are going to write but it is very bad for newspapers not to be on the right side of the Taoiseach &mdash; the Bank of Ireland decided to spend no less than $370 million or £230 million to take a holding interest in New Hampshire Bank Incorporated.  They have no difficulty in a rights issue of £74 million and £47 million preferred stock.  Is it not a strange investment decision that this money, admittedly a part of the US holding company but a substantial part of Irish reserves, is being spent outside the country the same week the Taoiseach is going to the United States to bring back money?</P>
    <P>I share the stricture of Nigel D'Arcy, managing director of the Taylor Investment Group, one of those involved in the International Financial Services Centre. There are many members of that association who share my views; not all of them are involved in this scam.  Mr. D'Arcy said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> In April, the UK's Financial Services Act comes into force, which will create a complete legislative structure governing the entire British financial services industry &mdash; which includes everything from banking and insurance to stockbroking, as well as controlling building societies and their activities, etc.  We need a similarly comprehensive measure.  An Irish Financial Services Act &mdash; modelled on the UK statute &mdash; is vital to assist in marketing Dublin's International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>In the light of my comments this evening on the massive handouts operation here, statutory control is imperative.  Mr. D'Arcy also said:</P>
    <P>I understand that the approach that will be adopted regarding the Centre is that banking activities as defined by Irish law will be supervised by the Central Bank, insurance companies by the Department of Industry and Commerce and all other financial activities will operate under an appropriate <i>selfregulatory</i> framework to be approved and monitored on a prudential basis by the Central Bank.  Such a framework is simply too fragmented and vague, as well as lacking the necessary legal clout sufficient to avoid questions being raised about Irish authorisation standards abroad.</P>
    <P>That is a legitimate criticism made in the public interest and is one I support. Before we went down that road fundamental protective measures should have been in place.  As the Minister conceded, we are in urgent need of a revised Central Bank Act.  We have been drawing up this Bill for 20 years and it has languished in the Department of Finance. My last sight of it was in 1981 when I was a junior Minister.  It appears to be buried in the Department again.</P>
    <P>I share the views of my colleague, Deputy Noonan, on the VHI.  The Minister has made an almighty mess in this area, and there is a very simple solution which we considered in Government, namely, that there should be a regulatory <Col N="1447" /> mandatory requirement on the VHI to send a computer print-out to the Revenue Commissioners detailing the payments made to consultants.  There would be no problem with that but the VHI refused point blank to do that for me.  They put forward all sorts of arguments &mdash; confidentiality of medical records, which need not arise, contractual relationship with subscribers and so on.  I did not accept that argument.  I was on the point of ensuring that this measure would be brought about, but time ran out.  Now we have come to this impasse.</P>
    <P>When dealing with consultants charging fees over and above those paid by the VHI, the Minister said in his speech:</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that there would be no justification for any such increase in fees.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the medical profession, that is called whistling into the wind.  The Minister knows that phrase is meaningless because there is nothing to prevent a consultant charging a fee which will be recouped by the VHI while the patient has to pay another fee.  We will be opposing this section because in terms of framing it is a nonsense.  There is no reason the Minister should not insist on this measure being introduced.</P>
    <P>I can readily appreciate the horror in the Department of Finance if that proposal is made because people will ask why the print-out of interest payments made by building societies to individuals should not be sent to the Revenue Commissioners.  That would cause a stir. Non-disclosure would raise its ugly head. The Minister has an easy way to recast this section and ensure that additional money is received by the Revenue Commissioners. At present all that is involved is the deduction rather than the full rate of tax which would fall to be paid in the event of a full print-out being sent directly to the Revenue Commissioners to be reconciled with the ordinary taxation returns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved the adjournment of the debate on this Bill on 23 March I said that the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1988, was 99.9 per cent ready and would be introduced when we resumed after the Easter recess.  On that occasion Deputy Carey remarked: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;, which prompted the Minister to remark: &ldquo;Can we have a little wager on the margin&rdquo;?. I am glad to be able to report that the Minister's Bill has been introduced. Members will be aware that it is almost a replica of legislation which was being prepared by the Coalition before they left office.  I accept that Deputy Barrett's Bill is similar.  The Minister has announced that his Bill, with the exception of one or two alterations, is almost a copy of the Coalition's proposals.  I understand that in section 34 of the Minister's Bill those under 15 years of age will be allowed to be on licensed premises at any time during permitted hours &mdash; Deputy Barrett's Bill restricts their presence to 8 p.m. &mdash; if accompanied by a parent or guardian. Both Bills forbid unaccompanied children to be on licensed premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made that change to accommodate tourists and holidaymakers. If we adopted Deputy Barrett's proposal they would have to leave licensed premises with their children at 8 p.m.  Young persons are forbidden to consume alcohol on licensed premises at <Col N="1449" /> any time.  I understand that licensed vintners made representations to the Minister to change the time limit.  Section 38 of the Minister's Bill will allow publicans to employ apprentices over the age of 16 in licensed premises.  Deputy Barrett's Bill proposed that only young people over the age of 18 should be employed on such premises.  We are all aware that many apprentices in the licensed trade start at 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>All Members welcome Deputy Barrett's decision to introduce his Bill.  He deserves praise because he has given us an opportunity to stress the need for curbs on underage drinking.  We have all had to face problems associated with cider parties and so on but Deputy Barrett was not concerned about young people drinking cider alone.  We are all aware of the distress young hooligans who consume a lot of alcohol cause to our citizens.  It is important to point out that they represent a small minority of our young people.  We are introducing legislation to curb the extravagances of a few people.  However, I am glad that at last gardaí will have the authority to confiscate drink from young people and that they will be able to cart young people they find in a drunken state off to a suitable place to sober up.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of how frustrating it is for gardaí who cannot deal with young people who congregate in a field for a cider party.  There is a need to educate our young people about drink.  Deputy Harney was correct in stating that drink is associated with being adult, mature and independent.  If children are introduced to drink in the home where it is taken in moderation they will not take any great notice of it when they reach maturity. When they are 18 they will not go on a great splurge and drink their heads off. They will grow up without attaching any great mystique to alcohol.  If young people see their parents abusing alcohol &mdash; far too many of them return home with too much drink on them &mdash; they will follow that example.  That is a shame. Alcohol given to children at the family table will educate them to regard alcohol <Col N="1450" /> as a normal beverage and one that is not restricted to adults.</P>
    <P>Another reason we have excessive drinking is that young people starting out in a job get adult wages.  In the thirties, forties and fifties young people starting in their first job at 18, 19 or 20 received ten shillings, £1 or £2 per week.  They did not have the money to spend on alcohol but the youngsters of that age today in many cases start off earning the same amount that is paid to a married person with a family.  I accept that they pay a lot more in taxation but they are left with a big amount of money and spend most of it on alcohol.  I do not see anything wrong with drink as long as it is consumed in moderation.  Our problem is that many children of ten and 11 have been found in a drunken state.  There have been numerous complaints about certain off-licences in my constituency selling alcohol to young people.</P>
    <P>When one endeavours to persuade such people to go into court to give evidence against the person selling alcohol one discovers they will not do so.  On the one hand members of the public complain bitterly about off-licence proprietors selling alcohol to people under age, while on the other hand, there is encountered the difficulty of persuading them to give evidence in court.  We hear the contention continuously that if there were more recreational facilities, more clubs and amenities for young people there would not be so much abuse of alcohol.  I would argue that the many young people who join youth clubs and avail of recreational facilities do not abuse alcohol or use it excessively.  I would contend that it is those young people who do not join such clubs or avail of recreational facilities who are the real offenders.  I read a letter written by a sensible person recently who spoke of the forties, fifties and sixties when there were no youth clubs or recreational facilities for the young people growing up in those decades.  Yet there were not encountered anything like the same problems that arise today.  It should be remembered that millions of pounds have been spent since 1973 on the provision of such recreational facilities for <Col N="1451" /> young people whereas there were never any funds provided before then, from the time rates were first lifted from community halls to the stage when massive grants were provided for such halls.  The problem has increased to such an extent that we are forced to introduce this Bill. In the seventies I used to beseech respective Ministers for Justice to introduce legislation to prevent under-18 year olds being sold alcohol by off-licence proprietors. Usually, the response I received was that if a father wanted a pint of stout or a granny a naggin of brandy a youngster had to be able to fetch it for them.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy McCartan spoke of a minimum of one pint, that one could not sell an open can to an under-18 year old. The problem appears to be confined to the same small minority.  As that small minority reach adulthood, take up a life of crime or whatever, in turn their youngsters seem to follow the same pattern.  I have spoken on many occasions to the Garda, juvenile liaision officers, people engaged in social work with youngsters and they contend that, very often, they follow the same pattern or cycle as their parents.  It constitutes a great tragedy.</P>
    <P>The question of identity cards was raised on a number of occasions.  Deputy Seán Barrett considered that perhaps there should be some attention devoted to the issue of such identity cards.  I do not see any drawback to the issue of such identity cards to prove that one is over 18 years of age rather than <i>vice versa.</i> If I were 18, 19 or 20 and was going out with the lads and did not want them to laugh at me I would make sure I had some form of proof to illustrate that I was over 18 years of age.  I do not think young people of 18, 19 or 20 would object to a system of identity cards.  I see no need for any great debate on that issue. As Deputy Seán Barrett said, people use cards for all sorts of services, such as Banklink and Visa to passports.  Neither do I see the need for legislation to introduce identity cards.  Publicans, who are very anxious to have such a system in <Col N="1452" /> operation &mdash; if they can satisfy themselves that their customers are over 18 years of age &mdash; should be able to issue them, asking young people to bring in birth certificates, photographs of themselves or whatever, when they would issue a card free of charge.  If I were an 18, 19 or 20 year old and was being taken for being younger because of my size I would not want to be embarrassed going into a publichouse and being refused alcohol.  Therefore I would be quite happy to show personal identification.</P>
    <P>Sometimes legislative provisions penalise certain sections of the community. My children enjoy a small quantity of wine with Sunday dinner.  They have been doing so since they were very young children and have never become drunk so far.  But when we take our children out to dinner or attend a wedding or some other function the same practice cannot obtain.  That is a price I am prepared to pay in order to control the excesses of a very small minority.  This may constitute a problem for some people who dine out on Sundays, who want to educate their children to drinking in a responsible manner.  Unfortunately it is becoming a part of our culture that there must be total abstinence or, alternatively, indulging in alcohol to excess.  I would think the majority of people drink moderately.  Practically all Members of this House enjoy a drink.  Assuming that Members represent a cross-section of our community then it could be contended that most people drink moderately, in a manner allowing them to maintain control of themselves.</P>
    <P>The most telling provisions of this Bill are those providing for the confiscation of drink by the Garda from marauding gangs of hooligans.  Many of us must have been tempted many times to leave our cars when we saw young hooligans going around swinging bottles of cider.  The temptation is to take those bottles from them; these are usually 15 or 16 year olds. One does not readily become involved in such circumstances.  I can always understand the reluctance on the part of the Garda to become so involved.  Nevertheless it is up to the community at large, <Col N="1453" /> the Garda and everybody concerned, to ensure that the provisions of this Bill are implemented.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, one cannot legislate for virtue but one can endeavour to make abuse of the law more difficult.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Seán Barrett replies on Second Stage he may ask that this Bill form part of the overall intoxicating liquor legislation rather that have two separate Bills incorporating much the same provisions.  There is no point in my dealing with the Minister's Bill, much as I should like to, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the changing of the opening hours of off-licence premises and so on.</P>
    <P>I was relieved to see that it will be an offence for anyone over 18 years of age to purchase alcohol for someone under that age because sometimes a man who should know better will, for £1 or £2, buy alcohol for those under age.  I am glad that a penalty has been introduced in this regard.</P>
    <P>The amount of money spent glamorising alcohol in advertising has been referred to.  The advertisements I fear the most are those publicising drinks which are laced with wine or fruit juice which make alcohol very palatable.  People who are prone to alcoholism can, without realising it, become addicted to these drinks and advertising practices should be examined.</P>
    <P>Most people drink responsibly and no one is trying to stamp out the practice. However, educational programmes should be undertaken to try to make parents who take a drink aware of the importance of monitoring the alcohol consumption of their children.  They could perhaps remove the mystique by drinking in a family atmosphere because I do not know anyone who ended up an alcoholic who had grown up in that kind of atmosphere.  They may exist but I am not aware of them.  I am delighted to be able to say to Deputy Barrett that our Bill is ready and I hope the two will become part of the same Bill.</P>

      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I wish to contribute briefly to this debate in relation to the <Col N="1454" /> Intoxicating Liquor (Children and Young Persons) Bill, 1988, proposed by Deputy Barrett on behalf of Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>Earlier today, at Question Time, I asked the Taoiseach whether he could give an indication to the House that its business might be a little better ordered in future, particularly as there appeared to be a coming together of minds between the major opposition parties and the Government on issues of major importance, not only within Parliament but outside it.  Not being privy to the discussions on the Order of Business, it is somewhat disquieting that although the time of the House is very valuable and that there are so many important issues to be pursued, by whatever series of events, by the initiative of Deputy Barrett we have an Intoxicating Liquor (Amendment) Bill dealing with one aspect of the law &mdash; namely, children and young persons &mdash; and wider legislation in the stocks published in the recess by the Government in which section 4 is an exact copy of Deputy Barrett's Bill.</P>
      <P>We spent two sessions of Private Members' Time in the last term discussing this Bill and we will have to repeat a lot of what has been said when the Government introduce their Bill. However, some good has come out of it because it is undoubtedly a fact that if the Bill now before the House had not been presented in Private Members' Time there would not have been any legislation from the Government. Deputy Barrett's Bill prompted a very rapid response from the Government.  It is also clear that we have an opportunity, to some degree, to use this debate as a pre-Second Stage debate on the Government's Bill.  No doubt, some of their remarks will be noted by the Minister who is present and reported back to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened at length to Deputy Briscoe's contribution to understand how this marriage process will take place and how one Bill will ultimately be subsumed into the other.  This Bill should be supported and The Workers' Party will support it because it is comprehensive in the area it seeks to address.  It deals very adequately <Col N="1455" /> with the issues of under-age drinking.  It is so accurate that the Government's Bill mirrors it.  Deputy Briscoe highlighted two small differences but otherwise they are exactly the same.</P>
    <P>If we pass Deputy Barrett's Bill at the conclusion of Second Stage, as I understand the procedures of the House, it will then go to a special committee of the House to consider Committee Stage as happened in the case of the Bill regarding marital breakdown currently on Committee Stage.  That has a very good aspect to it because it means that parallel to the business conducted in the House, there is, at a remove within the House, more legislative work proceeding.  That system should be looked at much more often in the conduct of the business of the House as it would be a much more constructive way of dealing with amendments on Committee Stage, as in the case of the two sessions we had of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marital Breakdown. At each session, 16 Deputies were present throughout, contributing and listening, which would not happen in the House on Committee Stage of any Bill. The special committee on Committee Stage is a very good system and in supporting Deputy Barrett's Bill we will achieve that for the second time in the life of the House.  It will mean that good legislative work is proceeding in tandem with what is going on in the Chamber.</P>
    <P>By supporting Deputy Barrett's Bill, the Opposition &mdash; if I can use that global expression to encompass all except the Government side &mdash; will be in a position to dictate the pace at which the legislation relating to under-age drinking can proceed, because The Workers' Party are not happy with the progress and pace at which legislation is introduced on the floor of the House and proceeded with from then on.  We have no control within our party because we are not privy to Whips' meetings and discussions and the other parties in their entirety referred to as the Opposition do not control the pace at which legislation can proceed through the House.  This is an important, urgent area of law which should be addressed <Col N="1456" /> as early as possible.  Unfortunately, one cannot rely upon Fianna Fáil, this Government, to assure us they can deliver as quickly as we would like movement on this legislation.  The Bill as introduced in Private Members' Time was the sole and single reason for prompting the Government's legislation.  If Committee Stage is dealt with by a Special Committee it may well be the means of prompting onwards at a greater pace the Government legislation.  Well and good, if all becomes one let it be so, and let us have the opportunity to move with haste.</P>
    <P>On the procedural end of things the Government's Bill as produced deals with areas other than under-age drinking and, even at this stage within days of its publication, it has evoked a response from the organised sectors within the bar trade and the licensed trade generally.  It is clear that a great deal of hard debate faces us and many serious issues have to be discussed in the broader context of licensing of restaurants and the like, but there seems to be no disagreement around the House on under-age drinking. It appears that both sides of the House have produced identical legislation, so why can we not at least deal with that single area and not be delayed by arguments and issues which may arise in a different sector of the liquor licensing laws?</P>
    <P>We should deal specifically with the law with regard to under-age drinking, get it on to the Statute Book in the form of Deputy Barrett's Bill as quickly as possible and then spend whatever time is necessary at a later date dealing with the broader or other issues of liquor licensing as contained in the Minister's Bill.  That is a very sensible way to proceed with it, and I urge the Minister and the Government to consider taking that on board. Looking through the record and listening to the contributions it seems that throughout the debate there has been no serious departure from the principles advanced in Deputy Barrett's Bill.  We should not delay any longer in putting that legislation into place.</P>
    <P>The Bill is particularly welcomed by The Workers' Party because for the first <Col N="1457" /> time since 1924 it gives us the opportunity to challenge the thuggery of under-age gang drinking in the city and, from listening to the contributions it seems the experience is not confined to the Dublin area.  The problem has confronted many communities over the years and it is important that we tackle it.  It has confronted not only communities but is a feature of the nightly work of CIE bus drivers and conductors in the city who have to deal with juvenile drinkers coming on board their buses from the city centre.  In my area of Fairview and the North Strand these young people can find any number of off-licences to service their need, continuing into the north-east area in Coolock and so on where they hold their mid-field, out in the open drink parties.  Phibsboro' comes to mind on the city centre route to Finglas as an area notorious for the delivery of alcohol through off-licences to under-age people, particularly cider, although I accept that beer features largely too.  These areas on the north side of the city have become synonomous with off-licences prepared to hand out alcohol without yea or nay to young people, and those facts have been known for years.</P>
    <P>I talk about the north side because I am familiar with that area of Dublin but I have no doubt that similar problems obtain on the south side and throughout the city where in licensing hours, irrespective of age, provided you are big enough to stand up in long trousers, you can collect alcohol in off-licences and the law is so outdated and inadequate that nothing can effectively be done about it. Night in and night out young boys &mdash; and girls &mdash; can be seen hanging about street corners canvassing older people as they walk past to go down and get them the odds in the off-licences, and silly, stupid people agree or are often bullied into doing it.  Even today in our newspapers we read of the sea front at Bray, once a place of casual, usual resort for people, becoming a virtual no-go area because of these extraordinary happenings.  This is the most important feature of the legislation before the House tonight.  It is geared to enable the Garda Síochána to <Col N="1458" /> confront and deal with not only those who are out in the open at these cider drinking parties abusing alcohol but also the off-licence owners and pub owners and bring home to them their wrong-doings.</P>
    <P>However, a number of aspects of the Bill need to be commented on and in doing so I am mindful that I am now addressing both sides of the House, so to speak.  At this stage I welcome the arrival of the Minister for Justice.  In making my comments I am addressing Deputy Barrett who is promoting the Bill before the House and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, because he will have to listen to much the same arguments when his own Bill is being debated.  The first aspect that worries me is that while the Garda Síochána have power to intervene and confiscate goods, alcohol and containers and to demand of persons their name, age and address, there is not the power of arrest.  Particularly late at night when alcohol can be replaced it is crucial that when the Garda come to deal with these kind of illegal parties not only can they disperse the crowd but they can identify the ringleaders and put them into temporary cold storage to cool off.  It is essential that that power is given to the Garda.</P>
    <P>The gardaí will descend; there will be a scattering and whatever number of people can be caught will simply have their goods, their liquor and hardware, confiscated.  That is no deterrent to these people who, driven by need, aimlessness or whatever will simply go to the off-licence or the pub, collect another round and head back to the fields and continue with what they were doing.  Bravado being the order of the day, to belittle the Garda as much as possible is a feature of the conduct of many of these people. Therefore, it is important to look at the question of arrest powers and the opportunity for the Garda to recognise, as they can and do, the ringleaders of these events, take them in for cold storage purposes overnight, prosecute them as being the ringleaders and let them out in the cold, clear early morning or visit a court to answer for the misdeeds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> The other aspect of the Bill that concerns me is what can only be described as a very soft approach to the whole area of penalty.  If I remember correctly, the point was made by Deputy Taylor and others, and I adopt the argument, that alcohol is a drug as lethal in the hands of young, impressionable people as any hard drug.  It can create as lethal a consequence. It can provoke the same type of irrational response as any hallucinatory or other strong drug.  Let us look at the penalties.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Bill all that is proposed even on the third offence is a monetary penalty and one which pales into insignificance if one compares the range of monetary penalties that have been made available for road traffic offences today in this country or the monetary penalties that are being made available in the misuse of drugs legislation.  This has got to be looked at.  There is money to be made out of the peddling of alcohol to young people.  That is the reason off-licences trade in it and that is why dishonest publicans will do anything to get alcohol over the counter to anyone irrespective of age.  We must be serious if we are to talk about this legislation being effective.  I contend that the sanction of imprisonment must be available for people who persist and on the third time around we should be talking about penalties beyond £300.  We should be looking seriously at the prospect of putting before publicans and young people who persist in this kind of offence the prospect of their going to prison.</P>
    <P>The point must be made that the simple extension of endorsement on licence with the consequence obviously that three endorsements will lead to possible suspension of the licence.  As far as that licence holder is concerned, that has proven not to be a satisfactory sanction because of the whole area of the transfer of licences from the current licence holder to a nominee, and onwards down the line, with the result that any member of the family, or indeed outside persons, can be nominated to hold the licence if <Col N="1460" /> the risk of disqualification or suspension of the licence is being broached.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to confine the whole area to fines only.  I say that for another reason.  A very good way of bringing home to pub owners and off-licence owners the harm and damage they do is to force them into doing community work, to make them come out of their profit-making ale houses and off-licences and to work with the victims of young hooligans who are driven to all kinds of insanities by the consumption of alcohol. They should be made work through the community service order but that cannot happen where the penalty is a fine only. The community service regime can only be invoked by a District Court where it is a substitute for imprisonment.  For that reason I say that the sanction of imprisonment should be available as an alternative with regard to penalties under the Bill.  I would ask Deputy Barrett to have a look at that.  In tandem, we are having a double address to Deputy Barrett now and to the Minister later when his identical legislation comes to be considered.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill which deals with getting rid of the &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; provision is very much welcomed.  It is incredible to think that the Garda Síochána and so many community people have had to wait for so long for legislation to deal with this matter.  It has bedevilled any serious prosecution of under-age drinking.  I make the point, and it has been made before, that the onus must rest on people who hold their premises open to business. It is the duty of a person who holds a licence to conduct the business in accordance with the law and the onus must rest squarely on the licensee.  I do not believe one need dwell on that matter.  There is no one in this country who would seriously argue against that.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with under-age drinking. The penalties are utterly unrealistic and must be dealt with.  Regarding the consumption of alcohol by under-age persons, I suggest that the legislation is a little draconian and restrictive.  I am thinking particularly about social events, for example, weddings where people under 18 years of age go in the company <Col N="1461" /> of their parents or family.  To suggest that at a wedding in an hotel that a person at the age of 17 could not take a glass of wine at the meal is somewhat restrictive and I would ask that that be looked at. We can go too far on this line.  However, in the company of parents, adults or guardians there is a time and an event where the consumption of alcohol in moderation is not a bad thing and, indeed, is often a more useful thing to help to introduce the normality of alcohol as something in which young people should be educated.</P>
    <P>The question of children on licensed premises is a matter on which I understand there is a divergence of views. Deputy Barrett's Bill confines matters to 8 p.m.  The Minister said he would allow it up to all hours of proper licensing trade but Deputy Briscoe said that was because the Minister had received representations. I have received representations from the Vintners' Federation of Ireland.  It may well be that they have a more extensive response to the Minister but they made no point in any representations to me about this in so far as they make no reference to it at all.</P>
    <P>However, the Irish National Union of Vintners, Grocers and Allied Trades Association, which is the association that represents most of the Dublin staff, have made representations specifically on this point and at their AGM passed a resolution expressing grave concern at the suggestion that section 120 of the Children Act, 1908 would be repealed to allow for the presence of young persons on licensed premises.  I am inclined to that view.  I do not believe that a licensed premises is the place for children of any age in any circumstances.  However, I recognise that there is the question of tourism and people going out with their families and they should be accommodated. The way in which I have experienced that abroad in the company of children is that there are areas in licensed premises designated as children's rooms where the parents are asked to sit with their children.  This is a scheme which could be looked at.  The areas are well <Col N="1462" /> appointed.  They contain some small items for the children's amusement, for example, a special area where they can play on the floor, and the children can have access to some toys and, most importantly, they are not getting in the way of adults who are there on the premises simply to socialise without being troubled and annoyed.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is anything as unseemly and as disorderly as some of the licensed premises one can visit here on a sunny Sunday afternoon close to holiday resorts where tables are laden down with half-empty beer glasses and children are dashing about to the annoyance of everyone and at the risk of toppling tables and glasses over.  We must be very careful about how we allow the law to be changed in this regard.  The simple repeal and the general proviso of children on premises while in the company of adults is not sufficient and I would ask both to consider&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, but we could prompt a specific direction here of indicating that this provision would apply to specially designated &ldquo;children only&rdquo; areas in licensed premises.  That is something that must be looked at.</P>
      <P>Under section 11 the Garda have power to confiscate and arrest.  The power to arrest is essential to allow gardaí to deal with persistent ringleaders and with the problem that they can simply regroup at the same point when the gardaí have gone.</P>
      <P>Regarding proof of age on prosecution, the words &ldquo;and such person appears to the court to have been&rdquo; in section 13 are unnecessary.  The prosecution presumption should stand on the belief of the garda and it should only be dislodged by the formal proof by the defendant, on production of a birth certificate, that he or she was over the age.</P>

There is all-party agreement on the provisions of Deputy Barrett's Bill.  As it is an urgent matter, I suggest that the Bill be allowed to progress unhindered at this stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this Bill.  This debate will be well worthwhile if it enlightens the minds of Members of this House as to the urgent need to update the legislation governing the sale of intoxicating liquor to young people and others.  The Minister should take whatever good points are in this Bill and incorporate them in his own legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan made many allegations during the course of his speech and talked about the delay in bringing in this legislation.  I agree that legislation in this area is long overdue.  This Minister is undertaking an indepth study of the problem.  I am aware of this at first hand since I am involved in the trade and in the Vintners' Federation.  He has prepared fully effective legislation to deal with the entire problem, which does not simply relate to young people.  Responsibility for the problems in this area rests partly with the publicans and partly with the Garda Síochána, but generally it rests with society as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Ministers have fudged this issue during the past 15 years.  I was Vice-Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses which submitted two detailed reports to the last Coalition Government.  We proposed specific changes which were long overdue in updating the law on the licensed trade. The Government did absolutely nothing. I hope that Members of this House will <Col N="1464" /> have a sense of collective responsibility when they finally come to decide on the details of new legislation.</P>
    <P>There have been allegations about dishonest publicans.  I am a publican and I can safely say here or anywhere else that I am a fairly honest man.</P>
    <P>The legislation as it stands is impossible to comply with and implement.  That is why we need a broadly based Bill to cover all aspects of the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor.  This legislation should be debated fully and implemented as quickly as possible.  I have already expressed my compliments to the Minister on undertaking an indepth study.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not officially lobbying on behalf of the vintners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am lobbying on behalf of honest publicans.  When they handled the drink trade we had not any of the problems we have today.  There has been a new concept of marketing in this country and multinationals have been offering bargain buys to the housewife. The problem starts when the housewife buys a half bottle of vodka and consumes it during the day.  What effect does this have on the family?  Teachers are now expected to teach manners to children in schools.  It is all a question of responsibility.</P>
      <P>As one who has been involved in the trade for many years I can say that the family publicans and the Vintners' Federation are very concerned about the good name of the business and they are saddened at the fact that they are saddled with part of the blame for the problems which arise from the abuse of alcohol. The good name of the trade on which so much of this economy depends will be enhanced if legislation is introduced to update the existing law and eradicate anomalies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody can give a specific answer to the question of how these various problems arose.  We all have our own ideas but many are reluctant to face reality.  I believe that part of the problem is caused by the fact that young people have more <Col N="1465" /> money to spend and are afforded greater opportunities to do so.  The opportunities are there because of the advent of clubs and organisations.  I would include political parties who saw a golden opportunity to apply for extensions to sell intoxicating liquor and were accommodated by the existing law to do so.  We know that in recent years licences for late night drinking were granted rather easily. The effects of granting such licences have rebounded on the family publican and on the family itself.  Under the law as it stands, the onus is on the publican to clear his premises at a said time and to determine the suitability and age of a person who wishes to buy alcohol and consume it on the premises.  The heavy hand of the law rests on the shoulder of the publican.  People in general feel they have no responsibility in the matter.  I know that from experience.  The existing law supports this claim.  I believe that collective responsibility is the key to the solution of the abuse of alcohol.</P>
    <P>I believe that when the Minister for Justice introduces his new legislation on the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor we will have the commonsense to realise that responsibility in its entirety must be removed from the shoulders of the publican and spread across the board, to the family, and to those elders who bring young people into pubs and to the young people themselves who must be educated about their responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>I hope the discussion this evening will help to open the minds and thinking of many people in this House on alcohol and drug abuse.  They are related and one leads to the other.  Many people blame the publican for the incidence of drug and alcohol abuse, especially among young people.  However, we must bear in mind that the family publican did not create the problem, as I have said before, and history has proved that.  As I have said previously, the existing legislation needs to be reviewed urgently.  The Vintners Federation of Ireland are very concerned about the abuse of alcohol, in general, and they have made submissions to many <Col N="1466" /> successive Ministers, on many aspects of the licensed trade in respect of their concern with regard to the abuse of alcohol and under age drinking.  They certainly look forward to changes in the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we are inclined to fudge this.  We all have memories of a certain Government that fell on this issue.  I believe there should be some type of identification.  It is completely impossible for me, as a publican, to determine whether a young girl is under the age at which she may legally be served alcohol.  For instance, six young people come into my pub, or somebody else's &mdash; perhaps even the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's pub, when he retires &mdash; and one of them orders four pints and two club oranges.  We have an idea that one or two of the group are under age but if somebody comes over when you are busy and orders say, four vodkas and two pints, they could tip the vodka into the orange.  I could then be prosecuted for serving those people and this is one of my concerns under the proposed legislation. The word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is very important. We do not want to let anybody off the hook.  There is a recognition that responsibility must be shared across the board.  There are many aspects of the legislation which we must examine in great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a sympathetic district justice would understand the odd occasion that might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respects to the Minister, we have at present legislation enforced whereby a publican must vacate <Col N="1467" /> his counter at 10 o'clock on a Sunday evening and walk out and call time.  If people refuse to leave the premises he can be hauled in before a court to answer his case.  The silly old adage that a garda listening outside a door does not hear the publican call time should be forgotten. There is nothing in legislation that I know of which states that somebody outside a publichouse door should hear them calling time inside.  The publican may walk around his customers and state nice and quietly, &ldquo;time is up gentlemen, please&rdquo;. Anybody who frequents a publichouse surely knows the closing time.  Many publicans have had their livelihoods endangered by endorsements imposed because a garda did not hear them calling time outside the premises.  That is going from one extreme to the other.  We should try to bring in legislation that will incorporate a sensible balance, and where the law will have some respect for the publican. At present it has no respect for them.  People who leave publichouses after closing time can go to a disco, where there are extensions or go to a night club where there is no supervision and where, in many cases, there are young teenagers. These people are exempted from the law and have been, but I hope they will not be exempted much longer.  There should never be a law which differentiates one person from another.  It is time that we did away with that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would take grave exception to the remarks Deputy McCartan made here about dishonest publicans.  I believe that anybody, people in small towns or elsewhere, know you may find a publican, and I term then a necessary evil, who will keep late hours, who will open before Mass is over and will not close for the two hours.  They take a certain segment of the trade away from the normal publican. But we find invariably that when the &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; sign is up these are the publichouses that are on the market.  They may last a year or two, perhaps three but not much longer.  That is my experience and I have <Col N="1468" /> been in the trade for 30 years.  Generally speaking, from 10 o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock at night is long enough for any business.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for people to force drink down their throats inside the 10 minutes drinking up time so the extension of drinking up time to half-an-hour is more than welcome.  Sunday night closing where publicans are forced to close at 10 o'clock only opens the minds of some people when they have a few drinks taken to head off and perhaps drive 15 or 20 miles to attend a late night disco, bringing young people with them, perhaps their families.  I am not blaming the hotels or the people who run the discos, but the law allows this to happen.  The law as it stands is itself furthering the opportunities for abuse of alcohol.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan also referred to the advertising of alcohol.  I think it has an effect.  If you look back at old films of the late twenties, thirties and forties &mdash; and I have not killed the habit &mdash; everybody was smoking a cigarette.  No matter how beautiful she was she lit up a cigarette.  It was the done thing at that time and this had an effect on people smoking.  John Wayne smoked a fag, I was a fan of his and I would get a Woodbine somewhere. The same applies to alcohol.  Advertising definitely has an effect.  We all know that the box in the corner has done a lot of damage to the social structures in this country.  People will be guided by what they see on television.  We should have a look at the question of advertising alcohol. However, if we are looking at advertising in relation to alcohol we should look at the other side of advertising.  For example, we are told that certain washing powders wash whiter than white but in my opinion soap is soap no matter what brand you are selling and it just washes like soap.</P>
    <P>On the question of children in licensed premises, from my own experience the worst thing for any publican is to have a child running around a public house at night.  He would get in the way of everybody <Col N="1469" /> and the publican would worry about the law finding him on the premises.  At the same time I know from personal experience and from living in the north Meath area where there are great attractions for tourism that in a certain public house where there is céili music and dancing at night people like to bring in their children.  We are always very concerned and very worried about having the children on the premises.  At the same time I believe it is much better to have young children under the supervision of their parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We should use a sensible approach in those cases and allow children to be accompanied by their parents. I know of cases where cars have gone on fire and many other things can also happen.  The Minister should also keep in mind &mdash; and I know there is nothing he can do about this &mdash; the young families who are locked at home in their houses at night while their parents are out at social functions.  I know there is nothing we can do about that but it is a question of collective responsibility.  The vandalism which has erupted in major cities, and which has even spread down the country during recent years, is as a result of the abandonment of responsibility by the people who should be responsible, and who should be held most responsible.</P>

      <P>I am talking about parents. In many cases parents have abandoned their responsibilities.  As I said earlier on, they blame the publicans and the <Col N="1470" /> schoolteachers and if a schoolteacher raises a hand to a child to put manners on him, or question him about the taking of alcohol, parents question why their children should be accosted in such a manner.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputy Barrett's Bill will create an awareness in this House of the problems of under-age drinking.  I hope that many of the people who have spoken here will abandon their one-sided approach to this problem.  There is no use in saying that one should close all pubs.  It would be like the prohibition period in America and worse could happen as a result.  When we discussed the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee Members on the other side of the House suggested that pubs should be left open.  There is a certain amount of merit in that because from my experience once people are refused alcohol that is when they start looking for it.  However, I do not think we can go that road yet.</P>
      <P>The legislation the Minister has introduced, with the exception of a few grey areas which we hope to brighten up before it passes through this House, is good legislation.  I hope that aspects of Deputy Barrett's Bill will be taken into consideration and implemented.  Hopefully we will emerge with a Bill that will do justice to the trade and preserve the interests of society in this country.</P>

      <P>The proceedings here this evening remind me of the time when I was growing up as a youngster in the country when on Sunday nights we were allowed to go to the pictures.  During the course of the evening we viewed the main feature film and at some stage we were given a preview of what would happen the next Sunday evening.  We used to call it the &ldquo;trailer&rdquo; in those very simple days. There was no drink, and no money for it, around in those days.</P>

      <P>They were but it did not come in our direction.  The main feature of the evening here is Deputy Barrett's Bill but it is laced with a little of the Government Bill that has been published in the meantime.  I find that a little intriguing.  Having said that I will confine my remarks to Deputy Barrett's Bill.</P>
      <P>At the outset I should like to say that I and my party welcome this Bill.  We commend Deputy Barrett for bringing it before the House and for enabling all of us to make a contribution on it.  Contributions have been made in great depth and detail during the course of the deliberation on this Bill since it was first introduced before the Easter recess.  My party support the Bill but we will put forward amendments to it.  At this stage I should like to appeal to the Minister to allow this legislation, as it has been presented by Deputy Barrett to go through, to let it take its course, to let it go through Committee Stage and to take on board whatever amendments are worthy of being made.  He should let it go through as a separate piece of legislation that is long overdue.  It should not be delayed any longer.  Commendable and all as the Minister's Bill is, I feel that because of the broader issues involved there must inevitably be a great deal of discussion and debate before the Bill finally clears the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Under-age drinking is a serious problem and there has been too much delay in bringing this legislation before us.  I ask the Minister &mdash; and I know he is open to this kind of suggestion &mdash; to let this Bill go through, to let it become law, to put his back behind the enforcement of that law and then let us come back and study his own worthwhile Bill as an entity in its own right.  I say to Deputy Barrett &mdash; and I hope he does not think we are ungracious about this &mdash; that we will put forward amendments to the Bill and I hope that the opportunity will be given for us to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said to the Minister that we have waited too long already and in this respect <Col N="1472" /> I want to quote from the ESRI report that was published in 1986, which is exactly two years ago.  It is the report of a survey that was carried out on teenage drinking.  Its findings were that eight out of ten youngsters in the age range of 13 to 17 years drank in pubs.  That is extremely serious.  The report also said that in that same year only six publicans were prosecuted and of those six, five had convictions, some reasonably modest fines were imposed and business went on as usual.  That happened a long time ago and a lot of serious hard drinking has been done in the meantime.  We should not neglect any longer what that survey told us two years ago.  The time has now come when we in this House must put together legislation that will be strong, practical, enforceable and which will be enforced.  We must do it now and not wait any longer.</P>
    <P>The people who have suffered all the depredations that have been described in great detail by almost every speaker who has spoken in this debate &mdash; and which I am not going to repeat here this evening &mdash; will be glad and grateful to us if we speed up this legislation and if they see we are putting nothing at all in its way that might slow it down by even one day, not to mind one month or half a year or, as is likely to happen, if we allow it to be incorporated in the Minister's legislation. We are supporting Deputy Barrett's Bill, so he will not expect me, at 8.20 p.m. on this Tuesday evening, to describe at great length what we find good in the Bill.  The general overall thrust of the Bill is good. Its objectives will be met with some amendments.  Here I will be ungracious and immediately go into the areas where I feel amendments ought to be made.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Lynch did not wait to hear what I have to say about this, because I believe the single essential weakness in the Bill is the absence of any kind of identification.  In the early days when that Bill was discussed in the newspapers, my belief was that Deputy Barrett was going to incorporate in his Bill <Col N="1473" /> some system for identification cards.  As it is before the House, there is no reference to that at all.  That is a weakness in the Bill which will make it very difficult to enforce.  We are plagued with legislation, most of which is never enforced fully.  I hope that trait will not be an inbuilt factor in any new legislation.  I will be putting down an amendment later. This Bill will either stand or fall on the inclusion or not of some kind of identity card.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands places far too great a burden on the licensee or the person who is tending the bar at any given time. I realise, and everybody who has spoken has said, that the removal of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is a major advance but it pushes too much responsibility onto the licensee or whoever happens to be selling drink in a pub or disco or an off-licence and so on.  Some of the responsibility will have to be put on the shoulders of young people themselves.  I agree with Deputy Lynch that it is almost impossible to expect people who serve drinks in a bar to judge with any accuracy whether or not a person is over 18 years of age.  I think you will agree with me on that, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, having been a teacher for a number of years.  There are a number of second level teachers who are Members of this House, although they are not present at the moment, who would agree that it is almost impossible to judge the age of teenagers.  These are people who deal with children professionally and over prolonged periods every day.  If one meets those same children out of school on the street when they have changed out of their uniforms, when they have put their hair up or let their hair down and put on their make-up, or whatever it is they do with themselves when they are out of school, it is absolutely and utterly impossible to tell whether these children are fifth years or sixth years or seventh years.  If people like that cannot distinguish or identify them, how can we reasonably expect people who serve drinks in pubs and off-licences or wherever to make a judgement <Col N="1474" /> as to whether or not a person is under age and act accordingly?  We are asking too much.  If we go along these lines the law will not be enforceable.</P>
    <P>I have thought a good deal about the whole business of ID cards.  I have no objection to asking every citizen of this country to carry an ID card.  A country that has a sense of social responsibility and an awareness of the damage that is being done to our young people through excessive drinking and under-age drinking should not object to carrying an ID card.  I do not think it is necessary to impose that on all of us to make the provisions of this Bill work.  I do not think it is necessary that the Minister or I should have to carry an ID card if we want to buy a glass of beer in a pub. Unfortunately it would be instantly recognised that we are both&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Another idea that has been put forward is that on attaining the age of 18 young people should be issued with an ID card in the context of this legislation or similar legislation.  That idea is fraught with danger.  There is an inherent weakness in that idea because it could easily be read by young people as giving them a licence to drink in the same way as people get a licence to drive.  That would defeat in part the purpose of this Bill.  Under this Bill not alone are we hoping to curb teenage drinking but to modify all drinking in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I propose is &mdash; and I think the Minister will be glad when he hears what I have to say because he has been plugging it like nobody's business all afternoon &mdash; that on reaching the age of 18 every young person should be issued with an age of majority card, a multi-purpose card on the lines of a range of other cards people are given.  This type of card, with a photograph and date of birth, has a possport validity in all European countries. It could have the same validity for <Col N="1475" /> our young people and it could have a range of other benefits and entitlements that it would confer on young people at the age of 18.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of card I will be promoting. That card ought to be issued by local authorities in conjunction with the compilation of the register of electors because, on attaining the age of 18, young people are conferred with the right to vote.  The details in terms of cost and administration can be worked out later. I am just postulating the principle at this time.  Let us work on that kind of card and then we can say to young people that if they have their card they can buy drink and if not they are not permitted to do so.  In other words no card, no drink.</P>
    <P>That is a simple mechanism.  It would be easily understood by everybody and easily administered.  It would make a teenage and under-age drinking Bill work.  I have thought long and hard about what we are seeking to do in this Bill because I have seen far too much evidence of the damage done to potentially fine young people with the carry on and the caper of drinking at the moment.  I have thought long and hard to come up with some kind of mechanism that would enable us to bring forward a law which would be enforceable and easily enforceable. That is the only recipe I have come up with.  Whether the Minister sees any merit in it I do not know, but he has been talking about an age of majority card for some time since I came into the House this evening.  There is the key to making this Bill work.  One produces the age of majority card and then let it be known to everybody involved that that is the passport to buying drink whether it is in an off-licence, or publichouse, or wherever and, no card, no drink.  If we could do that we would be doing a good service to everybody.</P>
    <P>There are other parts of the Bill which I would like to commend.  One is the section that gives additional power to the Garda to go into these drinking parties <Col N="1476" /> and cider parties during the course of which a lot of alcohol is consumed by young people very often resulting in young people going on in a rampage of vandalism and violence afterwards.  That is a good provision in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Beidh níos mó ama amárach. Mar sin leanfaidh mé leis an dá nóiméad and say that that is a good provision in the Bill.  It needs to be fleshed out further.  I was interested in what was said by Deputy McCartan when he advocated that gardaí finding young people in these circumstances ought to arrest these people and put them into cold storage. That might be one way of doing it.  I do not know where a cold storage place could be found.  The gardaí might simply take these people home to their parents who cannot be exempted from responsibility either.  If these people are under age and ought not to be in possession of alcohol the fit and proper thing for the gardaí to do would be to take them home to their parents and let us hope that the parents too would be made to feel that they cannot get exemption from responsibility in the whole area of coming to terms with teenage drinking.  The gardaí should take these people home to their parents and give their parents the responsibility of looking after them.  The gardaí must confiscate the drink.  It must be known that young people who come by drink and engage in these drinking parties will have those parties broken up by the gardaí and will be taken home to their parents.  I hope it will be extremely difficult for such young people to find drink when this Bill becomes law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not perhaps the most earth-shattering item which a national parliament might debate. Nevertheless, I welcome the opportunity of using this forum to raise a matter that is of considerable importance to many people in the town and environs of Portlaoise. The Minister of State, from his records, will be aware that this has been an ongoing matter since, I believe, early 1980.  I need not spell out to him the number of Ministers who have held the Education portfolio since February of 1980 when the matter was first raised by the board of management.  I would hope that the present incumbents of the office of Minister and Minister of State will be the last people to handle this matter and that we will see building commence as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maryborough national school was built in the year 1879.  It was duly extended in 1964 but that extension took the form of the building of toilet facilities and extension of the yard area.  In February 1980 the board of management decided to seek the aid of the Department of Education in pressing for a badly needed extension. I understand that the grant was unofficially sanctioned in October of 1985 but to date the board of management and concerned parents are awaiting commencement of work on the school.  The present facilities comprise two rooms, a junior room which has at present 22 pupils and a senior room which has at present 32 boys and girls in an area of <Col N="1478" /> approximately 300 sq. ft.  My understanding of departmental guidelines with regard to space and gudelines that insurance companies endorse is that in old schools it is recommended that each pupil be allocated 11 sq. ft. of space and in the newer, more modern schools that 15 sq. ft. be allocated to each pupil.  That we have 32 primary school pupils in a space of 300 sq. ft. is an indictment.  Further, there is considerable hardship imposed on pupils and teachers alike as it is necessary for senior pupils seeking toilet facilities to pass through another classroom constantly, thus upset the junior cycle class.</P>
    <P>When one considers the vast increase in population in Portlaoise town and its environs over the past ten years, one can see that the facilities are not adequate for 1988.  The present population is over 12,000 people.  It is a town which has expanded far more than other provincial towns in Leinster over that time.  If the Department of Education are reluctant to sanction the necessary grant aid for the extension and fear that this is a school which may suffer from lack of pupils in time to come and that their investment will not be realised, I would like to join with the board of management in allaying those fears.  At present there are 54 pupils in the school.  In September of 1988 it is expected that there will be a further 11 pupils coming in and six pupils leaving for secondary school, giving a net gain of five pupils.  In 1990, as the Minister is aware, it is estimated that there will be 69 pupils in the two-room school, which speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>On the question of cost, one is talking about a total sum, I understand, of £42,000 to complete the necessary works of one classroom and the construction of a boiler house.  The board of management and the parents recognise that money is not as plentiful as far as Government Departments are concerned as perhaps was the case in the past.  They realise that Government grants are not hand-outs and that they must not be applied for just <Col N="1479" /> for the sake of applying.  Everybody in the State is making an effort to engage in a certain amount of belt tightening.  With that in mind, they have embarked over the past number of years on a fairly comprehensive fund raising programme. With regard to the present grant system for such extensions the Minister of State will agree that the local contribution is usually in the order of 12½ per cent of the total works, leaving a balance of the order of seven-eighths to be provided by way of State aid.  In this case the management committee and parents since 1982 have raised a total sum of £17,000 which, if placed against the overall cost of £42,000, would leave the board of management seeking a sum of £25,000 from the State. All credit must be given to the board for raising over 40 per cent of the estimated cost.  That would underline to the Minister and the Minister of State the urgent need which parents and the board see for extended facilities.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress on the Minister of State the need to have this work commenced as quickly as possible.  The campaign was first started over eight years ago.  The parents and teachers, the board of management, all interested parties, are very concerned that this matter should not drag on any longer.  The title to the property is in order, planning permission has been obtained and the plans have been agreed, so there is little else but to have the final and formal sanction of the Department for the payment of funds.  When one considers the allocation of £6.5 million by the Minister for Finance in October, it is not unfair for the board of management of this school to expect that priority might be given to allocating a sum of £25,000, which I understand would set matters in motion.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming here this evening as I realise he has a busy schedule.  I hope the Minister will see fit to grant this money.  I will now allow Deputy Hyland to come in for the remainder of my time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the fact that Deputy Flanagan has allowed me time to support the case in relation to the provision of additional classroom accommodation for the Church of Ireland school in Portlaoise.  I realise that there are many applications with the Department for new schools and extensions and I am realistic enough to acknowledge that the availability of funds for capital projects such as schools is limited.  It must also be said that the Reverend Canon Day, director at Portlaoise, and the school board have displayed by their toerance, their acceptance that funds are scarce.  The patience they have displayed since the date of their first application in the face of the many setbacks and disappointments which have been associated with the application is something which cannot be ignored.</P>
      <P>We are talking about an emergency in the town of Portlaoise.  We are talking about gross overcrowding and all the problems associated with that.  The school board have been content to negotiate in a reasonable manner with the Department through all channels of communication open to them and through the balanced political representations of both Deputy Flanagan and myself.  Their patience is now becoming exhausted.  They have tried every reasonable means at their disposal to find a solution.</P>
      <P>We are not talking about a very large sum of money.  The school management board raised from the community a sum far beyond that which would normally be expected.  It is to their credit and it is an indication of their commitment and of their anxiety to provide educational facilities for the primary students in the Portlaoise area.  All we are asking for tonight is for the Government to see their way to providing £25,000.  The Minister will agree that this is a very small sum from public funds to provide an urgently needed facility for the Church of Ireland community in the capital town of my county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the courtesy which the <Col N="1481" /> Minister has displayed to me over the past 12 months.  I have been harassing him on a weekly basis for a solution.  I know he is as anxious as I am to find a speedy solution.  On many occasions I spoke with senior officials in the Department as they also displayed an anxiety to find the solution.  I hope the outcome of our deliberations tonight in the presence of the Minister will be that the solution will be found.  The solution is simple.  It is the provision of £25,000 or thereabouts.</P>
    <P>We in this House have a duty to ensure that we provide for the needs of primary education in Portlaoise.  Much dedication has been displayed by the school management board and the community have made a positive financial commitment.  It is not asking too much of the Minister and the Department to provide the small sum of money necessary to get the project off the ground.  I hope he will provide the money so that the project can get off the ground as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Flanagan in thanking the Minister for coming to the House tonight.  I know he is very familiar with the problem and that he has shown a desire to solve it.  The Minister has dealt with the people in Portlaoise in a courteous manner over the months and we hope tonight we will get a permanent solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Deputies for their contribution on this school.  I am aware of the very poor condition of the school and of the urgent need for improvements.  At the request of Deputy Hyland I went to see the school one evening when I was passing through Portlaoise and I readily agree that it is in urgent need of repair.  The school caters for 54 pupils and a staff of two, including the principal.  The accommodation consists of two permanent classrooms erected in 1887.  They are small and unsatisfactory.  A number of schemes for improved accommodation have been under consideration in the Department in <Col N="1482" /> consultation with the school authorities. The proposal at present under examination is one for the provision of a new permanent classroom linked to the existing school building.  Tenders for this project have been received.</P>
      <P>I accept that accommodation in the existing school is unsatisfactory but Deputies will appreciate the present financial constraints in relation to the primary school building programme.  The Department's difficulties are compounded by the large number of projects in respect of which school authorities are seeking grant assistance.  One of the main problems is that each school feels strongly about its own case.   The task of the Department is to allocate limited moneys over as wide an area as possible in line with an objective assessment of the relative urgency of the cases in hand.</P>
      <P>The school authorities made certain proposals to the Department in relation to the grant, if the project were approved for contract, which have been mentioned by both Deputies here this evening.  I accept that Deputy Hyland has harassed me almost on a weekly basis over the past 12 months about this school.  At his request I spoke to Canon Day on the telephone some months ago and assured him of my commitment to finding a solution so that we can proceed with this proposal.  I have asked my Department to consider this matter urgently in the light of the overall financial situation in relation to the primary schools building programme and having regard to the large number of projects on hand.  I readily accept that the school authorities and all the local interests feel strongly that the project should be allowed to proceed to contract, particularly in view of the length of time the matter has been under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much as I would like to I am unable at this stage to give the assurances sought but I can assure all concerned that I am sympathetic to the problems of the school and I promise to have the case examined urgently having regard to the difficult <Col N="1483" /> financial situation.  In view of the interest of both Deputies I will communicate with them when this examination has been completed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that the policing service provided by the gardaí at Kenagh and Ballymahon is supplemented as necessary by mobile patrols operating from their respective district headquarters at Longford and Athlone and from the divisional headquarters in Mullingar. Also, when Kenagh or Ballymahon station is closed, callers can make immediate contact with the district headquarters station for assistance by means <Col N="1215" /> of the external radio-telephone, or &ldquo;Green-Man&rdquo;, which can be used free of charge at any time of the day or night. The gardaí at the district headquarters are in radio contact with all foot and mobile patrols operating in the area so that the most appropriate unit can respond to calls for assistance.</P>

    <P>The report for 1987 is not yet available.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned at the level of under-age drinking in the country and the apparent difficulty experienced by the Garda in obtaining successful prosecutions against persons who supply alcohol to young persons.  The difficulty in obtaining prosecutions is largely due to the fact that it must be proved in court that the licensee &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; supplied alcohol to a person under 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1988, which I introduced yesterday, proposes to repeal the relevant sections of the 1924 Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act which contain the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; and to introduce new provisions which do not include that word.  This change in the law along with several other provisions will, I believe, make a significant contribution towards curbing under-age drinking.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the comments made by the President of the Circuit Court on 10 December 1987 in relation to the scheme. The changes in the scheme, introduced with effect from 1 April 1986, to exclude compensation for pain and suffering, were decided upon by the then Government in the light of the escalating cost of the scheme as it operated up to then and in the light of available resources.

The granting of such a concession could, however, have substantial consequences for the taxation of married couples with children where both spouses have income and where their combined marginal tax rate is in excess of 35 per cent.  Such married couples would be entitled to elect to be taxed as single persons under section 193 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and there could be a constitutional obligation to allow them the same benefits as would be enjoyed by two single parents.

On the basis of the supporting documentation tax had been under deducted by his employer from his earnings for 1987-88 and, consequently, there was no repayment of tax due at that time.  In his continued absence from work his weekly tax-free allowances accumulated and by 7 February 1988 he was due a refund of £111.28.  This amount was repaid to him on 22 February.  By 18 March his tax-free allowance had accumulated to a sufficient extent to enable the balance of the tax deducted (i.e. £188.51) from his earnings for 1987-88 to be refunded to him.  This amount was refunded to the taxpayer on 18 April 1988.</P>

      <P>The public service early retirement scheme is being offered to eligible public servants on a voluntary basis so consequently, there have been no enforced redundancies under the scheme.  Eligibility for the scheme was initially confined to persons working in areas where developments had made particular groups of staff surplus to the needs of the public service but was subsequently extended to the over 50's in most areas of the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated in my Budget Statement that the redundancy terms will remain available during 1988.  Within the broad parameters set out above it is a matter for local management in the first instance to determine how widely the terms of the scheme will be offered in particular organisations and also the criteria to be <Col N="1231" /> applied in deciding whether to accept applications.  The approach adopted in any particular area of the public service will depend on the circumstances in that area including its financial allocation within which they must operate and whether staff are surplus to requirements. For this reason, there are no predetermined targets for voluntary early retirement set for individual Departments or State-sponsored bodies.  A total of 1,135 public servants left under the early retirement scheme during 1987.  A further 3,300 approximately have left so far this year.</P>
    <P>The costs of redundancy lump sums are borne in the first instance by the direct employer, who then seeks recoupment from the Vote for public service early retirement payments.  There is therefore a short interval between retirements and subsequent recoupment from the Vote. The costs of redundancy payments for those who left in 1987 amounted to £11.5 million of which £8.4 million was recouped to the employing agencies in that year.  Issues totalling £16.1 million approximately have been made so far this year from the Vote for early retirements. This figure included costs incurred during 1987 but not recouped to the agencies in question before the end of the year.</P>

    <P>I am satisfied that the air traveller and particularly the tourist has available to <Col N="1242" /> him very competitive air fares on this route and given the economics and structure of the route the fares compare favourably with those available on the Dublin-London route.  I am confident that the route will be well served by the two Irish carriers.  I understand also that SAS may operate services to Dublin this summer from Copenhagen via Glasgow on a fifth freedom basis.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Social Welfare Acts provide that pay-related benefit is not payable where the total amount of disability benefit payable equals or exceeds 75 per cent of a claimant's average reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant year.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 10 July 1987.  His reckonable weekly earnings in the 1984-85 income tax year which govern his claim were £12.66.  As his weekly disability benefit rate of £42.30 exceeded 75 per cent of his earnings, he was not entitled to payment of pay-related benefit.</P>
      <P>However, when the claim was being processed, his pay-related benefit was incorrectly calculated by reference to his earnings in the 1985-86 tax year.  This resulted in the overpayment referred to. In the circumstances of this case, it is not now proposed to seek further recovery of this overpayment.</P>

      <P>The Community Patent Convention was signed by Ireland and all <Col N="1269" /> of the then member states of the European Communities in 1975.  All of the original signatories, except Ireland and Denmark, have since taken the necessary domestic measures to ratify the convention, the bringing into force of which is an important element in the completion by 1992 of the Internal Market of the Community.  In Ireland's case there are constitutional difficulties about the ratification of the convention and, because of these, it is not possible in the immediate future to initiate the necessary legislative measures to enable ratification to proceed.</P>
      <P>A necessary step towards ratification of the Community Patent Convention, however, is the ratification of the European Patent Convention, which involves other European countries in addition to members of the European Communities. The Government have already decided that legislation to enable ratification of the European Patent Convention should now be proceeded with and the preparation of the necessary measure is at present being undertaken</P>

      <P>Cork city is still the headquarters of a region comprising Counties Cork and Kerry and parts of west Waterford and south Tipperary.  Nine driver testers <Col N="1288" /> operate in this area of which five are headquartered in Cork city.  However, the demands made on the testing service throughout the country are not constant and require a degree of movement by testers outside their base areas from time to time.  Similarly, changes in regional boundaries and in the location of regional headquarters may be necessary from time to time in the interests of the efficient management of the service.  At present, the regional arrangements are being reviewed.</P>

      <P>Under existing legislation the first step in obtaining separate local government representation for a town would involve an application for the establishment of town commissioners.  No such application has been made in this case. Any new proposal for the establishment of local authority structures would however, more appropriately fall to be considered in the context of the pending reorganisation of local government.  The programme which I am currently finalising in this area will deal with the question of local government structures and will update existing legislation.  The position of urban areas such as Ballybofey-Stranorlar can most appropriately be considered, therefore, in the overall context of the local government reform programme.</P>

Particulars of these draft directives are set out in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>An important item which is expected to be referred to the Social Affairs Council during the current Presidency is the Commission proposal for an implementing regulation for the European Social Fund. That regulation will follow from the framework regulation for the reform of the three Community Structural Funds which is at present under consideration by the General Affairs Council.  The Irish attitude to the draft of the implementing regulation, when published, will depend largely on the provisions envisaged by it for additional ESF assistance to be made available to the less developed Community regions, including Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 252 together.</P>
      <P>To classify compulsive gambling as a disease would not in itself entitle the gambler to any special benefits.  Gambling takes many forms and possibly the majority of people engage in it in one form or another from time to time. Those, however, who experience problems, or for whose families problems are created, through excessive gambling may obtain counselling and advice from their local psychiatric service.  An important role in this regard is also played by the voluntary group, Gamblers Anonymous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the steps he proposes to take to deal with the situation whereby men and women in Ireland have the lowest life expectancy at birth compared to their European counterparts except for Northern Ireland as stated in a media report (details supplied).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the article to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>From the latest available figures based on mortality statistics for the years 1980 to 1982, the life expectancies for Irish men and women at birth are 70.14 years and 75.62 years respectively.  It is not the case that these figures are the lowest in Europe apart from Northern Ireland. Within the EC, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Portugal all have lower life expectancies for men than Ireland, and for men and women taken together, both Scotland and Portugal fall behind Ireland as do a considerable number of non-EC European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International comparisons of life expectancy data must be approached <Col N="1328" /> with caution.  Since infancy is a time of relatively high mortality, differences in the reporting of early neo-natal deaths and in practices relating to abortion can have a significant effect on life expectancy figures.  Comparisons can also be misleading due the the fact that statistics for different countries are not all based on the same base years.  It is also relevant that the range in life expectancy in EC countries in particular, is relatively narrow.</P>
    <P>The health system in Ireland is well developed, relative to our stage of econnomic development.  The wide range of preventive, curing and caring services already in place is designed to address the nation's health problems.  The new structure for health promotion introduced in January 1988 represents a further significant development aimed at the prevention of some of the main causes of premature mortality in Ireland, including heart disease, cancer and accidents.  The new arrangements for health promotion also acknowledge the multiple factors underlying contemporary health problems and, through the Advisory Council on Health Promotion and the Committee of Ministers, facilitate a multi-sectoral approach in addressing particular health problems.  These developments are in accord with the recommendations set out in the report on health promotion by the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, which is the main subject of the article referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Medical cards are issued on a means test basis to persons who in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable without undue hardship to provide general practitioner <Col N="1329" /> services for themselves and their dependents. The purpose of the medical cards income guidelines is to assist chief executive officers in reaching a decision about a person's entitlement and to ensure uniformity of decisions in the different health boards.  In deciding eligibility for free services every effort is made to be as equitable as possible and in cases where people are cohabiting health boards treat them as a family unit, as far as possible, and apply the medical card guidelines for married couples.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for entry requirements to third level VEC colleges rests with the college authorities and the relevant validating bodies.  I understand, however, that in the regional technical colleges English or Irish at Leaving Certificate level are required for entry purposes with the exception of the Staidéar Gnó course in Galway RTC and the Staidéar Rúnaíochta in Letterkenny where Irish at Leaving Certificate level is required.  In the third level colleges administered under the aegis of the City <Col N="1345" /> of Dublin VEC Irish is not required for entry purposes.</P>
    <P>With certain exceptions Irish is a necessary requirement for matriculation purposes in order to qualify for entry to the constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland, i.e. UCC, UCD, UCG and St. Patrick's College, Maynooth which is a recognised college.</P>
    <P>Irish is also an obligatory entry requirement for admission to the primary teacher-training colleges and to Thomond College of Education, Limerick.</P>
    <P>In the case of Trinity College, Dublin Irish is not a necessary requirement, except where a particular course in Irish Studies is being pursued.</P>
    <P>Irish is not an obligatory subject for entry to the National Institutes for Higher Education, Limerick and Dublin. Grade D or a higher grade in higher or ordinary level Leaving Certificate Irish is among the requirements for entry to</P>

      <P>I am aware of newspaper reports concerning the statement made by the General Secretary of the Teachers' Union of Ireland about the selection and appointment procedures for vocational teachers.</P>
      <P>The selection and appointment procedures for appointment of teachers in second level vocational schools were reviewed in 1979 and the current procedures are as set out in my Department's Circular Letter 16/79, the contents of which are set out below.</P>
      <P>In the case of appointments to teaching posts in third level VEC colleges, other than to the post of principal in the regional technical colleges, the arrangements which have been authorised provide for selection boards of at least three and not more than five members.  The five member boards should consist of the chief executive officer of the parent vocational education committee, three other members of the board of management, at least one of whom would be a member of a vocational education committee, and the Minister's nominee.</P>
      <P>The composition of selection boards for appointments to the post of principal in a third level VEC college is set out in Appendix K of Memorandum V7, which is set out below.</P>
      <P>Following is the circular:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1351" />
      <Col N="1352" />5.  The <i>General Selection Board</i> referred to in paragraph 4 is to be set up by each Vocational Education Committee for <i>all wholetime appointments.</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;to Class III teaching posts,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to posts of Principal in schools with points ratings up to and including 299 points,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to posts of Vice-Principal in schools with points ratings up to and including 599 points,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to all Grade 3 posts of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The <i>Central Selection Board</i> referred to in paragraph 4 is to be set up by each Vocational Education Committee for appointment</P>
    <P>&mdash;to posts of Principal in schools with points ratings in excess of 299 points,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to posts of Vice-Principal in schools with points ratings in excess of 599 points,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to all Grade A posts of responsibility.</P>
    <P>6.  The adoption by Vocational Education Committees of the provisions of this Circular Letter should be formally recorded.  Proposed appointments after its adoption will be approved only where these provisions have been complied with.</P>
    <P>D. Ó LAOGHAIRE,</P>

    <P>Following is Appendix K of the memorandum:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Text of letter issued personally by the Minister for Education, Mr. Donogh O'Malley, T.D., to the Chairman of each Vocational Education Committee on 7th March, 1967.</P>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, a Chara,</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the letter addressed to all Vocational Education Committees on 20 Eanáir, 1967 regarding the question of the improvement of the procedure followed in connection with the appointment of vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>I have given careful consideration to the observations which have been furnished by Committees in reply to that letter.  The matter has been further discussed by officers of my Department with representatives of the Irish Vocational Education Association and of the Association of Chief Executive Officers.  I have also had a further discussion personally with representatives of the Irish Vocational Education Association.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much the manner in which this matter has been approached by Committees and by the Associations.  I have been impressed by the views which have been put before me and have taken account of them in formulating amendments to the proposals contained in the letter of 20 Eanair, 1967.</P>
    <P>The amended procedure is set out as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  for all permanent whole-time Class III appointments, for all Special Grade appointments and for all appointments to teaching posts carrying allowances of less than £280 per annum:&mdash;</P>
    <P>each Committee to set up as from 1st April, 1967, a selection board of five members consisting of four named members of the Committee and one officer of the Department of Education who will be nominated by the Minister; this board to act for one year and to be assisted by the Chief Executive Officer as a non-voting advisor and by such other non-voting advisors as it may desire in particular cases.</P>
    <P>(b)  for all appointments to teaching posts carrying allowances of £280 per annum and over, for all appointments to posts as Higher Technological Teacher, Grade III and for all appointments to posts carrying inclusive salaries above that level:&mdash; each Committee to nominate four of its members to serve for one year as from 1st April, 1967, on a central selection board of seven members, the other three members of the Board to consist of one representative of the Irish Vocational Education Association and two officers of the Department of Education who will be nominated by the Minister; the latter three members to be permanent members and the four Committee representatives to sit according to the vocational education area for which the appointments are to be made; the central board to be assisted by advisors as at (a) above; secretarial service for this board to be provided by the Department if desired.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" />
      <Col N="1354" />It is envisaged that Vocational Education Committees, having adopted the procedure outlined above, should not find it necessary to proceed in full committee to duplicate the work of the selection boards and that in the normal way they should make their appointments in accordance with the selections of the boards.  I therefore desire it to be understood that this will be the normal procedure.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that in the introduction of the procedure outlined above it is my desire to facilitate the exercise by Committees of their growing responsibilities and to make more time available to them in committee so as to enable them the better to cope with the many new developments in secondary and technical education.  I trust, therefore, that I will have the co-operation of all Committees in the implementation of the amended procedure for an experimental period as from 1st April, 1967.  It is my intention that this procedure be adopted by all Vocational Education Committees and that proposed appointments after its adoption will be approved only in accordance with its provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 to 284, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The decision to provide a new post primary school in Kilquade was taken in January 1985.  It was taken on the basis of projections of significant growth in housing, population and pupil numbers in the Kilcoole, Kilquade and New-townmountkennedy areas.  Also, it was anticipated that the schools in Bray, Wicklow and Greystones, currently catering for post primary pupils from those areas, would not be able to do so in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These assumptions have not been borne out.  In particular there has not been, and it appears that there will not be, a significant increase in the number of <Col N="1355" /> pupils annually leaving the four primary schools in Kilcoole and Newtown-mountkennedy: the total number leaving at the end of the 1986-87 school year was 95; the total number projected to leave at the end of the 1994-95 school year is 133.  Baptism figures for the parish of Kilquade have remained stable in recent years and are at a level which would not justify the provision of a new school in Kilquade.</P>
    <P>Other factors have meant that the existing post primary schools in Bray, Wicklow and Greystones will continue to cater adequately for pupils from Kilcoole, Kilquade, Newcastle and New-townmountkennedy. Firstly, a new comprehensive school in Wicklow town for 250 places opened in September 1987; this has had an effect on the level of first year enrolments in some of the other schools, particularly in Greystones where surplus capacity of almost 100 places exists.  Secondly, the three schools in Wicklow town have all had additional accommodation completed in recent years with the result that there is now a small, but increasing, surplus of provision in the centre.  In Bray post primary centre, the total intake into the five schools in the free education scheme has fallen for the second year in succession.</P>
    <P>At no time in the foreseeable future will potential demand for post primary school places from the area exceed the number of available intake places.</P>
    <P>Given these circumstances and in the light of current financial constraints I am sure that the Deputy will accept that the provision of further post primary accommodation in north-east County Wicklow is not justified.  Having regard to all the relevant data, therefore, the question of consulting each second level school authority did not arise.  I am satisfied that the post primary schools in Bray, Greystones and Wicklow, which are well served by existing transport arrangements, will continue to cater adequately for all the pupils in these catchment areas seeking post primary education.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education when work will commence on the post-primary school promised for the Kingswood Heights-Kilnamanagh areas of Tallaght, Dublin 24; if the project can be expedited in view of the urgent need for a post-primary school in this area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The present position regarding the proposed post-primary school for the Kingswood Heights/Kilnamanagh areas of Tallaght is that in view of the considerable amount of capital expenditure required to provide the school, the strict limitation of funding available to my Department and the large number of cases requiring urgent attention, all aspects of the project are the subject of a detailed investigation before commitments can be entered into.  Consequently, I am not in a position to say when work will commence on the school.</P>

The school opened in temporary accommodation in September 1986 and is at present housed in the old vocational school, Lucan.  I am not aware of any need to upgrade the facilities available in the old vocational school, Lucan; in this regard and with regard to the provision of new buildings for St. Kevin's community college I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputy Mitchell's question of Wednesday, 10 February 1988 (No. 88).
