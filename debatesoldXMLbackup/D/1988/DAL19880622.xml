      <P>On the Order of Business last week I asked the Taoiseach could he indicate when the rules and regulations necessary to make the Status of Children Act effective would be brought into force.  I was subsequently advised that they were under preparation but I was given no indication as to when they would be published.  The failure to publish and distribute these rules and regulations is preventing both children and parents relying on the rights conferred on them by the Status of Children Act.

      <P>Last Friday we dealt with the Estimates for the Department of Justice with the Minister for Justice not being present.  Last night I moved a Private Members' motion and &mdash; what I regard as a great slight on the Opposition parties in this House &mdash; the best the Government could do was to send in a backbencher to reply to the main speaker from the Opposition and who proceeded to misrepresent what I had said and to use the issue as a political football.  As a result of a biased judgment by your substitute in the Chair I was asked to leave the House.</P>

When the Minister got out of this House and into the Seanad, where the Government have a majority, he deleted the amendment which had been accepted by this House and now he does not appear in this House when dealing with the amendments made by the Seanad, rather he has sent in Deputy Woods, who, I am sure, has no authority whatsoever to accept anything.

I want to assure the Government that, as far as I am concerned, the days of co-operation are finished if this is the manner in which we are going to be treated.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 6: In page 5, lines 27 and 28, &ldquo;at midday or in the evening, or at midday and in the evening,&rdquo; deleted.</P>
      <P>Following an amendment proposed by Deputy Colley, the afternoon break from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. in the permitted hours of the supply of intoxicating liquor in special licensed restaurants was removed.  This Seanad amendment makes a consequential change in the definition of &ldquo;restaurants&rdquo; in section 6. That is all that is being proposed in this amendment.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee <Col N="1216" /> agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Section 8: In page 6, lines 36 and 37, &ldquo;is satisfied including <i>inter alia</i> by annual inspection&rdquo; deleted and&rdquo;, having inspected the restaurant, is satisfied&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>In consequence of an amendment proposed by Deputy Seán Barrett, subsection (2) of section 8 was amended to ensure that the special licensed restaurants would be inspected by Bord Fáilte at least once a year.  It was indicated that this amendment would be referred to the draftsman to see if the wording could be approved.  This is now done in Seanad amendment No. 2.  It will be noted from subsection (4) of section 8 that the Bord Fáilte certificate must be renewed each year.  The effect of this amendment is to ensure that the premises are inspected before the new certificate is issued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to expand a little bit more in regard to his reference to subsection (4) and how he would consider that the two taken together would require that an annual inspection take place.  We had a long debate on this on Committee Stage when the argument was very forcibly put.  We agreed to the proposition that there would at least be an annual inspection in order to maintain standards.  Because the reference to an annual inspection has been taken out by the Seanad amendment I would like the Minister to tell us how the two taken together will achieve what this House is anxious to achieve, that is, regular, at least annual, inspections to ensure that standards are maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that we, technically, achieve what the Deputies have in mind.  In this regard the advice which was sought was the advice of the draftsman. Essentially it was a question of ensuring that we achieved what the Deputies have in mind.  The position now is that an inspection will have to take <Col N="1217" /> place before a certificate is issued.  The issue of a certificate will still be required each year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

If it is being suggested by way of implication I believe that the better thing to do would be to leave the explicit obligation and let the section stand in the way in which it left this House.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Which allows for the annual granting of licence.  The problem, as I see it is that by taking out the reference to an annual inspection in subsection (2) we are abandoning it.  What I would like to know is whether by way of implication there is an obligation to carry out an inspection before a certificate can be issued?  This is all by way of implication. There is nothing explicit in the section that requires the annual inspection. If my interpretation is correct, I think the preference of this House would be to keep the explicit need for an annual <Col N="1218" /> inspection because of our concerns to see that standards are maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>Section 8 (4) states:</P>
      <P>A Bord Fáilte Certificate shall, unless it is sooner cancelled pursuant to this Act, continue in force until the date of the next annual licensing district court for the court area in which the restaurant the subject of that Certificate is situated.</P>
      <P>The certificate only continues up to the annual licensing date.  It will have to be renewed or else it will fall.  The provision &ldquo;... having inspected the restaurant, is satisfied ...&rdquo; is included in the other section.  The draftsman has assured us that that is the position.</P>

      <P>May I say to the Minister, with the greatest respect to the draftsman, that what is wrong with much of our legislation is that the average man in the street does not understand what was in people's minds.  I certainly do not understand what was in the draftsman's mind in this case.  He should have come forward with an amendment which said &ldquo;...having inspected the restaurant annually is satisfied...&rdquo;.  Why could he not include the word &ldquo;annual&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to be suspicious of what is going on here.  It is clear that an attempt is being made to delete the requirement for an annual inspection by coming in here and pretending that by using different words we can achieve the same thing.  If the word &ldquo;annual&rdquo; is left out of this section and it is challenged in any court of law, I suggest that any reasonable justice or judge would say that the legislation does not make it clear that the restaurant has to be inspected annually.  For the life of me I cannot understand why people have to fiddle around with what is already there.  What is wrong with the phrase &ldquo;...is satisfied including <i>inter alia</i> by annual inspection...&rdquo; I got legal advice on this.  If the legal advice I got had come from the draftsman's office there would be nothing wrong with it but because it did not come from the draftsman's office it has to be changed.  There is a belief that <Col N="1219" /> every time the Opposition put forward an amendment, no matter what the wording is, it has to be changed because it did not come from the Government side.  I had experience of this recently in relation to an amendment to the Courts Bill.  I wanted the Minister to get the approval of the House to change the regulations in relation to the two senior counsel rule. The wording I used in my amendment was an exact copy of the wording in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but, lo and behold, the draftsman was not satisfied with the wording.  The wording came from the draftsman's office during the period of office of the 1984 Government.  This proves that unless the wording comes directly from the draftsman's office it is not acceptable to this House.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that what is in this amendment achieves what we want and is what this House asked for and got when the Bill was being debated.  If there is some attempt being made to drop the annual inspection by twisting words I am not going to be conned into accepting this.  I will not accept this wording as it is presented.  If they wanted to change the wording I cannot understand why they could not have said &ldquo;...having inspected the restaurant annually is satisfied...&rdquo; What is wrong with that?  The word &ldquo;annually&rdquo; was deliberately deleted.  I am convinced that the Government attempted, when they went out of the Dáil and into the Seanad, where they have a big majority, to drop the requirement of an annual inspection.  I am not going to be conned like I was last night or last Friday.  The days of being conned by the Government are finished.  I will not accept this con trick which is an attempt on the part of the Government not to build into the legislation the requirement for an annual inspection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The section would confine it to one inspection annually and the reason for including this provision is that it may be necessary to have more than one inspection annually.  The amendment has been worded this way to ensure that a premises is open to more than one inspection annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I am afraid that is not the case because the previous amendment said &ldquo;...including <i>inter alia</i>...&rdquo; and that means that other provisions are allowed for.  If there is to be an extra inspection in addition to the annual inspection there was nothing in the section in the form it went out from the Dáil after Committee Stage and Report Stage, to preclude the board carrying out a further inspection of the premises.  I agree with Deputy Barrett and Deputy McCartan that there seems to be a deliberate omission of the word &ldquo;annual&rdquo;.  If one reads through the section it is obvious that the application allowed for in section 8 (1) is for an initial certificate prior to a restaurant obtaining any special restaurant licence for the first time.  The conditions set out in section 8 (2) lead to the granting of that certificate, whereas section 8 (4) merely allows for the fact that one might apply for a special restaurant licence mid-year and then move to the annual licensing day.  There is no requirement in the section for the certificate to be re-granted every year on the annual licensing day.  It requires that a certificate is in being and continuing and that it may continue without annual inspection.  The section, as now presented <Col N="1221" /> to us after being in the Seanad, has absolutely no requirement to have an annual inspection or an annual re-grant of a certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back to the Minister in regard to the earlier reply he gave me.  I presume the Minister would point out to Deputy Colley that in respect of section 8 (4) the certificate lapses each year so there is a question of renewal of both the certificate and the licence.  The practice at present with regard to the licensing of public houses in that one sitting day of the District Court is set aside each year and it is called the annual licensing day.  From debates on this, I believe that 900 licences have to be renewed on one day by the District Court in the Dublin metropolitan area. These are lodged, the fees are paid and they are automatically granted by the district justice unless there is a specific objection from residents or a superintendent. The regime and order for the renewal of licences for public houses is a matter of course on an annual basis, without any requirement for inspection or review even by the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the taking out of the requirement for an annual inspection in section 8 will allow for exactly the same order of things to work with regard to restaurant licences and renewal of certificates. We specifically addressed that point in response to many concerns, but in particular to the concerns of the licensed trade, that there might be a proliferation, or a reduction, or a falling off in standards.  We wanted an ongoing annual inspection.  On Committee Stage we queried whether Bord Fáilte would be given the resources and personnel to maintain the necessary review and policing of the various restaurants which had been granted licences.  We are particularly anxious to ensure that a constant review is maintained.  At that time the Minister seemed happy with our concerns and responded to them and I am disappointed that the requirement for the annual inspection is being taken out as a minimum.  We argued on Committee <Col N="1222" /> Stage that if that requirement was not there it was not to allow for multiple inspections in one year but that it would achieve the situation where there might never be an inspection of the certificate by Bord Fáilte after the initial inspection. The objective of our efforts on Committee Stage was to ensure ongoing, regular policing at least once a year.  I would be very disappointed if the House departed from that principle, it having been argued at length on Committee Stage.  In the spirit of goodwill, the Government should accept the wording as it stands and not pursue the amendment from the Seanad at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When we debated this Bill in the House, I got a categorical assurance from the Minister that the same rigorous inspections and the law would apply right across the board.  Is that still the case?  I believe that it is.  With regard to Deputy McCartan's point about the licensing of public houses, etc., there is one annual licensing date, but the Deputy is quite wrong when he says that public houses are not subject to inspection.  Several different forms are sent out prior to the licensing renewal application.  One of those must be signed and stamped by the local authority, so the licensed premises are subject to inspection and must be passed as fit premises before the licence can be granted.</P>
      <P>In the case of restaurants, here we are dealing with food in a much greater capacity than would apply to the ordinary public house serving pub grub.  These restaurants should be subject to more than one inspection per annum.  It is easy to have premises in good order coming up to the licence renewal date and perhaps in a month's time let the standards fall. The Minister is quite right that these should be subject to more than one inspection and if that is the case I would be quite happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  The reason that I am, and will continue to be, very sceptical about what is going on here is that I believe this to be a deliberate attempt to get over the annual inspection requirement.  I suggest that the Fianna Fáil backbenchers who debated this Bill are being conned as well as we are and do not know it.  This amendment was proposed by me on Committee Stage and if one looks at the record &mdash; and I think my recollection is correct &mdash; the Minister asked that we give him time to examine our amendment and that he would consider it on Report Stage.  What happened between Committee and Report Stages? I presume the parliamentary draftsman was sent a copy of the amendment and that he gave his opinion.  Why did the Minister not accept the amendment on Report Stage, or why did he not come forward with another technical amendment on Report Stage?</P>
      <P>This is a total and utter con trick.  If the parliamentary draftsman was serious and was worried about the particular wording in the Bill &mdash; which is a load of bunkum, anyway &mdash; he would have put in the phrase &ldquo;having inspected the restaurant annually, be satisfied....&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very subtle attempt being made here to get rid of the annual inspection requirement.  With the greatest respect to Deputy McCartan, he should not be fooled.  I have been fooled for the past couple of months, I must admit, but never again.  This is an absolute con trick.  Why does the Minister not say that the Government do not like the idea of an annual inspection, that they have thought about it and that perhaps Bord Fáilte have pointed out they could <Col N="1224" /> not inspect all the premises annually and that it would cause total confusion.  What we said in this House, and Deputy McCartan repeated, was that we do not expect the taxpayer to bear the cost of these annual inspections.  We expect those applying for the licences to pay for them.  That is what we said and it is on the record of the House.  There are 250,000 people unemployed out there, and if we, through this legislation, can make a few other inspectors jobs for annual &mdash; at least annual &mdash; inspection all the better.</P>
      <P>After all, the licence will cost only £3,000 once off and I do not see why there should not be an annual inspection to ensure that standards are upheld. Those who have invested large sums of money in licensed premises must not be put out of business because somebody next door bought a premises, did it up and it was grand for the first Bord Fáilte inspection but immediately afterwards all the restaurant fittings were removed and it was basically a pub and the owner comes into court every year and gets a licence.</P>
      <P>It is just tough luck if we are asking Bord Fáilte to go around the country and inspect all applications for a renewal of a special restaurant licence at least annually at no cost to the taxpayer.  I will not accept the wording suggested by the Minister.  Perhaps there will not be a majority in the House to accept my point of view but, if necessary, I shall put it to a vote to make the position clear to those out there who made representations to all of us, and who made a good case.  We tried to get a fair and equitable balance in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill leaves this House and goes into the sanctuary of the Seanad, where there is a large Government majority, we are not going to be fooled by any amendments made in the Dáil being quietly deleted, with a &ldquo;technical amendment&rdquo; coming back.  This is not a technical amendment.  If the Minister is so concerned about my wording and wants to come forward with words which include &ldquo;at least annually&rdquo;, or &rdquo;annually&rdquo;, or any other form of words that he wishes, we shall consider them, but <Col N="1225" /> certainly we shall not consider his present wording.</P>

I think that the parliamentary draftsman has met the requirements that there will be at least an annual inspection and that it is left open to more than an annual inspection in the wording at present.  I see the difficulty which was foreseen earlier, which is why the Minister examined the possibility of the drafting being improved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply mean that the procedure is that the parliamentary draftsman is asked to give effect to a certain provision.  Subsection (4) is ambiguous because it does not say that a Bord Fáilte certificate shall lapse at the end of each licensing period.  It says that it will continue in force until the date of the next annual licensing District Court sitting but it does not say it will lapse at that date.  That can mean that the licence will continue to be in force and that it will obviate the necessity for a further <Col N="1227" /> inspection and another certificate to be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear how subsection (4) will work in practice.  The certificate continues in force until the date of the next annual licensing court, which is a date in September in each District Court area.  I presume the meaning of the subsection is that, as of that date, the certificate is no longer in force, it is spent.  For example, if the licensing court is held on 6 September the Bord Fáilte certificate is spent on 5 September. To get a new licence, the restaurateur must produce another Bord Fáilte certificate and, to have got such a certificate, he would have had to comply with the regulations.  It is the Minister's intention &mdash; although it is disputed on this side of the House &mdash; that he will have been inspected.</P>
      <P>If Bord Fáilte issue that other certificate prior to 6 September in the knowledge that the current certificate will expire at midnight on 5 September, what date do Bord Fáilte put on the new certificate? If they issue it on 1 September, following an inspection in July or August, they issue a certificate dated 1 September but on what date will it expire?  According to this subsection, the certificate issued by Bord Fáilte expires the day before the annual licensing court.  How can they issue a further certificate that will not expire on 5 September?  Otherwise they will be issuing it <i>in futuro</i> which is hardly what is contemplated by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In those circumstances, the Bord Fáilte certificate can be dated until the following September.  If the Deputy is right in his conclusion that it will remain in force until that date and shall no longer be in force at that stage and will be dependent on the other certificate being available on that date&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>How can Bord Fáilte issue a certificate prior to the expiry date that will not be killed by the expiry date? I cannot see how they can issue a certificate on 1 September 1988 and declare <Col N="1228" /> that it will remain in force until 5 September 1989.  According to this section, a Bord Fáilte certificate can only continue in force until the date of the next licensing session and in regard to purporting to cover the following year, the next licensing session will be the one immediately taking place on 6 September.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch asked if the purpose of this amendment is to achieve the same order of things in regard to the licensing and renewal of licences for restaurants as for licensed premises. He sought to make this case throughout the debate and felt that there should be the same regime for all licensed premises. The Minister did not answer him and I should like him to do so now because it would tell us a lot about what is envisaged in regard to this amendment if the answer is &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  Is the Minister, by extension, accepting what Deputy Lynch said, that this inspection will be a matter of form filling?  Will restaurants be sent forms to fill out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference is that the Bord Fáilte positive certificate will be required every year whereas, in the other case, the licence will depend on whether there is an objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not appear to be a difference because each local authority are consulted and must be satisfied and the way they do that is by sending out a form to publicans to fill in.  That form is certified and sent on with documents to court.  I thank Deputy Lynch for the information in that regard.  It was something of which I was unaware, as my only contact is from attending the annual licensing courts where all the public houses in the area are simply nodded through.  If there are specific objections from the public or the local superintendent in relation to some public houses, they are put aside for a separate hearing.  I am convinced that that will be <Col N="1229" /> the end result of the Seanad amendment. Deputy Lynch wants a similar law for public houses and restaurants and there should be a more strict and regular direct inspection of these premises, not just filling out forms.  Restaurants and the provision of food are crucial to a developing and improving tourist industry and, unless there is active surveillance we will come out badly from this development of the law.  If the Minister is of the view that there is little between us, I ask him to bow to the strong opinions held on this side of the House and not to press his amendment any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain what happens in regard to licences for public houses.  These forms are issued through the federation and they must be completed and returned to the local authority. In my area, there is a quarterly report on the number of public houses, the number of inspections carried out, the numbers still to be inspected, the number passed and the number of premises where the local authority &mdash; usually the fire officer &mdash; might not be satisfied with the lighting system or the emergency exit.  Several requirements must be complied with before the granting of a licence and they will be inspected again and again, if necessary.  When the local authority are satisfied that the premises are up to the required standard, they will then issue the certificate which gives clearance to the publican from that point of view.</P>
      <P>The health board must also be satisfied that the premises are clean.  I was under the impression &mdash; I hope I am correct &mdash; that that is the intention of the Bill in regard to restaurants and that the same criteria must apply right across the board. I know there is a distinction in regard to public houses and the liquor licence and there is the other aspect of the Bord Fáilte requirement.  I thought they would interlink so that we would have the one rule for everybody.  The Minister said when he introduced the Bill in the House that the one law would apply across the board.  I hope that is still the <i>status quo.</i></P>

      <P>That amendment was accepted by the Minister on Committee Stage.  The Minister had between Committee Stage and Report Stage to have the technicalities of that wording checked out.  The Minister did so and came back with it and the amendment was accepted on Report Stage and Fifth Stage was passed and the Bill went to the Seanad. What has changed between Committee Stage, Report Stage and the Seanad?  The Bill has come back with a wording which has deliberately excluded the requirement to have an annual inspection.  All sorts of justifications have been offered this morning as to why the wording should be changed.  There is absolutely no reason why it should be changed but even if it was to be changed and the intentions as expressed by this House were to be included, the Minister would have put in a phrase saying that the restaurant should be inspected at least annually. The Minister has left out the word &ldquo;annually&rdquo; altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister can talk about when a Bord Fáilte certificate lapses and about annual licensing and so on but I am talking about annual inspection.  I am not talking about when a licence is renewed or how a licence is being renewed.  I am talking about having built into legislation <Col N="1231" /> a requirement to have the premises inspected annually by a Bord Fáilte inspector.  Nobody will convince me that this is not an attempt to delete that requirement.  The Minister has referred to a subsection that has nothing to do with inspecting premises.  It has to do with the renewal of licences.  We are not all that stupid.  If the Minister does not now want to have an annual inspection requirement included in the Bill, will he please stand up and say so.  He should not continue to insult our intelligence by telling us that by changing the wording and deleting the need for an annual inspection it achieves the same thing.  I could argue this until 12 o'clock, but it would be an insult to the intelligence of this House to do that.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest sympathy for Deputy Woods who has been sent in here but who did not take this Bill through the Dáil.  If the Minister for Justice could not be available, this Bill should not have been ordered for this morning.  I accept that Ministers have to go on business.  I do not know where the Minister is, but I assume he is on official business.  If that is the case the Bill could have been ordered for tomorrow, for Friday or for next Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.  I will sit until 2 o'clock in the morning if that satisfies the Government and the Government Chief Whip.</P>
    <P>It is really galling when one sits down and spends hours with no back-up service of civil servants behind one preparing one's script for the Estimates debate, when one comes in here and is chucked off after 15 minutes and when the Minister who delivered the opening speech disappears, and the reply to the debate is given by the Minister of State in Forestry, who was not even here when one was making one's contribution.  If that is not an insult to this House and to the Opposition parties, I do not know what is. Then, when one goes to more trouble to do research, sitting for hours trying to get a speech together on a very delicate issue like extradition, lo and behold, the best the Government can offer is a reply from <Col N="1232" /> a backbencher from County Louth who stands up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and kicks extradition around as a political football.  This morning we came in to deal with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill and what do we get? &mdash; the Minister for Social Welfare who was not even here when this Bill was debated, and who has the cheek to stand up and tell me I do not understand plain English.  I am talking about the requirement to have an annual inspection of a premises.  I am not talking about how licences will be renewed annually.  I am talking about putting into legislation a requirement that a Bord Fáilte inspector goes into a premises at least once a year and sees to it that that premises is what we regard as a restaurant for licensing purposes.  The Minister can fiddle around with all the words, but please do not stand up and tell us we do not understand plain English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know if Fianna Fáil have changed their minds on the requirement for an annual inspection.  If they have not changed their minds, would they please tell me why they object to putting in the words &ldquo;at least annually&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>inter alia</i> by annual inspection&rdquo;?  What is the objection? Please do not continue referring us to subsections (4) and (5) which have nothing to do with an annual inspection but which relate to the renewal of the licences.  I have the greatest sympathy for the Minister, because being thrown into a debate of this kind at the deep end is extremely difficult, but it is more frustrating for us.  Why the Government could not have ordered this business when the Minister for Justice would be here is beyond me, particularly when there was an amendment from the Opposition benches and agreed by this House, which is not a very regular occurrence. We do not manage to dramatically change legislation every single day of the week, but when we do surely we deserve <Col N="1233" /> the courtesy of the presence of the Minister who was responsible for accepting the amendment in the first place, to explain why he got a sudden rush of blood to the head and he cannot accept it now. Instead of this we had the Minister for Social Welfare saying we will achieve the same things with different words and that if he refers to section 8 (4) everything will be all right.  It will not be all right, because the law will not say there is a requirement for an annual inspection.  That is a simple request.</P>
    <P>Is the House going to amend the wording that came back from the Seanad, wherever it came from?  I respect the Ceann Comhairle's request that we should not refer to officials in the House but wherever it came from, will the Minister include &ldquo;at least annually&rdquo;?  A Cheann Comhairle, can you tell me what is wrong with the wording in the Bill in section 8 (2) as sent to the Seanad that makes it necessary for the Government to change it?  Where did the requirement to change the wording come from?  They want to delete <i>&ldquo;inter alia</i> by annual inspection&rdquo;.  They want to put in &ldquo;having inspected the restaurant, is satisfied&rdquo;. They say that implies the same thing, that it implies there is a need for an annual inspection.  Are we to be taken for complete gombeen men altogether?  &ldquo;Having inspected the restaurant&rdquo;&mdash; how in God's name, can that mean &ldquo;by annual inspection&rdquo;? Can you tell me, Deputy?</P>

If we are to stay here until 2 a.m. and if the Minister wants to call in the Government Chief Whip and ask him to re-order the business so that we give extra time to this important legislation I am staying here and I am prepared to agree to it.  If he wants to come back here at 11 o'clock tonight and stay until 5 a.m. and if the Minister can convince me that his words will require at least an annual inspection, at the end of those six hours debate I will apologise to him.  I will not be conned, and I advise the Fianna Fáil Members, wherever they are, who came in here when we were debating this Bill, to come in quickly because I think they are being conned as well.</P>
      <P>The other suggestion I would make is that Deputy Lynch would go to his parliamentary party and kick up holy murder about this issue because this is not what this House wanted.  This House clearly expressed the view that it wanted restaurants to be inspected at least on an annual basis, and that is now being deleted from this legislation.  The Minister for Justice had every opportunity between Committee and Report Stages to check out the wording I had proposed on Committee Stage.  He chose not to do that, or maybe he did, but he did not object to it on Report Stage, in fact, he accepted it, and the Bill was passed on Fifth Stage.  Where in between all those Stages did he come up with this technical requirement when it says the complete opposite to what this House wanted.  I am saying to the Minister, for goodness sake leave well enough alone and go back to the Seanad and say: &ldquo;we are forgetting about your amendment because what was there originally is probably the best thing&rdquo;.  If he says that we can move on to the other amendments but I will not let this hare go.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and accepts the amendment.  In my initial note I said that what is required in subsection (4) of section 8 is that the Bord Fáilte certificate must be renewed each year.  The effect of this amendment is to ensure that the premises is inspected before the new certificate is issued.  It is a totally new procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is stated in subsection (4) of section 8.  A Bord Fáilte certificate shall, unless it is sooner cancelled pursuant to this Act, continue in force until and only until the date of the next annual licensing District Court.  In subsection (2) we are now putting in &ldquo;having inspected the restaurant, is satisfied&rdquo; which is the new Seanad amendment.  Basically what is required is a new certificate every year, not a continuation.  The Deputy could have some concern if it was a continuation. There is a totally new certificate issued each year and therefore it requires the procedure in subsection (2), which states that: &ldquo;having inspected the restaurant, is satisfied&rdquo;.  That leaves it open not for just one inspection but to more than one inspection if thought necessary.  The two subsections are subsections of section 8 and they are directly related.  It is clear to me, and the Deputies arguments in teasing it out have made it even clearer to me, that there is no question about the fact that the certificate falls each year and that a totally new procedure must be entered into.  In having the new procedure there is a requirement under subsection (2) which states: &ldquo;that having inspected the restaurant, is satisfied&rdquo;, that is what is included in the Seanad amendment.  That is the advice of the draftsman, and he has more expertise in this area than the <Col N="1236" /> general legal adviser.  We depend very much on the expertise of the draftsman and his experience in handling legislation. I am quite satisfied that that is what it means and I think the Deputy is just&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There was never any challenge to the Constitution by legislation drafted by the same gentleman. What in God's name is wrong with the wording that was put in by this House prior to the Bill passing the Fifth Stage? Would the Minister please explain to me how his wording is better than what is already in the Bill?  Would he explain to me how it makes it more clear that there is a need for at least an annual inspection in his wording?  Would he explain to me how his wording is better than what was already in the Bill and accepted by the Minister for Justice?  This amendment was not proposed by this party or by me personally.  This Bill, accepted by the Minister, and presumably by his Department, made clear the requirement for an annual inspection.  His wording does not say anything about inspections.  There is no implication about inspections.  It is concerned with the renewal of a licence. I am talking about the requirement of an annual inspection of a premises.  I cannot understand how he can argue that this new wording is better than what was originally in the Bill.  I do not want to be difficult but I have the feeling that somebody wants to get rid of the requirement of an annual inspection.  They do not like that in the wording because it is too clear. We can have this debated in the courts perhaps, but there was never a clearer requirement for an annual inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as worded when it left this House was accepted by the Minister, when he had time on Committee and Report Stages to examine all the wordings he wanted, and he did not have any difficulty with it.  Suddenly when the Bill went to the Seanad the difficulties arose.  I know where the difficulties arose because Bord Fáilte asked, &ldquo;How are we to carry out these annual inspections?&rdquo;  That is the reason the Minister is now trying to justify changing the wording.  We made <Col N="1237" /> it clear that the taxpayers of this country were not to fund the cost of these inspections. We made it clear and asked the Minister, if necessary, to include it in the legislation but he assured us it would be included in his regulations, that anybody who had to have an inspection done would pay the licence cost of, a once-off £3,000.  Therefore, it is not unreasonable that we should charge a small fee to somebody to have their premises inspected every year so that they can get a certificate. We even went so far as to say that if the restaurant was in Kerry or Cork that the inspector could do a number on the one trip.  We cannot be more reasonable. What is wrong with including the wording that was originally in the Bill? How is it better?  It is not better.  It casts greater doubts.  There is no clarity about the situation and I maintain that this is an attempt to cloud the issue and to con this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the fact that section 8 is a section about the application for a certificate.  This section is about the issuing of a certificate as a prerequisite for a licence.  The subsections are all inter-related as regards the issuing of a certificate.  The Deputy suggests that there might be some way in which we could say &ldquo;at least&rdquo; or some other words which would leave him feeling happier even though the amendment is technically correct.  I would have no concern about doing something like that if it left the Deputy happier.  The only trouble is that it would delay the implementation of this Bill and of the Act, something that is very crucial and critical at this time.  I am sure the Deputy recognises that.  If it were necessary to do that, then that would be fair enough but that would also involve delay.</P>

Subsection (4) clearly states that a new certificate is required each year.  The Seanad amendment to subsection (2) states, &ldquo;having inspected the restaurant, is satisfied&rdquo;.  In simple mathematical terms one cannot get a new certificate without the restaurant having been inspected.  A new certificate is needed every year.</P>

      <P>How can the Minister assure the House that the annual inspection will be carried out by Bord Fáilte? An inspection may be carried out initially, but that might be the last inspection of the premises for five or more years.  What is to prevent the owner of the licence violating the laws and regulations in regard to an annual inspection? The Minister is trying to whitewash the provision passed unanimously by the Dáil that there should be an annual inspection. <Col N="1239" /> We do not have any stipulation that an annual inspection should be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can accept what the Minister has said about an annual inspection occurring if a Bord Fáilte certificate is required annually, but there is nothing in the Bill which demands that a Bord Fáilte certificate operate on a yearly basis.  The Bord Fáilte certificate is defined in section 6 as having the meaning assigned to it by section 8.  There is nothing in section 7 which deals with the issue of the special restaurant licence which limits it to one year.  It simply refers to a certificate.  I would accept the section if in subsection (4) the Minister included wording to the effect that a certificate granted would cease to be effective at the end of the licensing year.  There is no precedent for Bord Fáilte certificates to exist for the same period of time that a liquor licence exists.  There is no precedent for a district justice to follow.  It is not enough to say that a Bord Fáilte certificate shall, unless it is sooner cancelled pursuant to this Act, continue in force until the date of the next annual licensing District Court for the court area in which the restaurant the subject of that certificate is situated.</P>
      <P>In my view that subsection means that the certificate will continue and there is no obligation to say that a further application for a certificate must be submitted. Deputy Cooney made a point about the date on which the certificate would take effect but there is nothing in the Act that clarifies that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Funnily enough, he nodded to me when I expressed the view that I thought he was right.  There will be confusion as to when a Bord Fáilte certificate will be in force, whether it is from licensing day to licensing day or from the date the application is submitted <Col N="1240" /> or when it is issued.  If the certificate is issued before the licensing court will it lapse?  The Bill states that:</P>
      <P>A Bord Fáilte certificate shall, unless it is sooner cancelled pursuant to this Act, continue in force until the date of the next annual licensing district court ....</P>
      <P>A Bord Fáilte certificate in existence before that licensing date must lapse on the date of the licensing court.  I submit that that subsection creates a real difficulty. If the subsection made it clear that the Bord Fáilte certificate would be for one year, would lapse on the date of the annual licensing court and that an application must be made for a new one, I would accept that there would be a need for an annual inspection allied to that provision.  The Minister should give serious consideration to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be the effect of the provision.  It was never intended that a Bord Fáilte certificate would be automatic and, therefore, it lapses on the date of the annual licensing court.  That is the point Deputy Cooney was making.  There is the technicality of how to get over the few days involved and that an inspection will have to be carried out before that date.  Obviously, that is a question of detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be stated in the section because there is no precedent <Col N="1241" /> for such a provision.  The Bill refers to &ldquo;a Bord Fáilte certificate&rdquo; which means any Bord Fáilte certificate which may be in existence in relation to the restaurant.  It goes on to state that such a certificate shall only continue in force until the annual licensing court.  A certificate in force before that date will lapse whether it is for the next year or not.  According to the Bill, any certificate in existence will lapse after the annual licensing court. It should be clearly stated that it should be necessary to apply for a new certificate for the year in which the licence is being applied for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that there are other people who know more about drafting legislation than the Members present, but I should like to remind him that the Bill was passed by the House with the wording I have suggested. Presumably, the same people the Minister has referred to examined it.  It is my understanding that a restaurant owner who wants to apply for a licence under the Bill must obtain a certificate from Bord Fáilte, produce it to the court and, if it is accepted, go to the Revenue Commissioners with £3,000 for the licence.  That licence must be renewed annually.  When the Bill was going through the House we insisted that Bord Fáilte should issue a certificate in respect of applications for renewal of a licence, but the legislation did not make it clear that before such a certificate would be issued an inspection of the premises must be carried out.  We amended the Bill to make absolutely certain that before Bord Fáilte issued a renewal certificate they would inspect the premises on at least an annual basis.  Perhaps there are other reasons why they should make an inspection more often than on an annual basis. It is necessary that the person has a renewal certificate from Bord Fáilte when he goes to court so that the judge will renew the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister accepted the amendment on Report Stage and it was sent to the Seanad.  When it came back from the Seanad the reference to annual inspection had been deleted and a new wording <Col N="1242" /> inserted which makes the matter far more complicated and there is greater uncertainity as to whether there is a need for an annual inspection.  The Minister then tries to convince us that this is a better wording.  If it was all right when it went through the House why is it not all right now?  If it had been left as it was we would not have this dispute this morning.  I cannot understand why there is a need to change the wording.  I think I am right in saying that one must be suspicious and that between the time the Bill passed this House and went to the Seanad people became upset.  They probably thought that there would be much work involved in inspecting these premises on an annual basis.  The Minister now comes back and says that we will not be able to inspect these premises on an annual basis but we will produce different wording which could be interpreted that way and he argues that this is a better wording.  How can it be a better wording when it excludes the need for an annual inspection? On day one we were trying to make it quite clear in the legislation that there was a need for an annual inspection.  I do not want to hear talk about a need for an annual certificate; I know there is such a need.  What we wanted to make clear was that in order to get an annual certificate an annual inspection would have to be carried out and that this would be paid for by the applicant and not by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not said anything this morning to convince me that the wording that was in the Bill when it left this House, which was checked by all and sundry, should now be changed by way of amendment by the Seanad.  He has not convinced me that this is better wording. I do not believe he has impressed anybody in the House that this is so.  This is an utter con trick.  We are now supposed to just nod this provision through and defeat the whole purpose for which we debated this Bill.</P>
    <P>In reply to the Minister's statement that this legislation is urgent, if he wants to check back on the records of this House for last January, October, September or August, he will see that I consistently stood up in this House, as did <Col N="1243" /> other members of the Opposition, and asked the Taoiseach where was the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1986, which was produced by the previous Government. The Government did nothing about this Bill for 13 months.  When I brought in a Private Member's Bill all hell broke loose and the Government said they were going to bring in their own Bill.  They suddenly reproduced the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1986, which was drafted by the last Government, as the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1988.  I produced the Private Member's Bill because there was a need to deal with the problem of under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>This Bill is now being rushed through the House and we have not time to question the Minister on a matter of important detail.  The Minister said that there may be a gap between the time the certificate runs out and the court case but that is a matter of detail that we will have to sort out.  It is some detail.  What will happen to the licensee who may be selling alcohol without a licence?  The Minister said that there might be a gap of, perhaps, a week, two weeks or three weeks but that this detail can be worked out later.  It cannot be worked out later because there will be no licence in place and the person serving a drink can be dragged into court because he has no licence or because his licence has lapsed.</P>
    <P>Do not tell me that we are not entitled to an hour and a half, a few days before the Dáil goes into recess, to debate this matter in detail.  I have waited 13 months for this Bill.  It would not be before us if I had not introduced my own Private Member's Bill.  We are now told that we cannot have a proper debate because this is urgent and because there are many people waiting for these licences.  We are supposed to be the big bad boys who are holding them up.  We are not the ones who are holding them up.  The Government held them up for 13 months.  I object to that sort of statement and I object strongly to any Opposition being muzzled from asking proper questions.  I object to the Opposition being muzzled when they complain bitterly that an <Col N="1244" /> amendment that they had proposed, which had been accepted by this House and by the Minister, the wording of which presumably was checked, is not now being accepted.  The Minister's substitute comes in and says: &ldquo;There are other people who know better than you do. They can speak English better, or they can draft legislation better&rdquo;.  There are many people in the Law Library, who can advise me and everybody else, who are just as efficient as anybody else at putting legal words together.  If the wording was good enough for Committee Stage, Report Stage and Second Stage in the Seanad, it is good enough now.  It is not good enough to come in here and try to persuade me that by substituting other words we will achieve the same thing with greater clarity.  All reference to an annual inspection is being deleted and that is supposed to give greater clarity to everybody, including the courts, that there will be a need for an annual inspection.  I am not going to be fooled.</P>
    <P>This is an important issue.  An agreement was made between the Whips that we would have a debate until 12 o'clock. I asked half an hour ago if the Minister would send word to the Government Chief Whip to ask him if he would please make arrangements for additional time. I offered to sit until 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock tomorrow morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if necessary to debate this matter and to have it cleared so that the people about whom the Minister is so worried will get their licences. I agree they need their licences urgently but we did not hold them up.  We had to rush this Bill through Committee Stage and extreme pressure was put on us despite the fact that we waited 13 months for legislation that was drafted in 1986.  I have not received even the courtesy of a reply from the Government Chief Whip as to whether we can get extra time.  Did the Minister even bother to send out a message to him?  No, because he knows that when 12 o'clock comes the Ceann <Col N="1245" /> Comhairle will stand up and all that Barrett has said for the last hour and a half he could have been saying out in Kildare Street because it is not going to make a whit of difference.  Only amendments tabled in the name of the Minister will be put at 12 o'clock.  What an abuse of democracy.  There are young children in that Gallery who think that this is a democracy and a democratic assembly. It is the greatest sham of all time.</P>

They are putting through legislation which is defective and which is going to involve disputes in the courts in future.  It is an utter and absolute disgrace &mdash; I never object to having breaks &mdash; that when there is an offer made from the Opposition benches that we sit for another two or three hours in order to debate this issue properly, we do not even get the courtesy of a reply from the Chief Whip's office to say yea or nay.</P>

      <P>In page 6, lines 21 to 27, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>This is a purely technical amendment. Section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, has been amended by section 17 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which has increased the fine provided for in section 13 of the 1967 Act to £1,000, the same monetary fine as provided for in section 7 (1) (a) of this Bill.  It is not possible therefore to substitute one fine for the other, as provided for in section 7 (1) (a) of the Bill, since they are now the same.  It is therefore proposed to delete that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 1 to 5, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>I have some basic objections to the Bill and I hope we can make some changes to it in the course of the day.  My party and the whole trade union movement are concerned that if this Bill goes through unamended it will allow this company to be privatised at some future time, because this subsection is proposing that the private company which is being set up under this Bill can at some future date be re-registered as a public company.  Not only this subsection but other sections, such as sections 17, 18, 19, 21 and 27, will allow for the privatisation of this company at a future date.  I believe that is not the intention of the Minister, nor do I believe it is the wish of those of us who for some years now have been proposing that a private commercial company be set up to operate the commercial operations of the forestry industry here.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the forestry industry, valued at £1 billion, has been the work of very dedicated men and women, professional and non-professional, throughout the length and breadth of the country over the years.  With the introduction of the internal market of Europe in 1992 this company could, under this Bill, be taken over not only by people within this State but by people outside it.  For that reason I propose the deletion of this section and I will be asking for the amendment of other sections at a later stage to prevent this happening.</P>
      <P>I do not want to prolong the debate on this because we will be having a similar debate on other sections.  I do want assurance from the Minister that he accepts the concerns of people working in the industry and in the Department at the moment and of those who will be working in the semi-State company when it is established and that he can tell us there will be no attempt in the future to privatise An Bord Coillte and that there will be nothing in this Bill to allow that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection in question is just an enabling one designed to give the company flexibility with regard to its future development.  Some State-sponsored bodies have in fact been established <Col N="1251" /> as public limited companies in the first instance &mdash; Aer Lingus, Air Rianta, B &amp; I and a number of others.  Any company established initially as a private company may, subject to the requirements of the Companies Act, re-register as a public limited company.  Coillte Teoranta should have the facilities to do likewise. Indeed, if this subsection were deleted, it could do so within the parameters of existing legislation.  This subsection however provides what may be regarded as a safeguard in that it requires Coillte Teoranta to obtain prior approval of the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance should it propose to become a public limited company.  What I am really saying is that if we were silent on this matter we would not have the safeguards we are providing in the Bill.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister of State is genuine in his arguments, as is the Minister sitting beside him, but I am thinking of a company which will go on into the future when there might be a change of Government which will see other Members on my left who might have a totally different attitude to a public company.  Ministers with the ideals and the stated aspirations of people like that might believe that they had the power to do what I fear this Bill will allow them to do.  I am appealing to the Minister to listen to what I have to say on this and not allow this Bill to go through unless it is specifically stated that it must be brought back into this House before any change such as privatisation could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware of what the Minister says in regard to other Bills and other companies, but, now that this Bill is going through the House, it is reasonable to request that no proposal for the taking over of the company should be considered unless it is brought before this House.  This is more specific in section 21 of this legislation, but the whole move towards the possibility of this starts in this subsection.  This is why I feel I have to make the change in this subsection, <Col N="1252" /> but I will continue to make this point on other sections.  I appeal to the Minister to assure the House that no attempt at privatisation or the sale of shares and the like can take place without reference not only to Ministers but also to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is clearly no specific intention contained within this section of the Bill to privatise and the fears which the Deputy expresses are in many ways groundless.  I made the point earlier that if the provisions contained here were not present the scope for a private limited company to go public is already incorporated in existing company legislation. What I am actually doing is providing a further safeguard.  In all of the discussion that has taken place in relation to changing the structure to manage our forest services, the staff and many people concerned with helping to evolve that change wanted the greatest possible flexibility. Secondly, it has often been asked in this House when legislation is being introduced, why do we not try to ensure that we cover the greatest number of eventualities possible, but I can assure Deputies that we are endeavouring to do this and I think they should be reasonably happy with that assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>If privatisation is not envisaged, enabling the company to re-register as a public limited company, surely this section is superfluous.  The Minister has given no reason for its inclusion other than saying that this provision is contained in other legislation. What we are talking about is one of our great assets, State forestry, and the setting up of a new body to deal with it.  What other eventuality could the Minister have in mind, apart from privatisation, for justifying the inclusion of this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputies are being too apprehensive in regard to this provision.  As I stated earlier, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, B &amp; I and a number of other State companies were established as public limited companies and I think the Deputies are failing to make <Col N="1253" /> the distinction between that kind of setup and privatisation.  I think the safeguards which are being provided here are acceptable and, in fact, stronger</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>My suspicions arose out of the fact that the legislation to be used as a model to set up this company is the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act which set up both An Post and Bord Telecom.  This subsection did not appear in the Act setting up An Post and Bord Telecom and I want to know why.  Both of these companies are operating very successfully and I ask the Minister why can he not accept this amendment to delete this subsection and allow this company go ahead and operate. I see no great demand for an amendment like this to be made to the Postal and Telecommunications Act to enable this to happen in the case of An Post and Bord Telecom.  Many of the other sections which we have let go through without debate are in line ball with many of the sections contained in that Act and it was agreed when discussions took place between the Congress of Trade Unions and the Minister that that is the legislation which should be used as a model to set up this company.  Yet, we see a new subsection being included.  It is not necessary to do so; it was not necessary to do so in the legislation setting up An Post and Bord Telecom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>A distinction must be made between the type of company that both An Post and Bord Telecom are and the type of company which it is envisaged will be set up under this Bill.  Under this Bill it is envisaged to set up a company which will develop a natural resource as distinct from a service industry.  If we look back to the time of the foundation of this State we will see that a State company was formed at that time, the Dairy Disposal Board, to allow the State to provide developmental services where the capital, the will or know-how did not exist.  Over a period of time the assets of the Dairy Disposal Board were transferred &mdash; those which were transferable &mdash; to co-ops many of which have now <Col N="1254" /> been turned into public limited companies. There must be flexibility, especially where commercial entities involved in the processing of raw materials are involved.  For those reasons I support this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>As it provides for privatisation which is part of Progressive Democrats policy anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh is right when he says that a decision was taken to base this legislation on the legislation setting up Bord Telecom.  I think he would be the first to admit that many areas of forestry activity differ from the activities of Bord Telecom and to slavishly follow the Act setting up Bord Telecom would be inappropriate.  Secondly, a number of sections contained in this Bill are designed to facilitate the development of forestry and these are not contained in the legislation setting up Bord Telecom.  I hope that when we come to deal with those sections the same arguments will not be used in an effort to delete them.  If we use a model we take only the essential ingredients, but we must style the Bill to suit the activities of the forestry sector.  Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy Sherlock are labouring this point and they can be satisfied, from experience in other public limited companies, that the fears they are expressing are, generally speaking, groundless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>My final word to the Minister is that this is a very basic area of the Bill which I am opposing and asking for it to be changed.  The unions, when discussing this Bill with the Minister, were led to believe that this area was going to be safeguarded adequately. I do not accept the Minister's explanation for the inclusion of this subsection, which was not included in previous Acts, in that fundamentally different activities will be carried out by this company.  We can look to the experience of Britain where British Telecom have been privatised.  We have a very large asset in forestry.  A value is being put on this which will be reflected in the share issue at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> If a public limited company is set up, when changes come about after 1992, undoubtedly, not only will people in this country see this as a very valuable asset but also those outside of this country will see it as a very valuable asset.  We already know that the brewing and distilling industry is being looked at by foreign companies.  I do not see any difference between the takeover of a company involved in forestry and the taking over of a brewing or distilling company and, therefore, when I see an addition to this section which was not included in the legislation setting up An Post and Bord Telecom I have to assume that it is introducing an element into the Bill which would allow for privatisation to take place far more easily than is the case under the Act on which this legislation is designed.  I will be pressing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the Deputy's argument that there is a fundamental flaw in this Bill.  Existing company law enables a company which is registered as a private limited company to re-register as a public company.  In this section we are providing the safeguard whereby the company will be required to obtain the prior approval of the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance should they propose to register as a public limited company.  The arguments which the Deputy has made and the proposal <Col N="1256" /> to delete this section weakens the very position which he sets out to safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to agree to disagree on this.  This section facilitates the sale of this company at a future time.  I have made my arguments on this and the Minister is aware of the concerns of the trade union movement in relation to this section.  If the section was changed in the manner in which I want, then this House would have to be consulted before any attempt would be made to change it to a public limited company or allow it to be privatised.  That is what I want to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with what Deputy Kavanagh has said.  We have waited a long time for legislation to deal with our forestry, which is a great natural resource.  There can be no justification for including a provision in the legislation whereby the company may register as a public limited company.  The Minister has not put forward any arguments for this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), lines 6 and 7, to delete &ldquo;Coillte Teoranta or, in the English language, The Irish Forestry Board Limited&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Coillte agus Adhmad Teoranta or in the English language, The Irish Forestry and Timber Board Limited&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment has been put down in order to expand the functions of this enterprise.  The Minister proposed that the company be called Coillte Teoranta, or, in the English language, the Irish Forestry Board Limited.  I have added &ldquo;The <Col N="1259" /> Irish Forestry and Timber Board Limited&rdquo; or &ldquo;Coillte agus Adhmad Teoranta&rdquo; because there has been a lot of talk about the prospects for forestry and the timber industry and how in a few years we will be able to export quality products.  A company were set up to run forestry, but the House should have anticipated further activity in the processing and final product industry.  By calling the board &ldquo;The Irish Forestry and Timber Board Limited&rdquo; we would be giving credence to the belief that in the long run this company will be producing products from start to finish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  &ldquo;Coillte Teoranta&rdquo; is the name by which the company will be generally known.  It is short, recognisable and makes a good impact.  It also reflects that the business of forestry, which embraces other activities such as timber sales, etc; will be the primary activity of the company.  The modern commercial practice in relation to naming companies is to have an abbreviated form which encapsulates the brief of the company and which is saleable.  Long-barrelled names, however well intentioned, do not meet this criteria and, even if adopted, are not generally used.  The design and presentation of the emblem of the company will leave nobody in doubt as to their all embracing nature.  In the final analysis a short name for a company is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage, neither is including a long list of responsibilities. In the long run the people in the company, their entrepreneurial skill and ability and the way they perform their duties will ensure that they are known and understood by the public.  I am confident of a positive response in that area and, therefore, the amendment is unnecessary. The existing name is appropriate, saleable and readily understood by the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the amendment because &ldquo;Coillte agus Adhmad Teoranta&rdquo; sounds very well. Did the Minister say that the company <Col N="1260" /> would deal only with forestry and are precluded from dealing with timber industries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy must have misunderstood what I said.  The range of activities for the new company will embrace all the activities which are at present engaged in by the forest service. Long names of companies are not used by the public and it is far better to have a name which can be easily used and which encapsulates the brief of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to press the matter.  However, the Minister should note that the name I propose would be even shorter than &ldquo;Coillte&rdquo; because &ldquo;Coillte agus Adhmad Teoranta&rdquo; could be known as CAT and there could not be anything shorter than that.  I do not know if that would be complimentary, but it is a thought.  In future, downstream industries and manufacturers of timber should be part of the Coillte portfolio and if the word &ldquo;Adhmad&rdquo; was included people would be interested.  I am disappointed that the Minister will not accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (1) (a), line 23, after &ldquo;forestry&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including land acquisition and afforestation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to expand this section to include land acquisition and afforestation.  Will the Minister concede the point that this company will have a future in land acquisition and afforestation? I also want to establish the criteria under which this commercial basis will be operated.  As Deputies are aware, there is a fledgling private forestry development area and &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; should mean open and fair competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope there will not be controversy on this area.  The principal objectives of the Bill are set out in this section, and one that should be clearly stated in the Bill is a reference to the acquisition of land.  It has traditionally been part of the forestry industry and part of the operations of the Department, to acquire land for forestry.  I go somewhat further in my amendment and say they should be able to acquire land compulsorily if necessary because that, too, has also been a feature of the acquisition of land for forestry.  That should be clearly stated as an objective of the new company.  Without that being specifically stated the company will not have the power to acquire land unless there is reference to the Minister.  The Minister retains that power to acquire land on a compulsory basis under the 1946 Act.  If we are setting up a commercial company and if we are to have confidence in this company, that power should be transferred to the company.  That power will not go into private hands but will remain in a State company.  That objective <Col N="1262" /> should be included.  I hope the Minister will see the logic of my argument.  There is no point in having a company which must keep referring to the Minister or his successor to acquire land on a compulsory basis under the 1946 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill fails to include the principal objective of the company to acquire land for forestry and fails to list among the powers given to the company the power to acquire land.  While the Minister may argue that this objective and the powers are implied in the Bill, we say they should be specifically included so as to remove an element of doubt.  Our amendment No. 5 seeks to alter section 12 so as to include in the objectives of the company the objective of acquiring land for the business of forestry and related activities.  Our amendment No. 11 to section 12 would give the new company the same power that the Minister at present enjoys under the 1946 Act to purchase or take on lease or otherwise acquire any land suitable for forestry or related activities.  It is essential that the company have the power to acquire land compulsorily, if necessary, for forestry. If they do not have the power to acquire land the company will be a dead duck from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the European countries only Iceland has a smaller proportion of land planted than Ireland.  We have just 5 per cent of land planted compared to 65 per cent of land in Sweden, 30 per cent in Norway and Germany and 25 per cent in France.  Even countries like Holland where there is a great shortage of land have a much higher area under forestry than we have.  Various programmes have been announced by different governments over the years aimed at expanding our forestry and different targets have been set for planting rates, but they have rarely been achieved.  In 1948 the Government produced a White Paper which provided for the establishment of 10,000 hectares of new plantations per annum over a 40 year period.  The aim was to give us a total productive State forest of 470,000 hectares by 1990, compared to the 70,000 hectares we had in <Col N="1263" /> 1948.  As we approach 1990 the actual area of forestry is less than the target in 1948 and in more recent years the planting rate has fallen again.  In 1985 less than 5,000 hectares were planted.</P>
    <P>If we are to ensure that we have sufficient land for the proper development of our forestry the company must have specific powers to acquire land.  Land which is under-used or unused should be capable of being acquired compulsorily by the company subject to the normal arrangements for compensation, in the same way as the Minister now has the power to acquire land, or Bord na Móna have the power to acquire land for bog development.  Unless the company is given the power to acquire land, it will be a dead duck.  The Minister will find it hard to justify not agreeing to this amendment to give the company the power that is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the composite amendments.  Our amendment No. 10 seeks to acquire suitable lands for planting in keeping with the company's requirements.  If this company is to operate with the degree of autonomy required to be truly commercial in practice, then it must have the power to acquire land as they see fit, to fit in with the long term objectives of the company.  If the company have to go back to the Minister and the Department to obtain land through the Minister, the commercial activities required to procure land which is part of the raw material in this industry will be fettered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with these amendments together since they reflect the basic recurrent theme of land acquisition by the company.  I agree that Coillte Teoranta, given the scale of proposed activities, must have the power to acquire land.  I agree with the sentiments of the Deputies on that score.  The power will be provided for in the memorandum and articles of association of the company. It is not customary in the case of the establishment of a new State-sponsored body to provide for the detailed activities <Col N="1264" /> of that body in its relevant legislation. Such legislation, as section 12 sets out here, normally sets out the general thrust and objective of the new body and detailed functions are specified in its memorandum and articles of association. These powers will include the purchase, or taking on lease or otherwise acquiring any land or right over land required in connection with the company objectives, together with the power to plant, manage and supervise.</P>
      <P>I understand the concern of Deputies who put down these amendments.  If we were establishing a State corporation instead of a company it would be absolutely essential to make provision in the legislation and to stipulate accurately the functions and obligations.  The company system, however, has much wider freedoms and the normal practice is to make provision for these matters in the memorandum and articles of association.  That will be done and I have clearly indicated the area it will cover.</P>
      <P>I was absolutely astounded at the remark made by Deputy Sherlock that the rate of planting had declined in recent times.  It is no harm to put on the record of the House that last year we had a record national planting, between State and private, and this year it will be very close to 14,000 hectares, which is 4,000 hectares above any previous record achieved in this country.  It is obvious from the funding figure in the Bill and from the historical pattern of forestry involvement in Ireland that public planting will have an important role to play in implementing the major forestry programme which this country needs.  The need to maintain an even age forestry estate and of guaranteeing supply is also obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These factors will be taken into account by the Government in deciding, as an ongoing evolutionary process, the best way to achieve national forestry planting targets.  All in all, Deputies can be satisfied that the powers which they seek to put into this legislation are incorporated in the memorandum and articles of association.  That is the normal practice. All of the areas which they have <Col N="1265" /> referred to are adequately catered for by those provisions.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by Deputy Kavanagh was that he wanted Coillte Teoranta to have the powers of compulsory land acquisition.  That presents a difficulty.  Because of the unfair advantage which the power to compulsorily acquire land would confer on the company <i>vis-à-vis</i> other private forestry companies, I am proposing to retain those powers at ministerial level for use at the discretion of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the basis of these amendments will be contained in the memorandum and articles of association and as such I do not intend to press amendment No. 7.  Nevertheless, I want to voice some concern that a facility which the Department with responsibility for Forestry have to acquire land, under their terms, in the name of the Minister, cannot be transferred to the company.  I hope the facility will be allowed to the company to always approach a Minister when acquisition is necessary because acquisition has been a necessary feature &mdash; and I am aware of this from my own constitutency &mdash; of the forest industry down through the years.  If the company cannot do that they will be tied to the other commercial interests which they never had to face in the past.  For the continued expansion of the timber/industry it is necessary but if the Minister considers it cannot be done I hope that the power under the 1946 Act can be used.  I hope some facility can be provided between Coillte Teoranta and the Minister which will allow acquisition to continue in the same way as it has in the past, perhaps by presenting the Minister with an annual demand or some necessary facility to allow him to acquire land on their behalf.  I am afraid that this might be a facility that would not be readily available to the company.  I agree with the Minister when he gave the figures for the increased planting.  In 1985, 7,000 hectares were planted, in 1986 it increased to 9,000 hectares and to 11,000 hectares in 1987.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I said earlier that the powers for compulsory acquisition would, if granted to the company, confer an unfair advantage.  Therefore, I have to indicate to the House that any use of compulsory acquisitions in the context of involving an arrangement between the Minister and the company would perhaps have almost the same kind of implication and would have to be very carefully managed. To satisfy the Deputy, this power is being retained by the Minister.  It will obviously have to be used with the utmost discretion but the fact that the power is being retained should ensure that in circumstances which permit its use the flexibility will be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I put down that amendment was that not only were employees in the Department concerned about the non-reference to planting and to afforestation but the private people in industry were afraid that the wording in this section, to carry on the business of forestry, was limited.  They felt there should be some indication in the Bill about the intention of the Government to give the company the power to plant. While the Minister has told me that there is a distinction between a corporation and a company memorandum, I am not aware that any other company has been set up, or is being set up, in the State which will have the same powers as this company. This will be an exception because it will acquire assets for sale.  Because of the scope that will be available to its directors and management following its acquisition, I wanted to put in the aspiration that planting would be done and that it would be in the memorandum of association or in the Bill.  I accept the Minister's assurances that it will be in the articles of association.  Down along the line I am not certain that in the future a managing director, chief executive and directors of the new company might just engage in forestry activity which they would see as the sale of timber and the sale of forests or the manufacture of goods.  For that reason I wanted land acquisition included in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would explain the difference between the State <Col N="1267" /> corporation and the new company.  While I accept in good faith what the Minister has said, I would like an explanation as to why this aspiration cannot be contained in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, perhaps the Minister would define &ldquo;related activities&rdquo; and explain what is envisaged in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 38 of this Bill the Minister has power to direct the company to engage in planting, setting targets or indicating the Government's wishes in relation to national matters of that kind.  There is no question but that these powers for direction are contained in the Bill.  Very often the question is raised &mdash; and it was raised during the course of the Second Stage debate &mdash; as to why we are interfering and not letting the company live a life of its own.  I do not think one can expect to have it both ways, to accuse the company sometime in the future of trying to have a life of its own, independent of the Minister and, at the same time, accuse the Minister of incorporating powers which will allow him to make sure the company is obliged to do what the Government consider is necessary.</P>
      <P>A point was raised in relation to the difference between a statutory corporation and a company and the consequent difference in relation to functions and obligations which can be enshrined in the memorandum and articles of association.  A statutory corporation is established with a singular purpose, is limited, and has a commission status.  It has always been the tradition to incorporate in the legislation establishing those corporations their specific functions.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The question by Deputy Michael Higgins concerns the estimate of emigration from the Gaeltacht and the Minister has replied <Col N="1270" /> saying that no Department could establish those figures.  Will he agree that it is a gross dereliction of the duty imposed on his Department to look after Gaeltacht areas, and the people who live in the Gaeltacht?  I should like the Taoiseach, who is still at the back of the Chamber, to take this on board.  There is a responsibility, which is now the Taoiseach's, to look after the interests of those who live in the Gaeltacht.  If the Minister's opening position is that he does not know how many are living or how many are leaving he is not taking the Department of the Gaeltacht seriously and he is not taking the Irish language seriously.</P>

What we are asking &mdash; the public are entitled to know because this is a matter of grave public concern &mdash; is what are the criteria under which such decisions will be made.  What type of information has the Minister been seeking from Irish Life?  Is it the case that if we get £300 million we will sell but if we get only £200 million we will not sell?

I think the Deputy knows that for some time I have been listening to reports from many sources, including at Government level, about the necessity for capital restructuring at Irish Life, mainly to allow them to expand further because of the great expansion that has been undertaken by the company in this market, in the UK market and, to a certain extent, in some US markets but they cannot get into all markets.  That question has arisen because of the capital restructuring of the company.  That is the issue that must be decided by the Government because they are the major shareholders in the company. As I have said, no decision has been made yet but the matter is under active consideration.  All the necessary information regarding any decision that <Col N="1274" /> is made by the Government will be made publicly known to all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties being caused by the extension of withholding tax to payments made by the VHI to their members in respect of medical treatment; if it is his intention to introduce regulations to facilitate the operation of his new method of tax collection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 31 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The extension of the withholding tax to certain payments under health insurance policies is provided for in section 8 of the Finance Act, 1988.  To facilitate the operation of the withholding tax the legislation requires a health insurer, where a claim under a contract of insurance has been submitted and accepted, to discharge that claim, in so far as it relates to fees for specified medical expenses, by paying the medical professional directly. Tax is deducted at the rate of 35 per cent from this payment.  This is a statutory requirement as passed by the Oireachtas and the legislation does not provide for any alternative system.  Health insurers are, therefore, required to make the deduction in all relevant cases and the tax deducted will be remitted to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> The legislation also provides that in the event of a subscriber making a payment to a medical professional prior to his claim being processed by the insurer the latter must still pay the medical professional directly and the professional is statutorily required to make a refund of this amount, inclusive of withholding tax, to the subscriber.  This is an important protection for the subscriber in the event of direct payment by him.  I would point out that in the past, in most cases, subscribers have not paid their consultants prior to their insurance claim being processed and the Voluntary Health Insurance Company have advised members that, under the new arrangements, subscribers should submit unpaid accounts in support of claims.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the VHI that a small number of doctors have written to the company indicating their unwillingness to accept direct payment from the VHI. Many other doctors have, however, indicated their willingness to co-operate with the new system.  In fact over 70 per cent of the relevant doctors have already furnished their tax numbers to the VHI as is required under the terms of the withholding tax legislation.</P>
    <P>I am not aware, therefore, of any significant difficulties for subscribers as a result of the introduction of the new system.  Deputies can be assured however that I am closely monitoring the operation of the scheme.  As Deputies are aware, I have power under the legislation to make regulations and I will not hesitate to use this power to ensure in particular that the position of subscribers is not adversely affected.  As a contingency measure preparatory work on regulations is under way.</P>
    <P>I have noted recent statements in the press on behalf of some medical professionals concerned in relation to the new system of payment.  I would like to stress that the system does not affect in any way confidentiality in the doctor/patient relationship.  In particular it does not involve the transmission of any additional information by the medical professional to the health insurer in relation to the medical complaint of the <Col N="1277" /> subscriber.  The Revenue Commissioners will receive absolutely no information in relation to the subscriber.</P>
    <P>Overall, the statutory arrangements which have been put in place for the application of the withholding tax to payments under health insurance policies represent the most effective procedure for applying the tax and will not, as I have said, damage the existing doctor/patient relationship.  I would urge the full co-operation of all relevant persons in the implementation of the arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister acknowledges that at least some patients have been paying medical practitioners directly and at least some medical practitioners are unwilling to accept the new tax regime, would the Minister issue a public statement advising VHI subscribers not to pay their consultants directly but to pay through the VHI, thereby ensuring that all due taxes are deducted?  Secondly, as the Minister acknowledges that some medical practitioners are unwilling to accept direct payment, what does he propose to do about that?  Public statements have been made in the press indicating that unwillingness to comply with the law of the land?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <P>As the Deputy has rightly said, very few people are doing other than what the legislation requires them to do.  I hope they will all row in with what is now prescribed by law.  The VHI have already advised subscribers to submit unpaid accounts with their claims and that is the position.  Through the replies and the information given in this House, through the questions by Deputy Howlin and others, I am sure the public will be further informed about the legislation and what it is intended to do.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Priority Question No. 39 is in my name and I <Col N="1278" /> would like to ask some supplementaries to it.  May I ask the Minister if any money which is being withheld by the VHI since the enactment of the Finance Act on 6 June has been remitted to the Revenue Commissioners and, if so, how much? The Minister indicated that he has taken the precaution of asking the officers of his Department to begin preparatory work on regulations if such regulations prove necessary.  What are the guidelines he has given to his civil servants in the preparation of these regulations?</P>

      <P>As regards the regulations which may or may not be required; the criteria are being worked on at the moment between Revenue, Finance and the VHI, as was stated by the Taoiseach to the Deputy on the Order of Business one day.  I hope, and it is the hope of everybody concerned, including most of the professionals, that the system will work.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Minister aware that certain organisations, and members of organisations representing medical consultants, intend that their members should not sign the appropriate forms which enable patients to claim from the VHI?

      <P>There have been lots of speculation and threats of legal action over the last number of months &mdash; we had the same in relation to other professionals last year when the withholding tax was introduced.  Most of what is being said at the moment is mere speculation.  As far as we gather, the system will work according to the law and we have the protective mechanism, through the regulations, if it does not work.  As I said, I hope the legislation as adopted will be applied and that there will be no necessity for the introduction of any regulations. However, if they are required, they will be introduced.</P>

I understand there is a proposal that medical consultants would not sign the form and, as members of the VHI know, the signature of the consultant is required on the appropriate form indicating medical treatment has been carried out, before the VHI will pay money to members.  Is the Minister aware of this?  If so, what steps does he intend to take to ensure that claims can be made under an authorised signature?</P>

      <P>I have replied to the first part of the Deputy's question when I said the Civil Service Commission are holding competitions at the moment and when the panels are available I will look at the possibility of redeploying staff to the Land Registry.  I have had 20 years or more dealing with the Land Registry and in many respects delays are caused because of queries because the first submissions are not in order.  The normal time for dealing with a Land Registry application is about 3.3 months; if there is a query, it increases to 18 months.  Big arrears can build up because the original application did not have all the information clearly set out.  As I said in the second part of my reply to the original question, the Civil Service Commission are at present establishing panels of candidates and when the panels are available, I will look at the question of redeployment of suitable staff to the Land Registry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The key recommendations set out in the report referred to by the Deputy dealt with the introduction of information technology systems to Leinster House in a planned manner over a number of years.  The first recommendation was that a detailed plan of action be drawn up for the introduction of new technology.  This was done and a comprehensive information technology plan for Leinster House was completed by independent consultants early in 1986. The first priority identified in this detailed plan was the provision of basic office technology and this was provided towards the end of 1986 at a cost of approximately £112,000.  This expenditure was preceded by the appointment of an additional officer to the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas in October 1986 to oversee the introduction of the new technology. The primary task in 1987 was to ensure that proper use was made of the hardware and software purchased in 1986 and to prepare for the implementation of further stages of the information technology plan in subsequent years.</P>
      <P>Proposals for further significant expenditure in 1988 were put forward and examined in the context of the 1988 Estimate campaign.  However, in view of the overriding necessity to reduce public expenditure, it was decided that such proposals would have to be deferred at least until 1989.  Accordingly no money for the implementation of further phases of the information technology plan has been included in the 1988 Estimates.</P>
      <P>The officer who had been appointed to oversee information technology developments in Leinster House left the Civil Service in October 1987.  The question of his replacement and the possible provision of funds in 1989 to implement the next phases of the information technology plan will be considered in the context of the 1989 Estimates campaign.</P>

      <P>I take it that, despite a tremendous amount of work and expenditure put into the production of this report in 1983, it has now been sat upon and is not being proceeded with.  Is <Col N="1285" /> the Minister aware that the whole purpose of this exercise as undertaken by the previous Minister, Deputy John Bruton, was to speed up operations in the House and make it more efficient?  Surely the refusal to appoint a replacement for the systems manager is an indication that the Minister is not interested in updating the procedures of this House, which are becoming a laughing stock.  The Minister is failing in his duty to proceed with the decisions made in this House in 1983 or 1984.</P>

We made the decision not to provide any additional money for further expenditure on information technology in 1988. The question now is what the overall Vote will be for Leinster House in 1987 and will it provide for computerisation. There is nothing for that purpose in 1988.</P>

Would he agree in respect of the existing investment of £112,000 in equipment that the non-availability of in-house expert advice on making the optimum use of that equipment has the effect of devaluing the money already spent?  Secondly, would he agree that there are immense continuing savings to be made in the preparation for printing and the printing of the Official Report and Order Papers of <Col N="1286" /> this House by use of modern computerised printing techniques and that this cannot be done because we have not an officer to prepare a plan of that kind, which would very quickly save money to the Revenue upon its introduction?  Will the Minister confirm that he has received representations from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and from me as an individual Deputy seeking the filling of this post, drawing his attention to evidence from France and other parliaments that savings can be achieved by the application of further technology?  Will he agree to look at all those matters very sympathetically indeed in the context of the 1989 Estimates, in view of the fact that long term savings can be made?</P>

      <P>The establishment of an authority or inter agency group to control and manage the River Shannon has been the subject of debate for some time now, and I note that the same question was asked by the Deputy last February.  As I stated in reply at that time, there are so many interests involved in this vast natural waterway, not the least of which are navigation and drainage which fall directly within my brief as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, that the proposal has obvious merits.  Nevertheless, it would be futile to set up such a body without providing it with the means to devise and implement a comprehensive plan.

      <P>In view of the significant increase in the Structural Funds that will be available from the Community, and in view of the funds which are already committed to the Shannon in one way or another through national agencies, would the Minister not agree that the combined sums, the enhanced sum from Europe and the existing sums already allocated, would provide a budget for an authority and that the question of devising functions or objectives for an authority which the Minister raises as an objection is really a ridiculous reason?  The functions are self-evident, the control and management of the River Shannon to be co-ordinated with a single body using the funds that are already there and the funds that can be got under the enhanced Structural Funds.  Surely now is the time to put the statutory body in place and there will then be a formal investment avenue for the European funds.</P>

      <P>I believe I have every right to be aggrieved.  However, I am proceeding with this question now. What I want to ask the Minister is if the payments made to farmers to get out of milk production are based on so much per gallon, something like 27p per gallon, of milk not produced?  If this is so, would the Minister not agree that that should be regarded as income and, therefore, it should be taxable as income?  Is it not also true that there are two reliefs available in relation to this, £2,000 in the case of a single person and £4,000 in the case of a married couple?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the efforts of many Ministers for Finance to have a fair and equitable tax system does the Minister think it is fair and equitable that farmers who are paid to get out of milk production can get into horticulture, into the production of beef or grow grain? <Col N="1301" /> Is it not inequitable that no tax is payable on the money paid over to farmers on getting out of producing something, apart from capital gains tax which is a miserable payment?

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

How could it be held by any court or appeals commissioner that a farmer had acquired his milk quota for value and how could it possibly be dealt with as the disposal of an asset and liable to capital gains tax?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 22 together and to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement showing the amount of share capital subscribed by the Minister for Finance to the ACC and the dates of those subscriptions.</P>
      <P>The last mentioned capital subscriptions, i.e. a sum of £5,448,000 subscribed on 31 May 1988, took place under section 4 of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1988.</P>
      <P>The question of providing further share capital for the ACC does not arise at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the share capital subscribed on 31 May 1988 has not restored ACC's balance sheet fully to the position obtaining prior to the incurring of losses of almost £15 million in 1987, I do not, <Col N="1305" /> at the present time, foresee any further capital subscription being necessary, bearing in mind in particular the expectation that ACC will return to profitability in 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to Question Nos. 13, 18 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>Under section 31 of the Currency Act, 1927 the staffing and remuneration of employees is a matter for the bank.  I have no function in this.  The issue of the currency is also a matter for the bank under section 45 of the Currency Act, 1927, as adapted.</P>
      <P>The data which the bank is required to give by law is contained in the bank's annual accounts and its annual report which are presented to the Oireachtas. The Deputies should refer therefore to those reports and accounts.</P>
      <P>I would regard it as excessively detailed to require the bank to publish the depth of information sought by the Deputies, the publication of some of which could be prejudicial to the operations of the bank.</P>
      <P>The bank monitors closely the costs of currency production and has assured me that these are not out of line with commercial costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am stunned by that answer.  A Member of this House asked the Minister for Finance a series of questions in relation to the expenses involved in running the Central Bank, the <Col N="1308" /> number of staff employed by the Central Bank, whether we are getting value for money, whether the 700 workers employed by the bank are giving the State a fair return for the amount of public resources they use and he has been told by the Minister for Finance that it is not his responsibility.  Whose responsibility is it?</P>

      <P>Theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our money they are using.  Is no Minister willing to accept responsibility for the outgoings of the Central Bank?  Is no Minister willing to say whether we are getting good value or bad value for money in relation to currency production, whether we are wasting money producing our own coins and whether, as was asked in one of the questions, Thomas De La Rue and Company produced notes more cheaply when they supplied notes to the State?  Am I to understand that no Minister will reply on behalf of the Central Bank and answer any detailed questions about their staffing, expenses, the cost of running their headquarters in Dame Street or any other details about that?  It is a scandal that this House is not being told anything about the finances and costs of the Central Bank or any of its activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I already said in my reply, under section 31 of the Currency Act, 1927, that is the position, and that was before the Deputy or I were born.  I also said that the bank monitor closely the costs of currency production and have assured me that these are not out of line with commercial costs.</P>

      <P>The Government have announced that programmes are to be prepared initially for EC funding for the Greater Dublin Area, Greater Cork, and the West.  The programme for Dublin is being prepared first, and it is intended that it will serve as the model for the others.  Ultimately the programme approach will cover the country as a whole.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> In regard to the Greater Dublin Area, consultants will be appointed shortly to carry out a study which should form the basis for the programme and a steering committee has been established to oversee this work.  This committee comprises representatives of the Departments of Finance, Agriculture and Food, Energy, Environment, Labour, Industry and Commerce, Tourism and Transport; the Dublin City and County Manager; Dublin Chamber of Commerce, and the Commission of the European Communities. The chairman and secretariat are provided by the Department of Finance. It is open to voluntary and community organisations to provide views and proposals to the steering committee.</P>
    <P>The Government are considering various aspects of the programmes for the other areas, including the precise geographical areas for each programme and the appropriate structures for the preparation of the programmes.  I hope to be able to make announcements on this before long.  It will not be possible for all organisations to be represented directly on the steering groups for programmes, but it will certainly be possible for all organisations to provide their views and proposals to the steering groups.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the problem referred to.  Drug trafficking is a serious problem world-wide and we will do all we can within the limits of our resources to help in combating it.  The recently-passed Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1988, <Col N="1313" /> confers wide additional powers on Customs officers in this regard and it is hoped that this will have a positive effect.

      <P>The only reason I would clarify that is if we were talking about the United States.  There have been no seizures of cocaine in this country in 1988 and there were only two seizures in 1986 and 1987 of 11 grammes and 29.1 grammes respectively.  The Revenue Commissioners are well aware in an international context of the serious threat cocaine is now posing in Europe.  I am sure the Deputy has seen a report in yesterday's <i>Financial Times</i> where the leaders of the main industial countries who are meeting in Canada have considered this matter and have set up a task force at ministerial level to focus attention on the consequences of drug trafficking.  It is a very serious problem and we are taking full account of that.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I appreciate that it is a serious problem but I am worried that it is not being treated seriously in this country.  The Minister has given figures for the seizures of cocaine in the country but may I ask him if he is aware that very limited seizures of cocaine can mean one of two things &mdash; first, that there is no cocaine coming into the country or, second that nobody is active in its seizure?  Has the Minister an opinion about which is the case in this country?  Is the Minister aware that previous Governments and Ministers in 1978, 1979 and 1980, when there were no <Col N="1314" /> seizures of heroin in the country, were being continually advised that there was no heroin problem but that by 1982 the usage of heroin was rampant in Dublin's inner city and that it took an enormous amount of resources and emergency activity to control that problem during the following three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The prevention and detection of drug smuggling are the responsbility of the Revenue Commissioners. Every member of the Customs and Excise service engaged in the examination of passengers and goods at entry points to the country is regarded as forming part of a first line of defence against the illegal importation of durgs. As the Deputy knows, if they get beyond there it is primarily a matter for the Garda.  At present six officers are employed full time in a Customs and Excise unit on drugs related work and an additional officer will be added shortly. There are also 22 Customs and Excise officers acting as drugs liaision officers throughout the country.  Obviously, all Customs and Excise officials in their dealings at the frontiers have to balance the vigilance that they put into effect with any problems they may cause to legitimate travellers.  This has to be balanced on an hourly and daily basis by the Customs and Excise officers.  As Deputies who participated in the debate on it will be aware, the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which came into effect this year will help in the fight against drug smuggling.  As we know, the Act provided that non-travellers as they are called, meeters and greeters, may now be searched for drugs at or in the vicinity of a port or airport or the land frontier and that officers may search these people under warrant for documents relating to drugs.  I would also like to add that in addition to the staff, the customs drugs unit have a detector dog which is trained in the detection of cocaine and a second dog will be trained shortly.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is a final supplementary question, a Cheann <Col N="1315" /> Comhairle.  I thank the Minister for his information.  I have no doubt that sufficient legal power is available to officers of the Customs and Excise.  What co-ordination takes place between those officers, the Garda Sochána and officials of the Department of Health in evaluating the threat which cocaine presents to this country and in co-ordinating measures to combat that threat?  Secondly, are officers of the Customs and Excise responsible to his Department involved in any international network or organisation which is dedicated to the prevention of the abuse of drugs?</P>

      <P>Taking the last part of the question first, I would not say that they are involved in any international network.  They are answerable to us, but they have contacts with the international network.  The necessity for that is accepted by all developed countries.  We maintain and improve that contact because it is an international problem and we must have international co-operation. The Minister for Health is also aware of the increased abuse of cocaine in other jurisdictions.  A national co-ordinating committee on drug abuse which monitors developments in the area of law enforcement, treatment facilities, education, community and youth development and research, will discuss cocaine abuse in Ireland in the very near future.</P>

Then, certain official organs of State were saying there was no particular heroin problem in the country when it was quite obvious, both in the prison system and to medical staff who were treating addicts, that the use of heroin was rampant in this country.</P>

    <P>43.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will make a statement on recent reports suggesting that the Government intend to require public service employees to contribute towards the cost of funding their pensions; and the long-term implications for the Exchequer of unfunded pension costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider it either necessary or appropriate to comment on media speculation of the type referred to by the Deputy.  I will, however, make a statement on the two issues raised by the Deputy, namely, the contributions payable by public servants towards their pensions and the manner in which these pensions are financed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that public service employees already contribute towards the cost of their pensions.  Many have contributory pension schemes, under which employees pay a total contribution of 6½ per cent of salary &mdash; 5 per cent for personal pension and lump sum benefits plus 1½ per cent for spouses' and children's benefits.  The remainder also contribute 1½ per cent of salary for spouses' and children's benefits but have nominally non-contributory main schemes; that is to say that while they do not make an <Col N="1317" /> explicit employee pension contribution, broadly the same effect is achieved by reducing their levels of pay below what would otherwise obtain.  These reductions, or implicit pension contributions, vary from 5 per cent up to 8½ per cent of salary.</P>
    <P>As regards the long-term implications for the Exchequer of unfunded pension costs, I presume the Deputy is referring to the fact that most public service pension schemes are financed on what is known as a &ldquo;pay-as-you-go&rdquo; basis from current State revenue rather than by way of a formal pension fund.  As I indicated to the House in my reply to Question No. 22 of 9 December 1987, I have no plans for changing this arrangement.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there would be nothing to be gained from the establishment of formal pension funds for public servants.  Arguments in favour of funding are more appropriate to private sector schemes and are, to say the least, not compelling in the public service context. One of the principal objectives of funding, for instance, is to provide a secure basis for the benefits of staff.  The pay-as-you-go system, however, is based on the State's permanent and continuing ability to discharge its obligations as they arise.  More importantly, the creation of formal funds would initially be very costly because of the immediate liability for the pensionable service already acquired by serving staff.  The capital formation involved would require either further borrowing or increased taxation and I need hardly underline the objections in present circumstances to either of these courses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, would the Minister tell me what proportion of public servants are on the 6½ per cent regime and what proportion on the 1½ per cent regime?  Secondly, could he tell the House whether, in view of the fact that he has agreed public service pay increases for the next two years, there is any intention on the part of the Government to increase, on the part of any members of the public service, the amount of moneys they contribute towards their pension and <Col N="1318" /> whether he is contemplating moving some people from the 1½ per cent regime into the 6½ per cent regime?  I appreciate the Minister may not like to comment on media reports, but I would ask him if there is any substance in the widespread perception that the Government are thinking of asking public servants to make a more substantial contribution towards the costs of their pensions.</P>

Does it mean that this company will be involved, as was done in Killykeen Park, in the creation of lovely houses in the forest area for letting and renting for, dare I mention it, fishermen and anglers and the like during the summer?  All these things are activities related to forestry. If you create something in the area of forestry and can make some money out of it, I am sure a good commercial company will look at every aspect of it.</P>
      <P>I am not against including related activities but I am asking the Minister to include one of the amendments suggested on this side of the House in relation to the acquisition of land because &ldquo;related activities&rdquo; could mean anything.  The review group on forestry looked at the whole question of setting up an alternative to the Department of Forestry and they were still in favour of acquiring land. They urged that consideration be given to the problem of unused land held by absentee landlords and that some form of financial discouragement should be introduced with a view to securing the release of land for productive purposes, including forestry.  That group was not made up of left wing Labour members or The Workers' Party many business people thought that aspiration should be in any new structure.</P>

      <P>With regard to related activities, it is rather surprising that Deputies, in seeking to have specific requirements enshrined in the Bill, tend to object to an arrangement which gives the widest possible flexibility because related activities cover a wide range.  It will be up to the company to decide, in the light of experience and advantage, to operate in the area where they will get the maximum advantage and the maximum return.  Therefore, I cannot see why Deputies have a problem in relation to that sort of provision which should be <Col N="1362" /> helpful and acceptable to everybody.</P>

      <P>I do not follow the logic of the Minister's argument.  My amendment will not inhibit anyone and it is wrong to suggest that it will.  I am seeking to include an aspiration and &ldquo;related activities&rdquo; can be aspirations.  The Minister seems to think that we want to limit the scope of the company but nothing could be further from the truth.  If a company in future decide that they will not pursue a planting programme, there would be something wrong.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 26, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company now proposed are responsible for 70 per cent of the raw material production and, as things stand, probably in excess of 90 per cent of the stock of timber.  My fear is that when a <Col N="1363" /> State company are developing forestry and in a position to sell their raw materials to their own manufacturing companies &mdash; if woodland industries are manufacturing companies &mdash; I foresee a difficulty in that the State would be able to underwrite the financial and commercial transaction of such a company and would be in an unfair trading position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other people in the business who are probably responsible for making 30 per cent of plantings at present.  If we are to develop the sawmilling and timber industries I would not like to see any such companies established under this Bill and being underwritten by the State because they would have an unfair advantage in terms of raw materials and supplies and, indeed, in the price which they might pay for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments would not be in keeping with the normal scope of a commercial company to engage in activities relating to their business.  The Minister for Energy already has specific powers under the Forestry Act, 1946, to establish and carry on woodland industries. Indeed, the forestry service operate two sawmills.  It is quite proper, therefore, that new companies should be given similar powers.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.  However, it is not envisaged that the company would immediately be engaged in extending their role in this precise area.  They are a commercial company and we should let them lead a life of their own and not impede them from the word go.  I am sure the Deputy would have no objection to public funds being spent in private concerns and he should not rule out public participation where public funds are concerned.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects to this in the sense that we have established contracts with a number of companies, Irish and international, in relation to the pulpwood sector where virtually all the supplies coming on stream are contracted for. These contracts were entered into for the purpose of getting these industries established and they have a considerable road to run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> In relation to the sawmill area, we have introduced also new systems of selling and quotas.  Overall, there is a tight balance between existing supplies from Irish forests and the actual demands from the existing sawmill industry.  The scope, therefore, for any immediate extension in processing is a couple of years away. We are now harvesting 1.4 million cubic metres and this will grow to 2 million cubic metres by 1993 and to 3 million cubic metres by the end of the century. A few years down the road there will be considerable room for expansion in that area, and I would not want to close off the possibilities for this new commercial company in this area.  I would ask the Deputy to accept that we already have these powers under the 1946 Act, that we have two existing sawmills in operation that with the number of contracts with existing processors, the opportunities for further development will be there a few years down the road and that we should not head-lock the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally agree with the Minister on this.  I certainly would not like to see the activities of the new company being reduced.  If these amendments were accepted they would prove very negative.  In many parts of the country forestry plantations are well removed from some of the private sawmills.  If the company did not have the ability to set up sawmilling, it would certainly tie the hands of the new company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the amendment proposed by Deputy McCoy were accepted it would interfere with the proposal to set up joint ventures.  That would be a very valuable new power for the forestry section to acquire.  The Minister referred to current activities but he has not indicated whether he saw downstream industries being engaged in, especially in view of the proposals for a structural programme by the EC which are expected to be published and in which the grant-aid system for agricultural production might be extended to wood production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister see this objective as <Col N="1365" /> part of the aspirations of the company? People are concerned about the hidden subsidies in the forestry area being used in unfair competition but that aspect is covered by EC legislation relating to competition.  Does the Minister intend allowing the private sector to tender for State planting in his efforts to ensure fair competition?  Deputy McCoy feared that the State, having so much of the assets, would create a monopoly and that this developing industry would be monopolised by the State.  I would like private and co-operative planting programmes to continue.  Would the Minister say if he sees any role for the private sector in tendering for this company's planting and how does the Minister feel fair competition will be administered by the company?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the question of tendering for State planting, the position at the moment is that the bulk of this work is carried out by staff in the forest service.  There has been a growing tendency to employ contractors for planting and harvesting.  I see no likelihood that that general pattern will change after the establishment of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the establishment of new industries, I hope in the next few weeks to be able to launch a new industrial and processing development for the timber industry, conscious of the opportunities particularly in the UK and Europe for exports and also conscious of the fact that we have a surplus of thinnings, particularly in the north-western area of the country, which would justify the establishment of another processing plant there.  I am very conscious of the fact that we need to get some of our timber resources, particularly pine, into a higher added-value category.  In all of these areas, whether due to the new company pushing existing processes or by new ones becoming involved, we are very conscious of the scope that is there and we will be supporting it to the maximum extent possible.  We hope to launch a new programme in relation to the potential in the UK.  The UK are at present importing 90 per cent of requirements and are likely <Col N="1366" /> to be doing so for a considerable time. Since we are on the doorstep of that market we need to exploit it.</P>

    <P>This amendment is to enable the Minister to indicate to the House the position of gaming rights of the associations which are already involved in the forestry service, who have availed of the sporting facilities provided by the forestry service. Will they get the priority they enjoyed heretofore?  These people have been very fair with the forestry service and have respected the bounties and the entire code that has been drawn up for them.

The company will be expected to use its resources effectively and efficiently and it will be conscious of community interests in certain of its activities and will take this into account. I have had a number of meetings with community groups regarding these problems. I accept the Deputy's point that over the years they have contributed considerably. At the same time there are situations where communities enjoy very good facilities and are paying virtually a pittance for them.  If the Deputy has any influence, perhaps he would assist me to make the whole operation more interesting from a financial point of view for everybody concerned.  I accept there are organisations who have played fairly fair, but I have to put on record that I am unhappy with certain developments in different parts of the country and I would like to see these improved.  I would be expecting the company to be efficient and to have regard to community and traditional interests in this regard.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat disappointed at the naked commercial tone of the Minister's reply.  I can understand why he might be tempted in that regard, but it is disappointing.  What the amendment is seeking to assist would be bodies such as the National Association of Regional Gun Clubs and their affiliate members throughout the country who depend for the exercise of their sport on obtaining grants, leases or licences of State forestry.  It could well be that they pay only a pittance, but what the Minister is offering may commercially only be <Col N="1368" /> worth a pittance.  I do not think the Minister or his Department, with respect to them, have put any substantial investment into game conservation or game procreation.  Any activity that takes place in that regard is done entirely by these people on a voluntary basis.  I caution the Minister very seriously not to go down the same road &mdash; or the same river &mdash; as his colleague, the Minister for the Marine, and attempt to impose charges, licences or fees analogous to the abortive rod licence.  If he does, he will have on his hands a controversy just as great and as colourful, because among the shooting fraternity there is a feeling that it too is nearly a God given right as much as the right to cast a line into the waters of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I caution the Minister to be careful.  I take his point that we are setting up a semi-State body which must act commercially.  The amount of revenue proportionately that it can expect to get from leasing or licensing the gaming rights on the lands under its control in relation to its woodland and timber activities will be puny and should not prevent or inhibit the Minister or the new body from giving preference to community bodies or non-commercial bodies such as the local gun clubs affiliated to the national association.  I can understand that the Minister cannot put the amendment as such into the Bill.  It would be an unfair inhibition on the independence of the new Authority.  What I would like the Minister to do is to assure the House that he has taken on board in a serious way the points we are making and that he will indicate to the new board, when they come to deal with the licensing or leasing of game rights, that preference be given to Community or non-profit groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a bad day for Irish sport, and Irish wildlife generally, if these rights are put up for bidding and competition and if tenders are invited from mainland Europe.  If those so-called sportsmen arrive here then very shortly anything <Col N="1369" /> that flies would not be left in this country. as has happened in their own countries. On the few occasions when they visited here local public opinion was so horrified that the local hoteliers who brought them in had to cease bringing them in because, literally, they fired at everything that flew.  They would obviously pay a handsome premium for the rights.  I would caution the Minister against that because that is a source of contention straightaway. I would ask him to indicate to the new board, when it is set up, that when they come to consider this aspect of their activities they give preference to local bodies (a) to ensure goodwill with the local community, (b) to ensure that people who are genuinely interested in conservation will be exercising the game rights and, above all, to ensure that the new body will not get into contention and that we do not have another rod licensing fiasco.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy, with his long experience in the House, has acknowledged that I cannot include this amendment in the Bill.  If I am to be accused of naked commercial responses to queries in this House, I would merely ask him what he would do in relation to something if he were doing what the Land Commission were doing for years: sending letters for 12p and 9p throughout the country to individuals and after a few years deciding they would discontinue the practice in some instances.  I was careful to say that in certain instances the amounts being paid compared to the facilities that are being provided are just a pittance.  In my discussions with the very people referred to by the Deputy they agreed that in the context of being able to provide good facilities of that kind they would be prepared to look again at some of the tenders.  I would be very conscious of the need to assist local communities and groups who have supported the development of game.  I think, too, that the Deputy could have included the forestry service.  To say they have not contributed would be very close to a naked untruth; but, nevertheless, we can agree to differ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> We are not unconscious of what has happened in the past.  I merely wanted to indicate to Deputy Carey that as far as many of these services are concerned the best way to ensure that they can be improved and maintained is to have a certain amount of commonsense at our side and at the side of the communities with which we are dealing.  There are many organisations paying what we would consider to be a fair amount for the facilities they are receiving and others, for one reason or another, have been able to travel down another road.  I am anxious to encourage them away from that.  That is the only sensible approach we can go about.  I have no hesitation in discussing these matters with the board on the basis of meeting the general wishes of the House.</P>

      <P>In page 7, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) to establish a trading company in co-operation with private forestry interests to spearhead an export drive for Irish forestry products,</P>
      <P>(f) to maximise the domestic value added of the timber industry,</P>
      <P>(g) to develop hardwood planting,</P>
      <P>(h) to undertake the technological development of timber and timber products.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already indicated that he is interested in the export drive.  The reason I put down this amendment was to ensure that there would be liaison in the entire forest sector and that this trading company, which would be able to discuss the future of the industry, might have an export led industry improving the balance of payments and take advantage of the opportunities which were outlined by the Minister.  I believe that in a short time this country will become self-sufficient, and if the increased rate of <Col N="1371" /> planting continues we should be able to supply large quantities of good timber to mainland Europe.  In order that there would be widespread confidence and fair competition in the industry, I would ask the Minister to consider this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in response to the proposed earlier amendments on section 12, detailed activities of Coillte Teoranta will be specified, as is customary, in its memorandum and articles of association.  These will be sufficiently wide in scope to allow the company to undertake all activities relevant to its business and to maximise its revenues. The extent of the company's involvement in particular activities will, of course, be a matter for the company as part of its normal commercial development.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carey, in the course of his Second Stage contribution and today, expressed fears that the presentation of the new company was not orientated enough towards marketing.  I should like to assure him that that is not the position. Most of the items he referred to will be covered in the memorandum and articles of association.  After some years of research we have succeeded in evolving the SG11, the standard specification for stress graded softwood timbers.  Some Irish companies are already engaged in marketing to the UK.  We have increased the supply to the domestic market from 10 per cent seven or eight years ago to more than 50 per cent today.</P>
      <P>In his amendment the Deputy referred to the need to develop hardwood planting and I should like to tell him that this year the acreage has been increased to 700 acres.  Despite the financial constraints we have been able to increase grants to the private sector for broadleaf planting. We are trying to meet the needs of the industry as fully as possible within the financial constraints that exist.  The Deputy can be assured that we will be giving full attention to the crucial area of marketing in an effort to improve income.  We will be doing everything we can to improve sales at home and in the UK.</P>

      <P>I understand that those involved in the industry are seeking an assurance that there will be a joint effort to boost exports.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not decided to establish a trading company, even if it was to be established outside the scope of the Bill. Such a move was suggested by the review group who reported on forestry.  It was their view that those involved in the industry should liaise in an effort to boost exports.  I accept the Minister's point about maximising the domestic market and the development of hardwood. However, he did not refer to my suggested subparagraph (h), to undertake the technological development of timber and timber products.  I am concerned about a group who have been working for many years in the Department with Eolas.  That group produced the lodge pole pine task force and were providing a very useful service.  Employees who had concentrated exclusively on the development of forestry and had carried out extensive research work should be engaged by the company.  Is it the Minister's intention to commit the new company to take on those employees of Eolas?  The research undertaken by that group has proved very valuable.  There is no reason those people should not be given an opportunity to continue their research.  I do not think we should leave this matter in mid-air or depend on the Minister for Finance to look kindly on Eolas.  I have no doubt that with the cutbacks, research and development work on timber will be curtailed.</P>

I have referred to the developments that have taken place in regard to the stress grading of software timber and the standard specification which has evolved.  Obviously, I was indirectly referring to the work of Eolas because they carried out that work.  I <Col N="1373" /> acknowledge the outstanding contribution of Eolas to timber research over the years and, in particular, to timber marketing.  Their work is more important for the future as timber supplies from our woods increase and the opportunities for exports arise.  We must continue with our research.</P>

They will also get £3 million by way of equality from Government investment plus £100 million in capital investment and guaranteed borrowings of £80 million.  This company are starting off with a very generous legacy from the Government.  In the interest of performance I would ask the Minister to consider inserting some kind of self-financing clause for the new company. After the four years of generous support which the State is proposing to give this company, if they are to make the type of <Col N="1375" /> progress that the Minister envisages and if they are to be the type of commercial animal which he requires them to be, and which I totally agree with, then this animal should be well trained.</P>

      <P>It is not good enough just to put an objective in the Bill that this company will break even.  That is why I put down this amendment.  There should be some kind of legislative target which the company should reach, such as a real rate of return.  The review body spent much time examining the matter of the rate of return.  They suggested 2 per cent or 3 per cent over the rate of inflation but I put down a figure of 5 per cent.  It now appears that the Minister would be satisfied with a break even situation.  If this real rate of return is inserted it would mean that the company would have to justify borrowings and a real effort would be made to generate profits.  It is for that reason that I put down this amendment. There is an onus on the company, in getting this huge asset which belongs to the taxpayer, to see that it is worked properly and that we get a real rate of return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will deal later with the valuation. Criticism of the forestry section is widespread, whether by employees in the Department or by people outside, in that they do not trade on a profitable basis. There is a need to examine critically the work practices and programmes to see if some means could be found whereby the State would benefit from the huge investment already made.  The investment is valued at about £800 million.  When the State is generous with a company and allows them to take certain controls, it should at least put down some guidelines for performance.  We have asked that there would be a real rate of return of 5 per cent.  Deputy Kavanagh spoke earlier about 1992.  There is no doubt that if the companies who are operating in the State, taking into account the competition from abroad, are not slimmed down, are not efficient and cost effective, they will fall.  The requirement is that the Minister would lay down some positive <Col N="1376" /> target and I believe that a 5 per cent rate of return is a reasonable target.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party are very concerned about the absence of information on the financial structure of the company.  There is a great deal in the Bill about capital advances, repayable advances and so on.  The working capital amounts to £3 million according to section 27.  Under section 24 the aggregate borrowings shall not exceed £80 million and the repayable advances amount to £100 million.  Borrowings and repayable advances attract interest and therefore the company could be hung up, as indeed has been the case in the past, with high interest payments to banks or other institutions, as I said on Second Stage.  I instanced the problems of B &amp; I and the various activities of that company. If that company make a profit it will go back to the banks in interest repayments which have accumulated over many years.</P>
      <P>This section concerns me.  The company as they stand at present, before the real money starts rolling into the coffers and before sales are achieved in ten years or so, which will be a real benefit to the company, will have various duties imposed on them from day one.  They will have to meet all charges properly chargeable, generate a reasonable proportion of capital needs and remunerate capital and repay borrowings.  They will have to conduct their business at all times in a cost effective and efficient manner. We all agree with that, but the fact that they will have to remunerate capital, repay borrowings, generate sufficient moneys and meet all charges from day one is something that could be very difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons the review group on forestry are against setting up a State company and preferred a national forest enterprise was that from day one the company would not have the resources from their own activities to be able to pay for their outgoings.  I am not opposing this section but I want to voice my concern about the structures and the financing of the company.  I am concerned <Col N="1377" /> about the huge assets which the company hold &mdash; between £800 million and £1,100 million.  At the same time there is a very narrow working capital base which will attract much heavy borrowings in the early years and repayments on those borrowings will have to be met.  I hope the Minister can satisfy our fears in this regard.  What borrowings will be allowed from day one?  What is the equity base and what is the likely breakdown between share capital and Exchequer repayable advances?  As I have said, I am concerned about this section.  Only the Minister can assure us that the company being set up as a State company will not get into difficulty as a result of the heavy interest payments they might have to generate because of this structure imposed on them from day one.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the reasoning behind these amendments, but it would be unwise to include such specific details in the Bill.  Section 38 (7) allows the Minister for Energy in consultation with the Minister for Finance, to set financial targets for the company.  This section has the advantage of allowing for a flexible approach.  I can assure the Deputy that we intend to set realistic targets for Coillte Teoranta and to take a hard look at their financial performance to ensure that they quickly make real returns on our considerable investment in forestry and reach profitability at the earliest possible date.  I do not propose, therefore, to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital programmes undertaken by the company, in agreement with the Minister, could well mean that the break even date would not be reached as early as it would without that kind of planting programme.  There are also a number of <Col N="1378" /> imponderables.  We are at present negotiating at EC level and the outcome of these negotiations will affect the profitability of forestry.  Should we succeed in getting additional funds, particularly for State forests, that will change the picture.</P>
    <P>However, I want to say a few words in defence of forestry, because it appears Deputies are under the impression that everything that has happened in forestry up to now has been a mistake.  Deputies will appreciate that very often in the past forestry was pushed into the mountains and into the very marginal areas thus requiring expensive road making and expensive management generally.  The forestry service were obliged to be involved in activities which ranged far from what one would call commercial criteria.  We want to tidy that up, give it a better commercial orientation, free it from the complexities and difficulties which constrain it within the existing organisation and to enable it to achieve a better return on the investment.  It would not be wise to write specific targets into legislation.  If it was possible to exceed a specific target mentioned in the Bill, they could avail of any opportunity which arose.  While I appreciate the reasoning behind the amendments and the need to ensure that we get a return on this massive investment in forestry as early as possible, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh mentioned the funding of the company, the share capital, borrowings and so on.  What the Bill sets out to do is to establish limits.  Within all that, negotiation has to take place with the Minister for Finance to agree an annual programme.  It would not be possible to say how this will develop.  I said on Second Stage, and I want to repeat, that because of the long time which must elapse before anyone gets a return on their investment in forestry and in spite of the assets of the company, to oblige them to engage in excessive borrowings at an early stage would be unwise.  Subject to clarification of this point in the light of developments and discussions with the Department of Finance, I do not think I can go any further <Col N="1379" /> than indicate that the whole thrust of what we are doing is to try to improve the performance of the company and returns on investment while taking account of the existing difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to come back to the specific wording in section 13 to &ldquo;generate a reasonable proportion of capital needs&rdquo;.  In that context I put it to the Minister that his Department have a profile of all the afforestation in the country &mdash; the age, when it will be harvested, the likely value, the annual operating plan, the forward plan for harvesting this timber, the likely market price, given that there is a shortage and so on.  To allow a private or a semi-State company to go down the road with as little restraint as &ldquo;generating a reasonable proportion of capital needs&rdquo; lets the management of this company off very lightly.</P>

      <P>If the Minister were to say that he would be satisfied with a real rate of return of 5 per cent after 1992 that would be all right, because he would be acting in the interests of the taxpayers who have invested in this company and he would be seeing their assets realise their true value.  He would be protecting their assets for the future.  The Minister said there was a limitation on borrowing, that the scope in this area was very small, but there is a temptation on the management to interpret the words &ldquo;generating a reasonable proportion of capital <Col N="1380" /> needs&rdquo; as meaning that they should break even and that that will be the best we can expect from this company.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>More learned people than I dwelt for a long time on this matter. Members of the review body concluded that a return of more than 3 per cent over inflation was an achievable objective in the investment of long-term funds.  I am asking for a real rate of return of 5 per cent.  I am giving the Minister the benefit of at least 1 per cent, if not 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>This is not the same kind of operation as An Bord Telecom or An Post.  They provide a service.  Deputy McCoy has mentioned all the variables in this industry and the Minister is aware that the economic factors can vary and that the company might even make losses.  By putting this amendment into the Bill the company will be required to make a reasonable effort to reach their targets.  I do not know how that can be condemned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said on a number of occasions that I intend to give this company a hard time and that I will only accept results and performance which indicate that steps are being taken adequately to repay the taxpayer for the investment made in forestry.  Deputies cannot have it both ways.  Earlier in the debate, Deputies were at pains to ensure that adequate planting targets and matters of that kind were enshrined in the Bill.  Land has to be acquired and paid for.  The way to ensure profitability at an early stage is to stop acquiring land and stop planting.  One cannot expect a company, however harsh an imposition, to become profitable very quickly and to move to a position where they can do without an annual payment from the taxpayer exceeding £30 million, while at the same time carrying out a new planting programme to give an even-aged estate, guaranteeing supplies to processors in the future and establishing new markets.  We are asking for a high level of performance but we cannot specify in legislation a date <Col N="1381" /> by which the company shall break even. There could be developments in the negotiations at the EC which could bring about changes overnight.</P>
      <P>Deputies are seeking something which is not attainable in this section.  Here we have a general provision with regard to returns and remuneration similar to that in other legislation dealing with the establishment of State companies.  Section 38 empowers the Minister to give a directive to the company and provides that their annual reports are to be submitted within a specified period at the end of the year. This section provides ample opportunity for assessing the progress of the company and ensuring that everything humanly possible is being done to reach break even point and thereafter to make adequate returns to the taxpayer.</P>

With regard to the possibility of success at EC level, we have been able to get a bit of movement on instruments which were not previously used for afforestation purposes.  It will take some time to finalise these matters.  The Commissioner for Agriculture will be here during the next couple of weeks and we will further intensify our efforts to gain an improvement in the funds from EC sources to enable a continual expansion on forestry, both private and public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has explained the difficulties for a private company or a State private company starting off with a mature bank of trees if they are expected to state a particular time at which they will be able to generate a proportion of their capital needs. Would the Minister not agree that the position must be desperate for those entering private afforestation with no bank of trees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation must be judged on its merits.  If we were able to signpost a break even date we would gladly do it.  However, there are difficulties. A company could become profitable tomorrow by deciding to abandon planting, but that would be an idle exercise in the context of what we want to achieve in the future.  If we are successful at EC level a certain strain will be removed from the company.</P>
      <P>We will monitor the activities of the company on an annual basis.  I have said that we will be giving the company a hard time but I cannot be expected to specify in absolute terms a rate of return which will be spelled out in legislation.  That would be without precedent.  Should the possibilities arise for the company to do better than Deputy Carey might wish, the opportunity must be there.  There are a number of problems in the way of that happening.  According to the best estimate, the company will break even somewhat later than 1992.  My experience of forestry is limited in terms of time but nevertheless I contend that to break even in a period somewhat longer than that specified either by Deputy McCoy or Deputy Carey would be an infinitely better achievement than the possibilities that we spelled out for forestry in the review.  If we did not establish this company, set new criteria and recognise the urgent necessity to make organisational changes with less attention to aspects which constrained the development of forestry up to now, we would be delaying for many years the possibility of reaching the stage of profitability which all Deputies want.</P>

I am in general agreement about the section but it is not the same as the situation in Telecom Éireann or in An Post; they have revenues coming in from day one.

      <P>The Minister is turning down everything I suggest.  All I can say is that the Review Group on Forestry said, at page 35, that they were mindful of the fact that the forest enterprise will not be in a position for many years to come to finance from its own resources its investment in new forests, or even all of its current expenditure, and that therefore they preferred a national forest enterprise which would be within the Department.  We disagree with that, I am glad to say.  My concern was that the amount of capital being made available may not be sufficient and therefore the company would have to borrow at whatever level of interest rate prevailed at the time or sell of part of its assets which is its forests with immature timber on them. As far as that is concerned, I will put down an amendment very shortly to be discussed.  All I want to do is deal with these concerns I have on more specific sections of the Bill at a later time and get the Minister's opinions on them then. Generally speaking, I am prepared to accept this section as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister implies that this section will create a burden for the company.  We cannot discuss the progress of Bord Telecom here and we cannot discuss the progress of An Post.  Now we are not going to be able to discuss the progress of Coillte Teoranta.  The Minister assures us that he is going to give Coillte Teoranta a hard examination every time, that he is going to keep on its back.  I know that the Minister for Energy is already keeping a close eye on Telecom Éireann and An Post, but as Deputies here in this House representing the taxpayers we have no part to play. All we are asking is that the taxpayers' investment would earn a real rate of return.  No matter what side of the fence one is on, whether one is a socialist, a capitalist or whatever, these huge funds belong to the taxpayers, so why are we not to know the return?  The Minister seemed to be satisfied to allow this new company to amble along and to have contained in this section that to break even will be satisfactory.  We want a 5 per cent real rate of return and that is reasonable.</P>
      <P>One aspect about the conduct of this company that the Minister has not referred to is the new market in semi-mature timber he is trying to create.  If such a market is created the funds will be available for this company.  The Minister is relying heavily on this, too, by virtue of the working capital he has provided; it is clear that that is what his intention is.  I have no objection to that either, but I demand that the Minister put down a firm guideline for a firm rate of return.  If the Minister wants to put a date on it, such as 1998 or whatever, that would be satisfactory.  I do not think the Minister is right to interpret this legislation in an open-ended way and tell the new executive that the Government will be happy if they break even.  The Forestry Review Group do not want that, the Minister does not want that, and the people on this side of the House do not want it.  We want to get this forestry idea moving and moving quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the UK, for instance, there is a <Col N="1385" /> market for semi-mature timber.  If pension funds and financial institutions are to be attracted into supporting forestry it is in that area it will be.  I know the risks are high, that land prices may fluctuate etc.  The Minister catalogued all the variable factors in forestry evaluation.  I appreciate that but we owe it to the taxpayers whose money is being invested in forestry to get a good return.  This is the only area where the State has become massively involved in asset production.  It is a single area.  I know there were different social demands from time to time and that economic circumstances have changed since the establishment of the forestry division.  I appreciate that, and I am not criticising the lack of profitability in the forest service; but a juncture has now been reached in the life of this nation where we have an opportunity to go forward in the forestry area, to expand it and develop it.  New companies are being set up, three or four of them on the private side.  There are extensive co-operative plantations planned.  The Minister is optimistic for the future and I, and everybody else, will be delighted to see a massive expansion of our forestry.  All I ask is that we do not set this up without expecting the chief executive and the board of directors to give some positive response like a real rate of return at some future date, and I though 5 per cent was a reasonable rate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Carey should be under no illusion as to the constraints on the company or the expectations that I will have of a significant improvement in the organisation and the return on investment.  But God help this country if the solution to the problem is the one that Deputy Carey submits: the success of the sales of semi-mature timber in the UK.  I said last year, when the decision was taken to dispose of certain lots of semi-mature forest that only those lots for which an adequate offer was made would be sold.  I regret to say that the pattern in the UK was far different.  If the solution to the Deputy's problem and the attainment of his goals in relation to a financial return on investment is achieved <Col N="1386" /> by asset stripping at prices which I certainly would not accept, I am not going down that road.  I indicated to the House that we would ensure, in section 38, agreement with the company on targets and on programmes and the submission of accounts to this House and the Deputy will see those targets and accounts in the House himself because they will be there for assessment on an annual basis.  We expect the company to go on planting and acquiring land and in that respect we cannot expect the company to attain profitability within a couple of years.  The Deputy and the other Members of this House will have an opportunity to see how the company are performing and whether they are meeting their targets on an annual basis.</P>

I believe that the establishment of such a market is essential in the development of forestry and I have to conclude that what the Minister of State wants is for this company, Coillte Teoranta, to hold a monopoly and to wipe out the private sector.  If it is the Minister of State's intention, in not setting targets for the new company, to wipe out the private sector he should say so and the more honest approach for him would be to say that by giving this power to the company they will be able to cater for all of our needs in the future but in alleging that I have advocated a programme of asset-stripping he is using emotive phraseology which I do not intend to engage in.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15.</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) to provide for consultation with the Minister for Finance concerning forestry development in areas of scientific interest.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I indicated that I would be moving an amendment along these lines.  Basically, what I am asking is that the Minister provide for a consultation process with the Minister for Finance in relation to proposed forestry development in areas of scientific interest which, as far as I am concerned, include areas of important conservation value for amenity, biological, geological and geamorphical reasons.  Perhaps the Deputies which the Minister of State has been dealing with up until now in this debate have been gentlemanly but in case the Minister of State has not noticed I am no gentleman and I mean business.  I am going the whole way on this amendment and I hope that the Minister of State will be in a position to accept this amendment.  It might short-circuit some of the debate if the Minister of State could give an indication that he is happy to take this amendment on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment does not threaten the company in terms of their financial viability and it has no financial implications of any kind, not does it disrupt the template the Minister of State has set out for Coillte Teoranta.  It in no way threatens the development of forestry in this country.  As I indicated in my Second Stage contribution, I broadly support this Bill, with some reservations which have been outlined by some of my colleagues. With less than 5 per cent of our country under afforestation there is much that we can do in afforestation which would be <Col N="1389" /> to the benefit of our economy.  Approximately 3.3 per cent of our country comes under the category of &ldquo;important scientific area&rdquo;, which includes areas of international, national, regional and local scientific importance.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State is probably aware, in the seventies An Foras Forbartha carried out a heritage inventory during which most of these sites were identified.  I have in mind over 1,000 sites. Only a very small proportion of our inland acreage and waterways would be involved.  Since I referred to this matter rather passionately on Second Stage, which I hope has had some effect on the Minister of State, my colleague, Deputy Nealon, raised an issue on the Adjournment pertaining to what I am talking about now, the threat to the Isle of Innishfree.  He and other colleagues waxed eloquently, quoting Yeats, on what that part of the world means to us. If this amendment is not accepted there would be no structures to prevent forestry development in specially sensitive areas for reasons which we can outline if necessary.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment which is non-threatening.  I would allow for consultation with the Minister for Finance and, through him, with the Commissioners of Public Works as they operate the Wildlife Acts and the National Monuments Act.  I am delighted to welcome Deputy Nealon to the House who I know has a particular interest in this matter.  The reason the Minister for Finance must be consulted is because of his responsibility for the Office of Public Works, an office in which, a short time ago, I spent a most enjoyable year as Minister of State with responsibility for this area.  I am not sure how much convincing I need to do but perhaps if I sit down the Minister of State may give me an initial indication of whether he is prepared to accept this amendment and, if need be, there is a lot more that can be said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I like to be threatened. Coillte Teoranta, like any other company, will be subject to the existing <Col N="1390" /> environmental and amenity legislation. In addition, a duty in regard to such matters is imposed on the company in section 13 of the Bill.  The company, therefore, unlike the generality of State-sponsored bodies will have specific environmental and amenity responsibilities.  Section 38 gives the Minister for Energy power to issue directions to the company, with which they must comply, on general forestry policies and other matters specified therein relating to their operations. While the Bill essentially sets broad parameters for the operation of Coillte Teoranta and does not provide specifically for every matter relating to their operation, I appreciate the sentiments underlying this amendment.  Notwithstanding the fact that I believe the fears expressed by the Deputy are generally groundless and are covered by the Bill I am agreeable to putting the matter beyond doubt.  Therefore, I am willing to accept this amendment and will amend the section accordingly.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased that the Minister is willing to take on board Deputy Doyle's amendment.  Because of the very enlightened attitude which the Minister of State took when I came up against this problem in my constituency in recent times I expected that that would be his attitude towards this amendment. The possible afforestation in the immediate vicinity of the vantage point for viewing the Lake Isle of Innisfree, which would have a serious detrimental effect on the general amenity of the area, is something which I believe will happen on a recurring basis.  When perhaps 95 per cent of afforestation was being done by the Forestry Division, we had control and we knew they would act in a very responsible fashion, as indeed they did. Perhaps it is not suitable on a Committee Stage debate but I want to pay tribute to them for the manner in which they developed the forests, not just for afforestation, but also for scenic walks, picnic areas and generally adding to the tourist value of an area in addition to the economic value of very often inferior land.  I <Col N="1391" /> am delighted that the Minister is accepting this amendment and I know that it will be a very substantial addition to what is turning out to be a very good Bill.</P>

      <P>There is no other reason for it.  I appreciate the Minister's acceptance of this amendment.  The Minister recently visited my constituency and I am sure he is aware of the extensive developments that have been carried out by the forestry in that area.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A consequential minor technical amendment arises from the acceptance of this amendment.  The consequential amendment to section 13 (1) (b) involves the deletion of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 10 and the insertion of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in section 13 (1) (c), line 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting my amendment.  Notwithstanding the provisions in section 38 (1) (c) of the Bill I believe this amendment is necesary to copperfasten beyond doubt the problem which has arisen in the past in relation to the mismatching of land and its use.  I happen to believe that money does grow on trees, particularly in the context of this Bill, but all sustainable development must have a look to conservation, and built into any policy in relation to development must be our conservation policy measures.  They must go hand in hand and if any development is to be sustainable into the future it must be sympathetic towards conservation generally.  The one is not the enemy of the other and should not be viewed as <Col N="1392" /> such.  There should be no fear by developers if a strong conservation protection measure is built into the Bill.</P>
      <P>As the Minister probably knows the mismatching of land and its use has been going on for a long time.  For example, we are now planting trees on our mid-lands and western blanket bogs instead of preserving them as wet land ecologies. We should be planting the Drumlin areas which we are now grazing with cattle. Perhaps the amendment which the Minister has now agreed to will concentrate our minds on the proper use of land and perhaps even the proper zoning of land. The Minister mentioned the environmental legislation and the constraints which exist but unfortunately afforestation is not subject to development plans and planning application procedures generally.  The planning authorities list all known sites of scientific interest in their development plans and they usually have objectives to protect these sites, but unfortunately that is good only as long as it relates to activities which are controlled effectively by the Planning Act, and forestry is not.</P>
      <P>In thanking the Minister for accepting this amendment I want to refer to forestry development in the context of the environmental impact analysis under an EC directive which will become operational in this country post-2 July of this year, which is only a few weeks away. Forestry is dealt with under Annex 2 of that directive and effectively the full spirit of the directive will be operational in this country.  Can I ask the Minister to confirm to the House that where there is any threat to an amenity of a conservation nature from a major afforestation plan that he will invoke an environmental impact assessment, through his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, in relation to that proposed development?</P>

I have always been very conscious of the quality of our environment and that we are only custodians of it for the time being and that we should do everything in our power to enhance <Col N="1393" /> and improve it rather than disimprove it. Beyond saying that I will always try to have regard to it, I have not had the opportunity to assess all of the implications of that document but as soon as I have I will communicate with the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that his acceptance of this amendment, perhaps in relation to forestry and forestry development, will bring to an end the appalling spectre that has been with us for a long time where one arm of Government is financially encouraging the destruction of a site of conservation interest &mdash; that would not be its intention but sometimes a development does that if it is not sensitive to conservation &mdash; while at the same time another arm of Government is trying to protect that site without adequate funding. This has been a dilemma for a long time.  This amendment will protect areas of particular sensitivity, from a scientific interest point of view, from that continuing any longer.  It will certainly make the job much easier for those interested in implementing our Wildlife Acts, National Monuments Acts and Planning Acts when protection is built into the Bill for these most important scenic and scientific areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to another point in relation to the general area of amenities which the Minister might clarify. As private afforestation spreads in my constituency, in particular areas in close proximity to dwelling houses are being planted.  I ask the Minister whether he has any rule on that because the people who live in these dwelling houses may not own the adjoining field and cannot in any way object to the planting.  They do not like having what will be, in a very short period, a very thick forest within 30 yards or 40 yards of their existing premises.  I suppose it is infringing on an amenity, particularly a dwelling house and the surrounds of a dwelling house, and I ask the Minister if he has any powers in that area.</P>

      <P>I cannot say I have had experience of it in the private sector but I came across a problem of that kind in State afforestation.  I decided that there would have to be a certain distance between a house and the first band of trees.  Obviously it depends on the nature of the terrain, whether there is an incline and so on, as to how far you can go, but we need to have more discussions to ensure that we get the best possible balance.  As I said to the Deputy on the Adjournment Debate, you can have extremes on both sides and we need to have a practical balance between them. In the context of discussions with private companies in the forestry area and also in the context of regulations governing the payment of private grants, I will try to go as far as possible on a practical basis to accommodate these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) to have due regard to modern safety practices.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am putting forward this amendment because I understand that in the forests over a number of years there have been at least two fatal accidents per annum and many serious accidents.  I have come across constituents who have lost part of their limbs in these cases.  Part of the <Col N="1395" /> problem is that safety practices are ignored.  The amendment would require the premier company in the forest area to set standards and have due regard to modern safety practices.  Also, some of the problems arise due to the black economy, the way in which people are hired for forest development and forest extraction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry on Second Stage appealed to the Minister to ask this company to control any black economy practices that might be creeping in.  When the Chipboard Company in Scarriff closed down, many of the problems associated with the black economy at that time surfaced. People who had depended for their livelihood on the Department of Social Welfare and forestry subcontractors or whatever, were very shocked at their lack of income.  Some of those people had been injured, but were still associated with the forestry extraction groups. These people were left in a very poor financial position and their families are now trying to look after them.  I appeal to the Minister to respond favourably to this amendment.  I do not know if this will lead to a further instruction by the Minister to the new company under section 38 &mdash; there will be an extremely long list under this section, from what he has told us already.  I suppose that it is the relevant section under which he has the power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Carey's amendment.  It has come to my knowledge that the practice to which he alludes is still widespread.  The situation arises whereby an operator is paid £9 per cubic metre for felling and clearing timber. There are no deductions of any sort.  I have spoken to a number of men engaged in this work and 3 cubic metres is considered to be a tremendous day's work. Against that, the operator is supplying his own saw, his own petrol, his own insurance or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>Or non-insurance, as the <Col N="1396" /> case may be.  It is obvious that those engaged in this practice just could not afford to regard it as a full-time occupation. There is no doubt, as Deputy Carey has pointed out, that there is an inducement to enter the black economy, especially as there are few or no safeguards, that I can ascertain, by way of screening people involved.  This practice is wrong for many reasons.  It is especially wrong from a safety aspect.  For this reason also, I support the amendment and ask the Minister to consider this area. It goes beyond the actual wording of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In case my silence would be taken to mean that I was not in favour of this amendment, I say that I am.  I always want to see safety-conscious methods applied in the forestry area. Those of us with some responsibility in that area know that there are practices which we condemned and should condemn. One is the hiring of operators who for one reason or another have not the ability to operate in a safe environment. Have the Department of Labour safety inspectorate any function in this matter? I would hope that they have.  Unfortunately, as in other areas, there are not enough inspectors to go around, whether it be to inspect building and construction, or lorries, or the like.  The inspectorate are too thin on the ground.  I hope that the safety aspects in the forestry area would be the responsibility of a specific Department such as the Department of Labour, and that it would not simply be a matter for inspectors from the Department of Social Welfare who are seeking to shake out people in the black economy. I hope that a real safety approach would be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that there are various instruction courses held in places throughout the country where operators can learn to operate in a safer fashion.  The Department bring in people who are involved in this industry and give them a basic instruction in the operation of chainsaws, sharpening, methods of felling and so forth.  This is not too well known.  Perhaps that section of the Department which <Col N="1397" /> is not being transferred could be made responsible for safety, rather than it being left to the company.  I hope that the Minister would hold responsibility for that section of the operation within the Department, rather than a commercial company who would experience great pressure to make money, resulting perhaps in corners being cut or a blind eye being turned to certain activities.  If the Minister does not accept this proposal, I hope he will give us the assurance that within his own Department the highest safety standards will be applied to the operation of the whole forest industry &mdash; not just to the commercial activities of the new company, but also to independent private activities in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I would like to refer to two aspects. The first concerns that great force of men who worked down through the years in forestry in varying conditions from area to area.  It depended on the attitude of the person in charge.  I have no doubt that many workers suffered ill-health as a result of conditions not being as they should have been.  The person in charge could be totally unsympathetic to the needs of those men.</P>
      <P>The other aspect referred to more specifically in this amendment concerns due regard to modern safety practices.  In the last decade, when the timber was being taken out under the contract and tendering system that applied, the contractor bought the timber from the Department and gave a pittance to the men to take that timber out in all sorts of conditions.  They had to make a week's wage and very often could not do that. That happened in the State forests and there is much abuse in that regard.  This must not be tolerated any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety aspect is very important because of the number of people who have been injured and have received no compensation because they were not insured.  They just agreed with the contractor to take the timber out and there was no such thing as safety precautions. I am aware of a number of people who have been injured and in one case a <Col N="1398" /> person was so badly injured that he will never work again.  Therefore, I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The company, as an employer, will naturally be concerned with safety practices and will continue the good tradition of forest service in this regard.  This is only one of the many matters with which the company will be involved but which is unnecessary to specify in legislation.  It would be difficult, therefore, to accept the proposed amendment. However, I share the concern expressed by Deputies in relation to safety practices in the whole forestry area.</P>
      <P>The forestry service have, over the years, undertaken a variety of training programmes and have ensured that all the staff have adequate protective clothing headgear, etc. but in spite of these training courses and the provision of protective clothing, there have, unfortunately, been a number of accidents. The chainsaw is a particularly lethal weapon and requires constant vigilance. I am certainly open to any suggestion which will improve safety practices and thereby ensure that we will minimise or eliminate altogether the possibility of any serious accidents to our staff.</P>
      <P>The problem is considerably different in relation to operators for some private companies and some of the fears to which Deputies referred are, in my own experience, close to the mark.  They leave a lot to be desired and are in need of a radical shake-up.  In relation to the question of the black economy operations, this accusation can no longer be aimed at the forest service.  We have ensured, through a number of ways, that all our practices in this regard are completely above board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also attempted, in a variety of ways, to try to influence this development in relation to the area where it affects our contract services.  All the personnel in the Department have been told to try to ensure that none of the people in the forests will be operating in the black economy.  Contractors receiving contracts over £10,000 per year will have to produce tax clearance certificates and <Col N="1399" /> a new form of contract which has recently been drafted by the Chief State Solicitor is being used for all future contracts.</P>
    <P>The problem obviously arises, not in the direct relationship that the forest service have with the contractor, but with the extension of these contracts and sub-contracts further down the line.  In so far as we can, in consultation with the Minister for Social Welfare, we will do everything we can to try to improve that situation.  This amendment does not relate to the black economy but I wanted to reply to some of the points made by Deputies and to assure everybody in the House that as far as the forest service are concerned training courses, the provision of safety equipment and the general climate for improving these practices is paramount and must be continually monitored and improved.  I will take any suggestion made in the House which will help to improve the situation as far as concerns subcontractors over whom we have no direct responsibility but for whom we obviously have to be concerned, where they operate in practices which are a threat to themselves, their livelihoods and their safety.  I will be glad to do whatever is possible in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>1 July is a more significant date.  The Minister said he would be grateful for suggestions in relation to safety.  Surely it is incumbent on the chief-executive and the board of directors to evolve a practice which would insist on contractors and subcontractors indicating <Col N="1400" /> that they had modern equipment available to avoid these accidents?  I know the Minister said that the Chief State Solicitor will bring out some form of contract but, if the company's objective was to engage in safety practices, the chief executive, the board of directors and the management would be obliged to develop that limited kind of control which, in the long run, would reduce the number of accidents.</P>

      <P>The company will inherit an industrial workforce and technical people who are well trained and conscious of safety standards which have operated in the forestry area for a considerable time and which have been improved through training courses, etc. The problem is not within the confines of the forest service.  If, for instance, a stand of timber is sold at an auction or by tender to a private company, they in turn pay a deposit on that purchase and use their own resources to harvest that timber. The forest service do not have direct or indirect control over that and the Deputy's amendment would not solve the problem.</P>

It may well require stepping up penalties or other such measures which will enable the safety procedures which have been adopted by the forest service for so long to find their way down to the areas which are at present worrying the Deputies.</P>

      <P>Before the Leas-Cheann Comhairle came in a Deputy in this House moved an amendment which was accepted by the Minister.  A further Deputy came in and wasted 20 minutes speaking to an amendment which had <Col N="1402" /> already been accepted by the Minister.  It was a pure waste of time so as to have it in the report, instead of debating amendments which should be debated.  That performance has been clearly observed. The amendments to this Bill are important and the people who put them down are entitled to debate them without time being wasted as it was wasted by the Fine Gael Party a few minutes ago.</P>
      <P>Section 14 says that:</P>
      <P>The company shall submit to and agree with the Minister each year a programme for the sale of land and the sale of timber, whether standing or felled.</P>
      <P>We are concerned that an interpretation could be put on this section that it was compulsory for the company to sell off land each year.  No doubt from time to time it would be in the interests of the company to sell off small parcels of land no longer suitable for forestry and to acquire other lands.  However, we are concerned that this section as worded would open the way for a large scale systematic selling off of the land bank necessary for forestry.  Our amendment would remove any element of doubt by making it clear that such sale of land would not be a compulsory annual requirement and would be done only where the company considers such sale to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party amendment seeks simply to delete the words &ldquo;the sale of land&rdquo;, and this is another way of doing it.  We would be happy with that also. Although it is not addressed in our amendment some of the other amendments made the point that a yearly programme is too short a term for an industry such as forestry which by its nature is a long-term investment.  We are prepared to support the idea of perhaps a three or four year programme.  In relation to the sale of land and timber, the whole question of policy is very important.  Something that has concerned me as a Deputy for Cork East is that in the Doneraile area there has been a sale of timber in Dreenagh Wood just outside Doneraile. Is it the intention to have that area <Col N="1403" /> replanted?  What way is the land being disposed of?  Already a fair section of it has been sold.  I am very surprised at the manner in which this is being done and I am availing of this opportunity to address the question to the Minister because this section deals with the sale of land and timber.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be an appropriate section in which the Minister could have made reference to the land acquisition and afforestation programme but there is no reference to that in this section.  Will the Minister state his intention in that regard?</P>
      <P>The requirement to submit a programme as provided in this section poses a few problems for the company.  By empowering the Minister to impose such a programme and to approve particular sales, the legislation restricts fairly severely the company's ability to carry on their business in accordance with the sound commercial practices envisaged. This is inconsistent with the reason for establishing the company in the first place which was to free it from the restraints of the Civil Service under which it had to act for so many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Annual programmes are inappropriate for forestry operations because of the length of time it takes for a tree to grow or for a forest to mature.  A three or a five year programme would be more appropriate.  A major point which concerns us and obviously concerns Deputy Sherlock relates to the sale of land.  The one thing that has concerned me throughout this debate is the possibility of privatising the forestry industry through various sections of this Bill.  I am concerned that the Minister should write into a Bill provisions for the sale of timber or land.  The Minister asserts that a programme will be set out for the sale of land and timber whether standing or felled.  My concern has been, and from what the Minister said earlier on, his concern also, is that we should sell growing timber and land together.  The only purpose of my amendment is to prevent <Col N="1404" /> that happening.  Now and again small parcels of land are sold off whether for the local authority in a particular area or for a Department of Education requirement for schools or playing pitches or whatever. The Department are often approached to sell small parcels of land and on occasions there may be a need to sell land in certain areas where a private sector operation might be appropriate.  I am very much concerned however, about large scale selling off of these assets of this company.  If this section goes through unamended it will facilitate the large scale selling off of assets.</P>
    <P>Should this company find itself in financial difficulties in the future where the Government will require them to look after their own future with regard to raising funds, the company may have to face the possibility of selling off assets such as timber on land.  I opposed this idea when I was in Government.  I made a statement at the time and the Minister, a Deputy at the time, also came in very strongly to support that view.  Now that the Minister is on the Government benches with the possibility of putting legislation through, I hope he will maintain that position that he and his party held a few years back, that it should not be possible, through a section like this, to sell off large scale areas of forestry estates in the ownership of this company. I know there are other sections which are very important but this is a very basic one, one which concerns me and my party very much.  If the Minister cannot accept my amendment I hope he will suggest an amendment which would take on board the sentiments I am expressing here today, namely, that under no circumstances should this Bill facilitate the sale of the land and timber which has been acquired through taxpayers' money over the years and handed over to private enterprise.  I hope the Minister can clear our minds on this matter before we proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to amendment No. 18 to section 14, subsection (1) which relates to the sale of land and timber.  The Minister should consider the rewording of this section to &ldquo;the sale and acquisition of land&rdquo;.  If the company are to be allowed to sell land, surely they must be allowed to acquire it given that the programme is agreed with the Minister.  Once the programme has been agreed with the Minister at the start of the year he will have given the company the power to sell land during the year.  In order to allow them to proceed commercially he must incorporate in this subsection the power to acquire land.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 21, I suggest to the Minister that in line with the commercial activities of the company it should not just be a year-to-year review but the company in line with proper commercial practice should submit a five year development plan.  This should be the basis of the Minister's review each year, not an <i>ad hoc</i> plan or an <i>ad hoc</i> agenda for the annual general meeting between the board of directors of the forestry board and the Minister but rather a review of the five year plan which should be submitted to the Minister and updated &mdash; and be the basis of the annual meetings &mdash; which would decide the sale and acquisition of land and timber for the purpose of the profitable and commercial operation of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the debate began on these amendments the Minister has been talking about the constraints which we sought to put on him through the various amendments.  In my proposed amendment I am trying to extend the scope of the company's activities by asking for &ldquo;a <Col N="1406" /> five year programme for afforestation, the sale or lease&rdquo;.  Following on Deputy Kavanagh's point I might also put in the sale or lease of land and the sale or lease of timber.  In this Bill a practice is now being accepted that total sales of land and timber will be the only way forward for forestry and forestry development.  I know the Minister had experience last year of two sales.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is off the rails again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite off the rails. On the first occasion he offered land on lease and in the second case he sold the land because the finance companies asked for it.  I do not understand why the financial companies want to take advantage of the small appreciation there might be in land values and commit huge sums to the purchase of land when the development of forestry might be extended much further through a leasing system.  I await the Minister's reply but it would appear to me that leasing as an idea has been abandoned in the Bill.  Perhaps I am wrong but that is what I think.  Some people whom I consulted about this Bill feel that the State is handing over these assets should make at least one last effort to develop a leasing system.  We are about to hand over the entire assets and if we asked them to have a further go at leasing we would be taking the right step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In countries such as Israel they set up communes where people work steadily year in year out under the high sun, yet the system of land ownership there is that of lease.  Even if it goes to a 700 year lease they will accept that in Israel.  There is something wrong in this country when we are not able to get our farmers to adopt a proper leasing system and to have confidence in it.  I am told the financial institutions are the very people who will not have confidence in the farmer honouring his lease after 40 years.  Irrespective of the malpractices which are going on, surely the State is guiding the company would indicate to them that they consider the two matters, the sale of <Col N="1407" /> the land or the lease of the land.  I think everybody would be happy if the land was leased because less emotions would be released about the disposal of a valuable State asset.</P>
    <P>That is the main reason I have put down the amendment.  I think that a five year programme is a realistic period for the chief executive and the directors to have something put together and it would release them from the scare of the big hand of the Minister for Finance coming down on them on an annual basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these amendments together as they all relate to section 14.  I want to make it clear to Deputies that the primary purpose of this section is to prevent the company from selling off large tracts of land to compensate for management deficiencies in conducting its business.  The objections which Deputies have in relation to any unnecessary disposal of land are more than adequately covered.  Indeed, the fears expressed by Deputy Kavanagh in that sense are unwarranted.  In my view it is entirely reasonable that the Minister, on behalf of the citizens of the State, who have invested large sums in forestry down through the years should have a role in preventing excessive land sales, together with timber on that land, by the company.</P>
      <P>The reference to timber can be interpreted as being almost exactly the same as that to land.  It is also possible to strip assets prematurely by the disposal of timber which is not ready for harvesting. There is no intention to use this section to put a strait-jacket on the company in relation to normal timber sales.  The section, in fact, allows the Minister flexibility in exercising his responsibilities under it.  It would not, for example, prevent the Minister agreeing a five year sales programme with the company, annual sales targets within this programme to be settled in consultation with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the memorandum and articles of association provide for a five year programme.  Within this section, and <Col N="1408" /> through the memorandum, we have copperfastened the twin aims of having a five year programme and having within it an agreed annual sales programme.  I do not propose to accept the amendments relating to the sale of land and programmes but I would be prepared to accept that section 14 should also provide for an annual programme in relation to the acquisition of land and, therefore, I agree to accept Deputy McCoy's amendment on that point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The memorandum and articles of association provide for leasing. However, I do not see it as having the potential that Deputy Carey considers. There is a reluctance on the part of farmers to lease land in conventional farming areas for dairying or beef production and in such instances farmers are in a position to retrieve the land at a given time but forestry is a long-term project and it is doubtful if it will encourage leasing.  We have provided for leasing and we will encourage it but it should not be seen as the be-all and end-all in terms of acquiring land for forestry purposes.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told me that the section covers the point I have raised, that the land on which the timber has been planted shall not be sold off without the Minister having made the House aware of it.  However, section 14 (1) states:</P>
      <P>The company shall submit to and agree with the Minister each year a programme for the sale of land and the sale of timber, whether standing or felled.</P>
      <P>Other sections amplify that provision.  Is there not a method whereby we can make it clear to future Ministers that under no circumstances can the assets of the company be stripped?  The Minister and I are concerned that the company should not be stripped of its assets but I am not satisfied that the amendment deals with the point.</P>

When I read the section I expressed concern in relation to what appeared to be an annual obligation but the matter has been checked with the parliamentary draftsman and I understand that there is not a better way of dealing with it.  Provision is made for the sale of land but at the same time the Minister can ensure that should the company decide to oversell, it will have to be specified.  I am advised that there is not a better or safer procedure to deal with this matter than that included in the Bill.</P>

However, the Minister will not be in charge of forestry forever and his successors may not have the same attitude to forestry.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for accepting Deputy McCoy's amendment because in doing so he is accepting portion of our amendment which states:</P>
      <P>The company shall submit to and agree with the Minister each year a programme for the acquisition of land and for the sale of land where the company considers such sale to be necessary....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has agreed to a programme for the acquisition of land.  It was good to hear that he was in agreement with the view that the company should not be selling off land.  He has told us that there is no compulsion on the company to sell off land.  Deputy Sherlock was anxious to include the <Col N="1410" /> words, &ldquo;where the company consider such sale to be necessary&rdquo;, so that that view would be submitted to the Minister and if he consented the land would be sold.</P>
    <P>It appears from the Bill that a Minister can insist on the company submitting a programme for the sale of the land he wants sold.  There is nothing in the Bill to the effect that that should not happen. Each year the company must submit to the Minister a programme for the sale of land and the Minister can insist on the company doing that.  It is for that reason that we want the following words included, &ldquo;where the company considers such sales to be necessary&rdquo;.  If the company do not consider such sales to be necessary there should not be any need to submit such a programme.  The Minister has said that he accepts that view.</P>
    <P>I accept the point made by Deputy Kavanagh that, in accordance with subsection (1) the company will have to submit to the Minister each year a programme for the sale of land.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter again.  He has been very reasonable in accepting amendments.  I am glad he has accepted that there should be a programme of acquisition of land but to insist that there be a programme of sale of land every year would be wrong.  It would give undue power to future Ministers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House because we have not made very much progress.  It has been clearly outlined by Deputy Mac Giolla that what will be involved will be the absolute sale of land, as is written down in this section. I am saying that the wording should be &ldquo;sale or lease of land&rdquo;.  Maybe I did not put down the proper amendment but I believe that it should be worded in that way.  I do not see why the company should be committed totally to the sale of land. I wanted to extend the time in order that there would be a five year programme. Such a programme in that area would be satisfactory and would not put the company under undue pressure.  In an earlier amendment the Minister said that I was putting unnecessary restrictions on <Col N="1411" /> the company by including, in section 12, land acquisition and afforestation.  The Minister said that that was a restriction and that it was dealt with in the articles of association.  While he is accepting this amendment, he is excluding the possibility of the lease of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Carey, I said earlier that as far as leasing is concerned it is covered in the memorandum and articles of association and there is no doubt about the freedom of the company to lease land.  This is a separate section.  Let us try to imagine a situation where no provision was made with regard to getting agreement with the Minister on the sale of land and that all that was included in the provision was the sale of timber.  It is probably likely that by staying silent on this matter there would perhaps be no objection whatsoever to the provision.  The reason why there is an objection is that there is a precise reference to a programme for the sale of land.  What I envisaged in that situation is that the company for one reason or another could decide, off their own bat, if the Minister did not have the power to find agreement with them, to dispose of unnecessary land banks to cover up for their own inefficiencies.  If I do not put in the provision, obviously I would not have the same power to restrict the company in the way the Deputies would wish.  In that sense I am meeting, in a general way, what this House wants to achieve.</P>
      <P>I readily admit that having read and re-read the section I was inclined to have the fears that were expressed by Deputies in this House.  I subsequently ascertained, in so far as I possibly could, from the draftsman whether agreement with the Minister on the sale of land could be incorporated in a different way and I am reliably informed that this is not possible. Nevertheless, I have to emphasise that the provision does not necessitate the sale of land on an annual basis.  It cannot be provided for in any different legal format.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, in the previous section there is the provision to remunerate capital and repay borrowings.  It may not be <Col N="1412" /> possible to do that within a given time and therefore many of the provisions in the Bill have, of necessity, to cover a range of possibilities, not all of which would have to be put into effect at a given time.  Therefore all we can do is try to cover eventualities which we envisage, in the best legal way that we can, and at the same time confine intrusion or any involvement of the Minister in the day-to-day activities to an absolute and total minimum.  I hope Deputies will accept that if I could be convinced &mdash; I have tried this from a number of angles &mdash; that there was another and more appropriate way to make the same determination, I would be glad to do so but, as I have said, I am reliably advised that that is not technically possible.</P>

      <P>If we were on Report Stage I would suggest an amendment. I do not think the Minister should ever accept from draftsmen that something is not possible.  The Minister should be given a programme every year of what the company are doing.  It is stated in the Bill that the company shall submit to and agree with the Minister each year a programme for the sale of timber, whether standing or felled, and if they intend to sell any land such programme should also be submitted to the Minister. The &ldquo;if&rdquo; makes that provision less definite than the one proposed which states that every year they must submit a programme for the sale of land and timber.</P>

When the Bill goes through this House it will then go to the Seanad and I undertake to have a further look at this provision.  I want it to be understood that, having already tried to achieve this end, I have to give that undertaking without a commitment to come up with a different solution.</P>

We will be having another look at it and some of our Senators can put forward an amendment if they think that a better wording is needed.  The purpose of my amendment is a simple one, to create a discussion on this matter, to voice our fears, to get the Minister's reaction to it and perhaps to get a more appropriate amendment from his point of view.</P>
      <P>I will put a hypothetical case to the Minister and perhaps he could refer to it.  He has said that this provision is a safeguard as far as he is concerned.  Suppose it happens that, as I suggested earlier, in the next few years this company are not generating sufficient revenue to meet all the commitments which they are supposed to meet, on the revenue side as well as the capital side, and a Minister tells them that he cannot give a direct grant to them but that they should sell some of their assets, as is provided for under section 14 (1), can that be done under this Bill as it stands?</P>

In providing only nine members on the board the Minister is obviously keen to have a very small tight-knit operation running the company and one cannot criticise him for that.  He might say that if there were three worker directors out of nine we would not have a balanced board.  I am not making his case for him because I would not agree with that.</P>
    <P>I decided the best way forward would be to increase the number of directors to allow the Minister to create worker directors.  If the Minister agrees with what I am saying &mdash; whether a nine member or a 12 member board &mdash; I will be happy and I am prepared not to delay the House any further.  However, it will not be sufficient for him to say that this can be covered in the Worker Participation Act, 1988, because when that Bill was being discussed, we tried to have this new board included, but the Minister rejected it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>His idea seems to be that it is sufficient to create a sub-board level operation in future concerns to be included in the worker participation legislation.  I do not think that is appropriate for the employees of the new company because they are very experienced and highly skilled people at all levels.  They do not need to be educated into the decision making process.  In my view they would be a great asset to the company.  We heard one of two remarks on Second Stage about working directors rather than worker directors and I want to reject any slight that worker directors did not contribute fairly and completely to the operations of their companies.</P>
    <P>My reason for proposing that worker <Col N="1416" /> directors be appointed to the board is that their knowledge and experience in their own industry can benefit the company; I am not simply making a political demand.  As I said, boards can only benefit from worker participation, not at a sub-level where, as somebody said, they deal with the colour of the toilet rolls.  We want them involved in decision-making. We do not want them kept happy at meetings held in backrooms and brought to Dublin once or twice.  We want them opearting at full capacity and making decisions using their expertise.  All the necessary information should be available not alone to the people the Minister will choose but also to the worker directors. I do not mind if the Minister accepts my amendment or somebody else's amendment.  All I want to know is if he accepts the principle of worker directors in this company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">

      <P>Amendment No. 23 in my name reads:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (2) (a), line 36, after &ldquo;more than 9&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, of whom not less than three shall be elected by the employees of the company&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are shocked that it is intended that a new commercial State company be established without any provision for the appointment of worker directors.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have made it clear that they consider this omission to be a breach of the terms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> There seems to be a new element of hostility to the principle of worker directors creeping into Fianna Fáil policy.  This is the second major State body to be set up by legislation within the past few weeks in which no provision was made for worker directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on the Teagasc Bill, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, made it quite clear that he was absolutely opposed to the principle of worker representation on the boards of these companies.  Whatever about Teagasc, the case for worker directors on the new forestry company is <Col N="1417" /> unanswerable.  I understand there have been very strong representations from the unions involved but they got a totally negative response from the Government. Why is it there should be worker directors in a company like Bord na Móna but not in a very similar company, the Irish Forestry Board Limited?  When posts and communications were taken out of the Civil Service through the establishment of An Post and Telecom Éireann, provision was made for worker directors.  Why is it that when forestry is being taken from under the direct wing of the Civil Service and a new commercial company is being set up, worker directors are not being provided for?  The only possible interpretation is that Fianna Fáil, in yet another U-turn, have decided to turn their back on the principle of worker directors, despite the generally held view that worker directors have contributed to a greater sense of involvement by workers and a better climate of industrial relations.  Who can deny that workers on the ground and representatives at a higher level will not be aware of the anomalies in the workings of a company? Direct representation on the board could eliminate these shortcomings and be of great advantage to the company.</P>
    <P>Our amendment is reasonable and asks simply that the workers in the forestry company be given the same rights and the same element of industrial democracy as workers in Aer Lingus, the Sugar Company, Bord na Móna, CIE, the ESB and so on.  The amendment suggests that three of the nine directors be elected by the workers.  I respectfully ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two amendments to this section.  I emphasised during my Second Stage contribution the need for expertise on the board of directors. Amendment No. 24 states:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (2). line 36, after &ldquo;more than 9&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;and shall include among them persons with established experience in <Col N="1418" /> marketing, accounting and personnel management;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All the studies on the State forests concluded that the main objective in setting up a new enterprise should be to establish a market-led industry.  I have asked for the inclusion on the board of persons with experience of marketing and accounting. We have had experience of companies where directors did not consult with other directors and made forward contracts. There is also need for a director who is experienced in personnel management because there will be huge problems in transforming this State body into a private company.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the trade unions encouraged the Minister and the review group to change from State control to private control.  They showed their goodwill towards the establishment of the company.  I was interested to hear Deputy Sherlock's remarks about the contribution of worker directors.  Some kind of incentive should have been provided for the workers such as, for example, a profit-sharing scheme.  This would apply to all the workers in the industry.</P>
    <P>I tabled amendment No. 25, dealing with worker directors, because I have been impressed by the progress made in my constituency by Aer Rianta, who are encouraging worker participation.  The workers, trade unions and staff associations have come together and have made some progress towards the worker director concept.  They have had lots of meetings which have been very beneficial for industrial relations in Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not even providing for trade union representation at sub-board level.  Is it to be done under the infamous section 38?  The Minister will have to come clean and say whether he intends to have these people at sub-board level.</P>
    <P>There will have to be strong management in the area of marketing, accounting and personnel.  I do not believe the transition will take place as smoothly as everyone believes.  I appeal to the Minister to give a definite indication that something firm is being done <Col N="1419" /> to provide for worker participation in the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to appoint directors to the company on the basis of the contribution they can make to it.  Obviously experience in marketing, accounting and personnel management are important but, equally, they are not the only considerations in view of the business in which the company will engage.  For this reason they should not be singled out for mention in the Bill.  A list of all the desirable attributes of the directors would not be possible.  This is a forestry company and there is nothing in the amendments to secure the appointment to the board of a person with a knowledge of forestry.  I should prefer to leave the legislation as it stands.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the other amendments tabled by Deputies Kavanagh, McCoy, Sherlock and Carey.  I consider that the proposed number of directors is appropriate, given the size and operations of the company.  I do not consider an increase in the number would have any impact in increasing efficiency.  The opposite might well be the case, as I think Deputy Kavanagh would agree.  It is the Government's firm intention to appoint the directors solely on the basis of the contribution they will make to the development of the company.  This approach would not, of course, preclude the appointment of an employee as a director but not in a representative capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> states that the Government proposes to facilitate the introduction of worker participation arrangements at sub-board levels.  Recently the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Bill, 1988 was considered by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Accordingly, I would be prepared at the appropriate stage to avail of the consultative provisions of that legislation in regard to the implementation of participative arrangements at sub-board levels in the company.  The Forestry Bill would give the right to employers to <Col N="1420" /> initiate arrangements for participation below board level in accordance with the provisions of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988.  It will be up to the employee representatives and the company management to work out arrangements best suited to the new company.</P>
    <P>It is not intended at this stage to make provision for the election of worker directors. Progress in participative arrangements require patience, time and discussion.  By concentrating first on identifying the common ground, employee representatives and management can concentrate on building a climate of trust under a scheme of participation suited to the particular needs of Coillte Teoranta. To achieve this, worker directors are neither necessary nor particularly appropriate at this time.</P>
    <P>The legislation provided for sub-board structures.  This will lead to a regular exchange of views and information between management and employees concerning matters of interest to both. These could include company plans, manpower policy and budgets.  Development of sub-board structures will require the time and commitment of employees and management, especially live management, to make these structures work. The aim, therefore, is to allow an opportunity for employees and management to design and put into operation their own participative arrangements below board level.  The question of worker directors can be considered in the light of the progress made at sub-board level.  It is clearly preferable first to build a foundation and infrastructure of participation below board level.  We only have to take the Aer Rianta experience where the management and staff set about over the years providing these structures and were gradually able to grow into a position where the worker director position was reached.</P>
    <P>I am not going to take second place to anybody in this House in relation to efforts we have tried to make to ensure we have the widest possible consultation with staff at all levels, not only in relation to the introduction of this new Bill which <Col N="1421" /> obviously affected their terms of employment and everything with that, but also in connection with the plans for the development of forestry as a whole.  We have had discussions with the trade unions, all levels of staff at headquarters, visited many of the forest centres, talked to the industrial workers and the technical staff at all levels to ensure that we would have the best possible consultation with regard to forestry development for the future, and indeed with regard to the development of the new organisation.  I am very concerned to ensure that we have the best possible staff relations but I do not, however, agree that this is the appropriate time to make this provision.</P>
    <P>Many of the arguments which were made over the years for the establishment of a new company to run our forestry services were based on the outdated procedures and the constraints in the Civil Service and even the dual structure in the forest service.  It could well be that to accept the proposals put forward, however genuinely, at this stage one would actually perpetuate some of the divisions which could be better overcome by establishing single line management under the new company where a basic effort would be made to work not only from the top down but from the ground up to establish the best possible staff procedures and mechanisms from which developments of the kind the Deputy has in mind would grow in the future.</P>
    <P>For these solid reasons, and bearing in mind that I have personally endeavoured to get the greatest possible consensus in the forest service with regard to these developments and that I have met not only the unions but personnel at all levels throughout the country in relation to this provision, I feel for the time being the presentation we are making in relation to development at sub-board level and the structures which would have to be built around that should be acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a great disappointment to me.  The Minister says he discussed this matter with the unions.  He must not have listened to what the unions said to him in regard to worker directors. <Col N="1422" /> The Public Service Executive Union, the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants, the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union represent the full staff of the present forestry section of the Department of Energy.  All of those indicated clearly that they want full board level representation.  Even yesterday the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which represents the voice of the total trade union movement, told the Minister quite clearly in a letter to him that they were disappointed with the Bill since the Minister would not accept two basic changes in it, the first that it was essential that provision be made for the election of worker directors to the board of the new company in accordance with the terms of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988, and the second that in order to protect the new company from any attempt at privatisation that might be made in the future the Minister should be obliged to return to the Dáil before any changes could be made in the status of sales of shares which could take place.</P>
      <P>The Minister was asked to make those two changes in the Bill.  He has rejected both of those and as a result I, on behalf of my party, will be opposing the Bill. It is wrong to say that the unions have indicated to the Minister that they are in favour of sub-board level participation by workers; they are not.  The Minister has their letter.  I have mentioned the unions that have made representations to me in regard to amendments that should be made and giving the opinions of the workers whom they represent.</P>
      <P>Because the Minister has rejected an amendment to the principle stated in section 15, on behalf of my party, I cannot accept this Bill in its entirety. Therefore, I am not only opposing this section but since it is very unlikely that we are going to get much longer to debate the remainder of the amendments I am opposing the whole Bill.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I will be echoing Deputy Kavanagh's views on the issues he mentioned.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have made it clear that <Col N="1423" /> they consider the omission to be a breach of the terms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  I would contend that what the Minister said in reply is a reflection on the workers in the forestry section at all levels.  The Minister is saying that within the workforce of that grouping there are not people who are fit to be on that board.</P>

Is the Minister going to say that the provisions of the Second Schedule of the Worker Participation Act are going to be invoked?  That is really my question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a First Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Last December, this House passed the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill of 1987, even though, on Committee Stage, discussions had reached only section 4. The remaining sections and Stages were all passed without debate.  In the Minister's introductory speech on Second Stage, he stated that the Bill had the support of the Trout Anglers' Federation of Ireland, Official Report, volume 376, column 2594, and Opposition parties accepted the Minister's assurance on this matter.  It has, of course, since transpired that the Minister gave the Dáil incorrect information on that occasion.  It is now clear that little or no consultation took place with the angling clubs involved. Their disagreement with the licensing system has caused major disruption in angling affairs, with extremely serious consequences for the angling tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, the losses in tourism angling alone stand at over £6 million according to Bord Fáilte, which is exactly 15 times the maximum revenue that the Government have targeted from their rod licensing system.  In addition, there has been the very damaging implication for the future of angling tourism arising from the extensive media coverage that the present dispute has received in the foreign media, including consumer and tourism media in Britain and on the Continent.  Even <i>The New York Times</i> has carried a report on the controversy. I want to sound this warning.  Unless this dispute is settled by this September, further irreparable damage will be done. That is the effective deadline for tour operators in Britain and on the Continent to put their tourism packages for the 1989 tourist season together.  Many of these <Col N="1431" /> people have been messed around with their Irish tours this year and if the present dispute is not resolved many of these will simply scrub Ireland from their list of holiday destinations for next year.</P>
    <P>When he first brought our Bill forward in May and continuously ever since, we have made clear that our primary concern in the present controversy is the innocent hostages in the tourist sector, the hoteliers, the guesthouse owners, the restaurateurs and others who are the real victims of the affair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not think of those last December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are anxious to see the fullest consultation with all the relevant interests to reach agreement on a mutually satisfactory system of funding for the development of inland fisheries.  The common sense solution to the present dispute is to suspend legislation until next March to allow such discussions to proceed in a climate of goodwill and to enable a lasting solution to emerge as quickly as possible.  We condemn any intimidation of anglers complying with the law of the land as it now stands and anybody who acts outside the law does serious harm to the cause of all those opposing rod licensing.  Our Bill is the correct way to go about resolving the present dispute, bringing the issue before Dáil Éireann.  This is not a nods and winks solution or one being attempted behind closed doors.  We are not seeking the total repeal of the legislation but rather its suspension for a cooling off period, when a lasting solution can be worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see our Bill as the only practical solution to the present difficulty.  We are aware of the several attempts made by the Taoiseach, Ministers, Ministers of State and civil servants to find some other way around the impasse.  Indeed, some guarantees are alleged to have been given which would have been highly improper. We are also aware of the expressed intention of Fine Gael to move an amending Bill to put in place alternative structures which clearly will not work.  It would <Col N="1432" /> serve little purpose to replace this bad piece of legislation with another piece of inoperable legislation.  I appeal to Fine Gael and all parties to support our Bill as the only practical course of action at present.</P>

      <P>I approached the Ceann Comhairle's office this morning to know <Col N="1433" /> if it would be in order for me to have five minutes also.  Some hours later, the Ceann Comhairle's office communicated with me and said that it would be all right. I made the initial approach in relation to Fine Gael; I did not consider other Opposition parties.  The purpose of this brief debate is to decide whether the Bill in the name of Deputy McCoy should proceed to First Stage and then be published and circulated.  Let us stick to what we should be talking about tonight.</P>
      <P>The Bill in my name on the Order Paper represents clearly and unequivocally, the Fine Gael position on the resolution of the destructive rod angling dispute that has continued now for six months.  I fully appreciate the concerns of anglers who distrust the licensing system and the potential legal controls inherent in it.  I accept in good faith that the anglers have &mdash; and will continue &mdash; to contribute to the development of our inland fisheries service, inadequate though that may be, given the enormous potential of this industry if properly developed.</P>
      <P>We need structures and realistic investment, proper pollution and poaching control to arrest the serious decline in angling.  It is towards this end that our time and energies should more properly be directed.  If we, the democratically elected Members of the House, have the will to deliver I know the anglers will keep their part of the bargain with reasonable contributions towards that service.</P>
      <P>Even if the Progressive Democrats win the vote tonight, their Bill cannot be taken this session as they have no Private Members' Time left.  They have known this for weeks but continued to raise expectations, mainly through the misleading histrionics of Deputy Molloy, who appears to be quite out of step with the views of Deputy O'Malley and his own marine spokesman, Deputy McCoy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On 16 December 1987, the Labour Party's attitude to the legislation was clearly indicated by our spokesperson for the Marine, Deputy Pattison, and myself.  On that occasion, we voted against the Second Stage of the Fisheries Bill, 1987, because there were a number of serious flaws in it.  There were three reasons for voting against it. <Col N="1435" /> We had decided in our attitude towards the Bill that the principle of interfering with free fishing was a very important one.  My speech in the Dáil &mdash; and that of Deputy Pattison &mdash; drew attention to the administrative difficulties in implementing legislation of this kind.  The third reason was that the proposed yield from the licence &mdash; £550,000 &mdash; had to be set in the context of a 13 per cent reduction in the Department of the Marine and the loss of over £1 million.  At that stage we pointed out that even within the 13 per cent reduction in the Department of Fisheries Estimate, the amount spent on conservation had been further reduced.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the Labour Party has been consistent in this regard.  We have continued to show to the public the principles underlying our opposition last December.  Since then, unfortunately, communities have become divided, relationships between anglers and fishery boards have been very badly damaged and great havoc has been wreaked in the tourist economy, particularly in some fragile rural communities such as Oughterard and elsewhere.  Our attitude to the present legislation, therefore, can be simply put.  We continue to oppose the principle involved in bringing in a rod licence.  We continue in our suggestion that it is administratively impossible to achieve.  We also point to the fact that, in terms of finance, it was replacement money, particularly in relation to conservation, for money that should have been provided from proper and adequate finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our attitude towards the tourists dealing with the present impasse is to participate responsibly and with some consistency when public meetings have been called on this issue.  Our party, Deputy Kemmy and others voted against this legislation in December.  We will be preparing our own legislative resolution of these difficulties in the autumn. However, in the interim, we must regard the Bill before us as offering the prospect of consultation and a period of time in which we might make some progress. <Col N="1436" /> For that reason, we will support the Bill proposed by Deputy McCoy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the homilies on cynicism to which attention has been drawn, the justification of those who did not vote against the legislation in December was that they had been misled about consultation. If that is the case, they should not be misled this evening.  For example, what has been proposed by Deputy Doyle has been rejected by the angling clubs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A simple consultation process in any part of the country could have confirmed that for her. Therefore, it cannot be said that anyone was misled in regard to consultation in December 1987 and closed their ears to consultation in June 1988.  We are opposed to the principle of the legislation but we will support the legislation proposed here because it offers us some breathing space and time for a resolution of a damaging and unnecessary conflict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I propose that the Dáil suspend the rod licence law.  There is unprecedented opposition among anglers to the licence fee which is seen simply as an attempt to raise additional revenue for central Government.  There have already been a number of incidents on rivers and lakes involving anglers and fishery officers.  Unless action is taken to defuse the situation there is likely to be further trouble with the prospect of anglers having to face fines and even imprisonment. There is also evidence that it is doing considerable damage to tourism. Tourists who were told there was free angling here now arrive and find that they have to pay for the pleasure of fishing our rivers and lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the manner in which this legislation was rushed through the Dáil in just two days before the Christmas recess, without adequate consideration and without consultation with either the angling interests or Bord Fáilte, it should be withdrawn. Having debated this matter with <Col N="1437" /> the very staunch members and officers of Fianna Fáil in the Blackwater valley area, that is the Mitchelstown/ Mallow/Fermoy district, and also with Fine Gael members&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have been subjected to more misrepresentation and misinformation on this issue then any other Member of the House.  The reason I oppose this Bill is that on 16 December, when this legislation was brought before the House, there was scarcely any of the interest we see this evening from either Fine Gael or the Progressive Democrats.  The people who are very vocal about this issue, and who have been vocal about this issue, were not in attendance in the House on that occasion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy, who has shown a very deep interest in this issue, was not present in the House and did not avail of the opportunity to make a contribution on 16 December.  Strange as it may seem, even though this legislation has been criticised on many grounds by Opposition spokespersons, on the occasion when there was an opportunity to amend the legislation and to table an amendment, they did not either bother to do that or to contribute.  I want to single out in particular the Progressive Democrats, whose spokesperson on Marine affairs was not present on that occasion.  Deputy Molloy was not present <Col N="1444" /> on that occasion and indeed the personnel of the Progressive Democrats was so depleted on that occasion that the party leader had to make a contribution on behalf of the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that a charge has been made that no consultations were entered into on this issue.  For the most of last year I had detailed consultations with the various fisheries boards, with the Central Fisheries Board, with the Coarse Anglers Federation of Ireland and with the Trout Anglers Federation of Ireland. We have on record the views of those organisations where they support in principle a licensing arrangement for both trout fishing and coarse fishing, so it is not accurate to say that the federations with responsibility have been opposed to the licensing arrangement in principle. They support the licensing arrangement. They did have some reservations about how the money should be spent.  We have written into the legislation very clearly that the licence revenue will be paid in at local level &mdash; not into the Exchequer &mdash; and used by the local fisheries authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities in the management, protection and development of inland fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much misrepresentation about the number of people who will be obliged to pay this <Col N="1446" /> licence.  We have exempted in the legislation persons up to the age of 18 years and persons over 65 years of age.  We have also made provision that the revenue will be spent at local level on the development and preservation of the resource.  The question that must be faced up to in a situation where the majority view of the people with responsibility in this area &mdash; the fisheries boards, the central fisheries authority and many of the responsible angling bodies in this country &mdash; recognise that the financing of the development of inland fisheries is a vital issue that has to be resolved.  Where State finances are limited and where our ability to direct more revenue into that area is limited, we have to seek alternative ways of funding the fisheries development programme.  We believe that the small amount which would be charged &mdash; £10 for a coarse licence, £15 for a trout rod licence and a short term holiday licence for £5 and £10 respectively for trout and coarse fishing &mdash; is a modest contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Swift</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the British gutter press which reacts so viciously and unjustifiably to matters Irish.  There seems to be a measure of agreement on this point.  If that is the case, should we ever respond to them by changing part of a tried and trusted system of justice?  In many areas of our law we have been steadily passing more responsibility to our district justices.  We have raised the monetary jurisdiction substantially in the District Courts in the past few years.  More importantly, we have given them jurisdiction over cases where formally they had none and people were obliged to go to the High Court or the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>One obvious example is in the area of family law where questions of custody and access to children are decided in the District Court.  This is a definite trend.  If a district justice can decide the fate of families in relation to who has custody of their children, why can that district justice not decide extradition applications as they have been satisfactorily doing for 20 years or more?  Some people say, or at least hint, that district justices might make mistakes in certain cases. I would like to remind the House that mistakes are made in many forums from time to time.  How many mistakes were made by senior British police officers and senior British superior court judges in the Birmingham Six case, the Guildford Four case and many other cases involving Irish people?  I would prefer to be before an Irish district justice than the entire House of Lords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The business of our law in this area is <Col N="1451" /> to administer justice.  Justice may well require the punishment of offenders. There is nothing wrong at any stage in giving consideration to present procedures as long as the object is to improve the quality of justice.  It should not be to please or appease the British establishment in any of its forms.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I wish to thank Deputy Swift for his generous agreement to share time with me.  There are few matters that are as frequently subjected to distortion particularly, as Deputy Swift has said, in the press of our neighbour and among parliamentarians from that country, than the vexed issue of extradition and its handling in this State.  The contribution of one Deputy opposite in this Chamber last night amounted to a semi-veiled attack on the Irish Judiciary.  The grotesquely exaggerated views that were put forward by that Deputy on the attitude of the Irish people towards the issue of extradition and towards the reality that lies behind <Col N="1452" /> it, the reality of violence, are all the more regrettable because they will be inevitably taken by the gutter press in Britain and by British parliamentarians at some stage in the future to whip us collectively about the head.  That speech last night was a regrettable one in that it was a lapse on the Deputy's&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Arrogance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrogance is something they brought into this Chamber.  On the issue of extradition, there is no doubt about where Dáil Éireann stands or where the Government stand.  The extradition legislation enacted by the Oireachtas a few months ago makes it clear that there is no wish amongst the democratically elected representatives of the people to allow our country to become a haven for terrorists or violence.  In the same legislation, the Oireachtas illustrated the desire to ensure that the rights of every Irish citizen are vindicated and subjected to prudent safeguards in the matter of extradition.  That is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" /> The Government's position is equally clear.  It was outlined in this House in a statement by the Taoiseach on 17 February, and I will precis some of that statement:</P>
    <P>Extradition is an issue about which there has been widespread and increasing concern in this country.  The major concerns have been that extradition should not be unreasonable or arbitrary and that a person who is extradited should get a fair trial in the requesting country.</P>
    <P>The Government introduced the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, to provide vital safeguards for our people in our extradition arrangements with Britain and Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach went on:</P>
    <P>I want to give this House a solemn assurance that the new Act passed by the Oireachtas in December last will be strictly adhered to and the safeguards provided for will be fully implemented...</P>
    <P>Extradition is a very important instrument in the fight against serious crime and international subversion. Extradition is also an inherent part of the international rule of law as it is applied between civilised and democratic States.</P>
    <P>It would not be a solution to anything to allow extradition to remain inoperative. The prudent, practical course is to have extradition but only to have it subject to reasonable and effective safeguards in the interests of Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>That view pertains on all sides of this House.</P>
    <P>I understand the <i>sub judice</i> ruling will prevent me dealing with the McVeigh case.  However, the Government's response to that issue and to its impact on extradition between Ireland and Great Britain, was set out in full in a statement in the House by the Minister for Justice on 14 June.  I agree with the views Deputy Swift was putting into the record at the close of his contribution, that a specific <Col N="1454" /> instance is a bad occasion on which we should rush into legislation.</P>
    <P>Extradition between Ireland and Great Britain did not start in 1987 or 1965, as some of the critics of the legislation would have us believe.  It has been a feature of relations between the two States since the second half of the last century. From the birth of the State until the sixties, UK warrants were simply backed in this country without any formality.  There are some people who would wish to return to that state of affairs.  I have to admit I am not one.</P>
    <P>The Quinn case in the early sixties changed matters considerably.  The automatic backing of warrants was ended by the Supreme Court ruling in that case. The Extradition Act, 1965, brought in a new order introducing the necessity to take extradition warrants from the United Kingdom before the courts.  The interesting point about the 1965 legislation is that it perceives the District Court as the court it chooses to bring the operation of the extradition system to in the first instance.  The interesting point about the 1965 legislation is that it followed very closely on a British precedent which sees the equivalent court &mdash; the court at Marleybone &mdash; as the appropriate court for the initiation of extradition proceedings.  I make this point about the British precedent because over the last few days I have heard a number of British parliamentarians &ldquo;tut, tut&rdquo; at the idea of extradition proceedings being initiated in our District Court.</P>
    <P>On the first point, I believe they have no reason for such reaction.  The District Court in general was perceived in Irish law as being the court initially in which extradition proceedings would be initiated and in virtually all cases there can be no faulting of the District Court handling of these matters.  The 1965 Act did reserve certain special occasions involving decisions where the nature of a case was in context to be brought to the High Court.  The generality of cases were, however, intended by the original 1965 legislation to be dealt with at District Court level &mdash; I emphasise at District Court level because we were following <Col N="1455" /> the British precedent.  From time to time we are criticised for so doing, but that is what we did on that occasion.  As contentious cases arose, almost inevitably because of claims that the offences in question were political in their nature, the political plea was put forward and in most serious cases the High Court became involved in appearances in the matter of the extradition warrants. Because of this, one could argue that bringing cases to the High Court has become the effective norm and that there was no major principle involved in introducing a requirement that all cases should originate at, perhaps, High Court level &mdash; and that is such a suggestion being made by an amendment here.</P>
    <P>The counter argument is that at present a major proportion of the cases on extradition are not contested.  It is extraordinary when one looks into this issue that many extradition cases for what we would call the ordinary, run-of-the-mill criminal cases, are not contested.  United Kingdom warrants tend to be accepted and there is no need to involve the High Court.  Forcing all cases to go to the High Court could involve a degree of incovenience and expense in the non-contested cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that if all cases were forced to go before the High Court, it would involve a degree of unnecessary expense, inconvenience and tying up the court time which is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is suggesting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy chooses to contest what I am saying, but I am only referring to what I have read into the record a few moments ago.  To contest every case before the High Court would hardly seem justified.  By doing so we could clutter up a court which from time to time has been criticised here and elsewhere because of the slow manner in <Col N="1456" /> which it deals with proceedings and because of the backlog of cases.</P>
      <P>The alternative would seem to be the Circuit Court.  There are some problems with the Circuit Court also.  The Circuit Court has a number of pronounced disadvantages. For example, it has a tradition of lengthy vacations, it may be wise that that tradition should be changed.  It tends to spend the bulk of its time on civil rather than on criminal matters.  For these, among other reasons, I suggest that we need to consider whether the Circuit Court is the more appropriate court to which to refer extradition warrants.</P>
      <P>On balance, I have no particularly strong view as to which court the extradition warrants should find themselves in in these issues which are to be contested. I share the confidence of the last speaker in all our courts.  They serve us well.  I would feel more confident as an Irishman before the most junior Irish court than I would before any of the courts of our closest neighbour.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, I hope any change in this matter will not be taken as reflection on the District Court.  I would like to take this occasion to rebut the accusations that have been made about a district justice recently.  I object in particular to arguments made about a District Court justice who was named and whose court was named in the British House of Commons.  It is wrong that this should have happened when the people who were arguing that case were not in possession of all the facts.  If I misread the speech Deputy Colley made last night or if I have misrespresented it here, I apologise for so doing.  When it has been drawn to my attention and I looked at it today I felt, as did many other Deputies, that Deputy Colley was joining those people who would seek to attack a section of the Irish Judiciary in this matter.  I accept Deputy Colley's statement that this was not her intent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. a. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 5, after &ldquo;may,&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" />&ldquo;having regard to the rights of non-smokers and smokers respectively,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While the Labour Party fully support the intention of this section, which would give powers to the Minister to make by way of regulation a prohibition or restriction on the consumption of tobacco products in designated areas and in certain facilities, one aspect we have given much consideration to is the plight of those who are addicted to smoking and who would literally despair if there was a blanket prohibition in all circumstances on the facilities listed in subsection (2). For instance, the prohibition in subsection (2) (a) could extend &mdash; obviously, this would be a matter for order &mdash; to a total prohibition of smoking on aircraft or trains.  It would be inconceivable for people who are addicted to smoking on aircraft or trains.  It would be inconceivable for people who are addicted to smoking to have an absolute blanket prohibition on smoking on a very long journey. Take, for example, a journey by train from Dublin to Killarney.  It would be impossible for someone who is addicted to smoking simply not to smoke for that length of time.  The choice open to them would be either to simply not use public transport or alternatively to break the law.  I believe that many people who are compulsive and addicted nicotinetakers would be driven to despair and would break the law in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>That was the motivation behind this amendment.  We tried to find a form of wording that would have the effect of allowing the Minister to make proper health regulations that would protect the common good and achieve a smoke-free environment for the majority who want it but which would put some obligation on the Minister to have regard at some stage to those in the community who are addicted to smoking so that some facility on long plane or train journeys would be provided for those people.  It is reasonable to have that provision in the Bill because many people who are smokers fear that their situation will be ignored <Col N="1462" /> completely and that a blanket prohibition will be brought into play once the regulations are published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I did not have an opportunity of giving my views on the Bill on Second Stage because I was out of Dublin at the time, I should like to say that I welcome the Bill almost <i>in toto</i> but with a number of reservations which I will outline tonight.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies I have been lobbied by groups over the past number of months with regard to the effects of this legislation and, in particular, the effect it will have on the tobacco industry, specifically in Dublin and Dundalk.  I have read many of the submissions that have come into this House, but they have not convinced me in any way that smoking does not endanger health, be it direct smoking or passive smoking.  Besides the health implications, there are also the economic considerations.  We import £50 million of tobacco leaf every year and we spend £500 million on tobacco.  The health and economic implications are major and the cost to the country as a whole is quite considerable.</P>
      <P>In relation to passive smoking, it has been proved conclusively to me that passive smoking is a danger to health and that many of the chemicals that are inhaled by passive smokers are as dangerous, if not more dangerous, than the chemicals that are inhaled by the mainstream smokers. American and European studies have proved that conclusively to my satisfaction. I am not going to bore the House by going through the figures which I have. Therefore, the question which arises in relation to this section is whether we legislate for everybody or whether we take into consideration the rights of smokers. I believe we have to achieve a balance and the amendment I have put forward strikes that balance so that we can cater for the percentage of people who are smokers in the areas outlined in the section.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with amendments <Col N="1463" /> Nos. a. 1 and 1 together.  While I appreciate the points made by Deputy Howlin and Deputy Allen, I do not propose to accept either amendment.  There are a number of reasons why I do not think it would be correct to accept these amendments.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill gives the Minister for Health a general power to prohibit or restrict smoking in designated areas or facilities.  Subsection (2) (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) simply highlight the specific public areas which I would regard as priority areas for the enactment of these controls.</P>
      <P>In his 1986 report on &ldquo;The Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking&rdquo;, the United States Surgeon General states:</P>
      <P>The scientific case against involuntary smoking as a health risk is more than sufficient to justify appropriate remedial action, and the goal of any remedial action must be to protect the non-smoker from environmental tobacco smoke.</P>
      <P>The goal of section 2 of this Bill is similar in that it is intended to protect the health of non-smokers.  Therefore, given this objective, I must, as Minister for Health, retain ultimate discretion to exercise my responsibility in protecting public health.</P>
      <P>In making regulations for the control of smoking in particular areas or facilities I will, of course, consult with all the interested parties.  Any legitimate concerns which are presented regarding such issues as safety will, of course, be considered when drafting the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical evidence indicates that the simple separation of smokers and non-smokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of non-smokers to environmental tobacco smoke.  Therefore, to ensure adequate protection in enclosed indoor areas for the majority of the non-smoking population, I will wish to be assured that effective segregation is possible before considering partial restrictions on smoking.  The detailed <Col N="1464" /> consultations to which I am committed in making these regulations will examine the potential for effective segregation in specific public areas or facilities and will provide a rational basis for the detailed provisions of the regulations.</P>
    <P>With regard specifically to public transport vehicles and trains referred to by both Deputy Allen and Deputy Howlin, I would again quote the examples of the DART and Dublin Bus to indicate how successfully total prohibitions on smoking can operate on short distance public transport.  In the case of long distance public transport, I would be prepared to consider partial prohibitions on smoking on the basis which I have already outlined. However, I must retain the general power to decide this issue on its merits at any given time and in view of the medical evidence that might prevail at any given time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>While I totally accept the thrust of the Minister's argument and in normal circumstances would fully accept the proposal in the Bill before us, to reassure those who are a significant minority now in the community who have to be encouraged and helped to give up smoking, a blanket prohibition in all circumstances is not the way to go about it. I fully accept that the Minister has no intention of having this type of blanket prohibition.  Thankfully, I am a non-smoker and I must say that I find it offensive to be in a confined space with smokers. Non-smokers have a right to expect a smoke-free environment and that is basically what the Bill is aiming at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, we must make some provision for smokers.  If the Minister is not willing to accept the amendments before him, at least he should give an assurance that people who are forced by circumstances to be confined for long periods in either a particular facility or a service vehicle would have their rights taken into account when the regulations are being formed.  It would be a little bit much to ask that somebody who was going to spend four or five hours in a train, or seven or eight hours in a trans-Atlantic jet, would have no opportunity in any <Col N="1465" /> circumstances to smoke.  That would be an unreasonable imposition to apply.  I am sure that the Minister does not intend that.</P>
    <P>The aim supported by all sides of this House, and strongly supported by the Labour Party, is to have a smoke-free environment for the majority who do not want to smoke and who should not have themselves assaulted as passive smokers by those who want to smoke.  Equally, there must be some balance.  The rights of the majority to have a smoke-free environment must be paramount, but there must be some balance in circumstances and on a very long journey or a long confinement the smoker should have some facility at his disposal.  That right to be considered is my objective in putting down the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise briefly to support the Minister and to indicate my total opposition to both amendments.  I am disappointed that these amendments have been put down.  It indicates that parties and persons proposing these amendments are not seriously committed to eliminating this health hazard from our environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Ban smoking, then.  That is our objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's approach in the Bill is very progressive and I fully support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Democratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is practically bordering on the criminal to allow smoking in aircraft and other confined spaces where the non-smoker becomes an involuntary smoker because of inhalation, despite the fact that he himself is not smoking.  The medical evidence is irrefutable that non-smokers in a smoky environment do suffer health damage.  I have practical reasons for believing that.  I know of people who suffer severe problems when caught in such an environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To argue a case here in favour of people who may be sitting in an airplane <Col N="1466" /> crossing the Atlantic for six hours, that it is unfair to deny them the opportunity of smoking for that length of time is wrong. I think we are doing them a great favour in providing a statutory prohibition on their smoking for that period.  It would be doing a serious injustice to the non-smokers to force them for those six hours to become involuntary smokers.</P>
    <P>This Bill is all about making decisions in this whole area and there has been a great deal of prevarication up to now. The medical evidence is so strong that it has motivated the Minister to bring forward this Bill.  Either we are committed to doing something positive or we continue with prevarication.  You cannot have it both ways.  Where people are caught as passengers in a confined space, smoking should be absolutely prohibited and we should move into that type of legislation now.  There have been people who have suffered because of lack of such legislation up to now.  I encourage the Minister to continue his resistance to these two amendments and to adopt a very firm line.  He has my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole principle of total prohibition in any sphere leads to law breaking by even the most respectable citizens.  I submit, with all due respect to Deputy Molloy, that anybody crossing the Atlantic in a total smoke-free area will go to the toilet area and smoke there, breaking the law.  I think that we learned, as far back as Chicago in the thirties, that total prohibition does not work.  Suddenly to deny 20 or 30 per cent of the population who are now smoking the right to smoke is unwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have supported our rod licence Bill if he wished to follow that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are going to have a reasonable debate here tonight to finish at a reasonable time, let us stick to the subject before us.  A surprise omission in this Bill &mdash; I did not have an opportunity to speak on Second Stage &mdash; is the whole <Col N="1467" /> question of restaurants.  This Bill does not deal with no smoking areas there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister clarify that point?  Total prohibition does not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really the nub of the Bill.  It has created much concern.  I represent a constituency in which several hundred people are employed in the tobacco industry.  Nobody there would say that cigarettes are good for your health and the trade unions involved have been endeavouring to try to encourage Carrolls, for example, to set up an alternative industry so that employment can be made secure for these people.  The situation in Dundalk is bad enough, with the highest level of unemployment in the country.  That must be recognised.  It may not be directly connected with health in the sense of smoking but it is a matter of great concern to people in Dundalk.  The point has been made very clearly by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, that we are not suggesting there should not be restrictions on smoking in certain circumstances. The best example you can get of a reasonable compromise is in this Chamber where smoking is never allowed.  However, a smoking room is provided where Members can have a cigarette.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alcohol is also a big killer but no one has suggested that we should close all the pubs and breweries.  That was tried in America many years ago but it did not succeed.  Banning smoking will not succeed either and there must be some compromise.  For some people, the right to smoke is very important and it can help in alleviating nervous complaints. Many psychiatric units would have more patients if people could not smoke.  There must be a balance and I am glad the Minister indicated that when the regulations are being considered there will be consultation with interested parties, public transport companies and so on and that some consideration will be given to <Col N="1468" /> that.  The same situation should apply in public buildings.  This is a public building but if the Minister issued a regulation that smoking would be banned in Leinster House I wonder how many Deputies in all parties would agree to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in section 2(1) to deal with restaurants. Deputy Bell made an interesting point when he drew the analogy with public houses.  This important legislation is a response to public opinion as two-thirds of the public want a smoke-free atmosphere, including people who smoke.  On the question of the regulations, we will consult the various interested parties.  We need balance but a Minister for Health must ensure that the health of the people is protected.  Circumstances may vary as more and more evidence becomes available. Tobacco smoking is more and more incriminated and one does not know what the circumstances may be in five or ten years' time.  The legislation allows for the prohibition or the restriction on use of tobacco products.  In that context, when the regulations are being drawn up they will have regard to the various issues raised.  For example, in the United States, cigarette smoking is banned on all short haul flights although on long distance flights smoking is allowed in certain areas.  The only consideration in drawing up the regulations will be public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to restate the consensus that emerged on Second Stage of the Bill from all parties, our desire to create a smoke-free community and environment for all our people.  That has never been at issue and we are now discussing the best method of achieving that objective.  While the Minister has the enthusiastic support of the Labour Party to achieve a smoke-free environment and while the Labour Party holds as a fundamental principle the right of every individual to have a smoke-free environment, if he or she so chooses, the point in the amendment is that on the way to achieving that perfect solution a couple of steps must be taken.  We <Col N="1469" /> cannot, at a stroke, decide that one third of the population who are currently addicted to smoking do not exist and do not have any rights and that the rights of the majority in all circumstances must be the only ones taken into account.  We know that the rule of the simple majority is not always the best.</P>
      <P>To achieve the desired objective, shared by all parties in the House, consideration must be shown to the minority who smoke.  They should be encouraged, helped and cajoled to give up smoking and given tax incentives to give up the foul practice but until 95 per cent of the population do not smoke some provision must be made for those who are addicted. If, as Deputy Molloy would have us believe, we will achieve the ideal solution of a non-smoking environment instantly, then we would not have this Bill before us, we would have a tobacco banning Bill, a legislative measure to ban cigarette production, smoking and sale.  We have not decided to go about it in that way; we must achieve the consensus desired in a reasonable way.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments that he will take on board miniority rights in regard to smoking while holding the fundamental principle of the health of the majority, which is his responsibility as Minister for Health.  For those reasons, I will not be pressing my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Howlin does not have the right to misinterpret what I said, which was that there should be a total ban on smoking where people were travelling in confined spaces and that, because of the now proven danger to people's health from involuntary smoking, it was time for us to make the decision not to allow smoking in places such as aeroplanes.  Any concerned medical consultant will support that point of view and any concerned person who is anxious to improve the general health of the community will also support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the proven damage to a person's health from involuntary smoking, it is now intolerable that people should be subjected to it.  This largely applies to people travelling in a confined <Col N="1470" /> space such as an aeroplane, the only case I mentioned.  The Minister's Bill refers to trains, public service vehicles or other facilities.  In aircraft, where substantially large numbers of people are confined to a very small area, smoking should be banned.  I did not advocate the total banning of tobacco smoking and Deputy Howlin did his own case an injustice by misquoting me.  His amendment seeks to water down the Bill and I hope he will not press it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 18, to delete &ldquo;, offers to sell or makes available,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or offers to sell&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Stage of the Bill I indicated that I found a certain incongruity in the phrasing of this section and I undertook to provide an amendment on this Stage, until the Minister clarified the intention.  Indeed, a member of the Minister's party commenting in the debate indicated that he regarded the wording here as being very loose.  The point at issue in section 4 is that any person who sells, offers to sell or make available cigarettes to a person other than in packets of ten will be liable to summary conviction and to a fine not exceeding £500. The intention is to protect children from being offered loose cigarettes and it is a laudable intention which I fully support. However, the implication of the section <Col N="1471" /> as drafted is that anybody who offers a cigarette to a friend is in breach of the law because to offer a cigarette is to make a cigarette available in a unit of less than ten.  My amendment seeks to delete &ldquo;makes available&rdquo; and simply confine it to &ldquo;offers to sell&rdquo; which would achieve the objective of the Minister, which is to prohibit the sale of loose cigarettes which is unanimously accepted as being an undesirable practice, one that introduces young children with limited spending money to the evils of tobacco.  My amendment would achieve that end but it would not criminalise every individual who offers a cigarette to a friend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment ensures that an individual offering a cigarette to a friend will not become a criminal in breach of the law.  My amendment sets out to eliminate the practice where shops on street corners near schools make cigarettes available in ones and twos.  I support the idea behind the section.  My amendment also sets out to eliminate the practice of offering a cigarette along with some other items in a shop, and it should be accepted as it achieves the Minister's objective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <P>The amendments proposed by Deputy Howlin and Deputy Allen reflect the concern that section 4 as drafted would extend to the making available of cigarettes, for example, within the privacy of a family home or at a private function.  This was not the intention of the section.  The section was intended to prohibit the making available of cigarettes singly or in packets of less than ten in conjunction with the sale of another product such as sweets.  This provision is primarily intended to extend the protections within the Bill in relation to the supply of cigarettes to young people. While I accept the concern expressed by Deputy Howlin with regard to the wording of the section his amendment would not be an adequate safeguard against the indirect sale and supply of tobacco to young people.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Allen ensures that the indirect <Col N="1472" /> sale or supply of cigarettes will be prohibited under section 4 of the Bill and I intend to accept Deputy Allen's amendment No. 3.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), lines 7 and 8, to delete &ldquo;an oral smokeless tobacco product&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;goods described in subsection (2) of this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks simply to delete &ldquo;an oral smokeless tobacco product&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;goods described in subsection (2) of this section&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 5 is a substitution for subsection (2), to substituted:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> (2)  The goods to which this section applies are products or substances, made wholly or partly from tobacco, consisting of fine cut, ground, or particulate matter prepared, sold or advertised for oral use in unlit form</P>
    <P>but excluding any chewing tobacco within the meaning of the Finance (Excise Duty on Tobacco Products) Act, 1977.  The purpose of these two amendments is to address a matter I raised on Second Stage.  I understand that the objective of the Minister in section 6 is the laudable objective of outlawing the product known as Skoal Bandits and sister products that are carcinogenic, unhealthy, unwholesome and undesirable.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Desmond, tried some years ago to have a prohibition on these products by using existing legislation which was found eventually to be <i>ultra vires</i> and struck down.  The World Health Organisation have regarded these products as being unsafe.  During the course of my Second Stage speech I quoted extensively from a variety of sources, from the World Health Organisation, to the <i>British Dental Journal</i>, to <i>Lancet</i>, quoting the evidence that these products were dangerous and should be banned.  I am in total accord with the Minister's objective.</P>
    <P>I seek in these two amendments to protect chewing tobacco from the rigours of the law in this regard.  There are a number of senior citizens in our community who have had the practice for many decades now, of chewing tobacco and it would be difficult for them to accommodate themselves to a blanket ban on chewing tobacco at this stage of their lives.  I seek to protect chewing tobacco from the full rigours of the law that would apply once this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I had some difficulty in wording a suitable amendment to include the variety of oral tobacco products while at the same time protecting chewing tobacco.  I referred to the Finance (Excise Duty on Tobacco Products) Act, 1977, because that is the first time that chewing tobacco is specifically mentioned in legislation, in the Second Schedule to that Act.  The <Col N="1474" /> definition is broadened in Statutory Instrument No. 296 of 1979.  Chewing tobacco is clearly defined in section 5 (2), where the term &ldquo;chewing tobacco&rdquo; is specifically recognised in legislation in detailed form for the first time.  Under Statutory Instrument 296 of 1979 chewing tobacco means tobacco in the form of rolls, sticks, strips, cubes or blocks, put up for retail sale and specially prepared to be chewed but not smoked.  I understand that that definition is also included in a European directive.</P>
    <P>In summary, the import of the amendments which I have summarised are to support in total the ambition of the Minister to outlaw Skoal Bandits, sister and related products, that are proven to be carcinogenic and totally undesirable, but to allow at the same time some avenue of light for the tiny minority in our community who use chewing tobacco.  I hope the Minister will achieve his objective while protecting the rights of a small number of people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I put forward my amendment bearing in mind also the rights of the individual who still uses chewing tobacco. For that reason, I put down this amendment but having heard the evidence tonight of the different forms of chewing tobacco which are available and having heard the other evidence available to others outside the House, I feel that by pressing my amendment I would be making the legislation ineffective and would be opening the door to companies who would bring in different variations of chewing tobacco.  It would make the present legislation very difficult.  I have been made aware of the different types of products now available, both in the United States and in Europe, ranging from chewing tobacco to Skoal Bandits and chocolate bars with nicotine as a constituent and there is even a toothpaste with a nicotine constituent.  Because of all the new products which are being introduced I think that pressing my amendment would be wrong and would <Col N="1475" /> open the door for these types of products and would allow them on to the Irish market.  For that reason I will not be pressing my amendment.  I realise also that 3 per cent of Carrolls hard tobacco products is chewing tobacco.  More and more elderly people are now chewing ordinary hard plug tobacco.  When I take all this into consideration I believe there is no point in pressing my amendment.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Howlin, has outlined the position.  Naturally we would be supporting not only the aims of the Minister in this regard but also those of our colleague, the former Minister for Health.  Carrolls, in Dundalk, have made chewing tobacco or pipe tobacco since the company was formed. I do not think it was the Minister's intention effectively to eliminate the production of that type of tobacco which is enjoyed mainly by a very small minority of elderly people.  Very few of the younger generation would chew the traditional plug or hard tobacco.  I do not think that was the intention.  We support the aim in section 6.  We would ask that it be put on the record that it is not the intention to virtually eliminate the manufacturing of the old pipe or chewing tobacco as manufactured in Dundalk for a century or more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years a wide variety of smokeless tobacco products have been developed and promoted in North America, Scandinavia and more recently within the European Community. These products are being promoted to young people as an alternative way to enjoy tobacco and it is estimated by the World Health Organisation that about 10 million people, mostly teenagers, in the United States of America are now using these products.  These products cause serious health problems. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, an agency of the World Health Organisation, have determined <Col N="1476" /> that there is sufficient evidence that these products cause oral cancer.  The use of these products also causes serious dental damage.  Continual use can cause white patches, known as leukoplakia, to appear on the gums.  Some of these white patches may subsequently become cancerous. The use of these products can also cause dental damage due to a receding of the gums where the tobacco regularly comes in contact with the mouth.  In June 1987 a World Health Organisation study group on smokeless tobacco control recommended a &ldquo;pre-emptive&rdquo; total ban on the importation, production and sale of all types of smokeless tobacco.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health, I am deeply concerned at the potential availability in this country of the type of chewing tobaccos which are being promoted in other countries and directed at young people as safe alternatives to smoking.  The scientific and medical evidence relating to the range of oral smokeless tobaccos, including chewing tobaccos, is such that it would be remiss of me as Minister for Health not to provide comprehensive legislation protecting the public against these products.  To exempt any specific oral smokeless tobacco could not be justified on health grounds and an exemption of a specific class of an oral smokeless product would leave the legislation wide open for exploitation.  Given the current developments by the tobacco industry internationally of new forms of tobacco consumption I have no doubt that any gaps in the law would encourage the development and promotion of the products exempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The range and variety of oral smokeless tobacco products now being promoted is remarkable and is evidence of how the industry is trying to diversify the ways in which tobacco is marketed.  There are varieties of solid chewing tobaccos and finely cut tobaccos which are either loose or in tea-bag sachets such as the Skoal Bandits, intended to be placed in the mouth and sucked or chewed, powdered moist tobacco products for sucking <Col N="1477" /> and even toothpastes and confectionery products containing tobacco.</P>
    <P>Because of the serious health risks posed by these addictive carcinogenic products and because it is likely that their promotion would result in a new generation of tobacco users at the very time when tobacco smoking is being discouraged the Government decided that the full range of oral smokeless tobacco products should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>The Deputies' amendments seek to exempt two types of tobacco products from the controls proposed in the Bill. The first of these is solid chewing tobacco which Deputy Howlin wished to have exempted from this Bill.  The point made by Deputy Allen is correct, that of the hard pressed tobaccos manufactured by Carrolls only 3 per cent of them consist of a special chewing roll.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Bell's concern, I want to assure the House that there is no intention of banning the sale of pipe tobacco or the ordinary plug tobacco to which he referred.  The second product which Deputy Allen wishes to have exempted from the provisions of the Bill is nasal snuff.  I should say that nasal snuff is not affected at all by the provisions of section 6.  The International Agency for Research on Cancer found that there was inadequate evidence that the nasal use of snuff is carcinogenic and it is specifically exempted from the definition of an oral smokeless tobacco product set out in section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to take on board much of what the Minister has said.  I would in no way seek to leave any avenue open for exploitation.  I fully acknowledge that there is a thriving commercial market out there which would probably seek to push a coach and four through any chink in this Bill.  For that reason I must be aware and cognisant of the cogent case made by the Minister.  He has answered the points raised in my amendment, and raised more particularly in my Second Stage contribution, that it <Col N="1478" /> is not the intention of the Minister or it is not a consequence of this section to outlaw plug tobacco or pipe tobacco which is freely available and which is chewed by a tiny number of people.  Once the assurance has been given that the rights of those people will be taken into consideration I am reluctant to push my amendment particularly if it will result, as the Minister indicated, in a chink being left in the Bill to allow the large commercial companies that exist in Scandinavia and the United States introduce into the Irish market products we all recognise to be carcinogenic.  For that reason, I accept the Minister's assurance.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash;Every regulation under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made for ratification.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given assurances in regard to future regulations and I do not doubt his word, but the Dáil should have some control over any regulations introduced. Therefore, I am proposing that every regulation made under this Bill should be laid before the Dáil for ratification as soon as they are made.  The Dáil should be able to monitor any regulations that are introduced.  There are sensitive issues involved in this legislation and, while I do not doubt the Minister's word in regard to the regulations, the House should have some control over their introduction.</P>

      <P>The normal procedure in regard to a Bill of this type is that the regulations are laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made.  If a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which the House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.  The effect of the amendment would be to introduce a totally new concept in legislation of this kind and would be a general policy issue.  I do not think it is appropriate to introduce it in this legislation.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister has said in regard to the amendment having policy implications.  However, all Members feel aggrieved that so much legislation is introduced by way of statutory instrument.  Indeed, an Oireachtas Joint Committee which tried to monitor statutory instruments over a period of time came to the conclusion that a huge proportion of the rules, regulations and laws that govern the lives of our people are introduced by way of statutory instrument. I support the concept that regulations should have the positive approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas rather than being automatically approved unless annulled by way of motion.</P>
      <P>In the ordinary course of events many regulations come into force without the knowledge of the majority of Members of this or the other House.  We must address this principle and try to find some way of dealing with it.  It may not be possible to have every regulation brought before the House but there should be some way of monitoring regulations and statutory instruments so that there can be some democratic veto by the elected assemblies over these matters.</P>

      <P>I concur with most of what has been said by Deputy Howlin.  I do not support the amendment but I agree <Col N="1480" /> with the concern expressed in it.  As far as I am concerned, the intention of the Bill is clear and it should be the prerogative of the Minister to make regulations as he sees fit.  However, a difficulty arises because of a lack of procedures under which Members are adequately informed about the regulations that are made.  As Deputy Howlin said, a huge volume of regulations are being introduced. It is the method under which most legislative action is taken by the Government, but Members of the House are not adequately informed of them.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to give an indication if he and the Government will introduce a system under which Members will be informed of regulations and are given an Explanatory Memorandum. It is often the case that the notification received does not clearly indicate the intention of the regulation. That is where communications fall down. Rather than supporting Deputy Allen's amendment, which is most restrictive and would limit the Minister's ability to make regulations &mdash; we are all aware of the difficulty involved in bringing legislation before the House &mdash; we should introduce a new arrangement to improve the method of communication in regard to regulations that are made.  They should be explained in an Explanatory Memorandum. If it set out what is proposed and the reason for the regulation, it would meet the need adequately.  I do not see the need for the amendment but I support the intention behind it.</P>

      <P>The powers of the House are being eroded and have been over a period of time.  We will have regulations introduced shortly in relation to food, but the House should have a right to assess it before it is made.  I will be dealing with some of the decisions by the Minister that require amending legislation in the course of the debate on the Health Estimate tomorrow.  We are becoming careless and somewhat slip-shod in our approach to regulations and legislation. <Col N="1481" /> Advisory committees on health boards have been abolished and, while I am not agreeing or disagreeing with that decision, it is important to point out that amending legislation is required to implement that proposal; but it has not being brought before the House.</P>

      <P>Section 2(2) gives a general indication of the broad spectrum within which the regulations will be made.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>(2)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, regulations under this section may do all or any of the following:</P>
      <P>(a)  prohibit or restrict the consumption of tobacco products in such aircraft, train, public service vehicle or other facility as may be specified;</P>
      <P>(b)  prohibit or restrict the consumption of tobacco products in such part of a health premises as may be specified;</P>
      <P>(c)  prohibit or restrict the consumption of tobacco products in such part of a school, as may be specified;</P>

    <P>(e)  prohibit or restrict the consumption of tobacco products in a cinema, theatre, concert hall or in such other place of indoor public entertainment as may be specified.</P>
    <P>As I have said, that is a broad outline of the type of areas for which regulations will be made.  As the Deputies know, the legislation has still to be debated in the Upper House.  Following the passage of the legislation through both Houses and the signature by the President it is my intention that there would be no delay in the enactment of the legislation.  As the Deputies know, next year is European Year against Cancer and we would certainly wish to have this legislation and the regulations on the Statute Book long before the beginning of that year.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is not very informative.  He just indicated to the House what his powers will be and we understand that.  What will the Minister's intention be when the Act is in place? Has he done preparatory work?  Does he intend to introduce regulations immediately to prohibit smoking in aircraft, in supermarkets and in cinemas?  Can he not give the House some clear indication as to his own thinking?  After all, he brought in this Bill.  I accept that his intention is to act and not to let the Bill lie on the shelf.  Surely the Minister has some idea of the type of regulation that he will bring in.  I am only asking what are they and when will they be brought in.  Bills have been introduced and Ministers have been given power to do certain things under regulation, but they have not always acted.  This is the only opportunity we have of hearing what the current Minister <Col N="1483" /> for Health's intention is.  I applaud him for bringing forward the Bill but it is absolutely essential for us to know what his intention is in regard to his use of these powers, when he intends to introduce regulations and what areas they are to cover.</P>

      <P>I wish to tease out the matter further.  This is the most crucial aspect of the entire legislation before us. Section 2 which the Minister has read out to us is the enabling power to the Minister to make regulations.  If we are simply going to be a body which hands over powers and then washes our hands of it, we will not be told the Minister's intention. On Second Stage many Deputies in this House said that a very comprehensive list of enabling powers are included in the Bill, but what are the Minister's intentions?  In relation to the Minister's power to either prohibit or restrict the consumption of tobacco products on aircraft, has he given any consideration to how he will use that power should it be enacted?  For instance, will he restrict smoking on flights below a certain duration, will it be prohibited on flights of less than one hour or will there be some prohibition on flights of more than an hour?  Has the Minister thought out his views on these matters?  We should be given some indication of his thoughts at this stage.  That is the real meat of the powers that this House is now being asked to devolve to the Minister.</P>

The Bill means nothing until the Minister brings in regulations.  The Minister has given us a brief glimpse of his intentions in relation to transport.  Can we ask similarly what are his intentions in relation to section (2) (e) of the Bill in regard to cinemas, theatres, concert halls or other such places of indoor public entertainment?

      <P>Firstly, I will deal with the point raised by Deputy Molloy about my reference to the United States and what happens there.  I was just drawing his attention to the fact that I had referred to short haul and long haul flights within the United States.  Of course the same criteria would not apply in Ireland because we do not have long haul flights within the State.  Obviously no Minister could draw up regulations for a Bill until it is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and until the Members of both Houses have decided what they wish to see in the legislation.  It is my intention to look at that question.  Some of the Deputies were concerned about long distance trains.  I have to take account of what the Deputies have said when I am drawing up the regulations and see how we can reconcile all the various views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the consumption of tobacco products in health premises, my initial inclination is that they should be banned.  On the question raised by Deputy Howlin about various indoor places of entertainment my initial inclination is that cigarette smoking should be banned in cinemas.  Until such time as the legislation has passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas, I do not think <Col N="1486" /> any Minister could be expected to say exactly what the regulations would be.</P>

      <P>May I warmly congratulate the Minister on the enactment of this specially important public health legislation to protect public health in a singular way.  In the years ahead, the Minister may reflect that this was the most important measure enacted by him during his period in office.  I want to stress that we have had cross party support in the enactment of those measures over the past ten years, since the then Minister for Health, Deputy Haughey, introduced the first extremely important Act in 1978. But it has been a hard ten years.  It has been a very difficult series of regulations arising from the 1978 Act.  It has, and will, be seen as a decade of very major advance.  The potential threat of the AIDS virus is horrific, but the actual damage caused day in and day out from the universal epidemic of smoking is infinitely greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cigarette smoking is still the single largest preventable cause of illness in this country and throughout the western world.  Even while we talk, some 17,000 deaths this year, or almost half of all the deaths in the country, will be directly attributable to diseases associated with smoking.  About one in eight regular smokers die from tobacco and related coronary diseases.  One in 15 regular smokers die from bronchitis and emphesyma.  One in ten die from lung cancer as a direct result of smoking. These frightening statistics should have a <Col N="1487" /> great impact particularly on young women of child-bearing age, especially when they see the havoc smoking causes to themselves and their children.  There is no need for me to go any further into this sad reality.  With the Minister I appeal to young people who are smoking to realise the extraordinary danger they are in and to stop smoking.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government on their persistence over the past 15 months in bringing forward this legislation.  I am particularly delighted that the Skoal Bandits have been covered in the legislation because I had enormous difficulty trying to find an effective statutory framework to prevent that dreadful product being imported, manufactured and distributed within the Republic.  We are unique in Europe in that regard.  I do not want to cavil on a party political basis, but despite my reservations &mdash; and the Minister knows they were considerable &mdash; about the abolition of the Health Education Bureau, his health promotion unit within the framework of the Department of Health will devote considerable attention to maintaining the enormous impetus of the Health Education Bureau in dealing with public health education on smoking.  I urge the Minister to work very hard in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will take it in the proper spirit when I thank two and many more public servants who have been involved in this area.  An assistant secretary in the Department retired a couple of months ago, Dr. Joe Robins. He campaigned within the public health framework unceasingly during his life-time to bring about those changes.  He worked with a succession of Ministers, from the then Minister for Health, Deputy Haughey, in 1978 up to 1988 to bring about that fundamental change.  I also want to thank the current secretary who in 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 &mdash; but particularly in 1985 and 1986 &mdash; had to face the combined opposition of the <Col N="1488" /> tobacco companies and many other influences, particularly some newspaper companies, which campaigned in every conceivable way against this legislation &mdash; politically, from the point of view of industry, and so on.  There were no holds barred.  I would hate to disclose some of the efforts made to prevent the regulations being brought in and the legislation being enacted.  I am delighted that the former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, stood up to those blandishments. The present Taoiseach has also stood up to the pressures and we are bringing in quite exceptional and historic legislation this evening.</P>
    <P>I attended last week a conference on allied health professions in Copenhagen. The Irish legislation of 1978, the regulations of 1986 and this Bill, which was available to the conference, were regarded as an historic breakthrough within the European Community.  It is now regarded as a model by the Commissioner in charge of public health.  Arising out of that development there is to be organised the first European health conference on tobacco policy in Madrid next November.  Ireland features there with a huge plus and I am delighted the Minister has nominated a number of delegates to attend.</P>
    <P>The legislation is of enormous importance. It is a benchmark of which the Dáil can be justifiably proud.  I congratulate the Minister and his colleagues in Government for the work they have done and I urge that we should not stop there. Licensed premises, places of work and third level colleges do not come within the framework of this Bill but they can be included in due course.  The horror which has been visited on many families and on ourselves and our parties by this addiction can be mitigated and removed as a matter of public health in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>It would be very remiss of me not to put on the record the very considerable economic and social responsibility displayed by the tobacco companies in <Col N="1489" /> their negotiations with the Minister and previously with me, notably P.J. Carroll and Company.  The marketing director of that company is a man of outstanding economic and marketing expertise and he has striven to diversify the company's role.  In tandem with this legislation we can try to ensure the maintenance of employment in other fields.  The company has been singularly successful in that endeavour.  I am pleased to put on record the co-operation I received from the managing director and the marketing director of that company.</P>

      <P>I should like to be associated with the remarks made by Deputy Desmond.  As one who has been a Member of this House for the same length of time as Deputy Desmond, I think it would be appropriate to include somebody with whom I have not always agreed.  Dr. Noel Browne was one of the first Deputies to seek legislation in this area.  I recollect that his was a lone voice when calling for warning notices on cigarettes packets.  I attended debates many years ago when he was not in receipt of much support in that regard but eventually it came about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Members of this House have come a long way in their approach to this problem. We spend £1.3 billion on treating sick people and it is clear that much of that expenditure would not be necessary if we had been more enlightened in adopting preventive medicine at an earlier stage.  This measure is very much in the area of prevention.  All we are doing is giving the Minister power, and we must hope that he will avail of this power.  It is unique that there is agreement across the board on the proposals in the Bill.  This indicates a willingness on the part of Deputies to support tough measures in the interests of the better health of the nation.  We hope to see the Minister bring forward other enlightened legislation in the area of preventive medicine where he consideres it necessary.  Lung cancer is, unfortunately, very prevalent here and <Col N="1490" /> medical evidence supports the view that 83 per cent of the lung cancers in Ireland are caused by smoking.  A person who smokes more than 25 cigarettes per day is more likely to die of bronchitis than a non-smoker and 50 times more likely to be admitted to hospital.  Our hospital costs have contributed much to our financial difficulties.  The economic benefit which could be achieved by a massive reduction in cigarette smoking is another motivation for promoting its reduction.</P>
    <P>The Minister must enter immediately upon a vigorous campaign to encourage young people not to take up this habit and to discourage those who have already begun to smoke.  Young girls make up an increasing percentage of smokers while the elderly and middle aged have been giving up smoking.  Short campaigns are effective but not in the long term.  The Minister's campaign must be sustained in a continuing effort to educate young people in regard to the dangers of smoking. We spend £40 million importing tobacco and we spend £400 million on tobacco products.  Just think what we could do if that money were available for capital investment.</P>

I would like to join with other Deputies &mdash; and we rarely have <Col N="1491" /> an opportunity of doing this &mdash; in congratulating the Minister on the progressive legislation he has brought in tonight.  With reference to the legislation itself, we are too often accused in Leinster House of leading from behind.  This is an occasion where we have the opportunity of leading Irish society with legislation that is probably in advance of the average person's understanding or perception of the seriousness of the problem. To that extent it is important that it be backed up with continued consultation on health promotion and with the fullest use of the powers which the Minister is taking on board tonight.  I would like the Minister to know that I share the views expressed on all sides of the House in relation to this Bill and support him in the application of the powers which the House is unanimously giving him tonight.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to make a Second Stage speech; I did that some time ago.  I want simply to add my congratulations to the Minister on bringing in this legislation because I am aware that it was not an easy piece of legislation to bring in.  My colleague, Deputy Barry Desmond, was quite generous in his praise for a number of individuals and he singled out many individuals in the Department and the present Minister. However, one person his modesty did not allow him to include in his generous congratulations was Deputy Barry Desmond himself, a man who brought in a number of imaginative pieces of legislation in his four and a half years in the Department of Health, including the environmentally positive as well as the health positive measure of banning the advertising of tobacco products, advertising that seemed to festoon every corner shop in our nation.  A tribute to the tremendous pioneering work and tremendous resilience of an excellent Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, should also be on the record of this House.</P>

I would urge the Minister to get it through the Seanad and into law as soon as possible because a day lost is a life lost where this type of legislation is concerned.  One frightening statistic I saw recently from one consultant in one of our major hospitals was that one-third of the patients in that hospital were in there because of cigarette related diseases. That brings home very forcefully the whole relevance of this legislation.</P>

As Deputy Desmond pointed out, the Taoiseach was the first Minister to introduce legislation to control tobacco advertising ten years ago, and Deputy Desmond himself introduced regulations in 1986 and had a major input into the preparation of this legislation. When drawing up the regulations we want to ensure that public health will not be compromised and that public health considerations will predominate.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject of accommodation at Gaelscoil Míde, Baldoyle, County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important and pressing issue and to thank the Minister for finding the time to listen to what I have to say on behalf of the parents and pupils of that very impressive but hard-pressed school.  As <Col N="1493" /> I indicated when I raised the matter, I propose to share my time with Deputy Michael Joe Cosgrave.</P>
      <P>The history of Gaelscoil Míde must be briefly referred to in order to illustrate the urgency and strength of the issues surrounding it.  It started in 1981 with 16 pupils and one teacher.  It was facilitated initially with a cabin premises in the grounds of the Church of Ireland school in Raheny.  Within a very short period of time that was fire damaged by accident and the school was obliged to move on to nearby premises in the newly constructed St. Vincents GAA club, also in Raheny, where, with the kind permission of the club, they occupied the committee room there for two years.  Because of their growing numbers they moved on again in 1982 to Baldoyle, their present location, initially occupying three rooms in the premises with three classes of 30 pupils serviced by two teachers.  They started off upstairs in the community hall, again by permission of the community association. In time they were obliged to move on to the stage of the meeting hall in the community premises which was cordoned off and made available to them for classroom purposes.</P>
      <P>The school continued to grow and in 1983 moved in part across the road to the convent and there, again by kind permission of the Sisters of Charity, they were afforded the use of a room.  A second room was given to them in 1985. Each year as they grew demands for space also grew.  Through their own efforts and negotiations and the goodwill of everyone concerned they managed to accommodate themselves.  Everyone who comes in contact with that school has nothing but goodwill for them and I know that extends as far as the Minister and the Department.  Now they have taken up a prefabricated building across the road in a third location where another class was located, this time on ground belonging to the nuns, and one year later into a second prefabricated building close by in grounds belonging to the parish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> At the end of their brief seven year history they are in multiple locations and have approximately three landlords, all of whom are treating them well but giving them very limited and inadequate facilities for their needs.  In September they will expect 32 to 33 extra pupils, uniquely for primary schools throughout our constituency &mdash; it is a school that is growing while others, because of population trends, are decreasing.  Gaelscoil Míde is increasing and will rapidly increase to a doubling if not a trebling of their numbers within a very short period of time once adequate and fair conditions are found for them.</P>
    <P>This school is recognised by the Department, is funded by the Department and the Department pay for facilities as best they can.  Nevertheless, the school does not measure up to the regulations of the Department in terms of space for pupils; it can only provide something over one square metre per pupil, whereas I understand the regulations require two square metres per pupil.  This is a serious problem which must be addressed without delay.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is the question of transport. Each parent pays £12 per month per pupil to be bussed to their location in Baldoyle which is not in the catchment area of the school.  A family with more than one pupil pays £20 per month for their own transport which they have been providing from their own resources since the inception of the school.  This is obviously a pressing issue at the moment.</P>
    <P>All of the parents of this school and all fhíor Gaelscoileanna look to the basic document of our country, the Constitution, in particular Article 8, which states that the Irish language is the first official language of the State, but I believe that Article 42 is of even more significance from their point of view. Under Article 42.1 the State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the family and it guarantees to respect that right.  The parents of all of these pupils have elected, <Col N="1495" /> as is their right under Article 42.3 of the Constitution, to send their children to a particular school and they should not be hindered in any way and under Article 42.3.2º the Constitution outlines that one of the factors which should be considered is the actual conditions of schooling.  I am sure the Article which has been quoted to the Minister most often is Article 42.4 which states that the State shall provide for free primary education.</P>
    <P>I believe that the State is failing the parents and pupils of Gaelscoil Míde in respect of each of those provisions.  If we take into account the contribution which the parents must make in respect of transport costs and other charges to maintain the premises, their right to free education does not exist.  Their preference for a fíor Gaelscoil and teaching facility is not being respected.  This is a facility that the Department like to promote and want to promote but the big question which faces me as a Deputy and as a representative of the area and all others concerned, is why does Gaelscoil Míde have to wait so long for a positive response from the Department?</P>
    <P>The number of parents who have come here tonight to listen to what the Minister has to say to them, within a few short hours of being notified that we had the opportunity to discuss this matter on the floor of the House, is a reflection of the great spirit which exists, a spirit which was referred to in the correspondence which I, along with Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Cosgrave, who are present in the House, received and this must be responded to in a very positive way.  I hope the Minister will be able to say something positive to them in that respect tonight.</P>
    <P>What needs to be done?  Obviously a single location is required for the school within the heart of its catchment area in Donaghmede.  There are premises available but they will not become available for perhaps another five years.  There is an urgent need for an interim solution. <Col N="1496" /> The school is seeking a single location and they say anywhere within reason. They are looking to the Minister to provide free transport for their pupils getting to and from wherever they are accommodated in the coming year.  They cannot be expected to provide a fifth part to the school in the Baldoyle area in an effort to meet growing numbers.  They want to meet with the Minister and I hope the Minister will be able to meet with them because I cannot convey to her the enthusiasm and spirit of the parents. They can only do that themselves, along with their board of management and teachers.  I ask the Minister to meet with them at her earliest convenience to discuss their cause.</P>
    <P>There are premises available in the immediate area but one of the remarkable facets of the educational system which has to be addressed some day is that the Department provide funds for the building of schools and the payment of staff but at the end of the day the Minister has no control over the disposal or use of premises.  It is remarkable that premises which could be made available are not being made available because there is a possibility that those premises could be sold privately for the gain of the diocese.  This is an issue which will have to be addressed, and I ask the Minister to take the issue solidly on her shoulders, in the context of the long-term solution, which is the provision of premises.  The boards of managements in two schools cannot be left to fight it out on this issue. Firm leadership is needed and I know the Minister will provide this as she has on many other issues during the year.</P>
    <P>I have said all I need to say on this issue.  I am aware that Deputy Cosgrave wants to join with me in my plea to the Minister to respond positivley.  We leave this House next week and the next opportunity we will have to do anything about this matter on the floor of the House is one month after the new school term commences.  I hope that in the interim the Minister will be able to concede to <Col N="1497" /> this request made on behalf of the parents and pupils of Gaelscoil Míde and that a resolution can be found to this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to thank you for allowing us to raise this important issue on the Adjournment and, secondly, I thank my colleague, Deputy McCartan, for sharing his time with me.  I will probably repeat much of what he said and much of what I said last week when I spoke about this issue during the debate on the Estimates.  However, it is worth repeating.  Due to the extreme accommodation crisis the very existence of Gaelscoil Míde is threatened.  This growing all-Irish primary school is temporarily situated in the Baldoyle area.  This small school is divided among four buildings and its 182 pupils are housed in an old convent school providing two classes, an old community hall containing four classes and two prefabs in the convent school grounds.  Worse again, the school is separated by a busy, dangerous main street and its junction with Willie Nolan Road, Baldoyle.  If equipment is transferred from one section of the school, persons must cross this busy and dangerous main street to gain access to the other section of Gaelscoil Míde.  School children face dangers daily crossing at this dangerous junction.</P>
      <P>Infant classes in the old convent school are using upstairs classrooms and teachers must accompany the pupils when using toilets which are situated downstairs. I understand that according to Department of Education rules upstairs classes should not be used where infants are involved.  To say the least, an old hall, an old convent school and two prefabs are just not good enough in this day and age to provide the proper environment for teachers and pupils to work together successfully in the full development of students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of management, staff and parents of Gaelscoil Míde are demanding that the school be unified under one roof <Col N="1498" /> in suitable accommodation not far from its home base in Donaghmede until permanent accommodation becomes available for the school.  The Department of Education recognise the right of Gaelscoil Míde to this unit.  They have thus far failed in their efforts to find a suitable building for Gaelscoil Míde for the coming new school year and there are just ten weeks left to the start of the new school term.  The people of Gaelscoil Míde are very angry at the treatment that they and their children have received and at the lack of positive planning for the school's future.  A very telling example of this is the fact that the permanent location of Gaelscoil Míde has still not clearly been established seven years after the foundation of the school.  Another is that Gaelscoil Míde will have five different buildings for its 200 plus pupils in September if proper accommodation is not provided.</P>
    <P>During the term of the last Government negotiations were at an advanced stage to purchase a two and a half acre site in the Donaghmede area from the Irish Christian Brothers.  The parents helped to negotiate a very favourable price for this site.  I understand that the cost was £17,500 per acre.  However, on the election of the present Government, and due to the severe cutbacks imposed in 1987, the purchase of this site fell through.  There are four schools in the Donaghmede area and a decline in pupil numbers.  The Department have indicated that space may become available in Scoil Caoimhín.  However, like Deputy McCartan, I cannot see this happening. Perhaps this space may become available in 1992.  Scoil Íosagáin in Kilbarrack could provide temporary accommodation in September.  However, I understand that that school may be offered for sale and I urge the Minister to consider this school rather than to sell it off.  Perhaps temporary accommodation could be provided there.</P>
    <P>The parents are demanding that the Department provide free transport for <Col N="1499" /> the pupils of Gaelscoil Míde to and from wherever they will be temporarily accommodated in the future.  For many years individual householders in Donaghmede have spent hundreds of pounds each year on coach fares to get their children to school.  I should also like to point out to the Minister that this is a very popular school in the Donaghmede and Baldoyle areas and it deserves that grant support. I understand that there is a precedent for it because Gaelscoil Inse Chór was provided with this type of transport by the Department.  I urge the Minister to do everything possible to provide Gaelscoil Míde with a school premises in the very near future.</P>

      <P>I have become very familiar with this problem during the past four or five years.  I want to put on the record of this House how dearly and closely I cherish the aspirations of Gaelscoil Míde.  On a number of occasions I have visited the school in Baldoyle and I am totally at one with the sentiments expressed in relation to the unsatisfactory and most unpedagogic nature of the conditions there.  The conditions there are not in keeping with what should be a proper or adequate teaching environment. I know the Minister and her Minister of State are fully at one with me in regard to those sentiments.  They have a full brief of what obtains in that school <Col N="1500" /> and they are fully supportive of the view that the conditions are wrong, not adequate and need to be redressed. However, I am also aware, from my ongoing discussions with the Minister and her Minister of State, that they are doing everything in their power to redress the situation.  I am sure Deputy Cosgrave, my colleague across the floor, whose party have served a number of years in Government, is very <i>au fait</i> with the conditions in relation to primary schools and with the authority the Department have and knows that they cannot wave a magic wand and simply overnight accommodate a Gaelscoil in an all-English primary school.</P>
      <P>There is an archdiocesan problem there.  The Minister may not refer to it, but I am referring to it because I know about the problem from my research as a primary school teacher.  There is a problem also in relation to the principals of schools who have found that the numbers in their own schools have fallen and who believe that a Gaelscoil would provide competition for them and which, by virtue of it being <i>in situ</i> in that school complex, might cause the demise of that primary school much sooner than might otherwise happen.  I am aware of all their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is fully aware of my concern, which has been expressed to her on many occasions, in relation to Gaelscoil Míde.  Her Minister of State is also equally aware of the problems and he recently visited the Gaelscoil with me.  I am very anxious that a single building be provided to accommodate the Gaelscoil. I must say to the Minister that recognising her difficulties &mdash; and I must recognise her difficulties &mdash; and the authority she has, I have taken the initiative over the past couple of weeks in relation to Gaelscoil Míde.  I hope that initiative &mdash; and I mean no disrespect to the Minister &mdash; which is outside the remit of her Department might bear, some fruit in the next week or two.  I encourage the Minister, in the context of the enthusiasm she has <Col N="1501" /> for a solution to this problem, to support me, which I know she will, and my colleagues, Deputies Cosgrave and McCartan, and to come up with a final solution to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate &mdash; my colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, Deputy McCartan, who sought for many days to raise this matter on the Adjournment, Deputy Cosgrave, who spoke on the issue last Friday, and my ministerial colleague, Deputy Woods, who has spoken to me constantly about it.  Obviously, this question spans all political divides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with all the Members that there is a need to have a solution to the problem for Gaelscoil Míde.  This school has expanded during the seven years since it was set up from its very modest beginnings to 182 pupils at present.  This deep commitment on behalf of the parents who want their children taught in a Gaelscoil is in itself proof of what is needed.  Since I came into office I have made very strenuous efforts to give recognition to Gaelscoileanna, recognition which the previous Government had been remiss and tardy in giving to them throughout their administration.  The present accommodation for Gaelscoil Míde is not proper and I fully accept that conditions in the school are not satisfactory.  Since the school obtained permanent recognition from the Department in 1984 the provision of suitable permanent accommodation for the school has been under active consideration.  Of course, we all know that it was hoped that a site in Hole-in-the-Wall Road in Donaghmede, the property of the Christian Brothers, could be purchased so that a new school building could be erected.  Some negotiations in this respect had taken place. However, this did not prove possible for various reasons, not quite for the reasons given by Deputy Cosgrave.  I have the files in my Department and I will, when <Col N="1502" /> I meet the deputation from Gaelscoil Míde&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I conveyed to Deputy Cosgrave in the House last Friday that at Deputy Fitzgerald's instigation and impetus I would meet with a deputation once the House had risen.  I repeat that commitment, which was asked of me again tonight by Deputy McCartan.  I want to say to the parents in the Gallery that of course I will meet them.  I have never failed to meet a group who wanted to meet me.  It is the easiest way to do one's business &mdash; you meet folk and they tell you what their troubles are.  I have all of the files and information and I will be able to correct some of the errors which have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of proposals are being considered urgently by my Department in consultation with the school authorities for the provision of suitable alternative accommodation for the school at the earliest possible date.  I share Deputy McCartan's view that an interim solution on one site is the first necessary step, with the ongoing magic date of 1992 perhaps as the date for the final solution &mdash; and I do not mean &ldquo;final solution&rdquo; in the terms in which it is often talked about.  I share the Deputy's concern that suitable premises should be provided on a permanent basis.  I am constrained from indicating the specific school premises which are being considered because I am in intimate consultation with the archdiocese, as are the officials in my Department, on a permanent home for Gaelscoil Míde.  I am not in a position either at this point to say when that alternative accommodation will be available but I can say unequivocally that my Department officials are fully bent on seeing that this issue is resolved.  I have told them to bend might and main to the resolution of the <Col N="1503" /> problem.  I accept fully that an urgent solution to Gaelscoil Míde's problems is needed and I can assure the Deputies in the House, Deputy Woods, the community representative, the parents who are here with us tonight, the school authorities, the teachers and, of course, the students, who are suffering the ultimate disturbance in the accommodation they are in, that the Department are taking all the necessary steps to ensure that the difficulties will be resolved at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to a philosophical point, but a correct one, raised by Deputy McCartan and one which is exercising me very much within the Department. Because of the falling population, in a very few years there will be a surplus of accommodation which will have been dearly bought, constructed and put up by taxpayers' money.

      <P>It is presumed that the change referred to in the question relates to the withdrawal of the accelerated rates of capital allowances and the restriction of capital allowances to the normal annual wear and tear rates only.  If this change were to apply in respect of investment from 1 April 1988 onwards it is estimated that the yield in 1988-89 would be negligible. <Col N="1321" /> In 1989-90 and for some years thereafter there would be a yield to the Exchequer in terms of increased income tax and corporation tax revenue.  It is tentatively estimated that this would reach a maximum yield of the order of £93 million in 1990-91, over and above the yield arising from the current rates of accelerated capital allowances.  This additional yield would diminish in each subsequent year because the abolition of accelerated capital allowances would result in, and be balanced by, an increasing entitlement to annual allowances.</P>
      <P>The Government's views on accelerated depreciation were set out in the budget and the necessary legislative provisions were incorporated in this year's Finance Act.  The Act reduced the accelerated capital allowances from 100 per cent to 50 per cent, with effect from 1 April 1989.  The reasons for this were basically twofold: to modify the existing bias in favour of capital at the expense of employment, and to finance the cost of the reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax.  I should add that this reduction in accelerated allowances does not apply to a limited number of special cases including qualifying services activities in the Custom House Docks area and in Shannon, the incentives for the designated areas, and projects negotiated with and approved by the industrial development agencies by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1988 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the reduction over two years of the maximum level of accelerated capital allowances in respect of <Col N="1322" /> machinery and plant and industrial buildings from 100 per cent to 50 per cent ceiling, together with the termination of the existing 30 per cent ceiling on capital allowances for machinery and plant claimed by farmers.  The total savings to the Exchequer arising from these measures, taken in isolation from other tax changes, are tentatively estimated to be nil in 1988 and to be of the order of £38.5 million in 1989, being £24 million in corporation tax and £14.5 million in income tax; £77 million in 1990, being £48 million in corporation tax and £29 million in income tax; £70 million in 1991, being £44 million in corporation tax an £26 million in income tax; and £59 million in 1992, being £37 million in corporation tax and £22 million in income tax.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the previous question from Deputy Cullen, these reductions were made in order to redress the bias towards investment in fixed assets at the expense of additional employment and to finance the cost of the reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax.</P>

      <P>Significant progress in relation to the taxation of all farmers likely to have taxable incomes was made in 1987 with the issue of the new farm profile form to some 30,000 farmers not already on tax records.  To date 14,000 farmers have responded.  Once the processing of those forms which have been returned is complete, the Revenue Commissioners will pursue those cases where farmers have failed to complete and return the proflle forms.  A further issue of profile forms to farmers who have not so far been <Col N="1323" /> approached will be considered when the processing of the 30,000 forms already issued has been completed.  In addition a new system of voluntary self-assessment for the tax year 1988-89 has just been introduced covering all self-employed persons including farmers.  This system will make it much more difficult, and costly, for the individual to delay the payment of income tax.</P>
      <P>The number of farmers who will be required to make tax returns in respect of 1988-89 will depend to some extent on the number of cases which will be excluded from that obligation by inspectors of taxes, whether on the basis of processed farm profile forms or otherwise. This can occur in cases where it is apparent that no liability to tax is likely to arise.  Taking account of exclusions it is tentatively estimated that about 63,000 farmers will be obliged to make a return of income for 1988-89.</P>
      <P>The number of farmers who are expected to be ultimately liable for income tax for 1988-89 is tentatively estimated at 29,000.  The estimated net receipt of income tax from farmers in 1987 and the corresponding budget estimate for 1988 are as follows: 1987, £34.5 million; 1988 (estimated), £42 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the OECD Economic Outlook No. 43, June 1988.  The Outlook points out that the current international economic situation is better than had been expected some months ago.  The October stock market crisis does not appear to have had lasting effects on business confidence. OECD activity grew by 3 per cent in 1987 and expansion should continue with only a moderate loss of momentum this year and next.  Inflation is under control and the international external imbalances are narrowing.  World trade is expected to continue growing strongly.</P>
      <P>I welcome the more optimistic economic forecasts contained in the OECD Economic Outlook.  General economic data available since the Outlook was produced lend support to the more favourable growth prospects.  In addition, the recently published US April trade figures were better than had been expected. They indicate that the reduction in that country's large external deficit, the main risk to international economic growth, is being maintained.</P>
      <P>In the country note on Ireland the OECD refer to the several positive developments in the Irish economy last year, notably the significant export growth, the emergence of a surplus on the external current account, the substantial lowering of interest rates and the reduction in inflation and the budget deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The OECD forecast a continuation of these trends in 1988 and 1989.  Export growth is projected to remain strong, reflecting rapid market growth and what the OECD acknowledge as Ireland's good competitive position.  The external <Col N="1326" /> account is projected to improve further and inflation is forecast to stabilise at around 2¾ to 3 per cent.  The OECD expect positive, if modest, GNP growth in each of the two years despite the effects of continued fiscal restraint on domestic demand.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> listed net emigration as one of the difficulties confronting us.  The programme estimated it at close to 30,000 a year. This is the same figure as is given in the OECD's report.  The central objective of the Government's economic and social policy as set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is to create a sound basis for secure and sustainable growth in output and employment over the years ahead.  The developments outlined in the OECD Economic Outlook clearly indicate that the environment for sustainable growth is being created by the policies pursued by the Government over the last 15 months.  This is the only viable basis on which we can proceed to achieve an improvement in economic growth and employment prospects thereby reducing unemployment and involuntary emigration.</P>
    <P>The OECD state that private sector employment may show some recovery. The latest information available suggests that the trend in private sector employment is responding to the improvement in the economic situation.  This is partly reflected in the recent sharp decline in the Live Register numbers.</P>

      <P>There are no plans to undertake temporary remedial works at the National Gallery pending the commencement of the proposed first phase of the plan to refurbish the Gallery.  As I indicated in reply to Question No. 35 from the Deputy on 24 March, planning for the proposed Phase I is at an advanced stage. The provision of the necessary finance to enable this phase of the scheme to proceed is still under consideration.  It will take approximately 9 months from receipt of financial approval to complete the planning, invite tenders and appoint a contractor to undertake the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £350,000 was allocated from the national lottery funds for 1988 for work in the National Gallery.  Little if any expenditure will arise on the major scheme in the current year and the Office of Public Works is therefore formulating proposals in consultation with the Department of the Taoiseach and the <Col N="1328" /> National Gallery for works to be financed from the national lottery provision which will deal with a number of the most pressing of the structural and security problems in the gallery in advance of the main scheme.  It is not the intention that these works will be of a temporary nature.  In general the works will be permanent although in a small number of instances more extensive remedial work may be necessary during the later phases of the overall scheme.</P>
    <P>It has not been finally decided at this stage how many subsequent phases of the work there will be.  This will depend to some extent on the availability of funds from 1991 onwards as well as on the availability of areas in the gallery.  It is too early yet to make financial provision for the proposed subsequent phases.</P>
    <P>A final decision has not been made whether to provide an independent heating system as part of the proposed refurbishment. The central heating station, which incidentally also serves this House, is about to be converted to use natural gas.  This will allow for far greater flexibility in the provision of heat and should eliminate the most serious of the heating problems encountered in the National Gallery in the past.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to authorise the National Gallery to retain an independent monitoring architect during the work.  The scheme has been planned by the Office of Public Works in very close consultation with the National Gallery authorities who have indicated they are in agreement with it.  The scheme also has the approval of the Department of the Taoiseach.  In those circumstances I consider that the engagement of a consultant to monitor the progress of the work is unnecessary and would be wasteful of public funds.</P>

      <P>As regards employment, it would be inappropriate for me to make public the specific conditions, particularly the employment condition, relating to individual companies but I can say that these 29 companies together have given firm undertakings, which will be reflected in the conditions imposed in their certificates, to create a total of 866 additional new jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to the impression given in the question, I would point out that the principal tax incentives and exemptions are available to both Irish and foreign companies. The effectiveness of these incentives and exemptions is kept under regular review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continued attraction of foreign industry is of vital importance to this country.  It has been the policy of successive Governments to give tax incentives and reliefs to foreign as well as Irish companies since we could not otherwise compete for our share of international investment.  At the same time, as was indicated by my colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce in reply to a similar question on 31 May, changes have <Col N="1333" /> been made this year in our industrial support measures which will now focus more clearly on developing home-based Irish industry.</P>
    <P>This year's Finance Act introduces a major revamping of corporation tax with a phased reduction in rates and a parallel cutting-back on accelerated capital allowances for investment in fixed assets.  I am satisfied that these changes will help to promote private sector development and to encourage investment in jobs rather than fixed assets.</P>

      <P>Class J contributions are not reckonable for either disability benefit or unemployment benefit purposes nor for the award of credited contributions in respect of periods of illness or unemployment.

      <P>She was not entitled to benefit at the commencement of her claim as according to the available records she had less than the minimum of 39 contributions paid since her entry into insurable employment. She also had no contributions either paid or credited in the 1986-87 contribution year governing her claim.</P>
      <P>Following inquiries, it was established that under her German insurance record, the person concerned had more than 39 contributions paid since entry into insurance and had sufficient contributions paid and credited in the year 1986-78 to qualify for benefit at the maximum rate appropriate to single women with no dependants.</P>

I have been informed by the South Eastern Health Board that the delay arose because of the complexity of applying the terms of the current agreement on pay in the public service and the pressure on the existing staff resources of the board.  Implementation of the terms of the agreement required that each person's pension be adjusted individually.  I understand, however, that the increases with full retrospection to January 1988 have now been paid.</P>

      <P>The conditions governing the use of these schools outside school hours are as follows: (1) that the prior permission of the board of management be <Col N="1357" /> obtained; (2) that the assent of the trustees be obtained; (3) that an undertaking be given that every care will be taken to safeguard school property and that any damage to the school premises or equipment will be made good by those responsible for the activity; (4) that arrangements be made to leave the premises (including out-offices) in a clean and tidy condition for the reception of pupils so that school work will not be interrupted; (5) that the function should terminate at a reasonable hour; (6) that an adequate insurance against damge by fire be effected if the ordinary policy of insurance taken out by the school authorities does not cover the use of the school buildings for purposes other than national school purposes; (7) that the board of management ensure that a sufficient charge is made to cover any expense incurred in providing heating and lighting during the use of the school by outside groups.</P>
      <P>As regards the use of schools for political purposes, Rule 9 of the Rules for National Schools is as follows: 9. (1) At a contested Dáil Election or Presidential Election or Local Election or at a Referendum, any room in a school may be requisitioned by the appropriate Returning Officer for such election, free of charge, for the purpose of taking the poll. (2) A schoolroom may also be used for public meetings at reasonable times outside school hours by candidates at an election of members of Dáil Éireann between the issue of the writ and the day of the poll under the provisions of section 30 of the Electoral Act 1923.  (3) No political meeting may be held nor may any political business be transacted in schools, whether vested or non-vested, except as provided in sections (1) and (2) of this rule.</P>
      <P>The stipulation in Rule 9 (3) is of a long-standing nature and it would not be appropriate to make an alteration to it without due regard to the views of the recognised school managerial and teacher organisations.</P>
