    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a comprehensive statement on the outcome of the talks he had at his recent meeting with (a) the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and (b) the employer organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in the statement issued following the separate meetings with the executive council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and national officers of the Federated Union of Employers on 3 March, I emphasised the importance of moderate pay developments having regard to the state of the public finances and to the need, if existing jobs were to be protected and new jobs provided, for greater competitiveness in the economy.</P>
      <P>The various options which existed in relation to negotiating pay developments were outlined.  The ICTU and the FUE agreed to consider the points made and to indicate their views to the Government as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the executive council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are meeting today and that the executive council of the Federated Union of <Col N="1852" /> Employers are meeting tomorrow to agree their respective responses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say in detail what options on pay were outlined to both bodies and also the indications, if any, given by the Government regarding such guidelines?  Will he give more detail to this House than he says has already been given by way of press statement?  One would expect this from the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The options put forward related to the various ways in which further pay increases might be negotiated, whether by way, for example, of a national pay agreement or otherwise, in the event of a national pay agreement not being the way the unions and employers want to proceed, and as to how the Government would proceed in their own area and private employers and unions in theirs.  It is on this question that the two sides are reflecting and they will be coming back to us within the next 24 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most important issue before the House this week or, possibly, this month.  What does the Taoiseach mean when he refers to a national pay agreement or otherwise? What specifically does he mean by &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo;?  The ICTU and the FUE are meeting today and tomorrow to decide on their response to what took place at those meetings.  I presume the Government had considered in advance of those meetings what their attitude to the pay guidelines should be and I want to know what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be reluctant to say anything at this stage that might prejudice the discussions and the consideration being given to procedure by the two sides.  It would be unfortunate if anything said here were to prevent the two bodies concerned from reaching freely the best conclusions they can as to the best method of proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the new responsible approach of the Taoiseach to these arrangements.  Would he <Col N="1853" /> not agree that it is a major change from his attitude of last August, September and October when&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an argument. A question, please, arising from the question put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What other subjects were discussed with the trade union and employer bodies?  What arrangements, if any, were made for further meetings and with whom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The state of the economy was discussed as the background against which any pay negotiations must take place and the context in which pay increases must be considered. The question of further meetings will arise when the two bodies concerned have responded to the discussions.  That will be a matter for consideration as soon as they have given their replies, which I hope to receive within the next 24 or 48 hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That will arise as soon as the response comes from the two bodies but obviously I cannot prejudge it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling Deputy Mac Giolla and I will then call Deputy Gene Fitzgerald for a final supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned that he asked for moderate pay increases this year.  In view of the inflation figure and the fairly savage impact which both direct tax and VAT increases are having on wages, would the Taoiseach agree that a moderate pay increase this year would mean a further reduction in living standards of workers?  If this is so, will this not be the third year in succession in which workers will be asked to take a reduction in their standard of living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>National output and <Col N="1854" /> income in real terms have not increased in this period by an amount which would permit any increase to take place in average living standards, though individual groups may have done slightly worse or slightly better, successive Governments seeking of course to protect particularly those least advantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not receive a reply to the second part of my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be an argument more than a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that last year and the year before the standard of living of workers was lowered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a statistical question which I would not wish to answer on the spur of the moment.  I think average real wages are somewhat lower now than two years ago but I would not want to go into detail without referring to precise figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the public service pay agreement expired for all workers some time ago, would the Taoiseach not regard it as a matter of urgency that a decision by the Government should be outlined to the House as to the attitude the Government expect to be followed this year?  In early September last year the Taoiseach, then Leader of the Opposition, outlined what he thought should be the pay increase in the public sector in 1983.  What has changed so much since then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are waiting to hear from the two bodies concerned as to how they wish to proceed and I would not wish to say anything that might prejudice the constructive development of the situation.</P>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will consider transferring responsibility for the operations of An Fóir Teoranta from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Industry and Energy <Col N="1855" /> in order to facilitate a more effective action programme for job maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the proposal to transfer responsibility for Fóir Teoranta from the Department of Finance to the Department of Industry and Energy has been considered by consecutive Governments since 1975.  The White Paper on Industrial Policy at present being prepared by the Minister for Industry and Energy will examine the effectiveness of the industrial rescue services provided by the State.  The question of ministerial responsibility will be considered in the context of this examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach personally consider it desirable that such a transfer of responsibility should take place because of the increasing involvement of the IDA in rescue activities in recent years?  Would he not consider that it is better value for taxpayers' money that one Minister should have overall responsibility in the rescue area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the arguments in respect of this but I do not wish to anticipate the conclusions of the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely at a time when there is a headlong rush towards more and more factory closures it is a bit ridiculous to suggest here today that all the decisions which will be taken in this vital area of job maintenance and job creation are being put on the long finger.  We had all the answers before the election but now we do not seem to have any answers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give the following information in respect of each personal assistant, adviser, consultant, secretary, typist or any other category employed from <Col N="1856" /> outside the civil service in a temporary, part-time or permanent capacity or contractual capacity, for the period 18 December 1982 to date: name, rank, remuneration, terms of conditions of employment, if seconded, and, if so, from where.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question asked by him on 26 January 1983.</P>
      <P>The only additional appointment since then was in the Government Information Services.  Mr. Fergus Finlay has been employed as a special assistant in press and information services, at a salary of £22,400 per annum.  The engagement is on a contract basis for the duration of the Government.  Mr. Finlay is on leave of absence from the private sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Including some who may not have taken up duty?  Are there some appointments pending?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not understand the Deputy's question.  Is he talking about Ministers of State taking up duty or other people taking up duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should know that we are talking here about appointments outside the civil service and his Department is rather heavily loaded in that respect at the moment.  In respect of the Taoiseach's reply are there other people who are to be appointed who have not yet taken up duty?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant information was given in a reply to a previous question to which the information given in this reply can be added.  I recall on the previous occasion, when I was asked this question, pointing out the broad correspondence between the appointments we have made and the appointments made by my predecessor taking account of the fact that in some cases people appointed in the public interest have been appointed by Governments and by the previous Government in particular.</P>

      <P>I appointed Mrs. Mary Shinners as my personal secretary on a salary of £125.00 per week plus an allowance of <Col N="1859" /> £11.00 per week.  She is seconded from the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Similarly my Minister of State, Mr. Edward Collins, appointed Miss Ann Flanagan as his personal secretary on the same salary and allowance as my personal secretary.  She too is seconded from the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Mr. Collins also appointed Mr. Walter Morgan as his personal assistant at a salary equivalent to the maximum of the civil service clerical officer scale, currently £170.89 per week.  Mr. Morgan is a retired railway official.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government provides that the National Development Corporation will be established as an early priority and will be a major vehicle for job creation through investment in new commercially viable projects in areas such as natural resources, advance technology and import substitution.  The commercial State bodies listed by the Deputy, with the exception of Aer Lingus, will also come under the aegis of the corporation.</P>
      <P>Consideration is at present being given to the statutory and other measures, including the corporate framework, required to establish the corporation.  It is not possible, at this stage, to indicate a precise date for commencement of its operations.</P>
      <P>In the context of my consideration of proposals to establish the corporation, I am also looking at the operations of the National Enterprise Agency to determine how best these might be integrated into the activities of the corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>He attempted a whitewash job on five questions in a row but he did not answer any of those in the middle at all.  I hope you will bear with me when I try to extract some information in relation to the questions I specifically asked.  Has the National Enterprise Agency stopped its activities as of now, yes, or no?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it has not.  Generally speaking, it is my thinking that its <Col N="1861" /> current activities should continue with a view to those activities being integrated into the National Development Corporation as soon as that body comes into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Question No. 8 would the Minister accept that the National Development Corporation was a priority in the Government's programme? If the Minister accepts that it is still a priority would he not consider setting it up on a company basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is priority but it is very important to establish it on the right basis.  The previous Government were very careful in the terms of reference they drew up for the National Enterprise Agency.  We have something useful to work on there.  It is a lesson to the present Government that one must be very careful in drawing up the terms of reference of this body because there is a serious danger that it could just waste money.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of the many problems that have arisen in the public sector as a result of hasty, well-intentioned but, ultimately, ill-judged investment decisions.  I am determined to set up the National Development Corporation on the very best basis.  The Deputy has raised a reasonable question.  He asked should we not proceed with a private company?  While I would not rule that out I tend to lean against that type of proposal on the basis that it does not allow the House an opportunity to discuss the terms of reference in a way I believe it should.  That was one of the defects of the National Enterprise Agency and one of the reasons why it has not had the public understanding it should have had in its work.  Its terms of reference were never discussed in the House under any of the Governments which presided over it.  There have been more than one.  That was because there was not any statutory basis for it.  It was set up under the procedures the Deputy referred to.  My preference for the National Development Corporation is that it would be set up on a statutory basis as soon as possible.  That means it cannot be brought into operation <Col N="1862" /> immediately but you will have a better product in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that it is quite possible to set it up and operate effectively on a company basis?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister is probably not serious about the National Development Corporation and he does not see it in the light that some of his Government colleagues see it.  If the Minister was serious about it he could set it up tomorrow morning with two £1 shares by civil servants in his Department, if they had quite clear thinking about what the National Development Corporation was going to do, what the objectives were and what areas they would cover.  It is not an idea that has crept up in the last day or week.  It is stillborn since the mid-seventies.  For a Minister to say here now that they are not clear in their minds what the objectives are, what projects it might do, it is quite clear to me, to the House and everybody concerned that the Minister and the Government are not committed to the National Development Corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says is correct.  This body could be established on a company basis and could be given the money to spend on that basis but that would not be adequate.  It is important <Col N="1863" /> that there be proper discussion of precisely what limits are to apply to the way in which we spend money.  From many years of activity in this area by State enterprise we have ample experience to realise that there must be proper criteria, that otherwise the whole effort would be a disaster.  I do not think Deputy Reynolds would wish to push the Government into making ill-judged decisions in what is a very important area.  We must establish the National Development Corporation on a proper basis so that it can earn a good reputation for itself.  It is hardly fair to criticise me in any way for wanting to take the decision in a deliberate fashion so as to arrive at the right decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us in terms as simple as possible what he visualises as being the difference between the National Development Corporation concept and the National Enterprise Agency concept?  Secondly, what advantage does the Minister consider the National Development Corporation concept to have compared with the National Enterprise Agency concept which would justify his demolishing a structure that was established firmly with the agreement of employers, trade unions and Government in favour of this new and rather mythical concept?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, the difference is that the National Development Corporation would have a supervisory role in regard to existing State companies whereas the National Enterprise Agency have no such role.  That would give the corporation an advantage in that they would be in a position to ensure that existing State company resources were used to act in partnership with whatever new projects might be established under the aegis of the National Development Corporation. There is no question of demolishing the National Enterprise Agency.  As I said in response to Deputy Reynold's original question, I would envisage the agency continuing to operate and to integrate their activities in due course with the National Development Corporation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few other points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is concerned that we do not have repetition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I need a lot of information. I had expected to be given simple answers to my questions.  Instead I have not had any answer but we all know the reason for that.  Can the Minister give one or two simple examples of projects the Government envisage carrying out under the aegis of the National Development Corporation and which cannot be carried out under the aegis of the National Enterprise Agency?  Would he not agree that the Kilkenny Design Workshops and the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, for example, were not hindered in any way from developing the role that this House intended them to develop as a result of their being set up under a company framework which was followed afterwards by legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not ruled out finally the possibility of proceeding under the Companies Act.  However, I have indicated that there are disadvantages in proceeding in that way.  The Deputy may disagree but that is his right.  The House will recollect that I have tended always to take the view that we should try to debate matters here before going ahead with them.  If we were to proceed in this instance under the Companies Act we would be at the disadvantage of having gone ahead before the matter could be discussed in the House.  That is not a very good procedure to adopt without there being good reason for it.  Deputy Reynolds asked what the corporation might do that could not be done by the National Enterprise Agency.  One example is the entering into joint ventures with existing State companies, something that the <Col N="1865" /> National Development Corporation in their supervisory capacity could do more easily than if the agency were involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked about the criteria and the terms of reference of the National Development Corporation.  He knows that this is part of the Government programme because it is Labour Party policy.  Is the Minister telling the House now that the terms of reference and the criteria envisaged by the Labour Party prior to their entering Government are not acceptable to him and to the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the joint programme he will find that the terms of reference are quite general.  If one were setting up a company one would need to set out the details to a much greater extent than is either possible or desirable in such a programme.  I do not see anything wrong with the joint programme in so far as it goes.  It sets out a very ambitious and sensible approach to the creating of jobs in, or with the aid of, the public sector but it does not spell out the detail that it is now my responsibility to spell out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any idea of the number of jobs the National Enterprise Agency-National Development Corporation are expected to provide in the next 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give a figure in that regard.  Until such time as the corporation are in being and the various projects can be examined, one is not in a position to give any forecast on the number of jobs that might be involved. I do not see any point simply in putting money into this body to enable them to create jobs that would not be viable.  Any jobs they create must be ones that can stand on their own after the initial State input.  None of us could envisage precisely the type of jobs or the number that might be involved in this framework.  Of course the National Development Corporation could create any number of jobs they wished by simply spending the <Col N="1866" /> money and without regard to the viability of the jobs created.  If they were to proceed in that way they would not be likely to last for more than 12 months.  We are interested in a National Development Corporation that will create jobs that will last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>How many jobs is the Minister talking about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot give a figure in that respect because a proper market assessment would first have to be done of the projects.  The NEA have done a considerable amount of work on a number of possibilities.  That agency have been working for more than a year and a half under the terms of reference drafted by the previous Government but they have not created any jobs yet.  Neither, so far as I know, have they been able to put a figure on the number of jobs that might be created.  I intend to use that work but I will not be drawn by the Deputy into putting a figure on the number of jobs that would arise in 12 months until such time as I am convinced that any job created is viable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the problem today is a lack of projects and not a lack of agencies or new structures and that it is a matter of indifference as to when or whether this new body will be set up since they will be no more than yet another layer of bureaucracy? If the name of the game is projects, we have ample agencies to undertake them but it is clear that the Minister is talking in terms of using a legislative framework to extend the period during which the Government might be pushed into a position of setting up the corporation. Just as what happened in a previous Coalition, we can expect the details to be announced on the day another election is called.  Incidentally, why are Aer Lingus not included in the list?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The list is the one that <Col N="1867" /> was drawn up between the parties coming into Government.  Presumably Aer Lingus were excluded because they operate in the transport rather than in the industrial area.  There is a role for the National Development Corporation and that role is in the type of project that has long-term potential but a slower rate of return than the normal private sector investor would be interested in.  The State can get involved in such projects because it can wait longer for a return than the private investor can wait.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy the IDA targets for job approvals in 1982; the targets achieved; and the targets for job approvals in 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority's job approvals target was 30,000 for 1982.  In that year the IDA approved 990 projects with total job potential of 29,511.</P>
      <P>The IDA have now discontinued the practice of setting their overall target in terms of job approvals in line with the recommendations in the NESC-Telesis Reports on industrial policy.  The Authority's target for 1983 is to create between 11,000 and 12,000 first-time grant-aided jobs and to grant-aid 900 projects under the new industry and small industries programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that those job targets will be adequate to deal with the escalation in unemployment <Col N="1868" /> which we are experiencing from day to day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The fact of the matter is that industrial development on its own has never been sufficient to deal with the growing unemployment problem.  If would be doing no one a favour to pretend that industrial development on its own will be the answer to the unemployment problem.  The hope must be that as a result of industrial activity there will be spin-off employment in the associated services sector which will help us to counteract the unemployment problem.  To be perfectly honest, no party has yet truly faced the gravity of the present unemployment problem.  None of the measures which we have been discussing so far is a complete answer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there any other plans to make up some of the very large shortfall which will arise?  Are there any new plans to tackle the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely why the Government established the Employment Action Team which brings together five or six central Ministers in the Cabinet in discussions on employment policy as a whole.  The trouble up to now has been that there have been many different approaches to the unemployment problem by different Ministers acting very generally on their own.  The idea of the Employment Action Team is to try to synchronise these to get the maximum return for State activity in this area.  One must also face up to the serious problem that even after many of these measures have been adopted there will still be a very substantial pool of unemployment. That is where initiatives, such as the Youth Employment Agency, can be of help.  In the overall context of the industrial policy White Paper referred to earlier, I will be trying to find, in conjunction with the Employment Action Team, answers to the problems which Deputy Reynolds has pointed out.  I do not have the answer now and to pretend that I did would not be doing anybody in the House a favour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate fully the importance attaching to the use of Irish standards for the purpose of raising the quality of Irish manufactured products. In recent years the number of Irish standards published has been increasing steadily. In addition, the staff of the standards division at the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the body responsible for preparing such standards, have been strengthened and it is intended to redeploy additional staff within the institute to this function in 1983.  I would point out, however, that, with few exceptions, these standards are voluntary and it is a matter for consumers to satisfy themselves that products conform to Irish standards.</P>
      <P>In the case of substandard imported goods, it is not possible to restrict their sale except where they represent a public health or safety hazard.  In such cases I have the power to make mandatory standards by order.</P>

      <P>You have the control if you are setting an Irish standard and the <Col N="1875" /> consumers would know by looking at the product whether if complied with that standard.  If it did not, they would not have to buy it.  We are allowed under the free trading obligations only to impose mandatory standards which must be applied, regardless of what the consumer might think, where the goods are a danger to safety.  Seven such mandatory standards have been made to date.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister is fully aware by now, after some months in Government, and in his previous term in office as well, of the number of jobs lost in recent years arising from what can only be described as substandard imports competing with Irish-produced goods, thereby putting many Irishmen and women out of employment?

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This very much depends on Irish purchasing managers. The work that is being done in alerting purchasing managers of Irish firms to the availability of good quality Irish products, as a substitute for the imports they are now using, is the key to success in this area.  This is something to which I shall be referring in response to the next question from Deputy Leonard.</P>

      <P>In the course of the supplementary information the Minister gave he more or less implied that the consumer should be satisfied with the standards.  In his last reply just a minute ago he talked about purchasing managers and so on.  Surely the Government have a responsibility?  From yesterday's unemployment figures we know now that they will be way over 200,000 before the end of this year.  Surely there must be some action the Government, and the Minister's Department in particular, could take to alleviate this very serious situation in which many thousands of men and women are losing their jobs?</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy will realise that when one is in the EEC one is bound by certain obligations as to free trade.  If one introduced some standards <Col N="1876" /> for imports which were such as to exclude perfectly good foreign goods but which were not just as good as the equivalent Irish product, one would not be able to sustain that position under the EEC rules.  The only area in which one is entitled to introduce that type of mandatory standard is where public health and safety are at risk, as I have already indicated.  It is not a question of not wanting to; it is a question of not being able to under our existing Treaty obligations.</P>

We, of all countries in the Community, depend on exports and the acceptability of our exports in other markets as our lifeline to survival.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that our obligations under the Treaties of the European Communities prevent us from taking action to restrict imports of building materials from other Member States.  However, I am convinced that the Irish firms involved in this sector should be capable of increasing their penetration of the home market through improvements in marketing, quality, product design, price and delivery performance.  The IDA and other bodies concerned with assistance for industry provide financial and other incentives for these purposes.  The Government's overall economic strategy to improve the competitveness of the economy generally is also an important factor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a Foras Forbartha Report at the end of last year indicated that half of the £360 million worth of materials imported for the construction industry could be manufactured here, notably concrete products, bricks, panelling and floor covering? Would the Minister agree that the Department failed to recognise the market for materials here and gave importers an opportunity to flood our market with goods that should be manufactured here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be a fair criticism.  What the Deputy has said and the figures he has quoted are correct. Indeed it has been estimated that if the business in question had been diverted to Irish building material firms, there could <Col N="1878" /> have been an additional 5,000 to 10,000 jobs.  That is why I said, in response to an earlier question, that it does behove people in the building industry who are purchasing managers to bear in mind the availability of native resources.  We have a very sophisticated range of building material products produced within the State.  It is very important that people who are purchasing for the building industry should realise this.  I am glad the Deputy has brought the matter to public attention by means of his Parliamentary question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the reason those products are now being imported is the Department's withdrawal of grant aid in the matter of concrete products, that that is the reason a lot of those businesses went out of existence?  Would the Minister, along with the IDA, introduce measures and aids so that those industries might get back into production?  It must be remembered that there are vacant factories lying idle &mdash; they are all low technology &mdash; in which a lot of the material I mentioned could be utilised.  Would the Minister agree that this should be done especially in a time of very high unemployment?</P>

      <P>This is just an addendum. Would the Minister accept there is grave need to focus more in the State-purchasing area, especially in the construction industry, on buying Irish raw materials?  Would the Minister not consider setting up a monthly reporting system within the new section in his Department &mdash; which I set up when there &mdash; the imports substitution section, to ensure that the maximum amount of money is spent in Ireland?  This arrangement is in operation in many EEC countries at present and it is time we got down to business.</P>

      <P>There are no plans at the moment to build an advance factory on the site in question in Mitchelstown. As I said, the site has not been finally acquired.  The Deputy will realise that in the north Cork area there is quite an amount of existing vacant factory space. It might not be the best use of resources to build more advance factories until we have made some progress towards filling the existing empty space.  The money might be better spent in that direction. However, as a long-term project I will ask the IDA to look at this.</P>

Five of these factories have been reserved for specific industrial projects.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's interest in the possibility that revenue might be secured from renting vacant factory premises.  However, the availability of these factories is a very important element of the IDA's incentive package and it is essential that these factories remain available to the IDA for promotion to visiting industrialists.  The Deputy will understand the serious problems which could arise for the IDA &mdash; and, indeed, for the temporary tenant &mdash; if a factory rented as a warehouse were urgently required to locate a manufacturing enterprise in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are proposals under general consideration which would involve the extension of supply to Cobh <Col N="1886" /> and Midleton.  There are also considerable advantages in having one distributor for gas in the Cork area generally.  The Cork Gas Company have the necessary administrative, financial and technical resources to carry out the project more quickly, and with less expense to the consumer, than if we had a multiplicity of authorities such as the county council and other urban authorities.  The gas company are prepared to invest £10 million in the planned development of the area. Individual urban authorities might be concerned only with their own urban area.  The setting up of additional gas administration for towns close to Cork in my preliminary view would be an expensive duplication of existing facilities and would not be of benefit to the hoped-for large number of Cork gas consumers.</P>

      <P>The Government very much regret and condemn the recent massacres caused by extremist elements in the Indian state of Assam which have resulted in the deaths of an estimated 4,000 people there.  These massacres, which have been condemned by the Indian Government, are the result of a long standing dispute between the local Assamese and Bengali settlers who have been moving into Assam for more than a century, which came to a head with the decision of the Government of India to proceed with elections in Assam as is provided for in the Constitution of India.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government of India have already taken urgent measures to maintain order in Assam and to prevent further massacres. It is to be hoped that these measures, which include the use of the Indian Army to try to control mob violence and <Col N="1890" /> restore law and order in the state, will be successful.  In view of the actions which have been taken by the Government of India, I do not feel that it is appropriate or necessary for the Irish Government to make representations to the Indian authorities at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach thought any further about the Dáil <Col N="1990" /> reform debate held here last January? During that debate I asked that consideration be given to continuing the process started last year of using the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and that the Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy J. Bruton, be a member of that committee.  Tomorrow the Committee on Procedure and Privileges meet for the third time and there has been no consultation between the Minister and myself or any member of that committee.  I appreciate the difficulties which the Minister faces in his Department.  Therefore, I suggest that it would be much better if the functions of Dáil reform were given to the Government Chief Whip because he has available people who were involved for many years in the procedure of this House.  There are at least three private secretaries to the Chief Whip within that Department and rather than, as he is doing at present, setting up a new section within the Department, I would prefer if the Taoiseach gave urgent consideration to my suggestion so that we could make some progress and avoid the kind of thing we had here last Thursday. If we switched back to a very amiable Government Chief Whip, then may be we could make some progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's remarks about the amiability of the Government Chief Whip.  The procedure we proposed is that the Minister for Industry and Energy would act as Leader of the House and have responsibility for the fundamental reform of the Dáil and bring forward proposals arising from that debate.  That should not preclude matters being dealt with in the ordinary way by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges when they arise, and we would not wish to hold up any proposals of a routine character which could be raised in that forum.  I am not clear what the Deputy has in mind, but perhaps it is something that could be discussed through the Whips.  We wish to facilitate any improvements in Dáil procedure and will do nothing which would hold them up.  There is a major task of Dáil reform to be undertaken as well as the continuing improvement of proce-pile <Col N="1991" /> dures.  They are somewhat different and are being tackled <i>in tandem</i> and in harmony by the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip.</P>

      <P>I want to be clear on what the Taoiseach is saying.  Is he saying there are two types of Dáil reform, short-term and long-term?  Was the gist of his reply to the effect that short-term law reform can go ahead in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but fundamental long-term reform will remain with the Minister for Industry and Energy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been our view that there is a need to tackle Dáil reform at a fundamental level, and we have made provision for that by appointing the Minister for Industry and Energy to that task and providing staff for that purpose.  He, reflecting on the very constructive debate which took place here, is now preparing proposals.  What I am saying in reply to Deputy Ahern is that that arrangement should not preclude any proposal which in the ordinary way would have come up for discussion through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges from being brought up there, and we would not wish to hold up any change of a routine kind which is brought forward.  Some of the issues raised of frustration about existing procedures could be dealt with through that mechanism while the more fundamental reform is being tackled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was last speaking on this measure I was voicing my concern at the way this debate had degenerated.  The degree of degeneration has been augmented, in my experience, by the hate mail one receives, anonymously or not, when one voices one's reservations about the appropriateness of an amendment to change the Constitution on any matter. It is a sad reflection that when someone voices a clear argument, to my way of thinking an irrefutable argument, against amending the Constitution in this manner, one gets hysterical letters through the post.  Those letters are prompted and promoted by the kind of nonsensical argument we have heard from both sides of this House, from people who think the argument is about abortion when it is not.</P>
      <P>I put on record my considered reservations to this farce the last day and I do not propose to take up the time of the House repeating them.  I want to say loudly and clearly, and to put on the record, the fact that this debate has degenerated to such an extent that nobody knows any longer what precisely we are talking about or, more to the point, why we are talking about it.  It has all the hallmarks, regrettably, of a sinking democracy and could be likened to people frantically running around the submerging deck of a <i>Titanic</i> arguing about the exact placement of deck chairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We take it for granted in this House that there is an inbuilt and implicit support for the democratic process and that our young people and the young people in Europe will automatically recognise the wisdom, efficiency and justice of a democratic system because it is a better alternative to what Europe has experienced in the past.  That is a great and frequently unquantified assertion on our behalf.  It is quite clear, given the degeneration of democratic politics in the North, that the sole, sane voice of democratic politics on the non-Unionist side in Northern Ireland is being substantially and consistently eroded by democratic terrorists in the form of Provisional Sinn Féin, with, to quote their own phrase, <Col N="1995" /> the ballot paper in one hand and the Armalite in the other.</P>
    <P>How can we, as a democratic Assembly, justify our relevance, efficiency or equity if we say to the public, especially to young people, that we are spending endless hours in academic debate in this Chamber about changing the Constitution, which will not have the slightest effect upon the issue about which we are all supposed to be concerned, abortion, because not one single physical change will result in society and the situation of women who find themselves pregnant? We have been blackmailed into changing the Constitution, which will achieve nothing, at a time when our Constitution is crying out to be changed because it is a barrier to social justice in three specific areas.  The first is one which is close to my constituency because of the historical nature of the housing stock.  We have no statistical figures on which to base our arguments but the consensus is that somewhere in the region of 30,000 people are affected by the removal by the Supreme Court of rent control legislation on the grounds that it was deemed to be inimical to the private rights of property owners and landlords in particular.  As a consequence of this, legislation went through this House, the first measure was found to be unconstitutional and the second is currently being challenged by an individual solicitor in this city.  As a result of that action at least 30,000 people are directly affected by the way a particular historical group of Supreme Court judges interpreted the property clauses of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>If Deputies went to a meeting of the tenants affected by that legislation they would be convinced of the relevance and of the pressing social necessity to redress the balance within the Constitution between the legitimate rights of private property and the need to get a balance for the common good.  Where is the amendment campaign to achieve that? Nowhere.  The people I am talking about are mainly elderly, single or widowed and on fixed incomes and are literally living in terror.  We had the scandal recently in our so-called democratic courts of an 87 <Col N="1996" /> year old woman being hauled into the witness box, asked to take the oath and to describe the housing circumstances under which she lived, the income she derived from some pensions and made feel she was a criminal for having lived all her life in the same house which she considered to be her home, a house which the landlord forgot he owned.  The Constitution we are rushing to amend is inviolate in this matter and cannot be touched because of the sacred nature of property here.</P>
    <P>If we amend the Constitution in relation to abortion it will not make any difference to the 30,000 on the housing lists of local authorities.  Land is being sold at a scandalously high price and we do not seem to be able to curb it.  Last week, this House agreed to establish a committee to deal with the price of building land. Tomorrow, the Seanad will agree to a similar measure and a committee will be established.  Since 1980, the Attorney General's Office, under three successive Ministers for the Environment, have been requested to give an opinion on the constitutionality of measures to deal with the scandalous abuse of land.  So far, the Attorney General's Office have found themselves incapable of providing an opinion.  Do you know what the guy who is responsible for that file is doing at the moment?  He is dreaming up some new wording for this farce.  That is what he is doing in a time of economic catastrophe, that is the deployment by the majority democratic forces represented in this House of scarce public skills in the Attorney General's Office.  What claims have we on our young people for the automatic and continued support for the democratic process when this kind of nonsense goes on?</P>
    <P>Marriages are breaking down in our society and there is no proper or effective legal framework with which to deal with reality, nor the possibility that something might happen in the future, which is the case upon which the pro-amendment people base their claim.  They argue it is necessary now to change our Constitution in such a way as to prevent some future body of people introducing legislation. Have we achieved such a degree <Col N="1997" /> of democratic efficiency and success in this Legislature that we can afford the luxury of resolving problems which have not yet arisen, when all around us there is a range of problems which are crying out for solutions, to which solutions exist and which ordinary people, who have been made to feel criminals in their own homes, feel should be solved?  What kind of a society do we claim as the correct and legitimate heir to the proud republican tradition of 1916 and 1921?  That is my <i>cri de coeur</i> to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  The argument I make is open and honest.  Both parties know they were hijacked by a well-organised and skilful moral blackmail operation at the height of an election campaign.  Whatever about conservatives in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, there is no room in my book of tolerance for so-called liberals in both parties who want to be on both sides of the road in this issue.  If they exist let them speak freely and openly on this issue.  Alternatively, let them show how they can justify the utilisation of this large, elaborate and expensive decision-making machine called the Oireachtas to set in motion in this House and in the Seanad and then with the ordinary people by way of a referendum, a campaign which will not change one comma, sentence, clause or paragraph of any law in the land that currently relates to abortion.</P>
    <P>There is no responsive argument to contradict what I am saying in relation to this issue.  The only way the supporters of this farce can justify their position is to bleat on as they do about how much they are opposed to abortion.  I have not heard any Member speak in favour of abortion. We are all at one on this issue.  All political parties have clearly stated that they are not in favour of introducing abortion legislation&mdash;end of story.  Why are we utilising the time and energy of the Attorney General, who should be doing his job on the question of land legislation instead of trying to do some type of semantic gymnastics to produce a formula of words that will say everything but not mean anything?  That is the legal task the Attorney General has been set not just by the <Col N="1998" /> Government but by the former Administration also.</P>
    <P>The tragedy at the end of the day, as this farce proceeds inevitably onwards to the predictable victory it will have overwhelmingly in the House, is that the more the people who are in favour of the amendment argue for its support on the grounds that it is about abortion the more they build up the view that there are thousands on the island who are allegedly pro-abortion.  We will live to learn bitterly that we have created a harvest that will some day be collected by others.  The more those who are in favour of the amendment try to force us into the position of saying that we are pro-abortion, which we are not, and the more they try to cast that argument on those lines, when the votes are counted if the logic of their argument is sustained then there will be numbered on this island thousands of people who allegedly are pro-abortion. That is not the case.  The irony at the end of this expensive, wasteful and shameful episode will be the creation of a false support in favour of something to which everybody is opposed in overwhelming terms.</P>
    <P>It never ceases to amaze me &mdash; I make this statement as much about myself as about others &mdash; how strong, forceful and full of emotion men can be about a topic which in the final analysis exclusively concerns women and how silent the voices of women have been, in the House and outside, in relation to this matter.  At the end of the day I do not think that anything said here will make it any easier for the women who are faced with this horrible dilemma, as many of them have been, and we know that from the official figures.  I do not think that what is said today, or on other occasions, will in any way affect the miserable sad journey that so many are frequently and increasingly taking to England or to other countries to obtain for themselves a termination.  We automatically and continuously assume in the House that democracy is well rooted in the Irish people, that Irish people believe in our capacity to use it effectively and that democracy is by definition somehow or other a more efficient, equitable and just way of running society.  I put seriously <Col N="1999" /> to the proponents of this amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They, and the ex-Cabinet members of that party, know better than anyone the difficulties encountered by successive holders of the office of Attorney General in relation to the formulation of words that achieves a political objective on the one hand but makes legal nonsense of the Constitution on the other.  Fianna Fáil are well endowed with constitutional lawyers who have pointed out all those difficulties.  A Member with the eminent experience of Deputy Tunney knows that better than I.  In recent times Deputy Tunney has acquired great skills in managing coalition, better than I will ever achieve and I give him that credit.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the Deputy's insistence in regard to this.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that the Government are responding to a piece of legislation which was announced immediately after the Government which he supported collapsed. Therefore, one cannot describe it accurately as being one Government's legislation as against another.  It happens to be precisely the same wording as far as we know &mdash; this is part of the farce &mdash; that was originally formulated by a Government of which he was an active and full supporting Member.  In fact, Deputy Woods, who is sitting beside Deputy Tunney, was the Minister responsible for introducing the legislation in the first place.  Deputy Woods knows better than I, and many others, the legal pitfalls and mine fields surrounding the wording associated with his Government's attempt to respond to what was nothing short of moral blackmail in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is it that we automatically assume that our young people will continue to give unqualified and uncritical support to a democratic process that is so manifestly devaluing itself in the eyes of everybody else?  I regard myself as a rationalist.  I am putting forward what I consider to be rational arguments against this amendment. If some Member can refute my arguments, I am open to accept his or her refutation.  I am not locked into a prejudicial attitude against them, but I am saying that there is no tangible, logical or rational reason why we should amend the Constitution in this manner.  That is a fixed, locked separate argument.  On top of that, to my way of thinking it adds insult to injury to think that the entire elaborate process of constitutional amendment is being used in this instance, while I can cite three separate issues where there is a pressing social need and demand to introduce an amendment. <Col N="2001" /> There are two separate arguments but one can make the connection in terms of pragmatics between the first and the second.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy McCarthy make a contribution last week on a matter that had little or nothing to do with the proposed amendment: the question of abortion and international statistics and the decision of the Supreme Court in regard to it.  If Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael wish to bring in legislation reaffirming their opposition to abortion and confirming the 1861 Act, let them do that.  I am clear about the way I would vote in regard to that.</P>
    <P>We are doing something different.  We are opening a legal Pandora's Box.  Every Deputy around the country who has talked to a half-baked solicitor knows that in the opening of that box nobody knows what will come out of it.  Nobody can determine the nature of what will come out of it and, most important of all, nobody can respond to the open-ended legal consequences of what will emanate from such a box when finally opened by some action by a private citizen against the Minister for Health, subsequently the Supreme Court and possibly on to the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that we are not doing democracy any service in moving this proposal.  All of the political parties, particularly Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, should have the courage and moral strength to stand up to the nation and say, as we have had to say to many economic interest groups, &ldquo;I am sorry, the situation has changed.  We are not going ahead with this for legal and financial reasons and we give a clear assurance that none of the political parties involved in Leinster House propose to make any change in relation to the question of abortion&rdquo;&mdash;and that would be end of story.</P>
    <P>We could utilise this time more effectively and efficiently to amend the Constitution in areas that are crying out to be amended and where people are suffering every day as a consequence.  If you walk less than half a mile from here on to the first floor of a very inelegant office block building where temporarily the rents tribunal <Col N="2002" /> of the District Court is housed, you will see a scandal going on in relation to the operation and administration of landlord and tenant legislation.  Such a scandal was inconceivable to the land-leaguers whose centenary we celebrated last year, and to all of the nationalist and republican forces who coalesced successfully in 1918 and 1920 to achieve partial independence on this island.  That in 1982 and 1983 a Supreme Court of the Irish Republic would reintroduce under a de Valera Constitution the powers and rights of landlords to exploit their own with greater legal immunity than Mother England ever gave to them is a kind of tragedy built upon a farce, the farce of this debate and this proposal.  I regret bitterly that this House and the major political parties have allowed themselves to be dragged in by this small group of people.  It is a reflection on the kind of consensus politics we have that this has been allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>Finally, I appeal to both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that it is not too late yet to find a face-saving formula that will achieve the objective of the pro-life campaign, which is to ensure that abortion will never be legalised in this country on the one hand, and on the other hand not to use that legitimate aspiration shared by the vast majority of people on this island in a crude, savage and weird attempt at amending the Constitution in a manner that will do no good and no justice to the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>I listened with some interest to the references by the Minister of State to some of our prevailing social ills.  One could be forgiven for forgetting that the Minister of State is a member of a party who are keeping this Government in power.  If his party are to continue to keep this Government in power, why do they not insist on the Government tackling these prevailing social ills?  I appreciate what the Minister of State said about the time taken resolving this problem, but I point out to him that it is within the power of the Government to put a number of constitutional amendments together to the people by way of referendum, if that is their choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2003" /> Sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, make abortion a criminal offence in effect.  That law was passed by a British Parliament but it was carried over into the laws of the Irish State under the provisions of the Act of Union, 1800.  The Constitution of 1922 carried over all previous British laws applicable to Ireland into the laws of the Irish Free State in so far as they were not inconsistent with that Constitution.  The Constitution of 1922 was replaced by the Constitution of 1937 and the same position prevailed.  In other words, all pre-1922 British laws were carried over into the laws of the Irish State post-1937 in so far as they were not inconsistent with the 1937 Constitution.  The question of inconsistency with the 1937 Irish Constitution could be determined only if a citizen of the State challenged one of those laws as being inconsistent with that Constitution. Nobody has as yet challenged the validity of sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, and accordingly, they are still applicable in Ireland.  As I said at the outset, they make abortion a criminal offence and they provide extremely severe penalities for people who have been involved directly or indirectly in carrying out an abortion.</P>
    <P>At present, this law which makes abortion a criminal offence can be said to give an unborn person a right to life.  This is done indirectly by making it a criminal offence for anybody to take the life or to participate in the taking of the life of a person who is conceived but as yet unborn.  This right which the unborn has been given under sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, can be abolished or repealed in two ways.  Firstly, it can be abolished by the Legislature.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas can by a simple majority pass a law which would repeal sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.  Alternatively any citizen of this State can challenge sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, on the grounds that they are unconstitutional, in some way inconsistent with the provisions of the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2004" /> If the High Court and, of course, on appeal the Supreme Court, found these sections of the 1861 Act to be unconstitutional, then they would automatically cease to operate and abortion would no longer be a criminal offence in this State. Accordingly, the unborn's indirect right to life given by sections 57 and 58 of the 1861 Act would disappear.</P>
    <P>However, if the right to life of a person who has been conceived but is as yet unborn were contained in the Constitution, written into the Constitution, then it would require a referendum, that is a plebiscite, in which all citizens over the age of 18 would be entitled to vote to abolish that right.  This is precisely what this amendment seeks to achieve.  It seeks to incorporate the unborn person's right to life into the Constitution so that that right cannot be abolished, abrogated or changed without direct reference to the people.  It takes the decision whether or not to interfere with the unborn person's right to life away from the courts and the Legislature and gives it directly to the people.</P>
    <P>On the general level two arguments have been advanced against this proposed change.  Firstly, it is said that it will achieve nothing in the sense that it will not prevent one Irishwoman from going abroad to obtain an abortion.  Secondly, it is said to be sectarian or divisive.  I want to advert very briefly to each argument in turn.  On the question of preventing Irishwomen from going abroad to obtain abortions, I have heard statements at pro-life meetings that this amendment will in some magic way prevent Irishwomen from going abroad to obtain abortions.  That is nonsense.  We all know that the amendment will not prevent one woman from leaving Ireland to obtain an abortion abroad.  However, I would point out to the people who make that argument that at no time in the history of the world has one form of activity been universally banned in every country.  That is still the situation and will continue to be the situation.  Many activities are prohibited by the criminal laws of Ireland but are nevertheless legally permissible in other countries.  No one has ever suggested, nor would it be correct to suggest, <Col N="2005" /> that we should try to prevent Irish people from going to countries where those activities are legally permissible and engaging in such activities.  Irish people are free to do that and there is nothing we can do about it.  The only way effectively to prohibit women and girls going abroad to obtain abortions is by a process of education on the evils and ill-effects of abortion.  The fact that the proposed amendment would not prevent even one person going abroad to obtain an abortion is totally irrelevant to the issue before us.  What is important is that the laws and Constitution of Ireland should reflect the ideals, aspirations and beliefs of the vast majority of the population of this State.</P>
    <P>This amendment would prevent abortion ever being legalised in this country, except by direct wish of the people expressed by way of referendum.  That itself is a desirable and worthy objective. It is said that the Supreme Court interpret the laws in accordance with changing social conditions.  I do not know if it is any part of the Supreme Court's mandate to do so, but I am ready to admit that the Supreme Court have certainly taken into account changed social conditions and attitudes when called upon to make a decision on whether legislation is constitutionally permissible.  This applies particularly in relation to policy decisions, and a decision on sections 57 and 58 of the 1861 Act would come into this category.  It would be logical to assume that the Supreme Court would not find sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, to be unconstitutional unless they felt that at least a substantial minority or perhaps to accept the decriminalisation of abortion. It puzzles me, however, that some people advance the argument that the interpretation of the will of the majority should be left in this case to the personal decision of five Supreme Court judges.  It is a matter so fundamental that people are entitled to be consulted directly.</P>
    <P>There are other protections in the Constitution, the importance of which I do not wish to minimise.  I speak of such rights as the right to private property <Col N="2006" /> contained in Article 43, the right to the inviolability of one's dwelling, the right to <i>habeus corpus.</i> These rights are extremely important and cannot be abrogated or changed without direct reference to the people.  Surely the right to life is a more fundamental right.  Why should it be possible to abolish this right to life without direct reference to the people when those lesser rights cannot be abolished except by this process?</P>
    <P>A second argument against the amendment is that it is in some way sectarian or divisive.  I have attended meetings in my constituency held both by those who support the amendment and those who oppose it and I have not heard anyone spelling out precisely what &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; means in this context.  My interpretation of speeches by the anti-amendment campaigners is that they claim this amendment would widen the gulf between the majority population in the South and the majority in Northern Ireland and thus further postpone the day of Irish unity by consent.  If this is a proper interpretation of their argument, it is strange in the extreme, particularly since nobody has ever suggested that sections 57 and 58 of the 1861 Act are divisive or sectarian.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why a change in the method by which sections 57 and 58 can be repealed should postpone for one moment the day of Irish unity by consent. Are the anti-amendment campaigners really saying that the repeal of those provisions and the effective legislation of abortion will be part of the price which this country will have to pay for unity?  If that is their argument, it is a price I am not prepared to pay, regardless of when it has to be paid and regardless of the complexion of the Government who seek to introduce it.  I am sorry if I am misinterpreting the views of the anti-amendment campaigners but that argument seems to be implicit in their assertion that the proposed amendment is divisive or sectarian.</P>
    <P>I refer now to a point of view which was expressed a number of years ago but is heard less often today, possibly because of the economic problem.  There is a view that the way to achieve Irish unity by consent is to lower our standards, <Col N="2007" /> change our laws and do whatever the other side want.  That sort of approach will never win the minds and hearts of the Northern Unionists.  The inescapable reality is that the respect others have for us is directly proportionate to the respect we have for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Because of internal conflicts in the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, as well as conflict between the two parties, the Government have sought to backtrack from the implementation of this amendment. They have adopted a misleading approach in order to find a way out, but it is also a dangerous approach.  The argument being used is that the wording is vague and imprecise and could lead to some unexpected results.  There has never been and never will be any written law or constitutional provision that when closely and expertly examined could not be said to lead to some unexpected or unforeseen results.  A few leading lawyers will always produce some section or wording which will produce unforeseen results.  If we were to carry that argument to its logical conclusion it would lead to some absurd results.  It would make this House and the other House redundant as far as our function as lawmakers is concerned.  We could not embark on any more legislation except, perhaps, in the simplest form.  The courts could no longer make decisions which would in effect constitute rules of law.  This would lead to the abandonment of the Constitution because I am sure that any reasonably skilled lawyer could do with any Article of the Constitution what the Attorney General has done with this amendment. A reasonably instructed lawyer could examine any Article and find some word or phrase which, if interpreted in a certain way in a certain context, would give rise to a result which at present seems undesirable.</P>
    <P>I find somewhat peculiar the Attorney General's reasoning for urging caution in relation to this amendment.  The central argument is that the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; is not defined.  Consequently the courts could take the view that the person who is protected by the amendment is only a person who is capable of being born.  I <Col N="2008" /> am not a medical expert but the medical evidence is that the foetus does not become capable of being born alive until after 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy.  That would be a very peculiar interpretation of this amendment if the Supreme Court were ever to take that particular interpretation. The peculiarity of that possible future ruling by the Supreme Court can be seen when we look at what, in effect, the law would be if the Supreme Court interpreted the amendment in that way.</P>
    <P>The result of that interpretation would be that for the first 28 weeks of pregnancy the unborn child would be protected by sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.  That legislation, so far as it related to the first 28 weeks of pregnancy, could still be changed by legislation and the Government would not have to go to the people by way of a referendum to bring about that change.  However, so far as sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 applied to the foetus after 28 weeks of pregnancy the abolition of those sections or any change in them would have to be referred to the people by way of a referendum.  That would be a highly illogical and unreal situation.</P>
    <P>I am sure that no properly instructed Supreme Court could interpret this amendment in such a way as to give rise to such a misleading, illogical and unreal situation.  Even if it did the position would then be that the unborn child is still protected in the same way as it is protected now up to the end of the 28th week of pregnancy and it would be protected by the law, copperfastened by the Constitution, after the 28th week of pregnancy. The protection of the child who is conceived but is as yet unborn is somewhat strengthened.  It is in no way weakened and, consequently, I cannot understand the Attorney General's argument in this context.  He has also argued that the words &ldquo;with due regard to the equal right of the mother&rdquo; in the amendment can give rise to a situation &mdash; we are talking about very exceptional circumstances &mdash; where a doctor would not be permitted to intervene to save either the life of the mother or the life of the child in a situation where it had to be one or <Col N="2009" /> the other.  That situation is governed by medical ethics and medical ethics are part of the natural law.  The Attorney General, Mr. Sutherland, should know better than anybody else in the House that the natural law is superior and antecedent to all positive law.  Consequently, no problem arises here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter made a few interesting remarks in the course of his contribution which I read carefully.  He said that the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; was wide enough to cover children who had not yet been conceived. Accordingly, if the amendment not only protects the right to be born after being conceived but in fact protects the right to be born and that right includes the right to be conceived, then the right to the availability of contraceptives, which was established by the Supreme Court in the McGee case and incorporated into legislation in 1979, could be challenged.  That was Deputy Shatter's viewpoint.</P>
    <P>One could ask oneself if this is really a realistic argument.  It seems to me there are two fundamental objections to it.  The McGee case decided that the right to the availability of contraceptives was implicit in the Constitution as it stands. It is not a right expressed in any Article but it is a right implicit in the Constitution as it stands.  We must ask ourselves would the Supreme Court be inclined to interpret a subsequent amendment to the Constitution as being directly contrary to a right, which the same Supreme Court had found to be clearly implicit in the Constitution as it was before the amendment?</P>
    <P>As Deputy Shatter pointed out, there are a number of possible logical interpretations of the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;. Consequently I cannot see why the Supreme Court would take the one interpretation which would directly conflict with the right which it had already found to be implicitly in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The second objection I would have to Deputy Shatter's argument is from a reading of the amendment as a whole. The amendment refers to the equal right of the mother of the unborn.  Consequently the unborn person, who is being protected by the Constitution, is envisaged to have a mother.  Can it be said <Col N="2010" /> realistically that a person who is not yet even conceived has a mother?  I suppose it may be a possible interpretation but it is one which is highly unlikely to be taken.  Deputy Shatter said also that since the Constitution has been found to be a vibrant, living, legal document many rights have been found to be implicit in the Constitution, which were not foreseen at the time it was drafted.  He stated that many such rights may also be found to be implicit in this amendment, which were not foreseen at the moment when it was being drafted.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State had a rather similar argument when he referred to a Pandora's Box which could be opened at some time in the future and at this point in time nobody knew what would be contained in it.  That argument is nonsensical. Since the Constitution is a vibrant, living, legal document many rights which were not expressly stated have been found to be implicit in it.  I am sure that many others will be found to be implicit in it as social conditions and economic conditions change.  If Deputy Shatter's argument is taken as a reason for rejecting this amendment then, in effect, we should abandon the entire Constitution now because many things may be found in the future to be implicit in the Constitution as it now stands which are not foreseen at the moment.  Therefore, the argument does not get us anywhere.</P>
    <P>There is one point, however, on which I would like to record my agreement with Deputy Shatter.  I am of the opinion that if this amendment, as presently worded, is adopted then the Supreme Court will at some time in the future&mdash;I am inclined to think it will be the more immediate future&mdash;be able to conclude from it, in conjuction with some other provisions of the Constitution, that there is an absolute right to life for everybody in the State, whether born or unborn and that right to life enjoys absolute protection even against the State itself.  This would involve the Legislature being forced to abolish capital punishment.  I would enthusiastically agree with that development. It would be very desirable.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the point that we can do anything with the wording of <Col N="2011" /> any legislative provision if we examine it sufficiently closely.  If you take the words &ldquo;defend and vindicate&rdquo; the right to life of the unborn in the amendment you could argue about those.  For example, we presume that in order for the right to life of the unborn to be defended or vindicated abortion will have to be a criminal offence.  What sort of penalty would be necessary in order that we could say that the right to life of the unborn was defended and vindicated by the law prohibiting abortion?  Would 14 years' imprisonment be sufficient to vindicate the right to life of the unborn?  Would ten years be sufficient, or even a year, or would such vindication require 20 years? We can do anything with the wording if we examine it closely enough.  If the Supreme Court were to interpret the wording of the amendment at some time in the future in the way in which the Attorney General has envisaged, the court would be going out of its way deliberately to decriminalise abortion.  Any court at any time can twist the wording of legislation or the wording of the Constitution so as to make it mean what the court wishes it to mean.  We trust our courts not to do that but is the fact that the courts can act in this way at any time a reason for our attempting no longer to make written laws?  I do not think it is.</P>
    <P>I have something to say about the campaign being waged on each side in respect of this amendment.  Although I am a member of the Limerick Pro-Life Society I am prepared to say that the tactics adopted by both the pro and the anti people have been deplorable.  I have been both sickened and disgusted with this situation and I condemn in the strongest possible terms the tactics being used by both sides.  However, while I disagree with some of the tactics being adopted by the pro-life campaigners, their basic motivation is sound.  It is the motivation of the anti-amendment people that I question seriously.  The immediate and almost instinctive response of the anti-amendment campaigners to the amendment is that it will not achieve anything. On many occasions in my own life, both in a personal and in a professional capacity, <Col N="2012" /> I have found it necessary to advise people that certain courses of action they wished to take would not achieve any objective but having offered that advice I did not go out of my way to work day and night or to generate a lot of publicity or enthusiasm to stop those people from acting as they wished.  It is extraordinary that the anti-amendment campaigners have invested such a colossal amount of energy, enthusiasm and finance in order to prevent something which they believe will not achieve anything.  Consequently, their motivation must be seriously in doubt.  As time goes on their statements and to some extent their membership, if examined closely, may indicate something more sinister than simply protecting the Irish people against themselves.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment has said, there are many social problems facing us and there are many antiquated laws which need to be updated and in some cases abolished.  There are many thorny issues that need to be tackled.  I urge the people, particularly the anti-amendment campaigners, to devote some of their energy to changing and updating those laws which have caused a great deal of hardship, misery and suffering to many Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea has referred to the campaigners on both sides in regard to this amendment and he tells us that, as seems to be the position of other Deputies also, he is involved in the pro-life campaign.  At the outset I wish to make it clear that I have not been involved in the campaign one way or the other outside of this House. The decision I have taken has not been taken in response to any campaign but simply on the question of the issue as I see it and my decision has been to oppose the amendment.  In the course of this debate I consider it necessary to explain the stand I have taken but before doing that I wish to comment on the contributions that we have had so far in this debate, many of which I have listened to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the position that has been adopted in the debate it seems to me almost obligatory when speaking on this <Col N="2013" /> issue to preface one's remarks by stating a case for or against abortion.  Those who oppose the amendment, either in an organised way or on an individual level, emphasise repeatedly that they see no contradiction in doing so while at the same time opposing abortion.  This is a valid argument and one that is crucial to any objective debate on this issue.  The emphasis of many Deputies speaking in favour of the amendment has been on the issue of abortion.  In many cases they have concentrated on the issue of abortion on demand.  I do not see the issue in those terms.  I see the primary question as being one of amending the Constitution and of why it should be necessary to do so in this instance.</P>
    <P>Our law ensures that abortion is not available in this State and no objective observer would suggest that Irish courts would at some time in the future facilitate the introduction of abortion on demand. Furthermore, for those thousands of Irish women who take a decision in conscience and who find it necessary to go to Britain in order to have abortions, the amendment will change nothing.  Surely, then, the issue is far more complicated than simply the question of one's moral stand for or against abortion.  There are other considerations that are of importance to all of us as well as to this institution but before referring to those considerations I wish to draw attention to one other point.  Having said that I am opposed to the amendment and that I will be voting against it, I am conscious of the fact that regardless of how I make use of the debate here to articulate my views, my stand, as well as the stand of any other Deputy who opposes the amendment, will be construed at least by some as adopting a position in defence of abortion. But I do not intend to be influenced by the atmosphere of moral intimidation surrounding this issue.  There are people in our society, both inside and outside this House, who have in the past politicised this question and thus abused what is a sensitive moral issue.  One Deputy, who made a very excellent contribution earlier in this debate, said &ldquo;If I were to vote against it or abstain, it would instantly be misconstrued, sincerely and <Col N="2014" /> accidentally by some, but I have no doubt unscrupulously and maliciously by others&rdquo;.  I have no doubt that there are a great many Deputies who are fearful of being misconstrued, maliciously or otherwise, who are being deeply influenced by that fear and are refusing to speak out against this amendment and against those forces behind it.  I must admit to sharing that fear.  That threatening cloud has overshadowed from the very beginning what has been termed a pro-life campaign.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Kelly's disgust &ldquo;that the leaders of the two big parties should have felt compelled in the heat of an approaching election to give an undertaking in a matter so serious as amending the Constitution&rdquo;.  That draws attention to a very important question.  Why this urgency &mdash; one might almost say indecent haste &mdash; with which the referendum is being pursued?  Why, amid such desperate social and economic difficulties, should we have a most costly referendum on a matter which is already more than adequately catered for in the law of the land?  No responsible Government would, of their own choosing, be so wasteful of time and money when all our efforts should be concentrated on the massive problems of unemployment and growing social inequality.  The only reason &mdash; and I emphasise the word &ldquo;only&rdquo;&mdash; that a referendum is proposed on this issue is because a small, unrepresentative group, using as its <i>modus operandi</i> political and moral blackmail, trapped the main party leaders into an ill-advised and hasty promise prior to an election, at a time when they were at their most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>This surely elicits a serious question: can anybody agree that this is the way to initiate proposals to change the Constitution of the State?  If we are to have a referendum to change the Constitution, then we, the elected representatives, should examine, discuss and agree, calmly and carefully, changes that are urgent and necessary to achieve social advancement for our people.  Surely that is the criterion for such a referendum, not the abuse of the democratic process whereby politicians are trapped into a <Col N="2015" /> hasty commitment on a highly emotive and sensitive issue by a group of individuals with no mandate whatever.</P>
    <P>Any Government which do not stand firm against such intimidation must accept the charge of moral cowardice.  It is ironic that when vital questions are raised in this House &mdash; for example, the Kenny Report on building land &mdash; we are told that this would be difficult to implement because it might prove to be unconstitutional. We then set up a Dáil committee to look further into the question and, hopefully, the issue goes away.  It never dawns on us that perhaps that is an urgent question which necessitates constitutional change.  There are indeed many other examples of positive changes which could be made if the political resolve existed.  The problem of marriage breakdown has been the subject of Dáil questions and has been referred to a Dáil committee.  This widespread human predicament, for which the existing law does not provide, is apparently not as urgent as the pro-life amendment, as it is called. I hope that the Minister will explain to the House how major social problems such as those which I have mentioned, which clearly require remedial legislation, can be set aside while a meaningless and unnecessary referendum is thrust on the people.  Is it intended to divert or sidetrack attention away from those vital social questions by plunging the country into a pointless emotional crusade?  That may not be the intention, but it will certainly be the end result.</P>
    <P>Another bewildering aspect of this referendum is its sectarian nature, the most ready reply to which charge is that it is not sectarian, despite the fact that all the Protestant churches &mdash; Methodist, Presbyterian, Church of Ireland &mdash; have stated publicly their opposition to the amendment.  Surely, its introduction can only widen the gap between the majority and minority churches and, inevitably, between North and South.  This is all the more bewildering since the Taoiseach has been foremost in promising a constitutional crusade designed, in his view, to produce precisely the opposite effect &mdash; that is, the bringing together of the different <Col N="2016" /> traditions.  How can he reconcile his stated aim of national reconciliation with this narrow, sectarian, unnecessary amendment?  That is something which I hope we will hear explained to the House.  So blatantly sectarian is the amendment, and now with the public opposition of the Protestant churches, there is a strong case for arguing that the proposed amendment is repugnant to the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of conscience.  As the Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral said so succinctly recently: &ldquo;You have a right to your opinion and I to mine, but to enshrine one particular denominational opinion in the Constitution is sectarian.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yet a further contradiction which should not go unnoticed is that, in the midst of cut-backs and calls for financial stringency, an estimated £1 million is to be spent on the referendum.  Surely that is an unacceptable extravagance?  If the Government were to allocate that money to Women's Aid, or to a special project for itinerant children, that gesture would be far more pro-life than this amendment will ever be.  It is noteworthy that the budget included an allocation of around £½ million to be set aside for a new agency to combat poverty &mdash; this paltry sum to combat poverty throughout the State while twice that sum is to be literally thrown away on a referendum which will change nothing, will not improve the quality of life of one single child in this State.  There cannot be any justification for such extravagance.</P>
    <P>I can see no intrinsic value in holding this referendum.  The only possible justification would be if there were a clearly defined threat to the existing law.  If there were a strong lobby calling for abortion on demand and a degree of sympathy in the House to such a lobby, then a referendum would be justifiable.  There is no such threat and, indeed, no possibility of that being the case in the foreseeable future.  It is evident that the vast majority of the people I represent are opposed to abortion on demand.</P>
    <P>If this referendum were necessary to uphold the present position, then I would certainly vote for it.  However, by any stretch of the imagination the referendum <Col N="2017" /> cannot be seen to be necessary at this time.  To say that it is now necessary to change the Constitution is as inaccurate as the term &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; itself.  If those who have spent so much time and effort orchestrating this campaign were genuinely pro-life, then they would take up the cause of the poor and underprivileged and mount a campaign on behalf of the homeless and the jobless, against the inequality and poverty that brings so much suffering to so many of our children. Any SPUC member or pro-life campaigner who does not have a record of work on behalf of the poor must be open to the charge of hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>Should this amendment be passed then the State's guarantee to protect the life of the unborn inevitably will become as meaningless a phrase as that contained in Article 41, which recognises the family as having imprescriptible rights superior to all positive law.  As one of our most prominent historians, Dr. F.S.L. Lyons, points out, here the reality does not approximate even remotely to the ideal &mdash; children still go hungry and mothers age prematurely, rearing large families in desperate housing conditions.</P>
    <P>On the other hand it is significant that many of those individuals and organisations who oppose this amendment have been prominent in seeking social reform to make life more tolerable for the oppressed and disadvantaged.  I do not think the same can be said of the SPUC people, as they call themselves.  Indeed, one lady Deputy on the Government side of the House, who has been prominent in her association with SPUC since its foundation, sees no contradiction in being associated openly and unashamedly with class-based campaigns against the building of corporation houses in middle class areas and more recently against the Howth hostel for homeless children.  I find it exceedingly difficult to understand the logic of that Deputy's concept of the term &ldquo;pro-life. Although I accept that I may have chosen an extreme case, those double standards must necessarily be reflected in the entire so-called pro-life campaign to a greater or lesser degree.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2018" /> As a society we tolerate the extremes of wealth and poverty in which at least a quarter of our people suffer the most acute deprivation.  We now wish to declare to the world that we respect the right to life.  As a representative of communities where poverty is a part of everyday life, I could hardly support such hypocrisy.  When we have a Constitution which guarantees the right of every family to a home, the right of every adult to a job and every child to a full and meaningful education and to health services, then our Constitution will be pro-life.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment will not achieve anything positive, only an implied negative smear on those Irish women who make what must be a most tortuous decision.  I will have no part in any such smear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear some time ago that I am not particularly enthusiastic about this amendment.  I said that, if there was a free vote on this amendment, certainly I would be voting against it.  I made it clear at that time, and do so again, that a free vote can only operate when it is free all round, when the Whip is lifted on all parties and when all parties agree that a question is left emphatically to the individual decision of the Deputy.</P>
      <P>That is not the case in this debate.  At the outset, may I say I will be voting with my party in favour of the amendment in line with the commitment given by my party in the general election.  I regret that this is so, because if ever there was a case for a free vote in this House this is one. I have no doubt that, if there was a free vote, the referendum would be held, that there would be in this House a sizeable majority voting out of conviction for the holding of this referendum.  If there was a free vote I believe that vote would more accurately reflect the true feelings of people in this House on the question of whether or not this referendum should be held.  Certainly it would be a much more accurate reflection of what is the true feeling in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would also be very much in line with what I believe is the true feeling in the country, not on the question of abortion <Col N="2019" />&mdash; because if ever there was an issue on which there is almost universal concensus it is against abortion &mdash; but on whether or not it should be necessary to hold this referendum.  Anybody here who reflects what she or he hears knows that throughout the country the people are divided on whether or not there should be a referendum. We Deputies come across it each day.  I come across it talking to students. I come across it in my constituency, in the pub.  I come across it talking to old people and young people, men and women.  We all know that people are disagreeing on whether or not there should be a referendum.  They are doing this calmly, in good faith.  They are doing it without abusing each other's motives. They see it as an issue on which it is possible to have honest doubts as to whether an amendment is a good thing at present or ever.  It is possible to disagree without being bitter about one's opponents without casting doubts on their bona fides, without thinking that anybody who opposes the holding of a referendum is in some way ambivalent on the basic question of abortion.</P>
    <P>That is the position in the country. That is how people see it in urban and rural Ireland and across all age groups. All of us who go to meetings, as all of us do in this House will see first of all that very many people are not particularly turned on by this whole issue anyway; but those who are are much more open-minded in their approach than is the official party line in both of the major parties in this House.  It is a question on which there is room for honest doubts and disagreement.  It is a pity that in this debate we here cannot be as open and as honest as are the ordinary people outside the House.  It is a pity also, and I regret it, that we in this House have allowed what is an extremely important and sensitive moral issue to become a political football and, in some cases, though happily in very few, to be used to denigrate the integrity of opponents or used for immediate political advantage.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to most speakers in this debate and have read what everybody has said.  I would say that the <Col N="2020" /> tone of the debate has been at a very high level: for the most part the tone of the debate has been one of tolerance and of at least attempting to understand the case even if one did not necessarily agree with it.  A lot of the credit for this must go to Deputy O'Hanlon, the new Fianna Fáil spokesman on Health, who set a very balanced and dignified tone for this debate.</P>
    <P>I would take certain exception to what Deputy O'Dea said.  I do not belong to any group.  I make up my mind on this matter as best I can.  I have written to both sides, I have talked with both sides and have read what I could.  I believe that no side has a monopoly of intolerance or bigotry in this matter.  There are extremes on both sides.  But I regret very much that Deputy O'Dea felt compelled to bring into question the good faith of the vast majority on the anti-amendment side.  No less than those on the pro-amendment side they are trying to be honest, and trying to speak with conviction on what to all of us is an important and central question.  I am sorry he saw fit to cast doubt, indeed almost to introduce an element of smear, on some of those people, especially since they are not in a position to reply under the privilege of the House.</P>
    <P>I want to outline the reasons why I am most unenthusiastic about holding this referendum.  Like Deputy Gregory-Independent and Deputy Kelly and many others who spoke, I am very unhappy about the way in which this amendment came about.  As is now well known, commitments were given without proper debate, without proper thought, and without proper consultation.  They were given without the type of reflection which should always precede any change in the law, and which most emphatically should always precede a change in our basic law, the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We all know there were election pressures. We all know there is a degree of distrust between the leaders of the two main parties in this House which probably has not been equalled since the first decade of the State.  Perhaps in part that explains why the party leaders were so quick to rush in.  Perhaps it explains why <Col N="2021" /> there was not fuller consultation on a matter which should never have been agreed to at such short notice and without a proper, full debate.</P>
    <P>During the election campaign those of us who had doubts should have come out and said so.  I expressed my reservations to people who spoke to me.  I said there was a commitment to the holding of a referendum and that commitment would be honoured.  That is the position today. Those of us who had reservations were caught up in the rush of events.  I am not apologising for that now.  I am not particularly proud of it but it happened.  We were afraid that what seemed to be a peripheral issue, a red herring, would become a central issue in the campaign, and the main thrust and the main concern of the election would be side-tracked.</P>
    <P>I agree emphatically with Deputy Kelly that all parties in this House should have a self-imposed embargo on commitments made, as he said, in the octave of an election period when groups find political parties at their most uncertain.  All politicians are like this.  There is no point in people on the opposite side adopting a holier-than-thou attitude.  All politicians are nervous before elections.  Pressure groups know they have politicians in a vulnerable position.  That was never more true than over the past year or two, given the record of political instability and the fevered atmosphere of Irish politics during that time.</P>
    <P>This pressure group exploited that situation brilliantly and effectively.  I do not blame the pro-amendment people for having done that.  They saw an opportunity. They were deeply concerned to get their point of view across and to achieve an objective, and they used that opportunity brilliantly.  They did it effectively and in good faith, and that is why this House is having a debate today on this amendment.</P>
    <P>I am unenthusiastic about holding a referendum on this amendment because of the principle involved in the way it was rushed into the House.  My second reason for my lack of enthusiasm about this amendment is that I feel very deeply we should not change our Constitution until all other means of achieving the desired <Col N="2022" /> objective have been explored.  There is no urgency at present about this question. There is no case before the High Court let alone the Supreme Court to change the law on abortion.</P>
    <P>As Deputy John Kelly, who is the foremost constitutional expert on this subject, pointed out changes in the Constitution do not take place overnight. There will be at least a year's notice, and perhaps two years, while the process works its way through the legal system. As he also pointed out, the entire ethos of our courts system is very different from that of the other legal systems cited by those who fear, and perhaps fear very genuinely, that they could wake up in the morning and find the law has been changed.  That will not happen.  The process is much more lengthy and the ethos of our courts is very different.</P>
    <P>There is no urgency, no pressure about this.  There is no immediate threat, no immediate danger.  For that reason, the whole question should have been examined much more carefully and at greater length in the normal legislative process. Normally when we face a difficult question we set up an all-party committee. We know that in changing the Constitution there should be as wide a degree of consensus as possible.  We know the matter should be fully examined, all the possibilities should be studied in detail, the best possible expert advice should be got not outside the House but inside the House.  That is why we have all-party committees.  That has always been the approach to changing the Constitution. At least there is a proper in-depth examination and a major public debate beforehand.</P>
    <P>We have plenty of time for that approach.  There is no immediate threat. Yet no attempt has been made &mdash; not even a start was made in this House &mdash; to examine the present situation, to ask ourselves if the existing legislation, the 1861 Act, is in danger of becoming outdated or needs to be strengthened.  We made no attempt to see in what ways our social services or our educational services could be improved to prevent the very thing we are talking about, that is, to prevent people having to seek abortions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2023" /> We did not begin to examine those questions.  There is a whole range of allied aspects of this matter which we as legislators, we as the elected Parliament, should have examined.  We should have sought the best possible advice to see if the law was working and whether it needed strengthening.  Then in here we should have examined in detail whether there was a possibility at some stage in the future of this legislation being found unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>That debate should have taken place in the calmness of a committee of the whole House, away from fevered political activity, away from the pressures of elections, away from the immediate concerns of this House.  That would have been a simple process.  That is the way it should have been done.  That process was not engaged in and it reflects badly on this House that it was not done.  On the few occasions in our history that we changed our Constitution, we did not rush lightly into changing it.  We did not say it must be done as quickly as possible, that there was not time for a full debate, that we would not utilise the existing process of examination and the existing means by which parliament itself could strengthen the legislation or find out what difficulties or weaknesses existed in it.</P>
    <P>Everyone in this House, from whichever party, surely has sufficient respect and reverence for our Constitution to agree that changing it is something which should not be undertaken lightly or in a hurry.  We should approach changing our Constitution at a much slower pace and only when all other devices have failed. The case for immediate change and an immediate referendum has not been made.  We have not even begun to exhaust the possibilities in this House of strengthening the legislation and achieving the objective all four Deputies sitting in the House want to achieve.  I am certain all four of us are at one in the objective we wish to achieve.  We are sitting in a sovereign parliament but the initiative did not come from us.  It was not set by the political parties but from pressure from outside groups.  As a parliament we have ceded a certain amount of our <Col N="2024" /> respect and sovereignty in not standing up and doing it our way.  Any other approach represents a partial abdication of our responsibilities.  I am speaking about the way in which this Bill came before us.  It may be that the end result will be that we will see the referendum on the same wording but let us do it in such a way that the self-respect of the House is not damaged.</P>
    <P>In the twenties the founders of the State took the view that the Constitution should be easily amended.  If 75,000 people signed a petition requring a constitutional change a referendum would be held.  This was in tune with the thinking at the time that democracy should be made as accessible as possible.  That device was abolished in 1928 because the Government of the day saw that there was a clash between the sovereignty of the Government and easy access to referenda. This abolition was opposed by Mr. de Valera at the time but in 1937 when he drew up his own Constitution he made no attempt to introduce this popular initiative.  He saw clearly that there could be a clash between the two different concepts of Government.  This clash is best illustrated in the experience of modern France where Charles de Gaulle, who hated parliament and parliamentarians, consistently used the referendum as a weapon against them and played down the power of parliament.  He did this with purpose and with considerable success.</P>
    <P>Mr. de Valera with wisdom saw that easy access to a referendum could undermine the position of parliament since parliaments from time to time have to make hard decisions and take unpopular measures. One of the reasons for a five-year parliament is to protect it from the fury of the people.  Mr. de Valera, who spoke so strongly on this issue nine years earlier, made no attempt to have easy access to a referendum.  In fact he designed his Constitution to ensure that referenda would be initiated by parliament.  The practice through the years has been that a referendum is not undertaken lightly and the pressure for one comes from within the House and not outside.</P>
    <P>There are some who feel that this is a bad system and that the Constitution is <Col N="2025" /> too remote.  Some would like to see us going back to the system which operated in 1922 but which was later abolished. When this referendum goes through there will be a move back to the old position and there will be pressure from outside to hold referenda on a wide variety of issues, some of which have been mentioned.  We are setting a precedent in that the House is responding to outside pressure.  I am not judging whether this is good or bad.  Perhaps it is good.  There will be other pressing and important issues on which constitutional change will be demanded and it will be hard to answer the arguments put forward.  If ACRA say there should be a referendum to abolish ground rents it will be difficult to deny them the right to hold a referendum. If the divorce action group say they have reliable information that over 50 per cent of the people believe that divorce is a constitutional right and that the Constitution should be changed in relation to the whole concept of marriage and divorce can we say that they do not have a right to hold a referndum?  If some group say that the concept of Irish neutrality must be enshrined in the Constitution as something that is unchangeable for all time and they say they have survey data which shows that 75 per cent of the people want this, can we say they cannot have a referendum or that the changing of the Constitution must begin in this House?  Perhaps we should go back to the 1922 model of the Constitution and encourage direct popular democracy.  It would make our lives much easier.  We would not have to make hard decisions and we could blame the people if things went wrong and say: &ldquo;You voted 60/40 in favour of a particular issue&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is an important precedent being established in so far as changing the Constitution in future is concerned.  Perhaps that is good but let us be clear that we are now inviting other groups to have an equally legitimate case to say: &ldquo;At least give us a chance to let the people speak directly on this matter.&rdquo;  It will be hard to resist some of the cases which will be made.  For these two reasons I am unenthusiastic about the referendum &mdash; the way in which it was initiated and the <Col N="2026" /> danger I see to the constitutional practice involved.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the proposed wording is sectarian.  The word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; is used too loosely in this context. There is a certain amount of woolliness on the part of those who oppose the amendment and this charge has been unjustly thrown at many of those who support it.</P>
    <P>I have certain mild criticisms to make on the role of the Protestant Churches in this matter.  A certain amount of confusion was caused by the early statement of the Protestant Churches that they did not see anything wrong with the wording proposed. Later they said they had difficulty with it.  Like politicians, I understand that they had the same pressures of time in this regard but I would have preferred if they had been more authoritative on the matter.  A certain amount of confusion is laid at their door.  I have not been fully convinced by all of Dean Griffin's arguments. Some of what he has said could be termed sectarian.  I do not think the wording is sectarian but this is the first time in our history that we are rushing forward with a measure about which most of the Protestant Churches and those of the Jewish faith have reservations.  That those reservations should be expressed publicly should give us some cause for thought.</P>
    <P>On the question of sectarianism, much was said about the intolerance of Northern Protestants and what right had they to lecture us on the creation of a tolerant society.  To argue along these lines is to go for a wrong but easy answer. We do not take our standards in this House or this country from bigotry.  We do not compare ourselves to those who have disgraced the name of tolerance and religion in Northern Ireland over the decade. We are a proud and independent republic.  We have always prided ourselves on respecting the rights of minorities. We do this because it is right.  We do not do it for any other reason.  It is not to impress the people in Northern Ireland or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>For that reason the reservations of the Protestants and other groups have to be taken very seriously.  For that reason, if <Col N="2027" /> for no other reason, we should take our time and make sure everything has been fully discussed, because no matter what we do here it will be seen by our enemies in Northern Ireland as wrong.  We cannot change that, so let us make it clear that, when we say we are worried about the reservations of Protestant leaders and Protestant churches, we are worried for the right reasons &mdash; because it is the right thing to do and is part of our tradition and if we do not do it the word &ldquo;republicanism&rdquo; has no meaning.  If we can do that we can reassure the many Protestants in Northern Ireland who are kindly disposed to this part of the island that this is not the case of a majority steamrolling minority groups into submission on a sensitive moral issue.  In many ways that is how it has been represented, and we can reassure the many Protestants in this part of the country who are worried that this is not the case either.</P>
    <P>When I made my maiden speech in the Seanad it was on a constitutional crusade initiated by the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald.  I thought the idea of a constitutional crusade was a good thing, an exciting innovation in Irish politics and I still think so.  After 40 years of the present Constitution, excellent in most respects, we have reached the stage where a comprehensive, objective, free-ranging review would be good for all of us and for the Constitution itself.  Any change in the Constitution at the present time should be part of that overall review.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that there is no pressure, no urgency, for this new legislation. There is no case before the High Court, let alone the Supreme Court.  If we are talking about changing the Constitution there is every case for bringing forward this pro-life amendment and making it part of an overall, constitutional review where the full working of the Constitution would be examined freely and objectively.  I regret that rushing forward with this referendum is going to blunt the impetus for other necessary constitutional changes which I believe are urgently needed and highly desirable &mdash; not to impress the people in Northern Ireland but because there are aspects of <Col N="2028" /> our society and Constitution which, in the interests of all the people, deserve to be looked at carefully, if not to be changed.</P>
    <P>On the controversy of the wording of the amendment, I was very pleased to hear Deputy D. Andrews, whom I regard as one of the most thoughtful humane members of the Opposition, make a plea for an agreed form of wording.  Deputy D. Andrews no more than many people must share the deep sense of unease felt by so many eminent lawyers and doctors who have told us the present proposed wording is inherently dangerous, and that there are implications and consequences which could be the exact opposite to what was intended by those most in favour of the amendment.  I am not one to rush in when doctors and lawyers are discussing matters which very often are above the heads of most of us.  But if eminent disinterested lawyers and doctors tell us, out of public duty and concern, that the wording is defective and could have consequences which would be the exact opposite of what was intended, the least we owe them is to take what they say seriously, listen to what they say and try to get a better form of wording.  I am worried by the insistence of some of those pro-life people that the present form of wording is perfect, cannot be improved on and that we are insisting that this from of wording go ahead.  Let us take pause on this matter and get agreement.  If we are going to have wording it should be possing to discuss this matter away from the party whip and get the most acceptable form of wording possible.  This is a matter on which, as Irish people seeking the same ultimate objective, it is almost obscene to talk in terms of rigid party lines, with one group having a monopoly of wisdom or right on this question.</P>
    <P>I regret that this amendment has come before this House the way it did.  One consequence of this campaign may well be, as the eminent Dominican, Dr. Fergal O'Connor, pointed out at the end of an extremely thoughtful essay, to promote an increasing awareness among people of abortion and create what he called an abortion mentality.  I hope he is <Col N="2029" /> wrong, but he is one of the most prophetic people I have met and I am afraid he may be all too right, that the end result of the debate may be very different to what was intended by those who initiated the campaign.</P>
    <P>I regret, as did Deputy O'Dea and others, some of the language that has surrounded the debate, especially the too easy branding of those who were anti-amendment as pro-abortion.  Those who have indulged in that practice did not do themselves or their cause any good.  The campaign in this House has been an honest one, but outside I am afraid some of the tactics used by people on both sides have often fallen far short of truth and honesty.  I regret the way we have rushed into this whole question of constitutional change when there was no immediate pressure or external threat.  This is a matter which requires and deserves calm deliberation and the least we can have is the fullest possible consultation with all interested groups.  I regret that we have rushed in without taking enough time to examine fully the views of all minority churches.  I also regret that we may do our well deserved tradition and reputation for respecting minority points of view harm from which we will not easily recover.  I regret too that so sensitive an issue, on which there is almost certainly national consensus, has been used in some cases for narrow political ends, which reflects no credit on those who so used it.</P>
    <P>It is clear we are going to have a referendum because the majority view in this House is that there should be one.  In that case let us put aside party differences, put our heads together and, without bitterness, get the best possible form of words.  Let us raise the debate both here and outside the House above party differences and show greater tolerance and understanding so that, when the tumult and shouting have died down and when whatever bitterness there is dies away, we can get down to the much more fundamental and important task of trying to eradicate those conditions which have made abortion such a dreadful scourge in modern society.  Then at least we will be <Col N="2030" /> talking in genuine terms about a proper pro-life amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that here or elsewhere we are familiar with the speaker who gives an assurance as to brevity and then burdens his listeners with thoughts which take an hour or two for revelation.  I assure you that I will be the exception to that and I hope I will be finished within 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>The proposed legislation comes before us from the Coalition Government.  I wish to remind the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, of that fact.  Its history is well known.  It arises from the concern of some people in the community as to the position of the unborn and to the uncertain and delicate position which exists in the Constitution in respect of the unborn, a position as delicate and uncertain as its own existence.  Most people, having become aware of that position, alerted me and representatives of other parties to the situation and I had no hesitation in accepting their reminder.  That represents the total blackmail and hijacking that the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, talks about in respect of my position. Other people can speak for themselves. I have sympathy with the people concerned and have no hesitation in indicating to the House that it will be my pleasure to vote for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Manning spoke about agreement with regard to the wording.  A form of words had been agreed upon by the former Government, after consultation with the best legal brains available to them.  The form of words was agreed, presented and subsequently accepted by the present Government.  That agreement is good enough for me.  It may not be good enough for other people, that is their entitlement.  Deputy Manning also said that some legal men are not as happy as others with the wording.  This, inevitably and unfortunately, has been the history of legal men since I first became acquainted with them.  There will never be unanimity among any group of legal men on any point so I do not think we should spend too much time in providing for the unlikely eventuality of every legal <Col N="2031" /> person being unanimous about anything, especially the matter that is before us.</P>
    <P>To say that there are politicians and Taoisigh-designates who would, on the eve of an election, present themselves to the public without giving full thought to what was promised, especially on such a serious matter as this, and to excuse them then subsequently for having done so is a reflection on and an insult to every politician in the House.  I do not want to appear sanctimonious but I would not do it.  I am here since 1969 and I have been lobbied prior to elections by different people and organisations.  Before the last general election a half dozen of my constituents asked me to sign a document that would protect the workers in Ranks bakery.  I said that because I could not predict what was going to happen in respect of the bakery I was sorry I could not put my name to any promise.  I do not wish to present myself as being holier-than-thou but, generally speaking, although there may be exceptions, as in every other profession, politicians do not yield to every pressure put upon then. The Deputy spoke about other people who are concerned about certain matters and that we are setting a precedent.  Let them press their problems.  It is a matter for this House to decide whether or not their entitlement is as forceful or as meritorious as they advocate and, that having been done, we are obliged to represent those people.  We are not here to resist them.  We all take support, consolation and direction from our constituents, and from people in other constituencies.  It would be wrong to give the impression that legislation can only emanate from the combined thoughts of those who are elected here and that we should never be receptive to suggestions from anybody outside this House.</P>
    <P>It was accepted by the last Government that such an amendment was desirable. There was agreement as to the form of words, accepted by the present Government. I recollect that when the Taoiseach was asked about the unexpressed position of the Labour Party and the position in which he would find himself if he were Taoiseach living up to the promise which <Col N="2032" /> he had made of having this introduced before the end of March, he said there would be no difficulty at all, that even in circumstances where the Labour Party might not support it, as was their right, the Fine Gael Party, if Fianna Fáil supported them, would be able to put it through.</P>
    <P>I regret that Deputy Quinn is not present. Did he express the reservations which he made here today prior to the last general election?  Did he say all the things he is saying here?  When, subsequently, he was privy to whatever negotiations took place prior to the establishment of the Government, did Deputy Quinn indicate that he was unhappy and unprepared to serve under the Taoiseach whose Government would introduce this legislation?  If he said he did then my opinion of him, and respect for him, would be greater but if he did not then I must attribute to him the hypocrisy he presumes to attribute to other people. My position in this has been consistent but I do not think one should look for any great credit because of that.</P>
    <P>As I see it, everybody in Ireland is anxious that the position of the unborn should be protected.  How one can move from that position into an area of alleged sectarianism, bigotry or the freedom of Ireland I find difficult to accept.  If the freedom of Ireland depends upon, in the minds of some, the murder of the unborn then it is a freedom I never want to see. If members of other religions or beliefs feel as keenly about this as some of their presumed spokespersons would indicate, I am surprised.  In my constituency there are many people who differ from my religious beliefs but they have not expressed their concern to me in the fashion that was expressed today.  I do not think there is anything sectarian or over-zealous in the matter of religion for me to say that I have an interest in and am concerned for the protection of the unborn.  How can anybody argue that that is a sectarian statement?  Contrary to the present fashion in the matter of religion and what I see as an effort or a tendency for whatever purpose to reduce everything to the lowest common denominator, I believe the need of the times in <Col N="2033" /> which we live is religion in action, not a watering down of everything to a point where nothing exists at all.  In this regard I may be arguing against the fashion of the moment but I would like to see everybody as convinced about their beliefs as I am about mine.  I do not wish to impose my beliefs on anybody.  I have never done so and I never will but I hope all people will be as happy about their beliefs as I am about mine.  I do not propose to make any apologies for my beliefs and I do not believe members of other Churches would respect me if I did so.</P>
    <P>I have moved slightly into the area of religion and accepting the thwarting of the Minister of State in the matter of this being sectarian.  I know I should not do that but on the other hand the time has come when I do not have to be making apologies for our beliefs when nobody can demonstrate to me that my beliefs are in any way prejudicial, injurious or insensitive to my neighbour.  If that proof is given to me I shall readily withdraw and apologise.  We get respect from those who differ from us in accordance with the way we practise, not what we say.  This alleged concern for the members of other religions is not as sincere as it may seem. That is as far as my sympathy will allow me comment on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manning said we were being rushed into something.  I do not have any great feeling of being rushed.  It is possible that Deputy Manning feels he has been rushed but we have been dealing with this for some time.  The matter has been before the people for a year or more.  I do not see any great element of undue expedition.  The point has been made that outside groups are showing an interest in this.  There are groups on either side and that is their entitlement. I would not be critical of any person or group if they feel they should apply themselves to follow a particular course legitimately. That is their entitlement.  We have too many people practising subversion, vandalism and many unwelcome and unnecessary measures.  It is heartening and wholesome to think that there are people who will apply themselves to having changes brought about in a fashion <Col N="2034" /> which is their entitlement and which has been provided for.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ordinary people outside&rdquo; is a term I would never use.  Apart from other considerations it presupposes that the person who uses that term considers himself or herself in some extraordinary fashion. We are all servants of the people outside. We must keep reminding ourselves of that.  I was quietly amused to hear Deputy Gregory in a very conservative fashion &mdash; it reminded me of a form of conservatism that is long gone &mdash; questioning the right of people outside to lobby him about anything.  I do not think Deputy Gregory accepts that premise as applying to everybody.</P>
    <P>His membership of the House has probably arisen from the fact that he was prepared to act as the spokesperson for people in his constituency and achieve for them material gains which were their entitlement but were denied to them for a long time.  That was his entitlement and his response to the will of a certain group of people.  All credit to him for that.  He acted perfectly in doing that.  However, having done that it is strange to hear him suggest that I, or any other Member, should give a deaf ear to those with whom we may have a certain sympathy or a certain affinity.  The inconsistency of that does not appeal to me.  The inconsistency of the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, does not appeal to me.  He criticised all and sundry for being emotive about this issue and went on to say that Members on this side of the House &mdash; I suppose he included his constituency colleagues, the Taoiseach and Deputy J. Doyle &mdash; were being hijacked, blackmailed and intimidated to indulge in what he called a farce. That was the commentary of Deputy Quinn on the Taoiseach who appointed him and on his colleague who has the pleasure, honour and privilege of representing the constituency that also sends Minister of State Quinn here.  He went on then to what I call a rather illogical point where, while being critical of what has happened here, he criticised the Supreme Court and the Constitution.  He criticised the Supreme Court for interpreting the Constitution in a fashion which was prejudicial to tenants in certain <Col N="2035" /> houses in this city.  He cannot have it both ways.  He cannot on the one hand criticise the Supreme Court, criticise the Constitution and allege a certain disregard on the part of the rest of the Members of this House for what I would suggest are more pertinent, more important matters and at the same time point the finger at people, Members of this House, who are taking a certain action prompted perhaps by the wisdom of the seanfhocal &ldquo;Ní hé lá na gaoithe ...&rdquo; so that we can protect the unborn in this country.  If what we are doing had been done by people on whose behalf Minister of State Quinn speaks in connection with his interests on behalf of the tenants of those landlords, then the problem and the injustice to which he refers would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>You, Sir, did not occupy the Chair when I promised the Ceann Comhairle that it was my intention not to speak beyond 15 minutes. I calculate that 12 minutes have now passed and I propose to stay with my promise, for what reasons I do not know.  Perhaps it is (1) to avoid repetition (2) in deference to a discovery which I have made about myself that my initial decision may be superior to my reason and if I were to move into the field now of the men with long gowns and wigs as described by Pádraig Pearse and into the field of words, my reasoning may detract from what I think is the justification and correctness of my decision and my pleasure to vote for this amendment. Contrary to what my colleague, Deputy Manning, would say, the sooner that opportunity comes to me the better.  In the hope that the words presented will be the words decided upon by the last Fianna Fáil Government, accepted by the present Taoiseach, voted on by people in the last election, the sooner that wording for the promised amendment comes the better I will like it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage on both sides of the discussion almost everything that is meaningful has been said.  At the outset of my contribution I want to make a comment on those both within and without <Col N="2036" /> this House who have seen fit to criticise the Taoiseach for having committed himself to including the promotion of this constitutional amendment in our election policy document.  I am certain, and the evidence of volumes of correspondence I have had in relation to the issue prompts me to say, that if he had failed to recognise this issue as of paramount importance to the Irish people he would not be Taoiseach today.  That commitment being given, it is essential that it be honoured to the letter.  The pro-life amendment is about preventing legal abortion, that is the direct killing of unborn life, for as long as the people of Ireland wish the existing ban to remain.  It has no other objective.  The passage of the amendment will confer on the most defenceless group within the human community the same constitutional protection as all of us as citizens enjoy.</P>
      <P>In the submission of the barristers against this amendment, which document was circulated to all Members of this House, they claim that the first and most obvious thing which the amendment would effect would be to acknowledge that for practical purposes in law it confers the right to life on the unborn, that there is no such right in common law nor was such a right ever conferred or acknowledged by statute.  Following traditional Christian theology, Common Law distinguishes between moral and thus the legal status of the foetus and that of the child.  I say to our learned friends that it is precisely for that reason that this amendment is vital.</P>
      <P>Mr. William Binchy, writing as chairman of the life, education and research network in the booklet <i>Abortion Now,</i> answers them more eloquently than I could because of his legal expertise.  He says that abortion raises legal issues of profound significance which go to the very heart of our legal system.  The present law is governed by the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, and it is important to look briefly at the two central provisions of that 1861 Act.  Having regard to their importance they merit quotation in full.  Section 58 provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every woman, being with child, <Col N="2037" /> who, with intent to procure her own miscarriage, shall unlawfully administer to herself any poison or other noxious thing, or shall unlawfully use any instrument or other means whatsoever with the like intent, and whosoever, with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman, whether she be or be not with child, shall unlawfully administer to her or cause to be taken by her any poison or other noxious thing, or shall unlawfully use any instrument or other means whatsoever with the like intent, shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable ...to be kept in penal servitude for life... </P>
    <P>Much talk has taken place about these two sections and I would wager that many people do not realise what the sections are saying.  I have not heard the submission of all who have come to this House and if somebody else has seen fit to record this I can only apologise for repeating it, but it is important that on record in this House should be precisely what we are talking about.  Section 59 of the 1861 Act provides:</P>
    <P>Whosoever shall unlawfully supply or procure any poison or other noxious thing, or any instrument or thing whatsoever, knowing that the same is intended to be unlawfully used or employed with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman, whether she be or be not with child, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,</P>
    <P>Thus the Act never speaks of abortion. Instead it refers to miscarriage, but for practical purposes the terms are interchangeable.</P>
    <P>Section 58 provides for two different situations.  Firstly when a pregnant woman sets out to bring about an abortion on herself she will commit an offence and where any other attempts to bring about an abortion on a woman that person will be guilty of an offence whether or not the woman is pregnant.  Thus a professional abortionist will not escape liability by establishing that, contrary to the belief of both the woman and the <Col N="2038" /> abortionist, the woman was not, in fact, pregnant.</P>
    <P>The history of the abortion laws in most countries indicates a steady progression. We have heard about the risk to the mother's life, abortion based on the mother's health and finally that abortion should be carried out more or less at the discretion of the mother.  Sections 57 and 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, set out the existing law on the subject.  These provisions have never been analysed in any reported decision in Ireland so it is difficult to be certain how a court would determine some important questions that would arise.  These provisions render an abortion an offence without any qualification, unless the word &ldquo;unlawfully&rdquo; is to be interpreted as introducing a qualification.  The position of the unborn child under our Constitution is a matter of debate.  The Constitution gives no explicit protection to the right to life of the unborn, therefore any protection that may be afforded the unborn child must be implied from provisions which do not specifically address the issue.  The matter has not yet been determined in court, so analysis of the problem is necessarily provisional.</P>
    <P>Some passing references have been made by one Supreme Court judge in the case of McGee <i>versus</i> the Attorney-General. Mr. Justice Walsh adverted to abortion in veiled terms when he said that any action on the part of either husband or wife or of the State to limit family size by endangering or destroying human life would necessarily not only be an offence against the common good but also against the guaranteed personal rights of the human life in question.  He was a little clearer in the case of McGee <i>versus</i> An Bord Uchtála in 1979 when he said that a child has the right to life itself and the right to be guarded against threats to its existence, whether before or after birth. He continued that the right to life necessarily implies the right to be born, the right to preserve and defend and to have preserved and defended that life.  It should be noted that when Mr. Justice Walsh was making these comments the other judges saw fit to say nothing.  His comments were <i>obiter dicta</i> and are not <Col N="2039" /> binding on judges in other circumstances or even on himself.  To believe because those things were said that somehow there is a measure of protection would be naive.  Most of us feel that the Supreme Court would not now be receptive to giving legal entitlement to abortion, but can we be confident that in the future three members of that court or one member of the High Court will take the same stance?  We cannot.</P>
    <P>It is desirable to refer briefly to the relationship between legislation and the Constitution on the question of abortion. Some people, while welcoming the terms of this amendment as being just and sensible, nevertheless feel that legislation would be a more satisfactory approach. This would be the proper course and the safe approach in a country having no written Constitution or a Constitution limited to the declaration of specific rights without judicial functions of interpretation. Our Constitution is not framed along those lines.  On the contrary, we have seen our courts charged with very important and wide-ranging interpretative powers.  In the event of a clash between the Constitution and any statutory provisions, the Constitution must prevail and the statutory provisions will be struck down.  However satisfactory a particular statute may be thought to be, neither the views of the legislators nor the electorate will be of any avail if the courts take a different view.  Whether or not we wish it otherwise, our Constitution is so drafted that the rights of the unborn can be adequately protected only by an amendment.  A statutory response would afford no definite protection and, worse, could give rise to a false sense of security.  This amendment presents our community with an opportunity to protect the rights of the unborn through our laws.  It also forces us to face up to reality. What are the things which have caused people to take this awful step?  The passage of the amendment protecting the right to life of the unborn must be supplemented by the social and economic changes necessary to bring about a positive environment for mothers and their children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2040" /> In November 1982 the text of the proposed amendment was released.  It provided that the State should acknowledge the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right of the mother, should guarantee in its law to defend and vindicate that right.  The terms of that amendment met with widespread approval and something of relief, not only from the groups who actively sought the amendment but also from the leading members of the various religious denominations.  They included such distinguished Church leaders as the Archbishop of Dublin, the Reverend Dr. McAdoo, and Canon Hartin, both of the Church of Ireland, the Reverend Desmond Gilliland of the Methodist Church, the Reverend W.T. McDowell of the Presbyterian Church, the Catholic hierarchy and the Chief Rabbi.</P>
    <P>After several months during which those opposing the amendment argued that the amendment would be sectarian, it is extremely gratifying that the most recent poll taken both North and South of the Border shows that the one issue in our time which is a uniting factor and on which there is more common ground than any other is the desire to protect the life of the unborn.  The results of that poll published in <i>The Irish Times</i> show that in Northern Ireland 83 per cent of those polled were in agreement with the amendment, as were 87 per cent of people here.  That buried once and for all the red herring of sectarianism.  At the outset all kinds of red herrings were used as reasons for not proceeding with the amendment.  We have buried the red herring of sectarianism and I think even the most ardent anti-amendment campaigners are now ashamed to make any reference to it because it is so ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Science has made great progress in our time.  We do not have to doubt the time when life begins.  I now refer to a lecture delivered by Professor Sir William Liley, who holds the chair of perinatal physiology at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, at the Tiniest Human Conference organised by the Right to Life Association of Toronto and Area on 5 and 6 October 1979.  He stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2041" /> Our generation is the first ever to have a reasonably complete picture of a development of a human being from conception.  It was in 1930 that we first observed the liberation of an ovum from the human ovary.  It was in 1944 that under a microscope we observed the union of human sperm and ovum. In the fifties were spelled out the event of the first six days of human development as steps with the conceptus on a prodigious journey.  In the sixties there were three further advances.  For the first time, not only the diagnosis but also the treatment of a child in the uterus became a possibility.  Secondly, we were able for the first time to observe the foetus on its home ground and, thirdly the genetic code was cracked, the alphabet established in which is spelled out instructions which guarantee that each one of us is different from every person that ever was and ever will be.  One might have thought that these 40 years of discovery which put an end to centuries of guesswork, that this new information would engender a new respect for life before birth and the importance of this stage of life.  Instead around the world we see a systematic campaign hell bent on the destruction of the unborn child for every social and medical purpose.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago abortion was unthinkable in 75 per cent of the world's population. Now, almost 75 per cent of the world's population are living under abortion laws.  This plague has spread across the face of the world.  Surely it must cry to Heaven for vengeance.  If any other living species on this planet was being hounded and disposed of like the human race there would be a cry around the globe that would rend the place asunder. There is a deadly silence.  Why is there a deadly silence about it?  It is a profitable business.  Many of the interests who are promoting the anti-amendment campaign are doing it for profit.</P>
    <P>Abortion was introduced in Britain in 1967, in the USA, 1973, France 1975, Germany 1976, Italy 1978, Holland 1981 and the latest victim is Spain.  I question Deputy Manning and anybody else who <Col N="2042" /> will stand up in the House and try to tell us that there is no urgency and they do not know what we are on about.  I suggest they do some reading about the progress of this scourge.  It is as plain as a pikestaff to me that time is not on our side.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased when I heard my colleague, Deputy Eileen Lemass, refer to Madame Simone Veil, who has the doubtful distinction of having introduced abortion to France, which she seems to boast about.  She commented at the European Parliament in February 1981 that all pressures which could be brought to bear on states who did not have satisfactory abortion legislation would be justified. Where would that leave Ireland in the event of a case being brought to the Court of Human Rights?  Would those who would be deciding for us be of a similar mind to that of the good lady? After abortion what is the next expediency? When you start to cut out one generation it will automatically affect another.  Many countries in central Europe are now seriously feeling the effects of their abortion laws.  Last Friday at a medical gathering of doctors from central Europe I was told that in Holland they are now paying women to hurry up and have babies because they will have no workforce in ten to 15 years time.  The difficulty is that while you are waiting for the children to grow to maturity and become a tax paying element, which is essential in all economies, there will be many old people who will not have the taxpayers there to sustain them.  The next expediency must automatically be the elimination of the old, the infirm and the handicapped.  I have seen all this before. Is that what we are trying to offer the unfortunate young generation?  I am not interested in it.</P>
    <P>I say to those who tell us that we are crying &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; to take a look to what has happened around the rest of Europe. With regard to what we have heard about the terrible medical effects and the dramatic cases which people dream up, it is generally an unfortunate teenager who was raped by a psychopath or something horrendous, which none of us has ever heard happen.  Dr. Kieron O'Driscoll was Master of the National Maternity Hospital <Col N="2043" /> for 35 years and I heard him say at one stage that during the course of his medical career there were 250,000 deliveries and not once did any of his colleagues or himself have to sacrifice the life of a mother for the sake of saving a child.  There is ample medical evidence to refute all the claims being made about cancer of the uterus and all the rest of it. Those cases are treated in the manner appropriate to the patient at risk.  That is another red herring like the sectarian one which now, I believe, because of the integrity of the people in our medical profession who are standing up and telling those people that they simply do not know what they are talking about, can be shot down also.</P>
    <P>Where does that leave us with the critics? They then tell us that the money which will be spent on the referendum in those difficult times could be better spent somewhere else I believe it will cost £700,000.  We pay £1 million a year for our lifeboat services, and they, with God's grace, do not have to go anywhere. Are we saying that it is too costly to save future generations for £700,000 when we are prepared to spend that money on the lifeboat services, or are they so bereft of any kind of balance that they are serious about what they are saying?</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in supporting the words of the amendment which are before the House.  I accepted them when they were presented and I have since given them a lot of thought.  I cannot see that they will not suffice.  If they can be strengthened I will be more than pleased. Perhaps a way to strengthen the wording of the amendment would be to insert after &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;&ldquo;from the moment of conception&rdquo;.  That would copperfasten it. It would leave no doubt in anyone's mind as to what we are talking about.  Without intending any disrespect to my colleagues here or to those who have gone before us or those who may come after us, experience around the world in relation to the issue in question is ample proof that neither the courts nor the legislators, nor indeed the Church, have been able to stop the spread of this horror.  The only safe custodians of God's noble gift <Col N="2044" /> of life are the Irish people.  I do not wish either the legislators or the Judiciary to assume this role because, while I have respect for the people who hold office today, there are people in this country even now whom I would not trust with what I regard as being precious.  In addition, we live in times of changing patterns in political life.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept the amendment. If it can be strengthened, so be it; but not strengthened in a way in which it could be given a dual interpretation. What we must have is a singular understanding of what we are trying to do and I pray that for the sake of coming generations the wisdom of this House will ensure that the necessary amendment will emerge.</P>

      <P>I wish to put on record my admiration for the previous speaker and for her very obvious sincerity and total conviction in regard to the points of view she has put before us.  It was refreshing for me as a new Member to witness this sincerity and conviction on the part of another Member.  Deputy Glenn's closing remarks leave no one in any doubt as to where her priorities lie, not only in relation to this amendment but in relation to values in Irish society today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to add my voice to that of the many speakers from both sides who have pledged their support for the amendment. I am pledged to the wording as put forward, the wording which was put to the Irish people in November last as all-party wording, the wording put forward by Fianna Fáil on their last day in office. Some days late when it looked as if the matter might become an issue in the pending general election, though I do not think anyone wishes that to happen, the now Taoiseach went on record through the media, as did several of his spokespersons, to say that the wording was as near perfect as could be arrived at and that the amendment would not be an issue in the general election.  He said also that if his party were returned to office the amendment they would bring before the House would be the amendment as published by Fianna Fáil.  In addition, the Leader of the then Opposition said that <Col N="2045" /> he had taken the best possible advice on the matter and that this advice indicated that the wording was accurate and correct.</P>
    <P>If the wording was accurate and correct in the climate of the run up to the general election, why is the situation any different in the post-election climate?  Is it not strange that this change should have come about now?  We support the amendment as put forward.  It is the kind of positive amendment that was sought in the first instance.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk of the legal background to this debate but I should like to touch on the sociological implications of many of the aspects involved.  I have been listening to various speakers on both sides in the debate so far, particularly some speakers opposite, and I have noticed that last week and today there is emerging the trend that in some way it is wrong for concerned lobbies to press politicians on any issue but particularly on the issue in question.  I fail to understand why concerned lobbies should not press their point.  Surely that is what democracy is all about.  Is it not for all of us to listen to concerned lobbies, to absorb what they have to say and then to give our findings? Some speakers today expressed the view that there was something wrong in approaching politicians with one's point of view.</P>
    <P>I should like to take issue with one of the groupings involved in the anti-amendment campaign and to take issue especially with the terminology as used in their title.  I refer to the woman's right-to-choose group.  It may sound very liberal and trendy to say that one should have the right to choose, but to choose what?  In the case we are talking of it is a question of the right to choose whether one does away with life or preserves life. So far as I am concerned there is no choice in this matter.  If one procreates and conceives life within one, there is then no choice.  In other words, choice ends when conception occurs.  That is a point that must be made clear.  The right to choose is not the right to choose to do away with life.</P>
    <P>Another point of view put forward by the anti-amendment lobby relates to the <Col N="2046" /> financial aspect of the amendment campaign. In common with the previous speaker I fail to see how the financial aspect can impinge on what is such a very important issue.  Therefore, the question of finance is no more than a red herring and should be treated as tritely as should those who are putting it forward.  How can finance be the consideration when life is at stake, when we are talking, not about people who can protect themselves, but about people who have no way of protecting themselves?  We are talking of the child who is at the mercy of the woman who is bearing him.</P>
    <P>The sectarian issue has been raised too but, as Deputy Glenn has said, this is one that loses its appeal with each day that passes.  The issue in question is the supreme example of what is non-sectarian. It is all embracing.  Therefore, the sectarian tag, too, must be seen for what it is.</P>
    <P>One aspect of this whole area that has not been touched on sufficiently relates to the need for a change in attitude and in perception towards people with unwanted pregnancies.  I have given much thought to this problem and I know that there remains in Ireland in many areas what might be referred to as the lace-curtain twitching syndrome whereby when a young girl or a woman who is unmarried finds herself pregnant there is still an element of castigation towards her.  Perhaps this is the climate that forces women to take a certain course.  It is my hope that when this amendment has been enacted the vital work that has been put into this whole campaign by lobbies concerned for life would then be channelled into creating a climate whereby such women would have access to excellent counselling services, not only at local level but within the community generally.</P>
    <P>In my local authority area we have been enlightened for quite some time on this matter.  Why not?  It is not benevolence; it is plain human right that an unmarried mother have the right to accommodation for herself and her child. This facility should be more widespread. The community should be educated towards accepting that there are many such cases.  Out of this debate on the <Col N="2047" /> entire amendment issue might come a more enlightened and caring attitude towards girls and women who find themselves pregnant and unable to cope.</P>
    <P>There is an excellent organisation called CURA.  I had for a long while felt that they had not publicised their activities sufficiently, but recently on a train journey from the country I was glad to see in the lobby of the local railway station a large advertisement for CURA, giving a private access telephone number and other ways of contacting them.  I thought of a young girl boarding the train from the west of Ireland, the midlands, or anywhere else, looking upon this organisation as a lifeline.  I would like more openness on this issue.  There is no point in pretending that unwanted pregnancies do not happen; they happen every day.  This is a fact of life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly support this Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.  I abhor the tags which have been put on concerned people.  One Opposition Deputy said some weeks ago that he found deplorable the attitude of the pro-life campaign people.  This is unbelievable. In the European league we are one of the few remaining countries &mdash; I know that there is one other &mdash; which have kept their sense of values.  I would not like any Member of this Legislature to wish to go down the trendy, liberal path.  This is a very clear, fundamental and civil rights issue.  It is non-sectarian, with no financial implications.  The right to life is a supreme right &mdash; not the right to choose, but the right to life.  Many would-be opponents of the amendment have brought up issues like rape and incest. The child, conceived, not out of love but out of lust or hate, being a blameless separate entity, is as entitled to life as is the child conceived out of love.</P>
    <P>In the minds of most of the speakers there is awareness that the problems will not end when this amendment is passed. The minds of all interested people should next turn to the task of ensuring the necessary expert counselling and community and financial support.  I would be for strengthening the organisations which give this help and for strengthening the <Col N="2048" /> social services concerned.</P>
    <P>My mind is clear and unequivocal on this issue.  I speak from a very personal conviction and also from my party's viewpoint. I am not blackmailed or boycotted, as some speakers said.  I thought about the issue and the important point was the right to life of the unborn child.  The wording put forward, which I am supporting, is the ideal wording.  I would plead, not for castigation but for compassion in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M. Cosgrave Mr. M. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to be repetitious.  Most speakers have made the important points regarding religious and medical issues.  I am availing of this opportunity to put before the House my beliefs regarding the amendment. Having studied all the literature and the cases put forward by the supporters of the pro-life amendment and the anti-amendment lobby, in what has been commonly referred to as the abortion referendum, I have decided to add my voice in support of the pro-life amendment campaign.  I support the wording of the proposed amendment to the Constitution as drafted and intended to be submitted to the electorate.  However, any replacement wording would not be rejected by me out of hand, but would receive full and adequate consideration. Until a replacement becomes available, I reserve my judgment, but meanwhile I support the existing amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After mature consideration I have come to the conclusion that the life of the unborn child or citizen needs to be more adequately enshrined on our laws.  How more fully can that be achieved than by embodying the same right in the basic legal document of our State and nation, the Constitution of Ireland, or &mdash; as it is commonly known in Irish &mdash; Bunreacht na hEireann?  It will thus be ensured that no law can be enacted by the Oireachtas which would violate that right without first going to the people for their verdict. It was the men and women in the street and in the field who gave to us this Constitution. It is to them that we must return if we want to change it.  If the people of Ireland speak out in this forthcoming referendum in favour of adopting the proposed <Col N="2049" /> amendment, the right to life of the unborn child will be safeguarded in our basic law.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that when the 1937 Constitution was adopted even the most far-seeing eye could not have visualised a scenario in which a single voice, let alone a chorus of voices, would be raised here, some four decades later, clamouring for the right to destroy human life itself at its very source.  Sad to say, that time has arrived.  It is up to us parliamentarians, Members of the Oireachtas, to demonstrate by our laws that we are prepared to defend the human life of those unborn citizens who have, as yet, no voice of their own.</P>
    <P>There are those who would say that abortion is already unlawful in Ireland and is punishable under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, or any section thereof, as a criminal offence and that this, of itself, affords protection to the unborn.  With the present national momentum, however, this limited protection could be easily cast aside, perhaps through a successful action being taken in the courts, by which the same Offences Against the Person Act might be declared unconstitutional on some unforeseen grounds or indeed simply through the lack of enforcement as happened in The Netherlands and elsewhere in the case of anti-abortion laws, and has already happened in Ireland in the case of crime and bigamy.  I say to the men and women of Ireland that we must stand up and be counted on this issue.  Otherwise future generations would be able to castigate us for our failure to act and speak out, thus allowing our nation to follow the example of and go down the same road as that of our neighbouring island.</P>
    <P>In England and other countries where abortion has been introduced the roads are strewn with the remains of half-developed bodies, a whole army of would-be citizens.  The same could happen in this country if abortion was introduced. We would have the remains of half-developed bodies strewn all over the place. We only have to take a look at the abortion figures in England and Wales for the last year for which statistic are available, 1981, to realise the enormity of its scale <Col N="2050" />&mdash; approximately 128,000 abortions were performed in that year, a figure amounting to over 20 per cent of the birth rate of those two countries.  Let us not fool ourselves into thinking that this could not happen in Ireland.  We are already setting out in that direction.  Let us now say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  This is part genocide and cannot be allowed.</P>
    <P>On those grounds I reiterate my support for the adoption of the proposed amendment or an alternative amendment providing safeguards.  I am quite happy with the present wording.  But if a wording is advanced which suits the pro-life people I would be quite happy to support that new wording.  However, the amendment, as now worded, suits me and, in the absence of a better one, I would support it.</P>

      <P>In supporting this amendment of the Constitution I know I am speaking not alone for myself but on behalf of the majority of my constituents and on behalf of the vast majority of our people.  All of us reject abortion as being a terrible crime.  I feel honoured to have a chance to express my view in this House on behalf of the people who want us to bolt and bar the door against any possibility that, by mischance or pressure, abortion might be legalised in the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In affording the people an opportunity of recording their rejection of abortion we are obeying the democratic principles enshrined in our Constitution.  Abortion is deep-rooted in disrespect for life.  The abortion trade is a commercial enterprise yielding substantial profit for its operators. There are pickings to be had by supplying dead, and even live, babies for experimental purposes.  The abortion trade exploits the weaknesses, ignorance and downright badness of those who fall into its clutches.  This evil trade has been responsible for the deaths of over two million unborn children in Britain.  Since abortion was legalised there, by a Private Members' Bill in 1967, the annual number of abortions has been far in excess of 170,000.  In the USA the Supreme Court, by a judgment in 1973, made abortion legal.  Twleve million American children <Col N="2051" /> were killed before birth as a consequence of that judgment.  The annual number of deaths of unborn children in the United States is now a frightening 1,500,000. Even a small country like Denmark, with a population of 5 million, has 25,000 abortions annually.  According to United Nations statistics over 55 million unborn children are killed annually by surgical abortion.  No war has ever recorded such figures or destruction of human life.</P>
    <P>It is of vital importance that this Bill to provide a referendum to afford the people the right to insert into our Constitution an amendment protecting the life of the unborn child be passed.  It is often claimed that we would be the laughing stock of Europe by inserting this protection into our Constitution but the reverse is true.  Many people in many lands would welcome the fact that one country had been able to outlaw this dreadful crime.</P>
    <P>As for the claim that it is sectarian, this has been completely disproved by the clergymen of four denominations who have proclaimed their support for a total ban on abortion for any reason whatsoever. It has been repeated time and again by gynaecologists that there are no circumstances in which the life of the mother can be saved only through the direct killing of her child.  Why then not add a clause to the amendment stating that no law should be enacted permitting abortion of any unborn child at any time from the moment of conception?  Anybody who has studied the question knows that the demand for abortion is the work of a small, vocal group who have the support of a number of people in the media who present their arguments in a fashionable way and ignore or make little of the arguments against abortion.  It has been apparent in recent events that the media are more often than not inaccurate in their assessment of events.</P>
    <P>This amendment is essential because in many countries legislation, similar to our Offence Against the Person Act, has been overturned by the courts.  In America the Supreme Court, on the grounds of privacy, imposed legal abortion on all its states.  In Britain a rape case was used <Col N="2052" /> by the courts to permit abortion.  The same thing would happen here if any hard case was brought to the courts.  If abortion is allowed then in effect it means abortion on demand.  That is what has happened everywhere that abortion has been legalised.</P>
    <P>In passing this Bill this House will do itself an honour and future generations will thank us for having taken the initiative.</P>

      <P>In supporting this amendment I might reiterate what the last speaker and others have said here this evening.  I welcome the opportunity of supporting this amendment in its original wording.  Indeed, I regret the recent change of thinking undergone by the Government in relation to the original wording and which caused distress and anxiety to very many people interested in this pro-life amendment.  I was happy last week to hear the Taoiseach say in this House that he expects to have alternative draft wording within two weeks.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the recent number of large increases in the price of petrol and other oil products and, in view of the effects of these increases on the family budget, calls on the Government to ensure that the price of petrol and oil products to the consumer fully reflects reductions in the world price of oil. </P>
      <P>Molaim an tairiscint seo atá faoi mo ainm agus ainm mo chara, Deputy Ger Connolly, maidir le praghasanna artola ach go háirithe ardú na bpraghasanna le déanaí.  Tá na cánacha nua agus an cháin bhreis-luacha i gceist agus arduithe eile atá taréis teacht isteach ó thús na bliana. Táimid in aghaidh na n-arduithe sin agus táimid ag iarraidh ar an Rialtas athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an scéal ar fad agus na harduithe sin a ísliú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Connolly, and I put down this motion because we are <Col N="2053" /> very concerned about the recent trends in the price of petrol and other oil products.  We were motivated to put down this motion because of the changing world situation and the downward trend in world petrol and oil prices generally. These trends are not beneficial to the consumer in Ireland.  We are concerned about the extra £15 million the Minister intends to take by way of excise duty and which was announced discreetly in the Budget Statement.  We regret it as another hidden tax on motorists.  We are concerned about the devastating effect of these increases in the price of petrol on the household budget of the ordinary workers, and on the economy in general.</P>
    <P>We are astonished at the sheer enormity of petrol prices here as compared with the prices in other economies in this part of the world.  We now have the unenviable reputation of having the most expensive petrol in Europe.  If we take the figures for the price of petrol in other economies we will get an indication of how severe the impact is here.  In the United Kingdom first grade petrol is selling at £1.84 a gallon; in Sweden £1.77; in Norway £2.23; in the Netherlands £2.07; in France £2.22; and in Italy which is always regarded as the most expensive country in Europe, petrol is retailing at £2.71.</P>
    <P>We have by far the highest priced petrol in Europe.  As the Irish £ strengthens the gap with the United Kingdom will widen still further.  There is now a gap of £1 between the Irish price and the British price.  This is unacceptable for many reasons.  Our prices are away above the average in the EEC.  The price of premium petrol here is about 31 per cent higher than the EEC average.  The price of our road diesel is about 45 per cent higher than the average in the EEC. These price structures are unacceptable for many reasons which I will go into now.</P>
    <P>The burden of taxation on petrol is inescapable for virtually every adult in this State.  No consideration is given to one's ability to pay.  Taxation is imposed on petrol without regard to its all-embracing effects on our economy. <Col N="2054" /> Instead of providing a basis for the Irish economy, taxation on petrol is helping to destroy the economy.  It is destroying three elements in particular.  It is destroying our competitiveness; it is destroying our tourist industry; and it is reducing the living standards of our citizens.</P>
    <P>It is destroying our competitiveness. The unit cost of production is related directly to the cost of petrol.  It is also related to transportation costs.  The Government stated in their latest unemployment figures statement that the first point of attack must be on the many competitive weaknesses in the external and domestic markets.  The Government are responsible for one of our most glaring competitive weaknesses.  The price of fuel is a significant cost in virtually every business and productive enterprise.  The Government are responsible for over 50 per cent of the cost of petrol and they intend to enlarge their share still further if the price of oil falls.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude in taking away from the consumer the benefit of any fall in world oil prices exemplifies the narrow fiscal mentality of a Government who are concerned only with keeping their books right and not with the economic welfare of the nation.  The Minister was prepared recently to reduce the excise on less essential items such as beer, spirits, wine, cigarettes and tobacco, all of which constitute discretionary expenditure and, in the case of wine and tobacco, are largely imported.  He was not prepared to do the same for petrol.</P>
    <P>The price of petrol has a detrimental effect on our tourist industry and it is making a nonsense of the promotional aspects of Bord Fáilte's campaign this year.  The price of petrol is destroying the living standards of the majority of our citizens.  We can no longer say petrol is a luxury item for householders.  It is an everyday necessity and can no longer be regarded as discretionary day-to-day expenditure.  Rural counties are very dependent on petrol.  Recent household budget surveys show that about 8 per cent of weekly income of farmers making £4,500 a year was spent on petrol.  This compares with about 5 per cent in families with an average wage of £130 a week <Col N="2055" /> in urban areas.  We know that 60 per cent of rural households have cars as against 50 per cent in urban households.  This shows that the increases imposed on the price of petrol recently discriminate against rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Petrol prices could almost be used as a barometer for activity in the economy. The costs to the motorist have gone out of control.  He appears to be the one person the Minister for Finance considers he has no obligation to protect.  It is not just petrol alone: all the other costs have to be included.  There were the increases in road tax, insurance and in the cost of maintenance.  Every aspect down to the matter of spare parts has been affected. Things have got out of control, obviously with the full support of an uncaring Minister.</P>
    <P>We must look also at the effect on the motor trade in general.  It is well known that there have been enormous job losses in the trade.  Quite a number of garages are on short-time and some of them will never have an opportunity of returning to a five-day week.  There are no apprentices being trained in the motor industry. The numbers have decreased year after year and it is a sad reflection on what was a much valued skill that only two apprentices were in training in the whole of the county of Mayo in 1982.  I am sure a similar situation applies in other counties. When we consider the average motorist travels about 15,000 miles per year and taking petrol consumption for an average car at 30 g.p.m. the increases since 1 January are adding £3 per week to the overall cost for the average family. That must be considered in a situation where costs are increasing and where incomes are decreasing, with other levies and other forms of taxation being applied.  To add this further £3 per week makes the cost of motoring virtually unbearable so far as the average citizen is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that when people find they cannot afford to run a car because of petrol increases they will postpone getting essential repairs and maintenance work carried out.  It has also been noted that there is an increase in <Col N="2056" /> the number of motorists who do not have car insurance.  The numbers not paying road tax have increase dramatically and it must be stated that the increase in petrol which asks the average motorist to pay a further £150 per year in addition to what he was paying already will have serious consequences so far as the whole industry and revenue are concerned.  I am particularly concerned that people may postpone essential repairs and maintenance works because of lack of funds.  Much of the repair work has now been transferred to moonlighters in the business and, of course, this results in a huge loss of revenue to the State: loss of VAT on spare parts and on labour and loss of corporation profits tax from the companies operating in this area.  This is resulting in the closure of many garages and also in other garages going on short-time working.  Many of the legitimate repair shops are redundant and the blame must be laid at the door of the Government.  They have no care whatever so far as motoring costs are concerned other than to load on bigger taxes and particularly increases in the price of petrol.</P>
    <P>To wage war on the motorist is shortsighted and will be counter-productive so far as tax revenue will be concerned and we are fast approaching the time of diminishing returns as far as revenue from the sales of petrol is concerned.  Tax revenue was down quite considerably last year.  It covers all excise duty and VAT and these two elements are applied in no uncertain terms so far as the price of a gallon of petrol is concerned.  To take further steps against the motorists must be counter-productive and it will have a serious effect on revenue to the Exchequer. The relentless punishment of what must be the most vulnerable taxpayer of all, the motorist, continues apace as though there were no end to the capacity of the individual to pay.  He is being forced into a situation of taking alternative methods of dealing with the whole range of other motoring costs, the most serious being his willingness in recent times to risk going on the road without proper insurance, not to talk about the large percentage without road tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2057" /> We must admit there has been a change in the scene over the years so far as the use of the motor car is concerned.  We have to recognise that the car is in everyday use for virtually every family.  We will have to take note of some of the statistics being applied to motoring so that we can evaluate the trend.  Too high petrol prices are the root cause of many of the difficulties in this area.  In 1980 private new car registrations numbered 93,622; in 1981 the figure was 106,074; in 1982 it was 72,775 and that drop is continuing. It is reliably estimated that the number of new cars registered this year will fall once again and perhaps will not exceed 60,000 cars.  This will have a most serious effect on the number of people who are available to buy the petrol at the price the Government are forcing them to pay and it will also affect the motoring industry generally.</P>
    <P>In 1979 there were 682,958 private cars on the roads; in 1980 there were 734,371; in 1981 the figure was 774,594 and the provisional figure for 1982 is estimated at 709,000 approximately.  It is difficult to believe there has been such a vast decrease in the number of cars on the road and I found it difficult to accept that figure but the estimate has come from a very reliable source.  Perhaps the reason is that because of the cost of motoring a large number of cars are not taxed.  There is no doubt that petrol which is the one commodity that has to be used every day when one is motoring, the item that cannot be avoided because the wheels will not turn without it, is the one item that will be considered first and having regard to the present circumstances, people are prepared to stand back from other essential items such as road tax.  The figures are a sure indicator that there is a serious down-turn in motoring by the private citizen due in the main to the increases in petrol in the past few months.</P>
    <P>I know the Ceann Comhairle has been in the House for quite some time and I should like to remind him of the figure which applied when he and I understood pounds, shillings and pence.  In 1927 it cost 1/8d a gallon and one could buy 12 gallons for £1.  In 1976, which is the first year for which I have records for the price <Col N="2058" /> under the metric system, it was 94.8p a gallon.  In 1980 it was £1.55p.  I am talking about the price for premium grade.  In 1981 it was £1.90 and in 1983 it is £2.88p a gallon.  Without using a desk calculator I estimate that since 1977 petrol increased by 195 per cent.  That increased to 23 per cent as a direct result of the action of the Government.  Since March 1983 the excise duty on a gallon of petrol is 98.4p and when one considers that, one gets some indication of the grab that is on by the Government as far as petrol retail prices are concerned.</P>
    <P>In 1970 there were 4,772 retail outlets in the country.  This year the number is 3,874.  Fewer people will be buying petrol.  It was virtually the mainstay for the economy over the years as far as revenue was concerned.  The Government cannot see that we have arrived at the stage of diminishing returns.  Are they taking the Machiavellian attitude that as sales decrease they will increase the tax across the board to take up the slack irrespective of the difficulties it will cause in our competitiveness, tourist industry or standard of living?</P>
    <P>A car is now an everyday necessity. For too long it was suggested that it was a luxury for higher income workers.  The Government cannot see that the extra £3 they are asking workers to pay by way of increased petrol charges since 1 January must have a detrimental effect on their living standards and on the possibility of getting a proper wage structure this year.  The total gallonage of petrol sold in 1980 here was 289,890,000.  In 1981 it was 291,108,000.  It has been estimated that there has been a significant decrease in gallonage sales and by significant I mean anything in excess of 3½ per cent.  It is more likely to be close to 5 per cent.  Do figures count for anything as far as the Government are concerned except to increase the price of a gallon of petrol? The excise duty on a gallon of premium grade is 98.4p.  With VAT at 52.8p that gives a grand total of £1.51 or 53½ per cent of the pump price going into the coffers of the Exchequer on every gallon of petrol sold.  That is on the £2.82 average pump price for a gallon of premium grade.  What a starting figure.  How has <Col N="2059" /> it come about?  There were petrol increases over the years which were necessary on occasions.  Since 1 January this Government have put 15p on on one occasion, 11p on another occasion now resulting in 14p extra.  We have had a 15 per cent increase in the price of a gallon of petrol in just over 16 weeks.  Still the Government are not satisfied.  They are suggesting to the motorist that in some slick way they will get a further increase.  The figure of £50 million was announced in a peculiar way in the budget a few weeks ago.  This must mean 10p more on a gallon of petrol and it is just another tax to add to the litany of tax increases since 1 January.</P>
    <P>It was stated last year that an increase of 18p per gallon could bring in £49 million revenue in a single year.  These figures do not worry the Minister for Finance.  He is adjusting the figures to suit himself in the hope, as somebody said recently, of creating a fund which he can utilise in some underhand way to purchase votes at an election.</P>
    <P>The major Irish oil companies get their supplies of petroleum products from two sources &mdash; the UK associated companies and the Irish National Petroleum Corporation ex the Whitegate refinery.  We all know the situation at Whitegate.  The takeoff is about 35 per cent of the total requirements of the trade.  We all recognise the total dependency on outside sources for supplies and while this is fully appreciated, as is the need for security of supply, nevertheless we should be able to take fully advantage of the current world situation.  We had long-term contracts with Middle Eastern countries and these have now terminated.  The way we acted at that time was honourable.  We did not walk away from the contracts we had and that will guarantee us goodwill and security of supply in the future.  I accept that but when contracts are entered into again there should be an escape clause so that we can benefit from world trends.  The trend, as everyone knows now, is downwards but the Government are not prepared to pass on the benefit of this to the hard-pressed motorist by giving him what is his rightful due &mdash; a decrease in the <Col N="2060" /> cost of petrol at the pumps.  I do not believe we should become involved in further contractual situations until the world market stabilises.  We all know there is a glut of oil on the world market and it can be bought relatively cheaply on the spot.</P>
    <P>We see in the newspapers the possibility of a reduction of $5 a barrel.  That is pure speculation and it is confidently expected by those in the know that it could be reduced further by as much as $26 a barrel.  What kind of reduction will that bring?  Will the Government give a commitment that they will allow these benefits to be passed on to the the hard-pressed motorist by way of reduction in the price of petrol.  The BNOC dropped the price of a barrel by $3½ recently.  They supply about one-third of the total requirement of the Whitegate refinery. This could have resulted in the INPC saying immediately they could accommodate a 15p decrease.  Was that passed on to the hard-pressed motorist? No. Whatever policy has been adopted by the Government as far as petrol prices are concerned, they are determined not to give the results of world price reductions to motorists here.  We can only be suspicious as to what underlying policy they have in depriving the hard-pressed motorist of something which is his due.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by many that there are exorbitant profits being made by the oil companies supplying this market. In my view the time is opportune for an investigation into the sources of supply to the Irish oil companies and to the pricing in-structure to the Irish petroleum companies, how it compares with the world price situation and if there are better arrangements that could be achieved for our motorists and those who rely on the petrol business.  The price of petrol cannot be stabilised without some bold initiatives being taken which would concern purchasing, strategy, storage of strategic supplies and the source of supply. If the Government had the will to give the benefit of world prices to the motorist, these avenues could be considered.</P>
    <P>Let me nip the metrication device in the bud.  It is important that we retain the price per gallon as well as the price per <Col N="2061" /> litre at the source to the consumer, namely, the petrol pump.  While I accept the inevitability of metrication, I believe it should be obligatory that the price per gallon be displayed at the pumps as well as the price per litre.  The litre only pumps totally disorientate the consumer and make it difficult for the purchaser to ascertain how much per gallon he is paying. Until such time as the advertisements in the mass media stop advertising economies in motoring for their car products in miles per gallon that practice should continue.  There is an educational process to be undertaken and I advise the Government before they attempt to devastate the motorists so far as petrol prices are concerned, to consider it well.</P>
    <P>Is it too much to ask that the voracious appetite of the all-demanding Minister for Finance be checked so that the long suffering and harassed motorist might get some relief from the windfall of falling world prices, relief which his fellow motorists already enjoy in neighbouring countries? It is time for the Minister to come clean on the real story behind the petrol prices as they apply here.</P>
    <P>The measures taken by the Coalition are having a devastating effect on the Border counties.  The higher the gap between the prices the more revenue is likely to be lost.  Using the census and the household budget survey I estimate that there are about 108,000 households in the six Border counties and the total spending on petrol in these areas would be a very conservative estimate of £50 million a year, of which over half should and would go to the Exchequer.  If the inhabitants of the Border counties buy even 40 per cent of their petrol across the border, the Exchequer loses £10 million; if it is only 30 per cent the Exchequer would lose £7.5 million.  The average family spending about £480 on petrol this year would be saving about £120 a year, even allowing for the cost of driving the extra miles to get the petrol.  Households in the border counties would probably have incomes amounting to an estimated £1,400 million this year.  Only 70 per cent of that would be spent on the type of articles that could be brought across the <Col N="2062" /> border.  Let us take the figure at a round £1,000 million.  Every one per cent spent across the border represents £10 million and if even 10 per cent of income is spent north of the border, £100 million is taken out of our economy and the Exchequer loses between £20 million and £30 million. In addition, if one considers trips from areas outside the immediate border areas &mdash; even as far away as Dublin &mdash; the Minister may be losing up to £50 million for the Exchequer and up to £200 million or £300 million for the economy in 1983.  We should not be creating this kind of incentive for the maintenance of the Border.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious and difficult situation arising because of the inactivity of the Minister for Finance in not giving the motorist the benefit of something which is common knowledge to every motorist who has read a newspaper or listened to announcements in the media over the last number of weeks.  It is not just a possibility of a few pence reduction that might have to be altered again in a couple of weeks.  There is a serious would glut of oil.  Those who produce this international resource meet daily to agree not just if they might bring down the price of the day's product but by how much they will reduce it.  There is no doubt in the mind of the ordinary motorist that huge reductions are available for the barrel of oil, but they also know that the pricing structure for the Irish petroleum companies is not in accordance with the best deal that can be got elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The motorists want to know what kind of pricing structure there is, and how there is such a big differential.  They want to know what the Government are doing about this and what they propose to do to provide a different arrangement which will guarantee security of supply and also that there will be no fluctuations in prices in the foreseeable future; the only fluctuations they want to see are downwards. This present price reduction is reflected in every European economy but the only motorist who cannot get a cheaper gallon of petrol is the Irish motorist.  He is being mulcted by the avaricious Minister for Finance who seems to demand ever-increasing prices for the gallon of petrol <Col N="2063" /> to satisfy the Coalition's lack of policy to deal with our outstanding economic difficulties.  He decides that the quickest and easiest way to get the most money possible is to attach further increases to the gallon of petrol.  There has been a litany of increases on the unsuspecting motorist since 1 January, not just by budgetary provision but also, as some commentators suggested, by stealth, by announcing them in advance so that the unsuspecting motorist might not see them at the pumps.</P>
    <P>This is not a satisfactory situation so far as the motorist is concerned.  His standard of living has been devastated.  I have quantified that in pounds as far as the motorist is concerned.  It must have a very debilitating effect, not just on the family motorist, but on the economy in general and there will certainly be a reduction in tax revenue.  Instead of dealing with the recession, they have put the country into depression and they must carry the blame for it.  That is why we are asking the Minister to change his tack and allow the benefit of the world situation in reduced prices of crude oil to be applied to the over-harassed and over-penalised motorist in petrol prices.</P>

It is also naive of him to suggest that this Government are suddenly putting taxation on petrol and oil products.  One would think that no other Government ever increased taxation in this area.  When in Government, Fianna Fáil succeeded in putting taxation on petrol and road diesel, to give two examples. In 1980, Fianna Fáil put 20 pence extra, including VAT, on a gallon of petrol.

      <P>The price of crude oil has jumped dramatically over the past decade.  In 1973 it was around $2 per barrel.  It then jumped to around $11 per barrel.  That caused the first energy crisis and created serious dislocations to European economies.  Prices remained fairly stable up to 1978 when the price increased to $15 per barrel.  In 1981 it soared to $34 per barrel.  That increase has caused tremendous damage to European economies.</P>

      <P>For the information of Deputies opposite I should like to state that I am reading from notes.  I do not have to refer to the notes and I will not do so if that will please the Deputies opposite.  I do not wish to upset them.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out to the House that as soon as the price of oil reached a peak of 35 dollars per barrel the demand for it in the western world, and in this country in particular, declined.  The EEC, and our Government, encouraged that reduction of use.  It is important that we ensure that we have an adequate supply of oil for our needs and that was recognised in the seventies when we were being supplied by the multi-nationals who had their own contracts with OPEC countries and others.  In 1979 the INPC was formed for the purpose of concluding contracts with oil exporting countries to ensure that we had a continuous supply of oil.  That was an important policy move because it brought us into direct negotiation with oil producing countries and it should be noted that that has been an important way of securing our oil supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2069" /> Recent events in regard to OPEC and other oil producing countries show that the price of oil is weakening but I cannot subscribe to the suggestion made by Deputy Flynn that we should now be able to buy oil at about 22 dollars per barrel or that we should pursue a policy of purchasing on the spot market for Whitegate. I do not think any refinery could run on the basis of purchasing on the spot market alone.  That would be a very unwise move because the spot price could go above the official selling price very speedily and that could land us into serious trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is plenty of storage space available if the Government wish to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has raised that matter I will deal with it now. It is a fact that we have an IEA obligation to hold 90 days' stock of oil products here but that has not been the case.  There is a need when one is talking about security of supply to increase our present level of stock of oil and oil products here.  At present about 15 days' supply is held abroad under an agreement.  That is permitted but it is not satisfactory and I will be looking at that aspect in the coming months.  It is important for the Government to ensure that the 90 days' supply of oil is held here rather than permitting part of the supply to be stored abroad.  If a crisis arose abroad it is probable that the supply of oil to us could be seriously disrupted.  That would not be in the best interests of the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to address myself to the decision of the refining companies to cease refining at Whitegate. That was done in the face of opposition by two Governments, the Fianna Fáil Government when Deputy Colley was Minister for Energy and my Government when we were in office two Governments ago. Despite our request the refining companies ceased refining at Whitegate and the Government had no option but to buy Whitegate in order to ensure continuity of refining in this country.  That decision <Col N="2070" /> was necessary at the time but in the context of the price of petrol it is interesting to note that, though the refining companies stated that the cost of refining was too high at Whitegate, when the refinery closed there was no marked reduction in the price of petrol or oil products in Ireland.  That is an interesting fact to note because these companies are very profit-orientated.  They will not give a penny to the consumer unless they are forced to give a reduction.  I was disappointed that I saw no reduction in the price of petrol and oil products when the refinery closed.</P>
    <P>I feel that the present reductions in the ex-Whitegate price which I announced not so long ago and which were to take effect from 1 April are to be welcomed. It is a reflection of the changing of the crude slate to a more cost-efficient slate achieved within the refinery.  One must congratulate the workers of the refinery on their attitude to the operation of the refinery and to the reduction in the cost of crude oil to be refined at the refinery. These reductions amount to 15p per gallon of petrol and 7p per gallon on gas oil. Of course, it must be remembered that the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism has an imput here because the ex-Whitegate price is only one-third of the product cost to the oil distributing company.  Therefore their own slate must be adjusted and I hope that they too will take advantage of reducing crude prices to ensure that in the near future they can at least approach the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the National Prices Commission with a substantial reduction in their prices for oil.  That, of course, does not exclude the responsibility of the Government with regard to their Budget Statement and the statement of the Minister for Finance that he intends to take £50 million back in revenue. However, I hope that there will be a reduction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope that the oil distributing companies will get their act together.  In passing I must express serious disappointment and concern at a number of minor companies in the oil distribution field in Ireland who have failed to take their allocation of liftings from Whitegate.  This is a cause of concern, and in that context the major oil companies have honoured the offtake agreement.  I regret the action of the minor companies in this regard and I hope that they will see the correctness of playing their part in ensuring an orderly working of Whitegate and an orderly oil distribution market.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I wish to address myself briefly to the amendment put down by The Workers' Party which could only be described as a far-reaching proposal which the Government could not support at this time.  The amendment is very far-reaching and if implemented would cost in present value terms upwards of £600 million depending on the type of refinery decided upon.  Such a level of investment in refining might be justified only in the circumstances of an Irish oil find, but the general sentiment of the amendment that the State has a role to play in such an essential commodity as oil is accepted.  At least three different Governments have endorsed this in regard to Whitegate and they have highlighted the difference between the responsibilities of a sovereign Government and those of commercial enterprises.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say too that the refinery has been in State hands only since last September. I am pleased with the workers in the refinery and with their attitude.  I am pleased with the way the INPC have been managing the refinery and effecting economies. The refinery must be looked at to see how it is working and if it is efficient and to ensure that the cost to the State is not excessive.  The Government have a responsibility to review all energy costs as the last Government did with relation to the price of electricity.  They carried out a review of it.  That is only a proper attitude to take with regard to our energy costs.  We must understand that we are a little island far removed from the major cities of Europe.  There are and will always be the economics of being in an island situation both from the point of view of transport costs to the country and distribution costs within the country. That must always be accepted.  We have a responsibility within that context to ensure that our energy prices are as efficient as they can be.  I hope that the review of energy prices will prove fruitful and that the Government will be seen to be acting in a responsible manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, I would finally like to see a <Col N="2073" /> reduction in oil product prices within the country, but with regard to the context of the motion it is facile to take the taxation policy of the Government with regard to petrol and oil products out of context. You are either going to address yourself to the overall budgetary situation or you are going to run away from it.  The last Government succeeded in running away from the budget.  This Government will not do that, but in the context of a falling crude oil market price I hope that we will see a reduction in the price of petrol and oil products in this country in the near future.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling.  I support this motion and I should like to <Col N="2074" /> deal with the effect of petrol prices on the tourist industry.  Having been in office only a couple of months this Government increased petrol prices by 30 pence per gallon and diesel by 32 pence per gallon. I am glad the Minister for Finance is present because he stated before the introduction of the budget at a meeting in Athy, County Kildare, that he would like to see the budget deficit brought down to £730 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I am satisfied with that.  I wish to deal now with the effect of petrol prices on tourism.  It is the opinion of many that petrol vouchers should be made available to holiday-makers at points of entry.  This suggestion must be examined carefully because it is no longer attractive for tourists to come here, knowing that they will have to pay the highest prices in Europe for petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am aware &mdash; and I am open to correction on this &mdash; the Minister for <Col N="2075" /> Trade, Commerce and Tourism is at present in New York telling people they should come here on holiday.  How is he explaining our prices?  I should be interested to know how he is getting over that problem.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed in the speech made by the Minister of State.  He wandered a lot and talked about the Whitegate refinery.  My colleague, Deputy Albert Reynolds, said in September last that the price of oil products would fall in the first quarter of this year.  Very few people believed him at that time but he has been proved right.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider making grants available to travel agents to help them put together package holidays. Revenue from tourism has been extremely high in past years, but some new programmes must be introduced.  I should also like to see intensive promotions in Europe and the USA.  Tourists arriving at a point of entry should be able to secure a package covering hotel accommodation, car hire and especially petrol.  This is absolutely essential.  There is no use in trying to cod people because they realise that ours is the most expensive country in Europe.  Hoteliers and travel agents should co-operate with the Department in special promotions to improve the situation.  No such attempts are at present being made.  Special grants from the Department should be made available to encourage this promotion work.</P>
    <P>The hotel and restaurant business has been experiencing great difficulty during the past few months because of the VAT imposition and we are pricing ourselves out of the market.  We should consider advertising abroad to promote our country but we must begin at home by devising a programme that will be acceptable to tourists.  The Government must plan a policy in this regard.  As things stand, people are being scared off.  Many of those employed in hotels have received redundancy notices.  Some of the employees in the large hotels and restaurants, especially in the midlands, are on short time.  This is a serious situation.  There should be a consultation with all the <Col N="2076" /> travel agents and the other interested parties to see if an attractive package can be put together.  I cannot see people coming here this year if we cannot offer them an attractive package.</P>
    <P>The Border counties will be very badly hit by the high cost of everything.  People in those areas have only to cross the Border to get cheaper accommodation, food and petrol.  A person driving an average car can cross the Border and fill his tank for £10 less than at a local petrol station.  A man who owns a petrol station near the Border told me that his petrol sales have dropped from 6,000 gallons a week to 1,000 gallons.  If this trend continues he will have to close down.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to Sunday motoring. People in the midlands like to take their cars out on Sunday and drive to Croke Park, Connor Park in Tullamore, or to other places such as Bray.  Petrol retailers in the midlands have informed me that petrol sales on Sunday have dropped by 25 per cent.  Motoring on Sunday is a luxury now.</P>
    <P>Many workers from my constituency travel to Dublin to work on building sites. Company directors have informed me that those workers are now talking about redundancy as it is too expensive to travel to work in Dublin.  Many of those workers have been in the building trade for years and their fathers were in it before them.  It is &ldquo;make your mind up&rdquo; time.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Finance is in the House.  He will kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  A man who used to buy ten gallons of petrol will now only buy eight gallons.  The Minister is in for a crule awakening in relation to the Border areas.  There will be a substantial loss of revenue from petrol sales.  Any financial expert can tell the Minister that when one prices anything too high there is a drop in sales.  This will result in unemployment. All aspects connected with the tourist industry, as well as hotels, guest-houses and restaurants, are now hit.</P>
    <P>On the eve of the election, Fine Gael, with respect to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, had a great advertisement which stated: &ldquo;If you vote for Fianna Fáil you <Col N="2077" /> vote for a petrol increase of 15p a gallon&rdquo;. What did the Coalition Government do when they got in?  They put on 30p.  When you add in all the trimmings there is more to it.  Diesel oil has had an increase of 22p a gallon.</P>
    <P>The advertisement of the whizz kids of Fine Gael, dictated by the Taoiseach, appeared for &ldquo;Garret the Good, the man who does not make errors and does not tell lies&rdquo;.  I leave it to the people to judge on that.  That is what I call hypocrisy at its best.  This will be remembered by the people.  They have good memories.  I told the people in my constituency not to be misled by that advertisement.  I am glad to say they took my advice.  If they had taken my advice elsewhere they would not now be paying through the nose.  Fine Gael sold the people more than a pup.</P>
    <P>This was wrapped around the necks of the media as well.  It was lovely for them. Now they are coming to grips with the situation.  The distinguished press men in the gallery now realise it as well.  I have here an article by a very eminent journalist, Mr. James Morrissey, who addressed an open letter to the Taoiseach but calls him by his Christian name.  The Minister for Finance on radio spelled out what he would do and how he would lower the budget deficit to £750 million. He was caught up in the web then.  The Labour members of the Cabinet, the people who would not do any wrong either said, &ldquo;We do not agree with that. We stand back completely from it&rdquo;.  At the end of the day they put their arms around the Minister and said, &ldquo;Nice man, you have looked after us&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The tourist business is wrecked totally because of this situation.  The Minister must insist on the Government giving some relief in that area.  The industry is crying out for help.  Every day representations are made to us from people in the business asking what we intend to do to ensure that some help is given.  There will be thousands of job losses in that sector alone if the Government fail to give the help that is necessary.  In addition, many hotels will close and once closed will not reopen easily.  Any auctioneer would <Col N="2078" /> have difficulty in getting a bid on a closed hotel.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Limerick Canning Plant Closure.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to convey to the House the very serious concern being experienced in Limerick at the announcement of the pending closure of Mattersons canning factory.  This industry is the second oldest in the country, after Guinness's, Mattersons were founded in 1820. My purpose in raising the matter this evening is to ask the Minister to defer the closure date until all possible options have been considered.</P>
      <P>Those of us who were involved in discussions and negotiations on this issue were taken aback to say the least that the announcement of closure was made without any communication with the unions or the public figures involved.  During a deputation, we have been assured by Deputy Lenihan as Minister some months ago that the closure would not be announced without those directly interested being consulted first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The underlying position in this whole situation is that the Irish Sugar Company did not want the Mattersons from day one. When the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley succeeded in having Mattersons factory taken over by the Sugar Company, the new arrangement was resisted from the beginning by the company.  A deputation was informed by a Minister in the last Government that on the day Mattersons were taken aboard by the Sugar Company one of the senior executives of that company said he would see that the arrangement ceased in spite of the Minister. Against that kind of background the work force are deeply suspicious of the motives of the Sugar Company in this situation.  From a position in which 172 people were employed in August last year, 28 jobs were lost as a result of the company losing the Dunnes Stores contract while 11 were lost as a result of a rationalisation programme and 50 will be lost as a result of the proposed closure of the cannery section.  This is all the more tragic when one realises that this canning <Col N="2079" /> process is one of the most modern in Europe.  Recently a modern canning machine was brought in and this has the capacity of producing 100,000 cans in eight hours.  There are very few such effective production lines in canning anywhere else in Europe.  We were all told that one of the major factors in the Ranks closure was the outmoded technology being used, but here we have the very opposite.  If this cannery closes there will be a knock-on effect on those areas of employment within the Sugar Company that are responsible for the transport and distribution of Matterson's products.  In addition the closure will have the effect of forcing the profitable meat section of the company to carry the overheads carried up to now by the canning section.  This will result in an automatic weakening of confidence in or in the creation of difficulties for that section.</P>
    <P>I understand that the figures on which the closure decision is being taken are outdated and that the real position is that the up-to-date figures for the company are in a much more healthy state.  Before any decision is taken to close this plant I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the absolute up-to-date figures are available to the Government.  All Matterson's are asking for is a share of the £30 million that has been given by the Government by way of a grant-in-aid to the company. They consider that their losses are so insignificant in relation to the figures that were announced this morning that it will be nothing short of a tragedy to allow such a valuable part of the food-processing sector to close.</P>
    <P>This brings into question the whole philosophy of food processing in this country.  Recently we were all heartened by the announcement of the setting up of the task force which include the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and three of the senior Minister.  One of the stated objectives of that task force is to examine areas in which useful and valuable work can be created.  In the case in question we are witnessing the piecemeal destruction of the food processing industry.  This must not be allowed happen at a time of <Col N="2080" /> depression, especially since food processing has a greater potential for employment than any other industry.  What is happening is ridiculous in a situation in which there is no integration of agricultural output and food processing.  Meat and dairy products, for example, come within the aegis of the Department of Agriculture whereas the secondary processing of sugar &mdash; confectionery and so on &mdash; comes under the Department of Industry and Energy.  It is nothing short of a scandal that all this is due to the failure of successive Governments to bring in one overall and co-ordinated plan for the food processing industry, an industry that has jumped from seventh to second place in the Common Market.  It is second only to the petro-chemical industry in its labour intensiveness.  We are fortunate with all the raw materials we have at our disposal.</P>
    <P>Talk of impending closure comes at a time when several factors would indicate that this should not happen.  Some canning factories in the UK are closing because of the glut of beans and vegetables due to a very good crop.  The price of the foodstuffs came down and also the price of the cans, which would give Matterson's a better competitive edge.  Not alone are they among the foremost processing and production plants in these islands and Europe, but they have met the most exacting European hygienic standards.  They have produced extensively for companies like Heinz International Corporation and there could be no higher recommendation.</P>
    <P>If one advantage derives from the present recession it is that the law of economics is being borne in on people every day. We witness legitimate and understandable protests about increased taxation, but by a far less painful method we could solve our problems if we had the common sense and intelligence to concentrate on a Buy Irish campaign.  It is estimated that a 3 per cent swing from foreign to Irish goods would create 10,000 jobs here. One can imagine what that would mean now to our economy.  If unemployment continues at the present rate, it will bring down our economy, because it will be <Col N="2081" /> insupportable unless something is done. Support for Irish goods is absolutely imperative.</P>
    <P>Our climate gives us an advantage over most countries of the world because our cattle can remain in the open for almost the full year, giving an in-built differential advantage over our competitors within the Common Market.  We are, nevertheless, importing cabbage and onions from The Netherlands, potatoes from Cyprus, tomatoes from the Canary Islands and last year we imported lettuce, fruit, cheese, fish and canned vegetables, which is an absolute scandal.  In 1982 alone, we imported 40,000 tonnes of potatoes and are told by the Department of Agriculture that that figure will double in 1983, at a time when more than one million acres lie undeveloped.  In 1982 alone we spent £39 million on imported fruit, £12 million on imported vegetables, £604 million on frozen foods.  That is a reflection on all of us and we will pay dearly for it.</P>
    <P>I am asking for a public inquiry, if necessary, into the manner in which it is proposed to close down Matterson's.  This unjustifiable decision warrants the deepest scrutiny, because, given the figures that we heard this morning in relation to our Sugar Company, if closure of Matterson's is justified the whole Sugar Company should go out of existence.  It is wrong and unfairly selective to discriminate against Matterson's and the Minister for Agriculture must defer this closure. I am not happy &mdash; and neither are the people of Limerick &mdash; with the figures presented by the Sugar Company on this issue.  We are not getting the real picture and the situation is far more healthy than we are given to understand.  I am told that the decision to close the factory is based on outdated information.</P>
    <P>The Matterson work force believe that, if they were given only a fraction of the £30 million which will go to wipe out old debts and the interest on the machinery purchased, it would give Matterson's a fair chance to turn about within a year or so.  I appeal to the Minister and his colleagues, at a time when employment is at a premium, not to contribute to a scandalous situation in which native industries <Col N="2082" /> are being dismantled piecemeal.  It would cost far more to keep the work force on the labour exchange than to keep them in their jobs.  I urge the Minister very strongly to consider this course of action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opportunity of subscribing totally to the call from Deputy Prendergast for the postponement of this closure until all facts are known.  This proposition came before the previous Government.  As Minister for Industry and Energy at the time, I was not prepared to accept the figures put before me and asked the Government of the day to defer closure until I received answers to certain specific questions.  The election intervened and I was never in a position to get the full story.  There is something wrong with the philosophy of an Irish Government which, when unemployment is rife as at present, would think of closing down an industry which is processing native raw materials.  The criticisms of our industrial policy as expounded by Telesis and the NESC demand priority in the development of native resource industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time of expanding demand for beans and other associated products, Batchelor's, who are in the same business, are expanding, investing more money and receiving assistance from the IDA to do so, and if we cannot improve the Matterson situation there is something totally wrong with our approach to and philosophy on Irish industry.  I wish to ask the Minister a question which he may not now be in a position to answer. I understood, on the information available to me when this closure loomed previously, that outside auditors, in making their submission to the IDA for funds to make more investment in Matterson's, produced figures which showed that Matterson's were making a profit.  On the other hand, the Sugar Company group were saying the direct opposite.  This situation must be clarified for the benefit of the taxpayer and public representatives <Col N="2083" /> to ascertain where the truth lies in relation to the facts.</P>
    <P>It should be within the competence of all the agencies available to the Government to separate Matterson's from the group, if necessary, and let them do the job for which they were set up.  They have a future and the markets are there for their products.  They have done, and can do, an excellent job and there is no reason why they should not succeed.  For the little money entailed at this stage, surely, even in advance of a task force of Minister who will have protracted discussions, it would be criminal to close Matterson's now.</P>

      <P>The closure of Matterson's must be seen in the context of the overall affairs of the Sugar Company. Matterson's cannot be looked at in isolation.</P>
      <P>For some time now the financial position of CSET has been deteriorating. Recently it has become critical.  The company made a loss over £11 million in 1980 and in 1981 the loss was £12 million.  The accounts for the company for the most recent year &mdash; laid before the House on 2 March &mdash; show that in 1982 the loss was £22 million.</P>
      <P>In so far as the food division, of which Matterson's is a part, is concerned, its activities have consistently incurred losses since trading began in 1963.  The continued drain on the company's finances is regarded as a major contributory factor to the present problems of the company.  Since 1979 the food division has incurred a cumulative loss of about £29 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of their critical financial position the company sought an equity injection from the State of £75 million in March 1981.  Before coming to a decision on that, the Government decided that a fundamental examination of the company's affairs should be carried out by an independent firm of consultants.  The consultants, who submitted their report <Col N="2084" /> on the affairs of CSET in March 1982, recommended the disposal or closure of the entire Erin Foods division, as they concluded that it was inherently loss-making. Indeed, I might point out that this included a factory in my own town.</P>
    <P>The consultants' recommendations bore out the views of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies which had conducted an inquiry into the affairs of CSET in the summer of 1980. The committee's report was debated in the Seanad in February 1981.  As many Members may be aware, the Oireachtas Joint Committee had serious doubts as to whether the food business could ever achieve an economic return.  However, the committee recommended the provision by the Government of additional share capital to the company.</P>
    <P>The Government decided in June 1982 to provide such additional capital subject to the submission by the company of a clear and specific programme for the rationalisation of their food processing activities and the beet growing and sugar industry.  The capital was made available in October last.</P>
    <P>The programme submitted by the company listed a number of steps towards rationalisation, including the closure of the canning operation at Matterson's.  The company said they recommended this because they could not see any prospect of making this business profitable in the foreseeable future since the costs of production could not be brought down to those of competing products.</P>
    <P>Matterson's are engaged in two distinct business &mdash; fresh meats and canning. The fresh meats division has been reasonably profitable and CSET plan to develop this business further.  The canning side of the business is engaged mainly in the canning of peas and baked beans, imported from third countries. This operation has been making heavy losses in recent years &mdash; almost £1 million in 1980, over £1 million in 1981 and about £1.4 million in 1982.  CSET have estimated that the closure of Matterson's will enable the company to avoid accumulated losses of nearly £4 million and reduce borrowing by £3 million at the end of five years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2085" /> In accepting the company's decision to terminate their activities at Matterson's the Government are conscious of the need to ensure that the public moneys being invested in CSET are not wasted. If losses continued to be incurred of the same size as in recent years then the whole future of the sugar industry would be set at risk.  It is vital that the Sugar Company be able to produce sugar competitively, or else foreign sugar will come in here in increasing quantities.  The Government are very concerned about the need to put this important national company back on their feet.  Anybody reading today's papers would be very concerned about it too.</P>
    <P>In this whole connection i would like to take this opportunity of emphasising to the House the Government's commitment to the development of the food processing industry.  The criterion for any such development must, of course, be a real prospect of viability.</P>
    <P>What must be developed is a food processing industry which is able to turn out products which the customer is willing to <Col N="2086" /> buy in preference to imported produce. The firms engaged in the industry must be strong and soundly structured to stand the blast of the though international competition facing them.  Any failure to be fully competitive can be cruelly exposed in meeting the challenge from keen suppliers in the home and international arena.</P>
    <P>The development of a thriving food processing industry, to which I look forward, would add greatly to job prospects and of course it would earn foreign currency. I cannot, however, over-emphasise the need to be competitive.  To improve our competitiveness requires hard decisions.  One of these was the decision to terminate the loss-making activities at Matterson's.  I am sorry, indeed, that the decision had to be taken. It is a decision in the overall interest of one of the most vital of our national companies &mdash; Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>My principal function with regard to travellers is the provision of assistance to local authorities towards the development of their accommodation programmes.  The primary responsibility for the provision of the necessary accommodation for travelling people rests with local authorities, whether under the normal housing programme or in special schemes, or on halting sites.  My Department give every assistance including recoupment of full capital costs of providing special accommodation for travelling people and 90 per cent recoupment of the cost of the employment of social workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My policy towards accommodation for travellers is essentially the same as that <Col N="1896" /> of my predecessors.  Every traveller family entitled to be housed should be given due consideration under local authority statutory schemes of letting priorities.  For those who cannot appropriately be housed, places on serviced sites should be made available.</P>
    <P>There are now over 400 families on the roadside in Dublin county.  That statistic covers a great deal of suffering and deprivation, serious environmental damage in many areas, and increasing social tensions.  There is no answer to this except in a realistic settlement programme for these families: otherwise the conditions, and the strains, will get worse.  The implications of the situation will have to be faced up to by all the interests concerned &mdash; by the local authorities, by the settled communities and their associations, and by the travelling families themselves.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been urged repeatedly to prepare and implement plans to cater for the families in need of accommodation in their areas.  The Deputy will recall that, as Minister, he made a strong plea last June to all members of the Dublin local authorities stressing the urgent need for a crash programme for settlement of travelling families in the area.  The proposals to which the Deputy refers are part of the county council's response to the need.  I understand that it is the intention that other schemes also will be developed. Against the background as I have given it, a realistic programme for settlement of travelling families in the Dublin area must have my full support in principle.  It is a matter for the county council to decide in regard to the details of particular schemes.  It is very important, of course, that there should be full consultation with local communities and I understand that this is being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware from certain newspaper references and from representations from the Irish Taxi Federation of a proposal to introduce a new taxi or mini-cab service in the Limerick area.  All public service vehicle operations are subject to the licensing and other requirements <Col N="1903" /> of the Public Service Vehicle Regulations, 1963 to 1981, enforcement of which is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Under a determination made by Limerick Corporation, no new taxi licences may be granted at present by the Garda in the Limerick taximeter area. While this restriction does not apply to the granting of hackney licences, the latter remains subject to the usual conditions whereby the Garda must be satisfied as to the suitability of applicants and vehicles.  Hackneys may not, of course, engage within a taximeter area in activities such as standing or plying for hire in a public place which is reserved to taxis.</P>
      <P>In response to recent representations from the Irish Taxi Federation, my Department have written to the Garda Commissioner asking, <i>inter alia,</i> that strict observance be required of the legal provisions distinguishing these two forms of public service operation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 445 and 446 together.</P>
      <P>Since this company went into liquidation in January 1983 the Industrial Development Authority in conjuction with the liquidator had been actively seeking to have the assets, including those of the Cahir operation, taken over with a view to the resumption of employment by as many as possible of the former work force.  To this end discussions have taken place with a number of interested parties. I understand that: (a) the liquidator was authorised in the High Court on 28 February 1983 to enter into a contract with an existing Irish company in a related line of business for the acquisition of some of the assets of the company; (b) the arrangements so authorised do not envisage the resumption of activity on a permanent basis at the Cahir factory.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances the IDA are now endeavouring, with the liquidator, to secure for the Cahir factory a replacement industry that would provide alternative employment for workers who lost their jobs at that factory when the company went into liquidation.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Authority have, in recent years, secured a number of new overseas industries for Limerick city and county and have also assisted in the expansion of a number of existing medium- to large-scale industries. These projects, which have a job potential of 3,200 at full production, will provide substantial employment opportunities in the next few years in Limerick. In addition, the IDA have 531,500 sq. ft. of factory space and four industrial sites totalling 222 acres which are being actively promoted.  A further 37,500 sq. ft. of factory space is under construction in two locations.</P>

    <P>SFADCo have, since they were given special responsibility for the intensive development of small indigenous industry in the west and mid-west regions in 1978, approved a total of 451 small industry projects with a job potential of 4,000 at full production for Limerick city and county.  Twelve advance units totalling <Col N="1910" /> 42,000 sq. ft. are available for letting to small industries and are being actively promoted by SFADCo.</P>

      <P>At the request of the Midland Health Board, Comhairle na nOspidéal advised that Tullamore should, in the long term, be the location of regional specialities within the board's area.  Comhairle, however, did accept the need for an urgent short-term solution in relation to the provision of orthopaedic services (currently orthopaedic services are being provided from Dublin and Navan).  Their advice, in this regard, was that the only medically acceptable solution was the provision of a temporary elective orthopaedic unit in or close to a general hospital where essential back-up services were available.  In this context the Midland Health Board decided that elective orthopaedic facilities should be provided at the District Hospital, Athlone, in the short term.  The board have been in touch with my Department in this matter and the issue is under consideration at the moment.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit at the reduced rate payable to a married woman from 23 <Col N="1931" /> February 1982 to 21 February 1983, a period of 52 weeks, when she ceased to be entitled to further payment of benefit as she has less than 156 paid contributions in respect of insurable employment.  She was in receipt of unemployment benefit also at the rate appropriate to a married woman in the period 8 June 1981 to 31 October 1981.</P>
      <P>To qualify for benefit at the full rate she would have to be in the position that she was not a dependant of her husband.

      <P>Inquiries are being made in regard to the claimant's insurable employment during the 1980-81 contribution year and when these have been completed his entitlement to disability benefit for the period from 5 October 1982 to 1 January 1983 will be reviewed.</P>

It was then discovered that he had attained 66 years of age on 16 December 1980 and was not, therefore, entitled to any disability benefit or pay-related benefit after that date.  The claimant was informed of the position on 8 September 1982 and was issued with a claim form on which to claim old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Contributory old age pension has been awarded with effect from 28 August 1981 and the arrears of pension have been offset against the benefit overpaid to him. As a result the net amount overpaid is £479.85 and it is proposed to recover the overpayment by weekly deductions of £3 from 1 April 1983 when his pension book will be due for renewal.</P>
      <P>A letter explaining the position in detail is being issued to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit on 12 November 1982 and has in the meantime been paid at the rate of £93.85 a week.  Having regard to the date on which benefit was claimed the relevant tax year is 1980-81, that is the last complete income tax year before the beginning of the benefit year in which the first day of incapacity for work occurred.  The weekly rate of flat-rate benefit in payment exceeds the average weekly reckonable earnings of the person concerned in the relevant tax year and pay-related benefit is not, accordingly, payable.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of pay-related benefit the claimant's income in the 1981-82 income tax year could be taken into account only if the incapacity had commenced in the new benefit year which began on 3 January 1983.</P>

      <P>A routine reinvestigation of the means of the person concerned revealed that his means had increased since the original investigation of his claim.  Consequently a question of reduction of his pension was referred to the local pension committee for decision. The committee have decided that the person is entitled to a pension at the reduced rate of £2.45 plus £1.30 adult dependant allowance.  The assessment of his means, consisting of half the weekly value of a holding and capital, entitles him to pension at this rate.  The case is being referred to an appeals officer for determination this week and the pensioner will be informed of the outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal to change the criteria from five leaving certificate passes to two honours was based essentially on the consideration that reliance on five passes only has been tending to operate in practice to restrict the range of courses for which such a standard of attainment would qualify candidates for admittance.</P>
      <P>As I stated in a reply to a parliamentary question on Wednesday, 23 February 1983, for the purpose of avoiding any misunderstanding in relation to the matter, the relevant circular letter dealing with the conditions for the award of VEC scholarships will not be issued prior to consultation with representatives of the educational interest concerned.  The conditions to be prescribed for the 1983-84 academic year have not yet therefore been finalised.</P>
