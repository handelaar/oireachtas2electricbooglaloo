      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the opposition of the Danish Government to any concessions for Ireland on the super-levy; and if he will meet the Danish Prime Minister before the Athens meeting to present our case to him and seek his help in protecting our vital national interest.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach <Col N="402" /> if he is aware of the opposition of the Dutch Government to any concessions for Ireland on the super-levy; and if he will meet the Dutch Prime Minister before the Athens meeting to present our case to him and seek his help in protecting our vital national interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4 inclusive together.</P>
      <P>As regards the first part of each question, I have already stated in response to similar type questions in the House recently that it would not be appropriate for me to comment publicly on the details of confidential discussions at the present stage of intensive and critical negotiations in the Community.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware at this stage, I had separate discussions last weekend with the Dutch Prime Minister, Mr. Lubbers, the Luxembourg Prime Minister, Mr. P. Werner, as well as with six members of the European Commission and later with the President, Mr. Gaston Thorn.</P>
      <P>I also put Ireland's case to the Danish Prime Minister, Mr. P. Schluter, whom I visited yesterday for discussions in Copenhagen.  On Thursday I shall be in Bonn for discussions with the German Chancellor, Mr. H. Kohl, and later that day I shall be visiting Paris for discussions with the French President, Mr. F. Mitterand. Arrangements for a possible meeting with the Italian Prime Minister are under discussion at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the section of the Taoiseach's answer which deals with the first part of each question, is the Taoiseach not aware that the opposition of the governments I have named is a well-known fact?  Everybody else is prepared to comment on it, and why should we not comment on it in this House?  Would the Taoiseach also say what his proposals are with regard to meeting the head of the Italian Government having regard to the fact that the greatest opposition to our gaining any exemption comes from the Italian Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first <Col N="403" /> part of the question, I do not propose to comment on the position of any government. I cannot conceive that it would be helpful.  I do not think the Deputy can be serious in suggesting I should do so in the middle of a negotiation of this kind.  With regard to meeting the Italian Prime Minister, arrangements for a possible meeting are under discussion at the moment, as I said in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach be prepared to say that what he is doing this week-end is far too little too late?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary.  From the very beginning of this whole exercise I have given considerable thought to the timing of contacts with Governments and the form of those contacts.  We have made our case by diplomatic means in the first instance, and have chosen deliberately from the outset to leave the bulk of the direct personal contacts to the closing stages when heads of governments would be directing their minds to the various key issues at Athens.  I believe that was the right approach and that it will be vindicated in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions are the worst example of political opportunism I have seen for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the discussions did the Taoiseach raise the question of the distortions in the Common Agricultural Policy of the positive MCAs?  In view of a resolution of the European Council of about five years ago that these MCAs would be eliminated over a foreseeable period, namely about five years, did the Taoiseach raise these issues?  If he did raise the issues which distort the Common Agricultural Policy, will he indicate to the House what response he has got so far?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions have ranged over a number of issues in relation to the milk problem, including the question of positive MCAs and other distortions of the competition, as well as other aspects of the negotiation of which the <Col N="404" /> super-levy forms only a part.  I do not propose to indicate the reactions on particular points of any of the heads of government I met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the fact that there is already on the record of a European Council meeting of four or five years ago a decision to phase out these positive MCAs, can we be assured by the Taoiseach that when he goes to Athens he will move to do that as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a gentlemen's agreement of some years ago.  We would be concerned that out of these discussions would come a firm decision which would be clear-cut and which we could be certain would be implemented over a period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health when the departmental committee on the functions and work of health inspectors reported; if it is intended to publish the report and implement its recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee, who were set up jointly by the Ministers for Health and for the Environment in September 1979, have not reported as yet.  I am aware that certain difficulties arose in the preparation of an agreed report by the group and that these difficulties have not been resolved.  I am at present considering whether any useful purpose can be served by the continued existence of this committee and I am pursuing this question with the Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment.  I will communicate further with the Deputy on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say the committees were set up in 1979 and have not reported to date? If so, does be expect them to report?  I understood him to say he wondered whether it was appropriate that they should continue in existence at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="405" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable difficulties have arisen in respect of this committee which met on 28 September 1979. There were nominations by the Minister for Health onto the committee.  There were nominations by the Minister for the Environment, by the Local Government and Public Services Union, a chief executive officer of the health board and a city and county manager.  Unfortunately, the committee's work has proved somewhat abortive.  As I indicated, I am considering whether the group as at present constituted will be in a position to finalise their report, despite having had a draft report available to them since October 1980.  In these circumstances I propose to discuss the matter further with the Minister for the Environment suggesting that the matter might be resolved on a departmental basis in an industrial relations setting rather than through an inter-departmental committee.  It might best be resolved by the Department of the Environment with the trade union on an industrial relations basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give an indication of when he hopes to be in a position to make a statement on the functions of health inspectors as a result of his communication with the Minister for the Environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the near future. The basic issue, as the Deputy will be aware, is one of demarcation affecting the group.</P>

    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he received a submission from the National Council for the Aged on the effects of health expenditure cuts on the elderly; if so, the action he took or proposes to take; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received the submission in question and am, naturally, anxious to ensure that the elderly should not experience avoidable hardship in the delivery of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> dental and optical schemes, <Col N="406" /> using private practitioners, were resumed in the current year in all health boards except the Southern Health Board.  That board have not resumed the <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme but the elderly are regarded as a priority group and are treated as such by the board's own dental staff.</P>
    <P>With regard to transport services, the Western Health Board have been obliged to restrict this service.  However, the cost of transport to clinics is subsidised or met in full in all cases of hardship.  All doctors in the region have been advised of the new arrangements to ensure that all appropriate cases are identified.</P>
    <P>Health boards have funds at their disposal to supply items, which are no longer available free to medical card holders, to patients who would otherwise experience hardship.  The distance of a patient from the nearest supplier can be taken into account in this regard.  Bandages and dressings applied by public health nurses are, in fact, generally supplied free of charge to medical card holders.  Consequently, I am satisfied that the points made by the National Council for the Aged have been met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is a waiting list in respect of elderly persons who need medicines which are no longer available on the general medical services list?  In some cases it is just not possible for a health board to administer a scheme which will supply the necessary drugs when needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been surprised in the last six to eight months at the very few complaints which my Department and the health boards have received.  I could count on the fingers of my hand the number of representations from Deputies relating to the care of the elderly and the occurrence of hardship cases.  In relation to the withdrawal of various items in mid-1982, the total number of complaints received by the then Minister would be approximately 150.  Out of these, about 120 were immediately met by the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is some Uturn since last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="407" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the care of the elderly by our health boards is probably the best in Europe.  I made a recent survey and am quite satisfied that it is exceptionally good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the National Council for the Aged recommend general medical service cards for all over 75 years of age? Has he any proposal to implement that recommendation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, but do not see a justification for it.  Medical cards generally and the general medical services scheme should be based on income eligibility.  It would be quite wrong if somebody with a substantial income should on reaching 75 years of age automatically receive a medical card, just as I held it wrong that persons over 65 years should automatically receive pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that those over 75 years of age are high risk patients, irrespective of income and should be subject to the same guidelines as apply for those in the younger age groups?  Would he not consider that a case could be made at least for raising those guidelines to include the over 75's?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that on the grounds of utilisation of scarce health resources.  It would be quite wrong that somebody with a substantial income at age 70 or 75 should get free general medical services.  One could argue that case in relation to many other groups in the community on either age or sociological grounds.  I do not see a logic in suggesting that persons aged 75 and over should automatically get the medical card, irrespective of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Minister considers that £77 for an old aged pensioner and his wife is a sufficient income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am never satisfied <Col N="408" /> in relation to income eligibility criteria but do not believe in their abolition.  The Deputy is proposing a measure which I would estimate to cost £4 million.  I could spend that amount on many other areas of health with far greater effect.  Surely the Deputy is not suggesting that somebody with an income of £10,000 a year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of an old aged pensioner and his wife living on £80 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The position there is quite simple: 40 per cent of our population have free general medical services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>So much for a socialist Minister for Health.  Why was the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme not resumed by the Southern Health Board?  Furthermore, would the Minister not accept that representations regarding hardship cases among the elderly are not normally made by Deputies to the Minister in this House?  They are made to their respective health boards.  That is why the Minister can count on the fingers of one hand the number of complaints which he has received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the community care divisions of the various health boards give without question every possible assistance to the elderly in their areas.  The Deputy is well aware of that in relation both to the Southern Health Board and other health boards.  There have been particular difficulties in resuming the <i>ad hoc</i> dental and optical schemes in the Southern Health Board area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the health board have not succeeded in setting up a <Col N="409" /> structure and I am pressurising on that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.  My involvement, as Minister for Health, with the report relates mainly to the recommendations for the regulation and registration requirements in respect of day care services for children.  I intend, with the approval of the Government, to include a number of provisions in the new Children Bill which will have regard to the recommendations in the report.  The Bill will give clear statutory powers to the health boards to establish such services themselves, or to enter into arrangements with voluntary organisations for this purpose.  It will also provide for the making of regulations governing the registration and supervision of the various types of child care activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate how many of the recommendations of the working party on child care facilities are being accepted by his Department?  Does he intend to amend the Health Act, as recommended by the <Col N="410" /> report, in order to allow the health boards to provide the services recommended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Ministers are involved with the various recommendations &mdash; Health, Education, Environment and the Public Service, as well as Labour.  These Ministers, I understand, are considering the possibilities in respect of the report.  I have indicated already the new provisions in the Children Bill.  I have set up in the Department of Health a committee to examine the legal requirements and the standards necessary to implement the other recommendations. The major recommendations in my Department are being incorporated into the Children Bill, for example to give statutory powers to the health boards to establish day care facilities, which they have not got at the moment and to enter into arrangements with voluntary organisations on a joint basis for that purpose.  The committee I have just referred to in relation to the legal requirements held their first meeting at the end of July and they expect to be in a position to submit their recommendations before the end of this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  In addition to that committee there is a steering group representative of the various Departments concerned analysing the cost implications of the group recommendations. That analysis is also necessary. It was identified in the Inter-Departmental Working Party on Women's Affairs and Law Reform.  Because of the large number of Departments concerned, you have to get an indication of the additional cost but that will not prevent me putting the regulations into the Children Bill.</P>

      <P>We will have the Children Bill early next year.  I have had <Col N="411" /> considerable difficulty in revising major sections of it.  I have now employed additional legal advice in my Department and I certainly hope that it will be ready by March-April next year.  It is taking much longer then I anticipated.  I had to redraft the Bill virtually from the beginning.</P>

      <P>Given that this is perhaps one of the few growth areas in employment and in need and that the preferred arrangement for any working mother is, according to the findings of the report, either a relation looking after the child or a trained child care worker, is the Minister satisfied that there are sufficient trained child care workers available for employment at this stage?  The Minister's Department have some responsibility in the existing child care courses, involving themselves in the content of those courses.  Is the Minister satisfied that that area is being catered for adequately?</P>

I wish to see the existing facilities supervised, regulated and registered. Some of them are profit-making&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Approval to a post of consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist at Louth County Hospital is primarily a matter for Comhairle na nOspidéal which have the statutory function of regulating the number and type of consultant medical appointments in hospitals.  However, there are certain issues in regard to the provision of maternity services at the County Hospital Dundalk which require to be clarified before the question of the appointment of a consultant obstetrician can be proceeded with.  Discussions in this regard involving officers of my Department, representatives of the health board and of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, are on-going at this time.</P>

The GPs and women who wish to avail of the facilities there do not know exactly what the future <Col N="413" /> will be.

The people of Dundalk will then have available to them in Dundalk for the first time ever the services of a consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never proposed that maternity facilities in the hospital should cease.  I have been concerned about whether the hospital should have resident within the hospital and servicing it on an exclusive basis only a consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist which the hospital never had and which the health board proposed the hospital should have.  The arrangements I have in mind &mdash; I do not wish to elaborate on them now because of the discussions that are taking place &mdash; will give that cover and a major assurance to the people of Dundalk and the surrounding townlands. I am reasonably confident of that.  I should like to add that I am grateful to the hospital authorities, particularly in Drogheda, and the health board for the outstanding co-operation they have given me in my efforts to resolve this issue.</P>

      <P>I agree that the Minister has a problem because such a company was to be established by the National Development Corporation, but of course we have not heard about the latter for 12 months.  I am sure the Minister is concerned about the need to establish a national drugs company bearing in mind that the Joint Programme for Government pointed out that such a company could effect substantial savings.  Has the Minister submitted his ideas on this to the Cabinet?  Has the Minister pressed his idea about such a company or pointed out to the Cabinet the substantial savings that would result?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true and the Deputy is aware of that.  The Deputy is aware that the Joint Programme for Government indicated that the task of establishing such a company would be given to a national development corporation. He is also aware that that programme stated that the functions of the company would be to manufacture and supply the general medical service with drugs thereby effecting substantial savings. Pending the setting up of that company I went ahead and got agreement with drugs companies and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries on a number of existing contracts.  The result is that substantial savings were made.  The manufacture of drugs and the setting up of a new company under the NDC is within the remit of the Minister for Industry and Energy.</P>

      <P>Five full-time posts of consultant orthodontist for the health boards have been approved and are with the Local Appointments Commission for filling.  Applications for the posts were invited recently.</P>
      <P>The health boards will continue to have a certain amount of orthodontic treatment, particularly of the more complicated cases involving the use of fixed appliances, provided on their behalf by orthodontists in private practice.  The absence of an agreed scale of fees has caused a hold up in the issue of authorisations to proceed with this type of treatment in recent years.  However, agreement is expected to be reached very soon between the Department and the private orthodontists on a special scale of fees for this treatment when provided for health board patients.</P>

Do I take it from what the Minister said in an earlier reply to Deputy De Rossa here today that he commenced discussions on this matter in December 1982 and that now, practically a year later, there has been no movement in the availability of orthodontic treatment for young people?

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>It will not eliminate it entirely because there will still be need to use private orthodontists in the most complicated cases, for example, the fixing or insertion of fixed appliances.  A number of them specialise in this area and five new men coming in cannot do all of that work.  But I can assure the Deputy that, in terms of reducing the waiting list, that constitutes a major measure.</P>

      <P>A number of grants are made available by health boards.  For example, to the Catholic Marriage Advisory Counsel the Eastern Health Board paid a grant in 1982 of £28,000 and in 1983 of £31,000.  The situation here is that the directors of community care, in their respective areas, have their own resources.  For example, in relation to another body analogous to the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council, I notice that moneys are paid by the Eastern Health Board to the Church of Ireland Marriage Counselling Service.  These particular grants are payable by the health boards throughout the country to the local voluntary organisations.  Many grants are paid.  I do not have details of all of the individual ones but I certainly agree with the Deputy, that in the area of marriage counselling services, there is need for greater expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are some homeless young people in Galway City and I understand that the new shelter at the Fairgreen caters for young people as the need arises.  The provision of separate accommodation for teenagers is not one of the Western Health Board's priorities which, among other projects, includes the provision of a hostel for homeless women.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Simon Hostel beside the CIE station &mdash; which has 15 beds at present &mdash; is catering for an occupancy of 21 or more, and that a lot of young people since the summer are calling on the Simon Community for accommodation? Is the Minister further aware that the Simon Community, because of the absence of a suitable alternative, are concerned that these young people may get into the habits of older occupants of this hostel?  Has he any plans to deal with that problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the health board regard the major priority the provision of a shelter for homeless women at Galway Regional Hospital; that would include homeless young women.  Those plans are before an Bord Pleanála at present and their decision is awaited on that project.  The local health board are of the view that it tends to be a summer problem, as I think the Deputy indicated.  One of the major general practitioners, with one of the largest family practices in Galway, indicates that it is not a major problem with regard to homeless young men. I will ask the health board to examine the situation at Fairgreen as it is usually full to capacity.  I will speak to the CEO about it when we meet next.</P>

I have discussed that matter with the health board but at this stage I cannot give a departmental commitment.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of and approves of the withdrawal of the services of the community welfare officer for the homeless at Lord Edward Street, Dublin 2; if he approves of the fact that the change of service was made at very short notice and without consulting either the homeless people who use the service or the voluntary agencies working in this field; if he is further aware that unattached wandering homeless people are continuing to call to Lord Edward Street; if any effort is to be made to assist such a vulnerable group to obtain their entitlements; and, if so, the nature of the measures to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Eastern Health Board have relocated the community welfare service for homeless people from their premises in Lord Edward Street, which has been condemned as unfit for use for some years, to the recently refurbished health centre at Benburb Street.  The board have also assigned an additional community welfare officer to the service.  There are now two community welfare officers at Benburb Street working full time with homeless people.  This means that the office can remain open all day as one or other of the officers will always be on the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health board made arrangements for organisations dealing with homeless people to be notified of the new arrangement through the community welfare service.  Many of the organisations have <Col N="425" /> indicated that they are satisfied with the arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The initial complaint was about the sudden manner in which the switch was made from Lord Edward Street to Benburb Street and the lack of notification to the people involved.  While there are two community welfare officers available, if a person from the south side comes at a time when the officer for that area is not available, the north side officer is not in a position to deal with inquiries and a number of people have been turned away.  Can the Minister indicate if any arrangement can be made whereby either officer can deal with any query, whether from the north or south side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first week after the change of location the board assigned a community welfare officer to Lord Edward Street to redirect people who were seeking information about services and, although there are now no services operating from the old office, a porter was retained to redirect callers there.  With regard to residents of the Iveagh Hostel, including the Trust organisation, special arrangements have always existed whereby a community welfare officer visited these hostels to make payments.  As a consequence of the relocation of services, the community welfare officer is now in a position to visit these hostels two or three times a week instead of once a week as heretofore.  The Salvation Army hostel at York Street is also included.  I am satisfied that the new arrangements represent a decided improvement in the services available to homeless people in Dublin city.  However, I should be glad to discuss the matter with the Deputy at another time.</P>

      <P>Liability for the cost of hospital services in road traffic accident cases is regulated by article 6 (3) of the Health Services Regulations, 1971. Under these regulations persons who require treatment for injuries received in <Col N="428" /> a road traffic accident are not entitled to avail of hospital services under sections 52 or 56 (2) of the Health Act, 1970, except where it is established to the satisfaction of the chief executive officer of the health board that the applicant for such services has not received or is not entitled to receive damages or compensation in the nature of damages, from another person in respect of the injuries.</P>
      <P>In cases where the compensation awarded is small in relation to the hospital bill, the chief executive officer of the health board may at his discretion use the hardship provision in section 46 (8) of the Health Act, 1970, and accept liability for the hospital expenses or, where appropriate, a proportion of these expenses.</P>

      <Col N="533" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The few remarks I wish to make at this stage will be brief.  On the previous day I congratulated the Minister on the way in which this important and complex legislation had been presented to the House and especially the clarity with which he managed to convey to us some of the more arcane and difficult sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I urged him then, and I wish to do so again today, that as a matter of priority his Department should develop a full, future policy with regard to aviation in the overall sense and especially and immediately in regard to airports.  We are at a stage where the use of regional airports and the feeder service provided from these airports is becoming an important feature of our transport system.  In the past few years there has been a dramatic increase in the use of this kind of service and I have no doubt that the potential market for regional airports is only beginning to be tapped.  For that reason it is vital that there be an overall policy of providing modest, functional regional airports and economically viable services and that the question of providing these services be approached in a thought-out way so that never again will we have the kind of one-off decisions as happened at Knock&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that the last day he spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  On that occasion we were coming to the end of a long day and I had confused some of the things the Deputy said.  This is simply to recap and to set the record straight.  Only through the provision of an overall, structured, thought-out policy will we avoid the kind of one-off decision that left us with the kind of albatross that Knock represents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share with Deputy Wilson a certain degree of bewilderment regarding the reason for section 2.  This is a strengthening of section 3 of the 1963 Act.  Like <Col N="534" /> Deputy Wilson, I wonder why under subsection (8) the director-general of the agency should need such immunity.  It is rather difficult to get the meaning of the subsection.  It states:</P>
    <P>The Director-General of the Agency shall enjoy immunity from jurisdiction in respect of acts, other than acts which would constitute a road traffic offence or acts whereby damage is caused by a motor vehicle belonging to, or driven by him, but including words spoken or written.</P>
    <P>I do not know why it is necessary to include this in the Bill.  I realise we live in a time of international espionage and subterfuge but I wonder why such safeguards are needed in legislation of this kind.  There may be good reasons and I should like to hear about them from the Minister.</P>
    <P>One of the main functions of the Bill is to regulate the charges for services provided.  I take this opportunity to apologise to Deputy Wilson for accusing him of a sexist remark on the previous occasion. I checked the record, the Deputy did not make the remark and I am sure he will accept my apology.  Like the Deputy, I am puzzled by the anomalies in the amounts charged on different routes in the same zones.  The Deputy outlined some examples on the previous occasion.  There may be good reasons for what is being provided for in the Bill but the loss in revenue for Shannon appears to be substantial.  I should like some comments from the Minister on this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and his officials &mdash; I am sure this includes the previous administration also &mdash; on the deal they have worked out with regard to the purchasing back of Mount Gabriel.  I know there has been a great deal of misinformed and at times mischievous writing and speculation about the role of Mount Gabriel in air traffic control.  Now that this installation will be fully under the control of the Irish Government this type of speculation, which in the past was at least in part responsible for the wanton damage caused, can be put to rest.  The bargain negotiated by the Minister represents a <Col N="535" /> worth-while saving to the Exchequer.  The Minister and his officials have shown themselves to be hard-nosed and tough in their bargaining and even if it is only a few million pounds it is worthwhile and it represents a real gain.  Like Deputy Wilson, I should also like to know the up-to-date position of Mount Gabriel with regard to repair of the damage caused some time ago.</P>
    <P>I would be very interested in knowing if the Minister has any views of his own on the third of the ten principles he enunciated with regard to the legislation, namely, the way in which within the framework of Eurocontrol there can be closer co-ordination of air traffic control policies and greater emphasis on joint planning and the cost effectiveness of air traffic control systems.  The Minister stresses, and I agree with him, that to this end the new convention must make provision for the new procedures.  I should like to know if the Minister has any specific suggestions to make or if there is any particular Irish attitude as to what can be done.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know if the Minister has any points to make on the question of the new requirements calling for greater care in the area of air safety navigation and the extent to which Eurocontrol might contribute to this.  This is specifically relevant in a week in which there have been two major airline disasters, one in strange circumstances in the area under the control of Eurocontrol.  At a time when there have been such disasters has the Minister any ideas from his own officials as to how greater air safety could be achieved?</P>
    <P>Principles five and six bring us back to a point I made earlier, namely, the matter of costs.  Deputy Wilson has pointed out certain anomalies and I have also drawn attention to them.  It is essential that there be as much simplification as possible of the financial machinery of Eurocontrol. Steps must be taken to see that the already high degree of efficiency is brought to an even higher level in the interests of costs and air safety.</P>
    <P>The general aim of the Bill is straightforward and the provisions in it must <Col N="536" /> receive general welcome in the House. They are designed to provide a greater level of air safety, even on the high level that exists at the moment.  They are designed to do so in a more efficient way, with a higher level of national control but within a co-ordinated, co-operating international framework.  The proposals in the Bill should help to meet these objectives which all of us share.  I wish the Minister success with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome this most important legislation. I realise its technical input.  In the context of the Bill I should like to draw attention to a very important matter, that is the recent growth in the number of small aircraft that use our cluttered air space, and to inform the House of what in many cases is the inadequate training some pilots undergo to obtain a PPA or private pilot licence.  There are now approximately 500 pilots operating close on 250 aircraft below 6,000 lbs.  It is important in obtaining such a licence that particular attention should be paid to training.  As things stand, all that is necessary is the achievement of a certain number of flying hours.  I think the number is 15 hours training plus a medical examination, plus a written examination in air law and theory, plus 40 hours solo flight time, and then a test.  All this relates to visual flight. It is flying by sight.  There is no comprehensive training in instrument flying and many accidents have occurred as a result of small aircraft wandering into the air space of commercial airlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These pilots have, as I said, no training in flying by instrumentation.  This is something that should be examined very carefully by the Minister.  Some tragic accidents have been due to pilots wandering into low cloud banks, banks as low as 500 ft.  At that point it is absolutely vital for a pilot to have a competent knowledge of instrument flying.  As the law stands, that is not obligatory and so these pilots are not trained in that aspect. Irrespective of how competent they may be otherwise, it is absolutely essential that they should be obliged to take a very comprehensive course in air navigation and instrumentation.  I make a very <Col N="537" /> strong plea to the Minister now in the context of this Bill to induce the flying clubs to introduce beacon installation and rudimentary navigation aids.</P>
    <P>We are living in an age in which we must have computerised flying and a knowledge of instrumentation is of vital importance.  There are something like 250 movements per day at Dublin Airport. It is a busy airport with 30 different airlines flying in and out.  The figure is 34 at Shannon and 15 in Cork.  The sky is crowded and, unless there is an updating of the rules and regulations appertaining to private flying, it is on the cards that we shall have more accidents.  An aircraft can be a lethal weapon in the hands of a private pilot.  Solo flying usually begins after 12 to 15 hours instruction.  That is not a great deal of time in which to give a pilot authority to take an aeroplane up on his own without any knowledge or appreciation of instrument flying.</P>
    <P>At this point, I should like to pay tribute to the pilots we have on our commercial airlines.  We have the best trained pilots in Europe.  Their record stands on its own.  Our airlines have proved very safe and this Bill is intended to maintain that record.  We have the best instrumentation in the navigational towers at Dublin, Shannon and Cork.  There has been trouble about manning levels and difficulties in operational techniques. The air traffic controllers complained that the instrumentation was not up to standard at Dublin Airport.  Possibly a great deal of that criticism may be unfounded but the Minister should give an assurance that the instrumentation of Dublin, Shannon and Cork is not wanting in any way.  This is his opportunity to do that.  Such an assurance would allay anxiety. It is not just a question of manning levels.  It is also a question of whether the instrumentation could be updated.  At all times the most sophisticated and best equipment must be used.  One does not look for a bargain when one is buying a parachute and it is most important that the instrumentation is of the highest standard.  I visited Dublin Airport and saw the instrumentation there.  The technical data is certainly away above my head but I would recommend the Minister <Col N="538" /> to visit our three major airports to find out for himself if the air traffic controllers are happy with the instrumentation. My feeling is that there is a certain amount of discontent.  They are, of course, quite right in their demands for the best instrumentation available.  We have a very excellent record in flying. One has only to think of Captain Saul and Colonel Fitzmaurice.  Lindberg referred to Ireland as one of the four corners of the air navigation world because of the huge ocean mass between Ireland and the United States.  Many planes travelling the southern course towards Portugal and traffic travelling towards Iceland on the north-western route have their last land contact with Ireland.  We are recognised as a most important navigational point.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider making instrumentation an obligatory part of the training of private pilots?  In 1972, 173 licences were issued to private pilots.  I have not got the 1983 figure but in 1982 the figure at the end of that ten year span had increased to 465.  The indications are that more small aircraft will be used as the enormous cost in jet travel increases. Equally, the increase in the number of small aircraft &mdash; those below instrument rating &mdash; has gone from 98 in 1972 to 241 in 1982 and the figure for 1983 will probably go way beyond that.  Therefore this is a very important factor.</P>
    <P>One is tempted to refer to particular crashes and to speak about the recent crash in the Welsh Mountains, but it would not be fair to those who have suffered. Therefore, I am loath to do that. A great deal of anxiety on the part of those operating control towers at airports could be eliminated if people made contact through instrumentation with airports. The Minister will agree that putting a person in to fly an aircraft is the same as giving a little knowledge which turns out to be a very dangerous thing. In my view the problem has accelerated to the point where we must address ourselves to it and take cognisance of the fact that many more terrible accidents have taken place over our airspace because many aircraft have flown into the <Col N="539" /> navigational airspace of commercial flights.  As Ireland increases its network of small airports the problem will magnify. With cluttered roads, communications will be by air.  We will have many smaller aircraft, such as the girocraft, which are operating in the United States. More knowledge of air navigation is necessary.</P>
    <P>We must look at the cost of air navigation to this country.  I realise there is a standard charge through the European agreement, but for a peripheral nation such as ours the Minister can make a case for some type of differential charge because there is a greater workload when the craft are going beyond the airspace of the nation itself.  Like previous speakers I welcome this legislation and I hope the Minister will take cognisance of what I said, that there should be an instrument course for private pilots and perhaps he could give the House an assurance that the instrumentation being used at our airports will not be found wanting by international standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Bill for many reasons, not least the fact that Ireland has an important position geographically in air traffic control.  We are an island on the approaches to Europe and carry a very high burden of the cost of controlling air traffic that is not directly related to our needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance for Ireland of the Eurocontrol organisation was that they recognised that trying to finance air traffic control presented special problems for a country like Ireland, that there must be some way a small country would be compensated and that there would be joint financing and joint collection of the equipment needed.  Ireland has done well out of its subscription to this convention. We have had the benefit of money communally subscribed and this has helped us to handle the difficulties of air traffic control.  It is very important that the collection of the route charges be centrally handled because it is virtually impossible to think that a small country like Ireland could enforce the collection of route charges if air companies decided not to <Col N="540" /> pay them.  Trying to collect these charges would face Ireland with enormous costs. Obviously the convention which arranged for central collection, central enforcement and ensured that none of the airlines operating from other countries would be found wanting when it came to paying up, benefits Ireland.  In my view it is important that we continue to support the suggestions in the new amended agreement.</P>
    <P>The importance of co-ordinating this sort of work should not be overlooked because not alone is it important for the safety of passengers but I can see a real danger where a small country like Ireland has to bear the cost of controlling routes which are not directly relevant to its needs and there is a very real danger that that country would tend to skimp on the amount of effort put into air traffic control. It is essential that there be some sort of communal backing to prevent this happening. It is like the farmer and the beekeeper. The farmer had apple trees which were obviously of great benefit to the beekeeper but the farmer could blithely ignore the development of those apple trees, or even cut them down, without paying attention to the beekeeper. Clearly, this sort of co-operation prevents such a thing happening.  This is a welcome measure but this convention goes even further.  It gives priority to placing responsibility for analysing the future needs of air traffic control on the community of countries involved.  There is a danger that if this type of measure is not done communally it will not be done if it is left to individual countries.  That underlines the importance of this measure. This convention also gives priority for training staff.  This is something which, if left to themselves, countries might tend to neglect.  Overall, this amended convention is very welcome.</P>
    <P>This convention has accepted what has ben in practice here over the last 20 years, namely to have air traffic controlled locally.  I understand it was proposed in the original convention that that should be done by a joint executive, in other words, that a supra-national authority would be responsible for our air traffic control.  That would have serious implications <Col N="541" /> for a country such as ours which is not only proud of its neutrality but must also consider the possibility of emergencies, just as any other country must consider emergencies.  It would be unthinkable if our air traffic control system were to be operated by foreigners in the event of an emergency.  The new convention gives clear testimony that our thinking on this issue was always correct. I will give one example of how things could go wrong if a supra-national body were controlling the system.  A few years ago the UK air traffic controllers who were responsible for controlling our air space over 25,000 feet went on strike.  We found ourselves in the position that our own aircraft could not fly in from the United States because we were dependent on foreign air traffic controllers.  That was the danger which lay along the path originally taken by the convention and I welcome the fact that they have reversed the situation and are now supporting our view.</P>
    <P>While broadly welcoming this convention we must raise some questions about its performance over the past couple of years.  It has been in existence for 20 years and Ireland, as a country subscribing to it, must consider whether it has adequately served its needs.  It is regrettable that there are still very different standards being operated by different countries in their systems of air traffic control. Ireland has been a victim of these differences. An example is that some countries operate a separation standard which would permit eight aircraft per hour to fly in for a particular airline, while an adjoining country might permit only four aircraft.  Obviously that poses enormous difficulties in trying to schedule eight planes to take a certain flight path, crossing a country which is not willing to allow them to cross at the required rate.  The result has been serious delays and it is unfortunate that Ireland has suffered in a way that other European countries have not, particularly when flying to Spain.</P>
    <P>The problem appears to be in overflying France.  During the past year or so our flights to Spain have been experiencing delays of up to 40 minutes while aircraft from other European countries do <Col N="542" /> not experience delays of that kind.  The Minister should consider whether we are getting through Eurocontrol the kind of results we need.  It seems we are being left behind to some degree.  It is important that we should press forward on this point this year when our Minister holds the chairmanship.  It would be disappointing if a body such as this which was set up to do the job of co-ordinating, should fall down through lack of effective measures.</P>
    <P>Although I recognise the virtue of unanimity which has already been praised by Deputy Wilson and also the fact that countries can derogate from decisions in cases of national importance, I still think this body may not have the teeth it needs to put through the important co-ordinating functions.  I would ask the Minister to bear that point in mind this year when he has the chairmanship of the authority.</P>
    <P>Another point relates to route charges. I read in the multi-lateral agreement on charges to which we subscribe that charges are established according to a common formula which takes account of the costs incurred by the contracting States in respect of en route air navigation facilities and services and of the operation of the system, as well as the costs incurred by Eurocontrol in operating the system.  Clearly that indicates that charges will be set in such a way that a country such as Ireland that will probably be bearing disporportionately high costs of air traffic control will be collecting higher route charges, thereby getting greater returns.  I have not the exact figures but I am given the impression that Ireland's route charges are somewhat lower than those in operation in most other countries.  I am at a loss to know why this is.  Our handling and landing charges are very high and it is not in our interests to have low route charges for aircraft which are overflying and not touching down, and high landing and handling charges for planes which touch down.  We would like to encourage traffic to land in Ireland.  I would ask the Minister to see whether we are operating route charges that are favourable to our position and if possible to alleviate to <Col N="543" /> some degree our high handling and landing costs by raising more revenue from route charges.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a figure in the region of £10 million for the revenue we collect and I am not sure that this fully covers our costs.  I know we do not face the cost of collection but it is important to discover whether the returns from route charges justify our expenditure. The importance of this point will probably become greater in the future.  Under the convention it has been agreed to give up the principle of Community financing for air traffic control facilities.  There is no doubt that the Minister has succeeded in getting a good bargain concerning the financial contribution by Ireland to take over facilities which were jointly financed.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be praised for getting a good deal.  In future we will carry a great deal more of the financial burden in providing these facilities.  That makes it all the more urgent for us to look at the system of route charges.  In future we will be depending on them to a far greater extent and we could find ourselves seriously out of pocket if we do not make sure at this early stage that our interests are adequately protected.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity of welcoming the Bill and the amended convention.  As I have said, it is good to see that an effort will be made to achieve greater co-ordination. It is important to seek international co-operation because it cannot be done individually.  I ask the Minister to take advantage of this year in which he is in the chair to make sure that the opportunity is not lost to give greater effectiveness to this job, and to make sure that the type of deficiencies which I have indicated do not persist, and that Ireland's interests are protected in the important financial job we will be taking on ourselves in future years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Wilson, Deputy Brady, Deputy Manning and Deputy Bruton for their contributions to the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> Both the amending Protocol to the Convention dated 13 December 1960 and the Multilateral Agreement on Route Charges were signed in Brussels on 12 February 1981 by representatives of the seven member and four contracting states.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Bill in this session is in phase with progress by other states in their ratification procedures.  To date three states, France, Luxembourg and Portugal have ratified both the Protocol and the Multilateral Agreement, while Switzerland has ratified the Multi-lateral Agreement.  The UK, Belgium, Austria and Switzerland expect to complete their ratification procedures by early 1984.  While the Netherlands, Germany and Spain have not given firm estimates of the time necessary to complete their ratification procedures, I am hopeful that the ratification procedures in all 11 states will be completed during 1984.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to the provisions of both the Protocol and the Multilateral Agreement. These provisions, when enacted, will enable Ireland to ratify the amended Convention and the Multilateral Agreement. I should point out that there is not a new Convention as such, but the term &ldquo;new Convention&rdquo; has tended to be used to describe the consolidation into one text of the 1960 Convention and the amendments arising from the Protocol.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill relating to the recognition and enforcement of judgments are similar to provisions being proposed to enable Ireland to ratify the 1968 EEC Judgments Convention.  These provisions are not as heavy handed as they might seem.  Their intent is to simplify and speed-up the collection of route charges in the event of airlines not eventually paying their debts.</P>
    <P>I should explain the situation in relation to unpaid charges.  In general, defaulting payers account for less than 3 per cent of the overall route charges payable and about 1 per cent in the case of moneys owed to Ireland.  While the Eurocontrol Route Charges Office may initiate legal proceedings against an airline who have continued to default in <Col N="545" /> their payments, in many cases a payment plan is arranged with the defaulting payer so as to assist an airline in every way possible to discharge their debt.</P>
    <P>The desirability of reducing the number of international organisations dealing with aviation matters was considered while drafting of the Amending Protocol was in progress.  The possibilities included some form of amalgamation with the EEC, with the European Conference of Ministers of Transport or with the European Conference of Civil Aviation.</P>
    <P>Difficulties foreseen at that time were the differing memberships of these organisations and that Eurocontrol was executive rather than policy oriented. There were undoubted advantages in continuing with the existing legal &ldquo;persona&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Eurocontrol is required in the first instance to offer all vacant posts to nationals of the member states.  The Department of Transport have been pressing for and will continue to press for more posts for Irish nationals in the organisation.  We succeeded in getting three new posts in Brussels for Irish nationals during 1983.  The Minister will continue to ensure that as many posts as possible, including those at the highest level, are open to Irish applicants as they fall vacant.</P>
    <P>In establishing the route charges system the Eurocontrol member states endeavoured to devise a system which would be as equitable as possible and that could be applied to both upper and lower airspaces.  The system is a harmonised regional system in which a single overall charge is invoiced for the area, irrespective of the number of states overflown. However, a separate charge is in fact calculated in respect of each state overflown, the overall charge for a given flight being obtained by adding together the separate charges.</P>
    <P>The system is designated a &ldquo;harmonised&rdquo; regional system because, although the charge is calculated for each separate State, the calculation formula is identical for all the States participating in the Eurocontrol Route Charges System.  Furthermore, the methods used by states in <Col N="546" /> calculating the expenditure incurred by them in the provision of the air navigation facilities is also identical.</P>
    <P>This charge is based on the cost, both current and capital, to each state of providing navigational facilities and includes the costs of the staff concerned.  These costs, which vary from state to state, are then divided by the estimated level of traffic to give a flat rate.  This rate in turn is adjusted to take account of the weight of a particular aircraft as well as the distance flown.  The charging system is therefore based on the distance flown in a particular aircraft in a given airspace.</P>
    <P>The charges referred to by Deputy Wilson and contained in the Schedule annexed to the Air Navigation (Route Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1983 (S.I. No. 82 of 1983) relate to tariffs levied on aircraft flying trans-Atlantic routes only.  They do not relate to charges levied at particular aerodromes but rather to route charges incurred when flying to or from these aerodromes from points within specified zones over the Atlantic and along particular routes.</P>
    <P>The Route Charges System works as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;States participating in the system notify the Eurocontrol Central Route Charges Office in Brussels of all flights departing under Instrument Flight Rules from their aerodromes, all data regarding departures from Irish aerodromes being forwarded to Brussels through Ballygirreen Aeradio Station, County Clare;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Central Route Charges Office then calculates the charge due, based on the aircraft's weight and distance flown;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this charge is billed to the airline concerned; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;on receipt of payment, the Central Route Charges Office reimburses the State concerned.</P>
    <P>In essence therefore, the Eurocontrol Central Route Charges Office acts as the collection agent of route charges for the States.  Reimbursement of moneys to states is made in US dollars which are <Col N="547" /> then converted into national currencies. The total receipts accruing to Ireland in 1982 amounted to £9.3 million and receipts to date in 1983 exceed £11 million. Under the new Multilateral Agreement, Eurocontrol will continue to collect route charges on behalf of the member and contracting states.</P>
    <P>Mount Gabriel Radar Station near Schull, County Cork, monitored civil aircraft in the upper airspace within a radius of 240 miles.  The facility consisted of two radar heads &mdash; one duty and one standby. The station was damaged by an explosion on 20 September 1982.  As a priority, Eurocontrol decided to restore one head to operational service.  Installation of the replacement equipment is now almost completed and an operational evaluation of the facility is scheduled to commence early in January.</P>
    <P>A preliminary estimate of the cost of restoring Mount Gabriel to its pre-1982 status is approximately £2.5 million. Malicious injuries claims have been lodged with Cork County Council both by Eurocontrol and by the Department of Transport.  Both claims are now likely to be heard in the Circuit Court in Skibbereen in January 1984.</P>
    <P>The development of air traffic control centres involves extensive research relying heavily on data processing.  For this reason, Eurocontrol set up an experimental centre at Bretigny, south of Paris. Experimental and simulation work is carried on there as a prelude to the development of automated control centres. Simulation is a technique whereby a real air traffic situation is represented in a computer and conclusions which can be applied to the original system can be deduced from the study of the model.</P>
    <P>At Bretigny, real-time air traffic control simulation is carried out in a realistic environment, and includes work positions for controllers, communications networks, radar coverage and automated back-up systems.  Officers from the Department of Transport have attended simulation courses and exercises at Bretigny concerned with the development of the Shannon upper airspace control centre.  Simulated exercises such as those <Col N="548" /> conducted at Bretigny cannot interfere with live aircraft.</P>
    <P>The estimate of £9 million which I gave in my speech as the value of Eurocontrol facilities in Ireland is made up of £3.6 million for the Shannon upper airspace control centre and its extension, £3.4 million for Woodcock Hill radar station and the replacement radars recently installed and £2 million for Mount Gabriel radar station.  These figures were agreed with Eurocontrol and, with the exception of estimates for the extension to the Shannon centre and the replacement radar at Woodcock Hill which are not yet fully costed, are the actual costs.</P>
    <P>Electronic air navigation aids and communications equipments are provided by my Department for the control of aircraft en route in Irish lower airspace and landing at or departing from the State airports and for communicating with aircraft flying over the eastern part of the North Atlantic.  The House can be assured that all aids and equipments necessary for the safety and regularity of aircraft movements have been and will continue to be provided.</P>
    <P>Expenditures for the past three years were: 1980, £0.5 million, 1981, £1.3 million and 1982, £3.5 million.  Expenditure for 1983 will exceed £2 million.  Equipment installed since 1980 includes a primary radar and communication equipment at Dublin, a very high frequency radio beacon and communications equipment at Shannon and a computer and high frequency transmitters at Ballygirreen Aeradio Station, County Clare.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government took an early initiative with regard to the tragic incident to Korean Airline Flight 007 on 1 September.  The Secretary of the Department of Transport who in his capacity as current President of the European Conference of Civil Aviation was scheduled to attend the 24th Session of the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation in Montreal later that month, was directed by the Government to work for a common position among ECAC's 22 member states with a view to their adopting a joint approach to prevent the recurrence of such a tragedy. This joint approach resulted in a resolution <Col N="549" /> presented by Ireland which will ensure that this incident is thoroughly investigated and that new binding and effective measures will be taken by the International Civil Aviation Organisation to guarantee the safety of aircraft engaged in civil air transport, including their crews and passengers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manning spoke on the immunity envisaged.  This concerns the Director General and the top officials.  It is similar to the case of diplomats and is normal procedure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady indicated that I should visit Dublin Airport, which I have certainly done.  I have not, however, visited the installation to which he referred. Some knowledge might be gained from this and I might look into it in the future. The Deputy also referred to instrumentation which, as I have already said, is undoubtedly the best available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised some points in relation to delays in flights to Spain over France.  The delays experienced by our aircraft are comparable with aircraft from other European countries, having regard to the number of flights involved. The Minister for Transport will be President of this organisation in 1984 and I shall remind him of the problem mentioned by the Deputy.  Deputy Bruton also mentioned costs.  We are not responsible for costs but we recover all costs involved in en route passage of aircraft through our airspace, both current operating and capital costs for the provision of facilities.</P>
    <P>Most of the points raised by Deputy Wilson have been dealt with already. Deputy Brady mentioned licensing requirements for Irish pilots.  The criteria for Irish licences are as safety orientated as for any other country.  The requirements are internationally agreed and enforced.  We always strive after greater safety and I can assure the Deputy that I am always conscious of the need to promote increased safety.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank all those who took part in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the point of military planes being involved.  I know that these are not, so to speak, programmed <Col N="550" /> for Mount Gabriel, as some question arose when I was in the Department.  I do, however, think that the word &ldquo;military&rdquo; is used somewhere, either in the convention or the protocol.  Is Shannon or the other Clare installation of Mount Gabriel involved with military aircraft at any time when they are flying through our air space?  The inviolability aspect has been covered, but I cannot see how a commissioner of the EEC is not given this inviolability while an official of Eurocontrol is.</P>
      <P>With regard to the £2.5 million malicious damages claim, could the Minister tell the House whether there is any fund or insurance available to Eurocontrol to cover such eventualities?  I mentioned two airlines in particular which failed, the Laker and the Braniff air companies. Could the Minister say if they owed any money to Eurocontrol and, if so, can this money be recovered in any way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to increase the statutory limit on the amount of grants which may be made to Córas Tráchtála to enable them to continue the work of promoting, assisting and developing Irish exports.  The Bill will also provide ministerial control of the remuneration, allowances, terms and conditions of employment of Córas Tráchtála staff including the chief executive.</P>
      <P>Córas Tráchtála were established by the Export Promotion Act, 1959.  The Act fixed the total amount of grants which may be made to the board out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas at £1 million.  Subsequent amending Acts raised this limit and the last one, in 1980, increased it to £90 million.  The present Bill proposes to raise the limit to £160 million.</P>
      <P>Córas Tráchtála have played a pivotal role in our export growth since their establishment in 1959.  The total value of exports in that year was £130 million and by 1982 this had risen to £5,688 million. Latest figures available to me indicate that exports this year are now likely to reach £6,850 million, which will represent an increase of almost 20 per cent over 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This impressive record is due to many factors.  However, the vital role which Córas Tráchtála have played in bringing this about is widely acknowledged.  Their ability to adjust and adapt their approach to the changing needs of exporters and to the requirements of the trading environment in which exporters operate has characterised the board's approach down the years.  Inevitably the growing volume and variety of Córas Tráchtála's promotion activities has necessitated an <Col N="552" /> increased rate of expenditure.  The board's allocation for 1980 was £8.062 million and by 1983 this had more than doubled &mdash; at £16.24 million.  The aggregate of payments to the board by way of grant-in-aid up to the end of this year will come to some £86.57 million.  The statutory limit of £90 million will therefore be reached early in 1984 and a further increase in the limit is now necessary.</P>
    <P>The present Bill raises the statutory limit from £90 million to £160 million. This may seem a very large increase but at the present rate of growth of Córas Tráchtála's spending it is envisaged that the new limit will cover requirements for about the next three years or so.  The actual grant-in-aid provision to be made in each financial year will, of course, continue to be submitted to careful analysis and scrutiny before being included in the annual Vote for my Department which will come before the Dáil in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the moneys provided annually to the board by way of grant-in-aid are spent on providing a comprehensive package of export support aids and services.  These range from advice and basic market information, specialist services in the field of market research, incentive grants for individual exporters visiting overseas markets, to the organisation of national stands at international trade fairs.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála are taking active measures also to improve the quality of Irish marketing skills with their Employment Support Scheme.  This scheme, introduced in 1981, involves the training of specialist export marketing personnel and it has been applied to selected companies for which, it is envisaged, the marketing executives will make a significant contribution to increased exports.  Over its limited existence the scheme has given every indication of being successful. Because of changing conditions in different markets there is a constant need to review existing forms of assistance and support provided by Córas Tráchtála to ensure that they continue to meet the essential needs of exporters, that they provide maximum assistance to our <Col N="553" /> export drive, and that the State gets the best possible return on its investment in this area of endeavour.</P>
    <P>The House will recall the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act. 1983, enacted earlier this year which broadened Córas Tráchtála's area of responsibility to include the promotion and development of a wide range of services exports.  The Insurance Act, 1983, which I also introduced, permits the provision of export credit insurance facilities in support of such activities.  The indications are that there is enormous potential for the export of service activities, particularly to areas such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries and Córas Tráchtála will have a vital role to play in this field.</P>
    <P>As mentioned earlier, total exports in 1982 rose to £5,688 million, which represents a value increase of 19.1 per cent over the previous year and the indications are that this performance will be repeated or even improved upon in 1983.  I have every confidence at this stage that the export forecast for 1983 will prove correct. We can attribute this fine outturn to a number of factors including: a growing awareness of the importance to Irish industry of developing new markets; a growing and more professional marketing effort by Irish exporting firms; and better support and assistance provided by Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>I know the House will agree that the outturn for 1983 represents an excellent achievement.  It is greatly reassuring that our exports, overall, continue to grow. Indeed, this is one of the few economic indicators that continues to give encouraging readings when others are sluggish or indifferent.  However, encouraging as it may be, it is clear that there is no room for complacency.  Present growth rates must be maintained and indeed improved on if we are to achieve our basic economic goals.</P>
    <P>A sustained record of growth and expansion of exports has never been more critical than now, confronted as we are with unacceptable unemployment levels and other economic difficulties. We live in an open economy and we must seek out new export outlets if we are to <Col N="554" /> begin to seriously tackle the unemployment problem at home.  With the world still in recession and overall demand for goods depressed, our export performance is doubly creditable.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to all of those engaged in the national export drive, and I take this opportunity to congratulate them.  It shows that Irish goods can compete successfully with goods from other countries and that Irish businessmen and women can compete with the best and more than hold their own.  There is no doubt that we can continue to break new ground and get new and repeat orders with our existing goods and services and our newly developing ones.  The potential is vast and the prospects are exciting.  However, there is a constant need to review, update and adapt to different tastes what we have to sell in foreign market places. There is also a need, every bit as pressing, to ensure that we have the best marketing skills at our disposal and that we make the best use of them.  In this ongoing struggle Irish producers can be assured that they will have the continuing support and assistance of Córas Tráchtála's headquarter's staff and network of 25 overseas offices in 19 countries and all five continents. I am sure the House will share my view that, in the interests of the continued expansion of our exports, Córas Tráchtála must have adequate funds at its disposal to continue its vital export promotion and development activities.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes a provision regarding remuneration, allowances and terms and conditions of employees of Córas Tráchtála.  This is to update existing provisions in the Export Promotion Act relating to these matters and in order, at the behest of the Minister for the Public Service, to bring them into line with standard provisions being inserted, as the opportunity arises, in the legislation governing all other State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>I now invite the support of Deputies to this measure which is so critical to the maintenance and development of our exports and I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in <Col N="555" /> accepting the Minister's point of view on this short but very important piece of legislation.  While the Bill may be dealt with speedily in the House its provisions carry our future prospects.  I do not wish to delay the House on this but I feel compelled to refer to some matters which the Minister has not dealt with.  I know he will support my views on those matters. The Bill amounts to a vote of confidence in our exporters and the major body promoting our exports, Córas Tráchtála.  The Bill is titled the Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1983 but the title of the original Act stated more explicitly what the legislation was about. The 1959 Act concerned the promoting, assisting and developing of exports and under that Act it was the duty of the board to advise Ministers on matters connected with the development of exports. I take it that the legislation before us will be implementing the advice the Minister has received over a long period on how to maximise our export drive.</P>
      <P>Our future, and that of our young people in particular, depends on the success of our export drive and that places a big responsibility on CTT.  It is not just a matter of guaranteeing or protecting our existing exports.  CTT must also devise methods to promote the export sector of our economy and not simply consolidate the considerable achievements made in the past.  As I see it they have a wider remit.  I agree with the Minister when he said that CTT have been more than efficient in dealing with that essential part of our economic life. Exports pay for imports and help to reduce our foreign debt.  They also provide continuous employment and it is only right that CTT, the promoting agency, should get our support and goodwill. CTT must also deal with the demand we place on them, that they dare not fail. The consequences of failure are too enormous to contemplate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been a dramatic improvement in our export trade, particularly industrial exports.  That has helped enormously our balance of payments deficit which I understand will be about £350 million this year or just 2½ per <Col N="556" /> cent of GNP, a remarkable achievement. Those responsible for such an achievement, the exporters and the promoting agency, CTT, deserve our congratulations. We should be fulsome in our praise of those who are doing such a fine job for our economy.  We must remember that the balance of payments figures can be somewhat misleading.  There has been a big decline in imports which has come about because of the drop in domestic demand and the reduction in people's disposable income.</P>
    <P>There has been a big recovery in the volume of agricultural exports.  That is not often referred to but it is important that we recognise that achievement. There has also been a considerable economising by companies on existing stocks as happens in any recession and there has been a sharp reduction, unfortunately, in the purchasing of machinery.  Investment in equipment has reduced and an increase in imports in that regard would be welcome because it would indicate a revitalisation of the industrial sector to protect and develop industries.</P>
    <P>The volume of our industrial exports is up by almost 10¾ per cent on the 1982 level, an extraordinary increase in a period of recession when other economies have had less growth in their export business.  The volume of agricultural exports is up by about 5 per cent on the 1982 figure.  That improvement is welcome and, obviously, is the main reason for the substantial figures quoted by the Minister.  Recently there has been some diminution of business confidence and we must take steps to deal with that by encouraging the use of venture capital and increased investment to develop exports.  One of the great obstacles to business confidence, which is so necessary, is the question of personal taxation.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not there is a reduced incentive to work which has been brought about by the fact that wage earners have had to accept a reduction in their disposable income.  Industry has also had to bear the increased cost of wages and raw materials.  This lack of incentive is evident in the loss of some specialist and executive staff, people I regard as an essential ingredient in our export drive. <Col N="557" /> We are finding it difficult to recruit international specialists and we should take all necessary steps to ensure that our taxation measures do not militate against the recruitment of specialists.  The result of our failure to recruit such people is that we are out of line with our competitors and jobs are lost.</P>
    <P>Our basic costs are out of line with similar costings in Europe and this militates against achieving better results in export markets.  In 1982 Irish costs rose about 6 per cent faster than costs internationally. While we have had considerable success in the export market this year, our achievements could have been greater but for the many factory closures. I accept that the Minister may not have responsibility for those closures but the magnificent achievement of our exporters could have been phenomenal had we maintained our total industrial base over the years.  The types of industries that failed were textiles, clothing and those using building materials.  We must note also that the export drive is affected by such things as direct and indirect taxation thresholds.  When one considers that three years ago the lower rate of VAT was 10 per cent, now 23 per cent, and that the standard rate was 20 per cent, now 35 per cent, one can readily see that these indirect taxes and charges have pushed up the costs of manufacturing industry.  Our industrial costs are simply too high.  They impose enormous pressure for compensatory price increases resulting in rising inflation and a loss on our industrial base, in turn, resulting in a possible loss of exports.</P>
    <P>There is at present not much incentive to invest in this country.  The productive base has been starved of investment in the recent past, with dividends taxed more heavily than any other form of income in the economy.  Indeed the capital gains tax rates are penal.  All of these work against a widening of the industrial base and any attempt at increasing exports.  We must revert to the situation in which we encourage risk-taking.  The decline in the industrial base, to which we must face up, can be arrested only by improvement in cost competitiveness.  I <Col N="558" /> should like to think that the economy will get the necessary shot in the arm from the Estimates and Public Capital Programme to be announced by the Government in the near future.  Only through that kind of investment or injection into the industrial base can inflation be expected to fall and can we reach the Euro level or average of cost competitiveness. That is the kind of thing that would renew confidence in the business sector, bring back investment, lessen the dole queues and bring about what we all desire &mdash; an increased working population generating growth and potential at home and abroad.  Improved cost competitiveness is our only chance of achieving those goals.  There is not much good in the industrial sector preaching to managers to control costs within their industry if the Government fail to control the escalating costs of essential services which have stepped out of line with the European average in the past few years. These include interest rates, petrol costs, postal and telecommunications charges, transport costs, electricity charges, the whole range of things affecting our industrial base and the level of exports capable of being produced to compete in world market places.</P>
    <P>The Minister says international demand has been picking up.  To derive full benefit therefrom we shall have to pay close attention to our cost-competitiveness in the industrial sector.  Many elements are beyond the control of the Minister or the Government but there are others that are not.  The area of essential services could be examined again.  If our industrial costs can be made to match international competition then I am sure that the figures announced by the Minister with regard to the out-turn on exports this year can be considerably enhanced and meet the target we know to be essential to generate growth and job opportunities for us.</P>
    <P>Our inflation rate is still higher than that of most of our competitors.  Profit margins have fallen.  The only way one can compensate for that in business is through increased productivity or a reduction in staff, neither easily attainable on occasions, with almost invariably <Col N="559" /> job losses.  If a serious attempt were made to reduce essential costs and services, then our industrial base would have the confidence required to generate the growth necessary for increased exports. We must be efficient and be seen to be in the market place.  This has been said by the Minister and others and I agree wholeheartedly with it.  The costs of domestic production must be maintained, even improved.  Major exports here in recent years have been from overseas capital developments.  Domestic industry is encountering considerable difficulty despite the figures quoted by the Minister for total exports.  We must remember that domestic industry is the area in which most employment is created and resides.  The cost pressures on domestic industry, as against the major foreign investors, is enormous.  Fifteen per cent of our total work force is unemployed at present, reflecting on about 500,000 of our people.  While we may lay the blame for some of our difficulties with regard to unemployment on the international recession by and large, we must accept responsibility for the number of people unemployed in our State.  An improving world market situation affords us the potential and we should grab it.  I take it that is one of the reasons this Bill provides more money to avail of those opportunities that will be created by increased world demand.  There are two ways this can be achieved.  We must once and for all grapple with our costs.  We must produce quality products, market them efficiently, making a profit for those in the manufacturing side of business. Only when increased profits are made will there be increased investment and confidence provided for people to continue investing in our economy.  We must create the environment to reward investment.</P>
    <P>It is often said now in the economy that there is something wrong in being successful, that a millionaire is some sort of parasite in society.  I never accepted that attitude.  What our economy needs is more men of wealth, who are prepared to reinvest their wealth, made through the efforts of themselves and their work-force, <Col N="560" /> thereby generating new areas of growth and job opportunities.  It is unfortunate that in our economy at present people who had been successful somehow are looked on as not having made their wealth in a legal or honest way.  The Minister has a grave responsibility in this regard &mdash; to create that kind of confidence in business people, that it is a worthwhile thing to do to reinvest, that there is nothing wrong with the generation of wealth, the growth of personal property, wealth or fortune.  We welcome it in an open economy.  All we ask from those people in return is that they would seek means of reinvesting it for the common good.</P>
    <P>We must also take a very close look at the sources through which growth in our economy can be generated.  These should be funded even if it means a transferral of some of the resources applied in other areas over a long period.  I mean a transfer to natural resources because their potential has never been fully realised here.  While I am in no way denigrating the people and policies that allowed huge sums of money to be granted to developers, and incentives given to foreign investors in the high technology area&mdash; because they are responsible for a large share of the export growth to which the Minister referred today &mdash; it is inconceivable that an industry located at home utilising domestic raw materials should or could fail if properly managed and funded.  There is a grave onus on Government Departments and agencies to see to it that our natural resources and their job potential are maximised.  Here I refer broadly to agriculture, farming of all kinds, fishing, forestry, mariculture, tourism, the whole range of things over which we have total control.  In the past they have been somewhat starved of necessary investment.  Had even a decent proportion of the money expended in attracting other industries here been spent generating the inherent growth in native resources we would have quite a number of people now employed in those areas.</P>
    <P>Of course we must protect our basic industries.  If we are to believe even half of what the Confederation of Irish Industry <Col N="561" /> and others tell us, we are now reduced to the bare industrial framework here, that any further stripping away could result in a situation not easily repaired by whatever moneys were made available to the promoting agencies.  To do that, we have to provide a healthy operating climate so that that kind of industry will grow and generate prosperity.</P>
    <P>Industrial electricity charges are 25 per cent lower in other countries than they are here.  We should look critically at that because it must place an enormous burden on big users of power.  It is now estimated that our telecommunications charges are costing Irish industry £50 million more than the average level of charges in the EEC.  A casual glance at telecommunications and communications charges, apart altogether from the quality of service provided, will give an indication of just how far out of line we are in competitiveness in this area.  That must militate considerably against the possibility of further exports from our existing industries, let alone the attraction of new ones.  The price of a local telephone call here is exceeded only by Belgium in the European states and a local call is at least 2p dearer than in any other country in Europe.  We have to look at big, industrialised states and see what is happening there.  In Germany, calls have been virtually stable for five years whereas Irish prices have risen steadily since 1979. Within the EEC we have the dearest postal charges for internal mail and 7p dearer than the price obtaining in the United Kingdom.  We have to relate that to the fact that in 1979 and 1980 Irish postal charges were cheaper than those of Great Britain or Germany.  Any operation dealing in exports uses these services and they must be at a serious disadvantage now because of our escalating costs.</P>
    <P>Our telex charges are 20 per cent dearer for a one-minute call to Great Britain than from Great Britain to Ireland.  Our charges are 300 per cent dearer for a one-minute call to the United States than from Great Britain to the United States, and our charges are 200 per cent dearer for a one-minute call to Japan than for a call from Great Britain <Col N="562" /> to Japan.  These statistics give me no joy but they clearly point out where we are being outstripped and outpaced by our competitors.  That must lead to job losses which, in turn leads to less production and less exports.  If the price structure was right for exporting industrialists, the volume of usage would more than make up for the loss by the cut in the costs.</P>
    <P>Our hydrocarbon costs are in excess of those of other countries and they are also a critical factor in manufacturing industry. The Government have a direct influence on the cost of oil because of our taxation policy.  Heavy fuel oil is taxed at £3.5 per tonne more than the EEC average. These costs will have to be strictly controlled in future so that we can expand our industrial base and, more importantly, attract other industrialists to locate their factories here in the knowledge that their cost competitiveness will not be completely eroded by ever-increasing annual charges.  I believe that is the only way to get jobs for growing population and to generate exports.</P>
    <P>We have many development possibilities that this Bill and the money provided in it will help to stimulate.  It will help existing industries and exporters and also future exporters to reach their potential. Things have been difficult internationally and perhaps will be difficult for many years to come.  Despite that, we have had this extraordinary result in exports and it goes to show that wealth can be created in any sector where we can compete on costs, quality and delivery.  Our work-force sometimes feel they are being let down by their parliamentarians who continually complain about them not pulling their weight, but I think the Irish work force are as adaptable and successful in the manufacturing sector as those in any other country.</P>
    <P>I have referred to our natural resources which are crying out for investment and which would more than compensate for the money expended on them by way of increased exports.  We have our technologically based industries and they are the result of promotional work done by a certain agency.  However, one agency cannot act independently of another, and if an agency brings a manufacturer in <Col N="563" /> here, their products have to be exported because the market here is so small and they are totally dependent on their own efforts, aided and abetted by CTT.  Our food processing industry is underutilised. We are not getting enough added value for what we grow and produce.  I keep harping on our natural resources because I believe that the value that could be got by way of exports and, as a result, job creation has never been sufficiently realised.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture has never been given enough attention.  Other countries are very successful in this area and they have not half the resources that we have.  It is in its infancy and money has to be invested there so that it can reach its full potential.  Those exports are of high value and much sought after and would create enormous job opportunities.  Our craft industries have been reasonably well protected over the years but there is such a demand for that type of export now, that we should take another look at their extent and range and see what support they need to compete with others in the market.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to consultancy services.  I supported his Bill earlier on this year and I am glad that he refers to it again because this is a potential that has yet to be tapped and our educational system is being geared to cater for it.  It can mean so much, not just in providing the service in a foreign market but in the service that those people, acting as kind of sub-agents for CTT, can offer to us by identifying a product necessary in those consultancy areas and also by helping to create production lines at home.</P>
    <P>These areas may not be entirely under the control of CTT but are totally related in the export drive.  Our new technology industries are expanding at a phenomenal rate and that is a vote of confidence in the measures that were taken and in the promotion and skills of the IDA, and the recognition and identification of the product needed in the market place, by CTT over the years.  They now contribute one-third of our output in the manufacturing sector and they have an enormous potential to expand.  We are now a net <Col N="564" /> exporter of new technology products, and that is a feather in the cap of our manufacturing industry.  There are over 40,000 people employed in new technology industries and 3,000 more in internally traded services and in that area we are a world leader now.  I will be asking the Minister that, recognising the potential there, he will ask CTT to give the enhancement of that industry his closest attention in the distribution of any extra funds and if he seeks the permission of the Dáil to do so he will be supported gladly by me.</P>
    <P>In the electronics field, the telecommunications field and pharmaceutical health care there has been rapid growth in exports since the mid seventies.  The industry was foreign owned, but I am convinced that with continued success of high technology industry there will be a continuing delegation of the parent company functions and if that is made possible on a continuing basis it will help to create and generate a basic Irish technological industry structure of our own. Only in that way can that export industry reach its full potential.  That success is now coming along and that transfer of power and skill from the foreign owners who came here originally to set it up to the Irish industrialist in that area will lead to much enhanced exports in the field of high technology.</P>
    <P>In food processing we have a natural advantage that is not available to virtually any other country at least in this latitude. We have the right climate and the right traditional skills in dealing with this, and as yet our dairy and beef processing plants are not working to full potential. How is it, with the support that has been given over the years, that added value has not been applied to those industries so that exports from them can be not just generated beyond the limits that we now know but that we can be leaders in that field?  There is no reason why CTT would be just promoting exports of technological goods but would not also promote major exports of processed food and beef products of these islands.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference in the Bill to what I presume is the main thrust of CTT in this question of marketing. <Col N="565" /> Marketing of exports is absolutely essential for the future of Irish industry, and exports success depends on the right product being available in the right marketplace at the right price.  These things are just as important as new plant and machinery.  The efficiency of any production line or any manufacture is useless unless what has been manufactured suits the purchaser and meets the customer's requirements, and that is what the money for CTT is all about.  When you consider that 13,000 Japanese marketing personnel are located and living in Europe at this time, that 1,000 Europeans are doing a similar job in Japan, that European sales in Japan are just half what Japanese sales in Europe are and that we have just 200 Irish executives operating outside Great Britain, you will understand how other major exporting countries achieve the success they do.</P>
    <P>We have had considerable success in the volume of exports that we have achieved and our future growth will depend on product development based on customer needs, and those customer needs will not be identified unless we take the same option that those other major exporting countries have done and put our marketing executives in the field. Much industry in this country is unable to develop its own marketing service. Each individual industry has its own sales force, but the help and support of marketing experts is needed in the marketplace. I ask the Minister to seek to increase progressively the number of export marketing executives that we have abroad.  We need those people there. They are not going as decoration or just to stand at trade fairs in order to be present when visiting dignatories arrive. They are going for a different purpose entirely, even though part of it is their attendance and proper presentation at fairs and so on and I support that, but you must consider that one marketing international executive costs about £50,000 and it is estimated that he will create 10 new jobs in this economy at home, which is the average from those already working in the field.  These jobs are achieved by meeting the additional export orders made by these executives. <Col N="566" /> There has always been a high return to the Exchequer.  It is a good investment to put more money into the training and locating of marketing executives in the marketplace.  A recent scheme where the Government provided 50 per cent of the recruitment expenses has been suspended, and what a short-sighted attitude that shows.  Those people at small cost have established growth of jobs at home because of their activities.  Why money should be cut off from that fund is beyond comprehension.  I ask the Minister to restore it not just next year but now.</P>
    <P>If the Government have any real commitment to the generation of job opportunities at home they should realise that the easiest and quickest way is to get out there in the marketplace to train marketing executives just as all other major exporting countries have done, and allow them to deliver from the home market. That is the way to identify new products, to alert the existing industrialists here on product trends and what the customer requires in the marketplace, so that those people at home can give their full attention to making the necessary changes to suit that product trend.  They can identify products that are not yet even being marketed here so that new industrial production lines can be set up.  The evidence is there of the number of people whom we have recruited under a various schemes.  It is incomprehensible that because of lack of funds the Minister has said he cannot continue the 50 per cent Government subsidy towards the recruitment of these specialists in the marketplace.  Only 80 were recruited in the last scheme inaugurated by a Fianna Fáil Government last year.  The first money to be allocated from the new amounts being provided here today should be in the creation of new posts of marketing executives in the international marketplace.</P>
    <P>Marketing in external markets is vital but we must also remember that there is need for an intensive effort on the home market also.  When we consider the home market takes half the national output of industry, that imports account for 56 per cent of national sales and considering the figure is only 30 per cent in Denmark, it is obvious there is a great need for CTT <Col N="567" /> and related organisations to ensure that the home market is not neglected.  We believe in free trade and free competition in the marketplace but we must also rely on self-help to keep our own market share at home and at the same time to develop our export markets.</P>
    <P>It was deemed illegal to promote &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaigns some years ago and thus it is not proper for me to say we should have a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign this year.  It will have to be labelled as my Irish purchase scheme for 1983.  It incorporates both buying Irish and buying local.  We will have to support Irish goods and there is no better time to make that case to the people than at this time of the year.  This year the Irish shopper should make his Christmas shopping an expedition of national patriotism.  That may sound glib but it means so much in real terms when translated into punts, sterling or any other currency.  It could be turned into a constructive measure for the benefit of the country and employment prospects for our people.  I am asking the Irish buying public to make a deliberate and conscious decision this year to buy quality-made Irish gifts.  We need to maximise the opportunities for our home market and Christmas is an ideal opportunity for the retailer and the consumer to put into practice the lip service that is given to promoting Irish goods.</P>
    <P>I am not asking people to buy shoddy articles.  I am saying that the quality, design and presentation of Irish goods are equal to those of any foreign product that is being sold here in competition with our home-produced product.  How else could it be when £6 billion worth of our goods are exported to marketplaces throughout the world.  Why are we not prepared to make a conscious decision to buy our products that are so sought after in other countries?  The purchase made this year of our manufactured goods will have repercussions not just for this year but for years to come.  An extra £1 per week spent by 500,000 households would gross £26 million per year for the economy and would create 1,300 jobs immediately for that small investment in our country. Last year we spent more than £1.7 billion <Col N="568" /> on imported goods that could have been produced here but still we hear no talk about an import substitution programme. These products have been identified as capable of being produced here either from existing plant and machinery or from plant that could be imported quite easily.  It only goes to make us realise the opportunities and the jobs that have been lost because of the shortsighted attitude of this Government so far as import substitution is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a continuing increase in the domestic market penetration by competing imports and one has only to look at some figures to realise how deep is this penetration.  Here we are talking about exports of similar type goods to other countries.  Fashion goods are a good example: we spent £250 million on imported clothes this year and £27 million on shoes that could have been manufactured here.  They are Irish products that are being sold by CTT and manufacturing industry in every market in Europe.  They are on display here and we should discriminate favourably in support of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Conaghan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that we were dealing with the Export Promotion Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the whole business is about.  We are manufacturing these goods for export.  We are giving £16 million to the promoting organisation to sell those goods for us.  Every year we give hundreds of millions of pounds to the IDA to attract industry here to manufacture goods for export.  Surely it is quite acceptable to ask the Irish people to buy the products we are exporting to the tune of more than £6 billion this year.  A reduction of just 10 per cent of the import penetration into this economy this year would result in 20,000 new jobs.  That is a point worth making.  We have a higher penetration level of imports than any other country in Europe.  We must be concerned about that if we are to give more than lip service to exports or job creation in manufacturing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My final point deals with what is now loosely termed our largest market, <Col N="569" /> namely, Great Britain.  It is still the largest market for our manufactured exports but there has been a decline in the proportion of our total exports to that country. However, the value of our exports still increases.  I accept fully that there have been huge increases, as evidenced by the Minister's figures, in sales to other markets but it has to be said that our market share in respect of our nearest neighbour has been reducing steadily during the years.  It was said before that we had an over-dependence on the British market.  Some 30 years ago 72 per cent of our total merchandise exports went to Britain, but in 1982 the figure was 31 per cent.  While there are those who will say it is marvellous that our manufacturing industry and the CTT marketing specialists have devised markets to allow us to get away from over-dependence on that market, imagine what the result would have been had we maintained our market share of 30 years ago while at the same time deversifying into other markets.  The employment position today would have been very different had we maintained the market share in Great Britain of even 20 years ago as well as diversifying into other markets. Had that been the evolution we would today have our total work force at work.</P>
    <P>This money is being given to CTT to develop markets.  Some of it will have to be used to re-establish our position in the British market.  It is in close proximity to our manufacturing base.  It has a large population, something in excess of 50 million.  There is no language difficulty. It is a market that should be readily available to us.  I would ask for increased promotional work to be undertaken in that market to bring about a reversal of the decline for our products that has taken place there.  If we can regain our market share the result will be a very quick expansion for our manufacturing industries and a big increase in our exports.</P>
    <P>It is essential that CTT should recognise the seriousness of the decline that has taken place.  It is also essential that CTT should be able to establish the reasons for that decline.  Manufacturing <Col N="570" /> industry here has abandoned the British market and before one can apply a remedy one must establish the reasons why we have failed to hold our share of that market.  Has our competitiveness fallen behind?  If the pressures of that market next door to us are too great for our manufacturing industries then we have problems, urgent problems.  In order to penetrate that market again there must be support from some promotional agency, namely, CTT.  We are giving that body money now to find out the reasons we have lost out in that market so that we can take remedial action.  Is the loss due to the fact that we can no longer produce acceptability in the British market? Is there obsolescence creeping in at a pace too great to bear in a very selective market like the British market?  Have our manufacturing industries decided, because of their lack of competitiveness, to opt out and seek other less selective markets?  If that is the case the figures the Minister gave us will be very short lived because technology will catch up with us in other markets as well.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that is the case but the reason we are failing to hold our market share in Britain must be firmly established. Is our presentation and design falling down?  If it is then CTT must provide the necessary expertise and strategy to deal with this deficiency in our export drive.  We must not become complacent because a substantial amount of our exports can be accredited to technological advances which might suggest that all is well with our manufacturing industry. That is not so.  The domestic industry is crumbling.  It is under-capitalised.  The machinery is obsolete.  Those in charge do not have the essential marketing skills. We must inform ourselves of the reasons some of our industries have gone out of business and have failed to make their mark in the closest market place we have, and we must deal effectively with that.</P>
    <P>We had the multinationals coming in since the early 1970s.  The British market was not their main concern.  The multinationals came here because of tax concessions, costings, labour costs, proximity to the mainland of Europe and membership of the EEC.  These were the <Col N="571" /> things that attracted the multinationals. They were not over-concerned about a share in the British market.  They are the people who account for most of our market share now.  They have played a big role in our export drive.  But we had traditional markets in other areas of activity and we must face the fact now that CTT must get back for us a substantial slice of the market share of our nearest neighbour, a share we lost over the last few years.</P>
    <P>We must seize the opportunity now. CTT must get involved in promotional activities as never before and encourage industries marketing their own products to take advice in regard to the identification of new products and new trends. Small industries must be asked to pool their resources.  There is no attitude of industrial neighbourliness in this country such as exists in other countries.  It is only in the recent past that we discovered that the vast majority of American companies employ fewer than 100 people.  Our small companies should be brought together to share administration costs, transport and a whole range of activity, including marketing, to enable them to establish a better standard of living.  CTT must be given the resources to survey market needs, discover the trends that exist in the market place, because the smaller companies do not have the resources or the personnel to do this for themselves.  They have to rely on an agency to do it for them. They must be advised as to trends and helped to meet any demand made upon them.</P>
    <P>Design is very important and we must take much greater notice of product design.  If it is necessary to amend the instructions from the Minister to CTT it is time we took that step.  They must get more involved in the recognition of design, presentation and product development than they have heretofore.  I would see nothing wrong with CTT drawing up a list of major and small companies that have been suffering from decline in older markets and providing them with support to identify the changes necessary in their production line to meet the market place in which they have to survive. <Col N="572" /> I believe that success will only be achieved by involvement in the market place and by having marketing experts out there.</P>
    <P>It is virtually impossible to establish the trend, taste and needs of the future from an internal position.  If we are to export, our marketing executives and experts have to be located where the action is so that they can talk to the buyers and trendsetters, recognise product requirements on a day-to-day basis and send back the word.  Then any manufacturing business worth their salt will produce the goods to meet that demand.</P>
    <P>We need competitive exports of a variety, standard, design and presentation equal to anything that can be found in any market place.  We need to retain existing markets, regain lost markets and penetrate new markets.  We need Córas Tráchtála with suitable resources and manpower capable of achieving the target we demand of them. We need a change of Government attitude to investment and business that will restore confidence and determination to commercial life and activity in this country. Lastly, we need results from the Government, in co-operation with manufacturing companies and Córas Tráchtála, and we need those results now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join the previous speakers in welcoming this Bill. I do not think the importance of our exports has been fully grasped by the people.  There has been a huge growth in our exports since 1980 &mdash; around 20 per cent per annum.  In 1981 it was 17 per cent; in 1982 it was 19 per cent and in 1983 it will be around 20 per cent.  If we look at this in cash terms we see there has been an increase from £4.5 billion to £6.8 billion for 1983.  That is a huge growth in money terms, and in real terms it is around 7 or 8 per cent per annum.  This year our total exports are £6,850 million. How much is the State putting into CTT? A paltry £13 million.  Successive Governments' attitudes to export promotion and to CTT like the TV spongers ad, they make Scrooge look like a playboy.  The <Col N="573" /> reality is that what we are spending is only a minimal proportion of what could be spent and of what is being demanded by CTT to show even better figures and greater growth.</P>
      <P>In relation to the performance of CTT we must bear in mind the international market in which they are working.  Since 1978 Ireland has lost 14 per cent in trade-weighted competitiveness.  Our inflation rate has been out of line with the essential cost inputs to industrial production, and with the European average. If we look further we see that the states with which we are principally dealing &mdash; 40 per cent approximately with the United Kingdom, the other EEC states around 30 per cent and 8 per cent with the United States &mdash; have an imbalance in their trade situations.  When we consider the general effect of the deflationary economic policies pursued by those Governments, plus the international recession, we see that this overall improvement and performance in exports results is incredible.</P>
      <P>Not all the credit can go to CTT.  If we look at the figures for 1981-82 we see that approximately 90 per cent of all our exports were either manufactured goods or in the food, drink and tobacco sections. The IDA have to take a certain amount of the credit for this improvement because these are the only areas in which the IDA are directly involved in grant-aiding new multinationals and so on.  The devaluation within the EMS of 5 per cent earlier this year will have a once-off effect.  I realise there will be an effect in the long term for those who import raw materials and re-export the finished product, but for 1983 the devaluation will have a once-off impetus.</P>
      <P>A weak currency is very conducive to our export promotional policy.  Many of the multinationals brought to this country have their own sales and marketing operations. They have their own international purchasing organisations through their own corporate bodies and structures and some of them, while they do not have a network throughout 19 countries as CTT have, in reality are not totally dependent on CTT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important point I want to <Col N="574" /> make is that, given this growth in exports, the overall state of the economy, the high level of unemployment and the general state of depression among the people.  I want to put it on the record that the only salvation, the only economic policy which can work for this country, is a market-led approach.  That has to be made quite clear.  When we compare this State with any other in the EEC we see that we are a small open economy with 48 per cent of out total output dependent on exports. No other state in the EEC has that dependence on exports, with the exception of Belgium.  Of the 24 OECD countries we are the second highest state dependent on exports.  We must remember that in the international free trade environment nobody owes us a living. The only justifiable long term income we have in terms of standards of living for our people is what we can earn abroad and bring back through exports.  This clearly shows that a market-led approach is the only way forward.</P>
    <P>When we take into account our competitive situation and the difficulties under which we operate, which I have already outlined, we see an enormous potential for Ireland.  This is a small country with a growing population.  There are many reasons for it being depressed, but there is a major area we can tap.  Let us examine the next important statistic.  Of all EEC imports the Irish contribution is only one-half of 1 per cent.  We are only scratching the surface of our potential. That is why I say time and time again that the only policy for this country is a market-led approach, even if it means deflation on the home market resulting in frictional unemployment and recessional unemployment.</P>
    <P>I will quote one example.  If we had, as they have in the Benelux countries, 58 per cent of our GDP as exports, as opposed to 48 per cent, overnight we would create 60,000 industrial manufacturing jobs and the direct one-to-one ratio in the spin-off service sector.  We can see quite clearly how we as a small, open economy are dependent on free trade.  Ours is only a fraction of the trade of the EEC.  We see what the Benelux countries have done.  We have enormous <Col N="575" /> potential for growth and this is the only way forward.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the schemes operated by CTT.  Their best scheme involves the bringing of foreign buyers to this country.  In 1982 they brought 1,400 purchasers here from abroad and this year the number will be about 1,200.  These purchasers are brought here, wined and dined and brought to the factory floor.  What more could they want?  Their fares are paid and they see what we have to offer.</P>
    <P>A second very important scheme is the employer support scheme whereby 90 people were taken on as marketing executives and based abroad.  This scheme was funded on a 50:50 basis by CTT and the companies involved.  It is estimated that these 90 jobs led to the creation of a further 900 jobs.  This direct sales push is the second best policy operated by CTT and I hope it will go from strength to strength in view of the fact we have such a large proportion of unemployed graduates who would be suitable for this work.</P>
    <P>There are other schemes which are very popular among businessmen such as incentive grant schemes towards travelling abroad and the production of brochures and literature.  There are also grants towards product development and design and these are of great assistance to companies.  If there are to be restrictions on the schemes operated by CTT, I would suggest that the emphasis of the finance available should be on direct company aid because the direct link with CTT represents the best value for money. Other schemes such as trade missions, store promotions, seminars and group marketing ventures have advantages but the direct company link is the best way forward at a time of scarce resources.</P>
    <P>In County Wexford there are a number of concerns in the industrial engineering and food sectors that are substantial exporters.  I have been alarmed at the continual complaints that since last May there have been no approvals and no extra payments.  This can be reiterated by the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Irish Exporters' Association.  No <Col N="576" /> travel grants have been approved and the same applies in respect of product exhibitions and the employment support scheme as well as brochures.  I know one manufacturer who is trying to break into the Greek market.  He produced a brochure costing £20,000 and was told by CTT that no money would be forthcoming until January 1984.  Perhaps that is the reason for this Bill.  Exports have a huge potential for the economy and our policies are making Scrooge look like a playboy.  We are not giving exporters the necessary support.  The Minister when replying might indicate whether grant approvals have been made since May.</P>
    <P>The embargo on recruitment throughout the public sector is a very blunt instrument. CTT have suffered a staff cutback from 358 to 320.  This is crazy when they are trying to operate 25 overseas offices.</P>
    <P>I call in the next budget for personal tax relief for marketing executives who spend in excess of 30 days abroad per year.  This would involve between 700 and 800 people.  Many of these top-class executives regard employment by an Irish company and tax rates here as similar to being sent to Siberia.  Our taxation rates are so high that these brilliant marketing personnel are easily attracted away to work for different concerns abroad.  Personal tax relief for such people would be an incentive to business people to move into the marketing sphere and this would have a beneficial effect on trade figures.</P>
    <P>CTT have 25 offices operating in 19 countries in five continents.  In countries where they are not operating there is a very strong argument for saying that people working in our embassies should be as helpful as possible in dealing with commercial matters in an effort to improve our export markets.  The embassies could be used as post boxes, if nothing else.  I recall a Deputy saying recently that the embassy in Peking cost £600,000 and the least we could expect is that they would do everything humanly possible to interact with CTT.  When CTT do not have the resources to set up an office in any country but are trying to examine the market potential, the Department of Foreign Affairs should be lobbied to use their <Col N="577" /> existing resources on a semi-commercial basis to see what can be done to assist them.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the very important area of quality control.  We can be very proud of certain brand leaders such as Guinness, Waterford Glass, Bailey's Cream, and so on.  They have been crucial in terms of selling Ireland as a front runner in high quality products.  I understand from marketing contacts that the problem is not so much that we get complaints in our international CTT offices of inferior quality.  I know Mr. John Murphy and his associates are given every assistance by CTT.  Deliveries are becoming a problem.  If people cannot be guaranteed the right product at the right price at the right time, as Deputy Flynn said, they will not come back to Ireland for more business.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, chaired a conference on quality control.  This will be the area of future development.  The existing CTT scheme of product development and design aid should be given the necessary shot in the arm and boost it deserves.  Under this scheme of design, product and development CTT are dealing with approximately 400 companies.  They are stretched to their absolute limits in their endeavour to cope.  If there is a need for extra personnel in this area, if there is a need for greater and more resources, they should be given top priority having regard to the attitudes and the policy changes of our competitors especially across the water.</P>
    <P>A pet hobby horse of mine has been tried and has failed, but it has a potential for enormous development, that is, the need for an Irish international trading company which would operate on the basis of foreign offices abroad on a commission basis selling certain products for certain companies on an export basis.  In other words, they would be the marketing agents.  This has been tried already and there were problems.  Certain banks and well-established industrial concerns became involved in the National Trading Corporation of Ireland.  I understand the corporation ran into financial difficulties and had to be closed.  The reason is that <Col N="578" /> companies restricted to export trading alone find it very difficult to succeed. They need to be importing in some countries and exporting in others to have a balance of resources, trade and profits.</P>
    <P>CTT should look out continually for a commercial profitable organisation which could act as a co-operative export marketing body and which would not advise but actually buy and sell directly on an agency basis.  If we look at the Japanese experience we see that the Sumitomo and C. Itoh international corporations have been very successful.  They zone in on a country.  They have back-up links at home for the products which are being manufactured and they export on a commission and agency basis.  This should be tried again.  I urge CTT to do everything humanly possible.</P>
    <P>I know CTT will say they already have the Irish Export Agency which, in so far as it goes, is a State company doing that very thing in the Middle East, and so on, and using State and private purchasing organisations over there and trying to make a profit on Irish products.  This is only the tip of the iceberg.  If this were organised and the best commercial brains in the country were running it, there would be real potential in following it up and ensuring that we could increase our exports.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with CTT's regionalisation policy here.  They have extensive offices in Dublin, Cork, Sligo and in Limerick servicing the Shannon region. I come from the south-east corner of Ireland.  In Wexford we have the third largest and the fastest growing port.  We have all the natural infrastructural advantages for commercial development in terms of location <i>vis-ávis</i> Britain and France.  There is an immediate need for a CTT regional office in the south-east region.  In all modesty I suggest there is no better place for it than Enniscorthy town, or Wexford.  If you look at the regional offices of the Irish Exporters' Association you will see that the missing link in the jigsaw is a CTT office in the south-east region.  That should be looked at.</P>
    <P>With the forthcoming publication of the industrial White Paper, which we all <Col N="579" /> hope will be a major initiative for development, employment creation and industrial policy in view of the Telesis Report, many arguments have been put forward by different people in the private and the public sector that the interaction between the IDA and CTT should be greater.  One could expand it to include the IIRS and AnCO as well.  I will stick to the simple argument as to whether CTT and the IDA should be amalgamated.  I understand this would require amending legislation.</P>
    <P>I would be opposed to that.  Industrial development, export marketing services and promotional services are very specialised jobs.  There should be far greater co-operation between the personnel involved.  I understand that Pádraig White the Managing Director of the IDA is on the CTT board, and there are overlapping links both ways.  On the ground the co-operation could be better.  If you take all the Departments, all the State agencies, all the bodies, all the semi-State bodies, all the organisations the State provides as a backup or a direct incentive operation to commercial life, they amount to 27.  I have always suggested there is a need for county development teams, not to amalgamate organisations and build huge quangos, but to have interaction between the personnel on the ground.  If there was someone from the IIRS, the IDA, CTT and AnCO in every county &mdash; just four people &mdash; they would be able to provide a localised expert service which would result in greater industrial development and ultimately greater exports.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to some technical matters which are vital to export promotion but are not the direct responsibility of Córas Tráchtála.  I speak of export credit finance schemes and export credit insurance schemes.  As I understand it, there are three schemes in operation at present.  There is the export finance capital goods scheme operating over five years.  Take the case of a company selling a ship or an aeroplane or a heavy piece of industrial plant to a French purchaser who wants three or four years credit to pay for it.  The company go to <Col N="580" /> their bank looking for 90 per cent credit over that period and the Government underwrite them to a certain extent.  With regard to smaller products, for example clothing or toys, where six months' credit is required as against three or more years, 80 per cent of the contract is at the AAA bank lending rate.  In those cases we must be extremely vigilant.</P>
    <P>Because of the exchange risks and so forth, the price being quoted for export credit finance to Irish manufacturers is at present in the region of 11 per cent to 12 per cent, whereas the French and British can quote, on the same schemes, 8 per cent.  I gather that the Government can do two things about this and one or other should be done.  Through the loose arrangement within the EEC, there could be an equilibrium amongst member states on export credit finance facilities and this should be implemented in full, with everybody being treated similarly. Alternatively, the regional government should take appropriate steps and I realise that the Minister made a statement in detail on this during the summer.  These steps should be implemented in such a way as to ensure that we are competitive. We are uncompetitive enough, as Deputy Flynn said, because of the cost of essential inputs such as stamps, telephone calls, diesel and everything else, so to compound the situation with a direct scheme which is supposed to help exports is not on.  There should be lobbying at the EEC to get fair play and, if not successful, there should be subsidisation by our Government.</P>
    <P>The third scheme is the export credit insurance scheme operated by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  This ensures contracts against defaults of payments due to a changing political situation in Third World countries or to a company going bankrupt.  The charges placed on companies here, which are then passed on to the purchaser to whom we are trying to export, are too high.  It has been recognised by the Government that there is too much red tape and the scheme must be updated and modernised. I call for the earliest possible implementation of those proposals and welcome the Minister's decision to set up an <Col N="581" /> advisory committee in that regard.  I hope the committee will monitor the situation, especially regarding our competitors inside and outside the EEC.</P>
    <P>The single largest reason for our phenomenal success with exports must be the export tax relief we give.  This has been in operation since 1959.  There is 100 per cent tax relief for the 100 per cent exporting company and if the company export only 80 per cent, they get only 20 per cent corporation tax relief.  This scheme is to be phased out from 1 January 1985 due to EEC regulations, but the Government should immediately devise schemes to ensure that we are able to attract the type of overseas investment that we have attracted to date, which has resulted in our excellent export figures.  If we do not have this 100 per cent tax concession for 100 per cent exporting companies, we can kiss goodbye to major multinational industrial development here.  The phasing out of the present scheme poses the most serious threat to industrial development for many years.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Flynn's comments about the number of companies which are 100 per cent exporting, and his question as to why they do not sell their goods here.  One of the reasons is that the greater the Irish sales percentage of total sales, the more they work themselves into a tax problem.  There could, however, be a review of the situation on the basis of low cost production and it might suit them to put on a third shift.  The export tax relief, which is vitally important and must be maintained at all costs, is basically the <i>raison d'etre</i> of many American, Japanese and other foreign investors here.</P>
    <P>In discussing exports, one must refer, albeit briefly, to agricultural exports, 25 per cent of all our exports being in the beef and dairy sectors.  In 1981, dairy products alone amounted to 12.6 per cent of our exports, or £640 million.  I would pinpoint areas of difficulty.  Butter sales to Russia have diminished in the last 18 months. The problems created by the super-levy and the proposals to cut back on the Common Agricultural Policy highlight an urgent need to ensure that decisions which affect our commerce &mdash; because <Col N="582" /> we produce so much butter and other dairy products &mdash; do not result in this or any Irish Government becoming the lapdogs of international politics.  Our vital economic interest in this area must be supported.  An Bord Bainne have done a very good job here.  I know the people involved and have nothing but the highest respect and regard for their efforts, in view of the overall situation.  One must give them credit for devising the Kerrygold brand name.  They have been highly successful, especially in the United Kingdom obtaining prices commensurate with British prices and are to be commended. This is the type of development on which the CTT should be working.  I know that there is interaction between An Bord Bainne and CTT, but it is not big enough.  There is an enormous potential in using the example of Kerrygold for developing other areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to beef, there is an ongoing argument within the CBF and the livestock trade generally concerning livestock on the hoof, carcases and boneless beef.  The latter gives a far greater amount of employment and value-added content in terms of exports.  Irrespective of the current financial difficulties of the EEC and the Commission's proposals on the super-levy, the Government should seek to increase the export refunds for boneless beef on the basis of reducing the rate of refund for live animals under 500 kg and also review the export refunds on heifers which are the essential backbone of the breeding stock in our national herds.  I call for the greatest possible interaction between the CTT, An Bord Bainne and CBF.</P>
    <P>Deliberate preference should be given to exporting companies with a track record.  I have had many complaints from a previous board member of CTT and from business people who before CTT was around were successfully exporting clothing and so forth to the United States. These people have a track record and have put their own money, time and resources towards locating export markets and should be given a distinct preference by CTT for grant aid when the chips are down.</P>
    <P>I outlined earlier that the most worthwhile <Col N="583" /> recipients under the schemes, programmes, incentives and aids which CTT gave on a direct company basis were in financial difficulties.  We must ask what the current situation is with regard to the preparation of the Estimates for 1984.  I understand from CTT that with their present employment level of 320, they have a twofold approach to the 1984 allocation. Firstly, the out-turn for 1983 of CTT expenditure will be £16.26 million &mdash; that is the money which they will have spent this year.  They maintain that to provide the same service next year, taking into account inflation and so forth, with more companies looking for the same service, they will need £20 million next year.  This would involve even a refinement of their existing services.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have not grasped the full potential of a market lead approach and the whole potential of boosting CTT.  When we look at CTT's individual business client relationships we see that three years ago they had 1,700 companies under their wing and this year they have 2,400.  The growth and the demand are there and people want their services.  I suggest that every pound left of the £20 million which they require to continue a refined service will mean that they are not fully able to utilise the resourceful potential of CTT as a body. That would be a damning indictment of any Government.</P>
    <P>I am aware that CTT have a new policy which has enormous potential.  It is called the market entry and marketing development finance scheme.  This new scheme is the same as the French COFACE scheme and the market entry and guarantee scheme in the UK.  This is a two-pronged approach.  If you want to launch into a particular market you have to have a pre-launch expenditure to do the market research, to see if people will buy your product, to see what they are prepared to pay for the product.  There is a certain amount of obligatory expenditure on a pre-launch basis.  Phase two is that you have to launch the thing, you have to set up an agency for it, you have to set up a distribution network and you <Col N="584" /> have to do all the advertising and the PR push.</P>
    <P>I am reliably told that in relation to any new product today, such as a consumer food product, a sum of £5 million would not be an exorbitant amount to spend to launch that product into the UK market. I understand that the market entry and market development finance scheme involves State help in two ways.  It helps a company on a risk basis.  There is a risk involved in the launch of any new product. There is no guarantee because the product is new.  Phase one of this scheme is that the State will under-write that risk. Phase two is that the company pay back only part of the original capital aid given to them because it is risk capital.</P>
    <P>This scheme has not been publicised yet but it has been requested by CTT, and will cost £10 million over and above the £20 million ordinary allocation to allow CTT to continue what this year is costing £16.36 million.  This is the crossroads for CTT, for the Government and this House.  I implore the Minister to give a commitment that with this Bill he now has the opportunity to give a very open-ended amount of financial commitment to CTT.  I hope he will give a commitment that for 1984 the market entry and market development finance scheme will be implemented.  That is the only way that Irish small companies as well as large companies and multinational companies can crack new markets.  It is too expensive and it is impossible to underwrite the extent of the risk on their own.  This new scheme has been very successful in Britain and France and has been adapted fully to launch products in the Irish market. I hope the Minister will give the commitment that this new scheme will be adopted.  If that is adopted I predict a very healthy future for our exports and the approximate 20 per cent growth we have had since 1979 can easily be maintained.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House on the basis that it is belated and that it is a waste of time unless the initiatives and the drive, which Sean Condon and the boys in CTT have, are utilised to the full. If this does not happen we are wasting our time as far as the potential of our <Col N="585" /> export drive is concerned.  The expenditure of CTT was £16 million in 1983.  That will earn £6,850 million.  If that is not good economics, you give a little bit to get a vast amount, I do not know what is. I hope the Minister and the Government will use the Bill to ensure that the new schemes which CTT have on hand will get off the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with previous speakers in welcoming this Bill which gives us an opportunity to reflect on the success of this semi-State body.  CTT were set up in 1959 with the aim of assisting and developing exports.  That year exports were £130 million and this year the figures are expected to reach £6,850 million.  This is a magnificant success story by any measurement.  Everybody in CTT concerned with this, as well as Irish industry generally, must be congratulated for this.  We very often hear criticism of our semi-State sector, much of it richly deserved, but in this case we have the example of a Government setting up a semi-State body, CTT, who have more than justified the faith placed in them in 1959.</P>
      <P>The success of CTT is a matter of great pride to every Irish person.  This success has been achieved by hard work not just in our old traditional markets of the 1959 period but by the efforts of the CTT executives and they encouraging industrialists to involve themselves in exports throughout the world.  CTT now have 25 offices in 19 countries and five continents. This gives everybody an idea of the scope of our export effort for a small country of our size and we should be proud of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is not worth the paper it is printed on unless there is a commitment by the Government to provide the money.  The legislation enables the Minister, with the permission of the Minister for Finance, to provide the money for CTT but there is not anything definite about providing the money.  In the course of his speech the Minister said the actual grant-in-aid provision to be made in each financial year will continue to be submitted to careful analysis and scrutiny before being included in the annual Vote for the Department which will be brought before <Col N="586" /> the Dáil in the ordinary way.  The Minister in considering the Estimate for 1984 should use this legislation to dramatically increase the investment in export businesses.</P>
    <P>The allocation for CTT in 1983 was £16.24 million and we are aware that in spite of the trojan work of the staff of CTT there has not been any approval for travel grants to certain areas since May. At a time of recession and high unemployment we should be pushing for more exports, but because of Government cutbacks our export drive has to be curtailed due to a lack of funds.  It makes good economic sense to provide extra money for export promotions because of the extra jobs that will come on stream.  I understand that the £16.24 million kept the organisation going up to May.  In preparing the Estimate for his Department the Minister should increase that allocation to at least £25 million.  If one is to take into account the market entry and development scheme referred to by Deputy Yates one must include £10 million also, the figure CTT estimate it will cost to implement such a scheme.</P>
    <P>Some people may criticise me for seeking an increase in the allocation and say that we should not increase grants to semi-State bodies, but this organisation through its policy of co-operation with industrialists has been very successful. The total value of our exports has increased dramatically in recent years. The 1982 figure of £5,688 million is expected to increase to £6,850 million this year.  Considering those figures it must be a good investment to increase funding to CTT.  At a time when there are 200,000 unemployed it is essential that we invest in our export promotion drive.  It is unfortunate that the Minister in preparing the Estimate for this year did not provide sufficient money to help CTT in their export drive.</P>
    <P>I read in newspapers recently that the Government were contemplating a 6 per cent cut across the board.  It would be foolish to cut CTT's allocation by such an amount.  That organisation deserves more assistance from the Government. Without our export managers the work and services of CTT would not be of any <Col N="587" /> benefit.  We should be proud of the grasp industrialists have of the importance of exports.  They deserve our congratulations. Some people believe that export executives lead a very glamorous life travelling the world, but the reality is that their task is very difficult.  Having served as Minister of State in the Department of Industry and Commerce I am aware of the difficulties they encounter.  No words of mine would adequately pay tribute to those executives for the work they do promoting our exports.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the chief executive, and his predecessors, the management and staff of CTT for their commitment to their task.  They are not just employed by CTT, they are involved in the national effort to increase exports. Their commitment to their job is total and is an example to others in the semi-State and private sectors.  In expressing satisfaction with the anticipated export figure for 1983, £6,850 million, it is important to point out that that figure hides the deep-rooted problems in our economy.  Our traditional companies are experiencing great difficulties and the success of our export drive reflects the success of the IDA in recent years in attracting new technologies in the pharmaceutical and electronic sectors.  It is unfortunate that our traditional industries are collapsing.  It is heartening to know that the pharmaceutical and electronic industries are successful but they do not have a big employment potential. We are all too well aware that the companies that provided a big number of jobs have got into serious difficulties due to a lack of research and development, and a failure to improve marketing techniques and produce new products.  This is the underlying, deep-rooted problem in our economy that the Government must tackle.</P>
    <P>Looking at Córas Tráchtála, I do not want to concentrate on the various individual incentive schemes they have &mdash; travel grants, trade promotions, stores promotions and so on, all of which are excellent &mdash; but I should like to avail of this opportunity to ascertain where we go from here having reached our exports <Col N="588" /> target for the year 1983.  I would suggest that it is time the title of the organisation, the Irish Export Board was changed to &ldquo;Irish Trade Board&rdquo; thereby reflecting its trade aspect, being conscious of the problems they encounter in the market places when engaged in promotions at Government to Government level.  I know that on trade missions one is moving in a world in which protectionism is the order of the day.</P>
    <P>I feel it would help the image of the organisation were it called the Irish Trade Board rather than the Irish Export Board.  Its scope might also be expanded. Of its nature it is at present export-orientated. I should like to see them involving themselves not merely in export work but also on the domestic market.  Indeed, there may well be good reason for an amalgamation of the Irish Goods Council with the Irish Trade Board so that the expertise of both might be utilised to the maximum for the benefit of our manufacturers. In this way we could build up companies on the domestic front &mdash; some of those companies who are at present very successful in the export field &mdash; placing them all under the one umbrella with one management or executive.  We might find then that some of our exporting companies would be prepared to be involved more in the domestic market, which is, after all, a very important element of trade.  I could not sufficiently emphasise the importance of the domestic as well as the export market.  Therefore it is important that CTT and the Irish Goods Council should come together.  There is tremendous scope for them.</P>
    <P>The whole area of agricultural exports calls for greater co-operation in this regard.  It is ludicrous that there is an organisation as successful as CTT and at the same time we have operating the equivalent of the old Pigs and Bacon Commission, the CBF, and various marketing agencies in the agricultural field. We are an agricultural country and our potential for future employment must be in the added value of our agriculture, our animals and food processing generally.  It is ridiculous that our agricultural exports would be on a different level from that of our industrial exports.  There is scope for <Col N="589" /> amalgamation of all effort.  It should be remembered that of all our exports agriculture accounts for 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The extent of the co-operation between the various agencies seems to be their meeting and sharing the same stands at trade shows and, to a large extent also, stores promotions.  The rivalry between the Department of Agriculture and of Trade, Commerce and Tourism should be eliminated in this respect.  I might give the House an example of a ludicrous situation in which I found myself when I had the honour of leading a trade mission of approximately 25 industrialists to Japan in 1978.  Since then through the continuous efforts of CTT and other trade promotions and schemes our exporters have been very successful on the Japanese market.  Yet on that particular mission in which I was involved there were in Japan at the same time representatives of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  I felt it should have been one national endeavour rather than a small island such as ours sending our people all the way to Japan for diversified purposes, perhaps to an extent damaging the effectiveness of the operation.  To their credit the Pigs and Bacon Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Future emphasis must be on having our products properly researched, developed designed and packaged.  If we are to continue to be successful in our export efforts there must be greater co-operation between the IDA, the Kilkenny Design Workshops, CTT, the Irish Quality Control Agency and all other agencies.  The need for such co-operation is highlighted in a report which was prepared on exports to Great Britain, the conclusions and recommendations of that report making interesting reading.  This report was prepared by PA Management Consultants, <Col N="590" /> engaged by CTT, in October 1982 to carry out a survey in order to identify the reasons behind the fall-off in our export figures.  However, I shall leave them until the morning because I shall be asked to report progress in a moment.  I intend to go into those conclusions and recommendations in greater detail in the morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Something like that.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other aspects of our export effort on which I should like to elaborate.  There is, first, the need for an Irish Trade Board rather than an Irish Export Board, greater co-operation with and organisation of the domestic market as well as the export market.  Basically this is an enabling Bill.  It is not providing funds, as such.  It allows the Minister seek funds from his colleague the Minister for Finance.  Assuming he receives approval from the Minister for Finance and the Government, he will then be able to give the money to CTT.  It is not a Bill that gives money to our export effort, and it is funding of that export effort that is at present required because of our present unemployment figures.  The unemployment figures are unacceptable from the national and social point of view.  It is essential that we get this money.  I appeal to the Minister to redouble his efforts at the Cabinet table to ensure that the allocation of funds to CTT in 1984 will enable them continue the work they have undertaken so successfully so far.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the saddest spectacles of our times is seeing fairly regularly in our District Courts very elderly persons, good solid citizens who have given great service to the country over a long lifetime, <Col N="591" /> because they are residing in formerly rent controlled dwellings and their landlords, under legislation introduced in this House, are enabled to have their case for increasing rents, albeit low rents, decided in a District Court.</P>
    <P>This House has debated the issue on a number of occasions and there is complete unanimity on all sides that the District Court is not a suitable or appropriate place in which to decide these applications for increases in rent, particularly because of the hardship caused to the tenants involved in court cases with the adversary situation and aggressive cross-examining, etc., which is part and parcel of court proceedings.  To avoid that, this House enacted legislation establishing tribunals.  Unfortunately, in bringing forward that legislation, those whose cases had already been brought before the courts were not allowed to have them transferred for hearing before the new tribunals.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was discussed here last July it was in response to pressure from Fianna Fáil Deputies who had consistently pressured the Minister for the Environment to introduce this urgently needed legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though he left it until the last minute we thanked him for coming forward even at that late stage with the Bill.  However, this meant that the debate on that occasion was very limited and very little time was given to discussing the merits and de-merits of aspects of the Bill which were causing concern to Members on all sides of the House.  On that occasion I asked the Minister if he would consider the points being made and come forward at a later stage with proposals to deal with the difficulties which tenants were facing whose cases had already been brought before the District Court but had not been heard.  Since that debate in July nothing has been heard from the Minister for the Environment in regard to these cases.  It falls to <Col N="592" /> Fianna Fáil to bring forward, in the form of this Private Members' Bill, proposals to deal with the situation of tenants whose cases are before the courts and who do not derive any benefit from the establishment of the new tribunals.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this legislation, therefore, is to amend the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) (Amendment) Act, 1983, in relation to the applications made to the court before 2 August 1983 but, so far, unheard.  The present situation, under section 10 of this Act, is that the applicant, usually the landlord, may withdraw the application and make a new application to the tribunal if the other party consents.  The purpose of this Bill is to change that, so that either party, most likely the tenant, without the consent of the other party, can apply to the tribunal despite the fact that the matter has already been referred to the courts. In other words, this Bill will enable tenants to have any application to the District Court made before 2 August 1983 withdrawn and a new application to fix the rent or premises under the 1982 Act, as amended, to be heard by the tribunal established by the 1983 Act.  In effect, the proposal will apply equally to landlords and tenants, but in reality, most applications have been made by landlords. The proposed amendment contained in this Bill will also obviate the necessity for both parties to consent to the applications being made.  The Bill will ensure uniformity of rents by having as many as possible dealt with by the tribunal or the housing authority and will further ensure that as many cases as possible are heard in the informal setting of the tribunal, rather than before a court which strikes fear into the hearts of many elderly persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill will not deprive a landlord of the opportunity of having his rent fixed but it will ensure that the rent will be fixed by a more appropriate body, namely the tribunal. As the House knows, Fianna Fáil at all times favoured the establishment of a tribunal and supported the Minister when he introduced the Bill in July last which established the tribunals.  The proposal now contained in this short Bill reflects Fianna Fáil's commitment to the tribunals <Col N="593" /> already established and the need for informal procedures to apply to the fixing of rents.  The tribunals have many powers to ensure that fair rents are fixed which do not apply to the District Court, such as the power to engage consultants.  In these circumstances, it is clear that all Members should support this Bill which represents a positive commitment to the need to ensure that fair rents are applied by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>When the Bill establishing the tribunal was being debated in this House on 7 July 1983 the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Quinn, highlighted the advantages in having their cases heard before the tribunal rather than the courts.  In Volume 344, column 2515, of the Official Report he stated:</P>
    <P>.... the persons coming before District Justices were often unaware of their rights, not properly represented, scared and anxious about the procedures used and of the threat to their homes.  The courts did the best they could in these difficult circumstances but there was no way in which they could change the formal and adversary nature of the proceedings which, as every Deputy knows, was of such concern to the often elderly persons who had to appear before them.  It is my belief that the proposals contained in the Bill will overcome many of the problems for landlords and tenants coming before the courts and that the structures set up will provide a more suitable forum for the determination of the rents of the dwellings in question.</P>
    <P>He goes on to give further examples of the desirability of putting an end once and for all to rent increase applications being heard in the District Court environment which, as everybody in that debate and in previous contributions in this House have emphasised and agreed, is most unsuitable and undesirable, particularly taking into account the age of the majority of the people involved.</P>
    <P>A large number of the people who resided in formerly rent controlled dwellings have, in fact, up to now been denied <Col N="594" /> the opportunity of having their cases heard before the tribunal which this House established.  Everyone who was here on the occasion of that debate will agree that it was clearly the wish of all sides of the House that the tribunals be established as quickly as possible.  When the original Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, was being debated it was understood that all sides wished to have the tribunals established as quickly as possible.  It was understood that that legislation was only the immediate response of the Government of the day to a difficult situation that had arisen following a Supreme Court decision and that the District Court was to be used only in the short term in this context.  It was understood by all sides that it never was the intention that any substantial number of cases would fall to be heard before the District Court.  The intervention of the General Election in 1982 obviously had a part to play in causing a delay in the Government bringing forward legislation to establish the tribunals. Then, there was a delay in the formation of a new Government and unfortunately the new Government delayed until July when they responded to pressure from Fianna Fáil and finally brought in a Bill. However, the legislation that was brought in then is of little benefit to a very substantial number of tenants.  In bringing forward this Bill today we are expressing our concern for those tenants and we are indicating a way in which they can be taken out of their predicament. Our Bill would simply enable either the tenant or the landlord to transfer a case from the District Court to the tribunal if either party so wished.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tabled an amendment to our Bill.  That amendment reads that:</P>
    <P>... Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill:</P>
    <P>(a)  because the Bill would have the effect of removing a right of application to the Courts subsisting at the time of the making of the application and would consequently be in serious risk of being found repugnant to the Constitution, and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> (b)  because its main provision would have the effect of permitting the respondent to an application to the District Court to withdraw the application against the wishes of the person making the application.</P>
    <P>The Minister is opposing the Bill on the grounds that there is a possibility of its being repugnant to the Constitution and also because he is of the opinion that it would have the effect of permitting the respondent to have an application to the courts withdrawn against the wishes of the person making the application.  We had contributions in that vein from the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment when this matter was being debated in July last but I do not accept that the reasons given by the Government side are the end of the story. In July last we stated that in our opinion the matter had not been given adequate consideration and that we would not accept that it should be left at that without any action being taken.  We said we did not accept that the legal advice being given to the Government on the matter was necessarily the correct advice.  We have substantial legal opinion available to us which indicates that the Minister's stand may not be correct.  However, I shall return to that at a later stage.</P>
    <P>In the interest of the tenants who have been affected so badly up to now, it is incumbent on Fianna Fáil to highlight this difficulty, to bring the question back to the floor of the House and in that way to put as much pressure as possible on the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that all of these tenants will benefit from the newer situation and have their cases removed from the court.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, was speaking on this matter on the other occasion he said, as reported at column 2517 of the Official Report for July 7, 1983:</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that, where a person has applied to the District Court to have his case determined and the case has not been determined at the time of the commencement of the Act, he or she should have the right to withdraw <Col N="596" /> the case, with the consent of the other party, and transfer it for hearing before the tribunal.  Consideration was given to providing for the automatic transfer of such cases to the tribunal and we wanted to do so, but we have been advised by the Attorney General that such action would be unconstitutional. Similarly, the tribunal could not be given the power to review cases already heard by the District Court except in so far as the cases come up for review in the normal fashion after the five year period had elapsed.</P>
    <P>We can see clearly that on July 7 the Minister informed the House that the Attorney General's advice to the Government was that the moves as proposed, and as proposed again in this Bill, would be unconstitutional.  But in the amendment which the Minister is putting before the House today he does not seem to be so positive about the constitutionality or otherwise of what we are proposing. The words used now are that there could be a serious risk of the provisions being declared repugnant to the Constitution. In other words, there is a new doubt so far as the Government are concerned, a doubt that did not exist when the matter was being discussed in July last.  Consequently the Minister's adamant statement to the House that he had received advice from the Attorney General to the effect that giving either party the right to have his case transferred would be deemed unconstitutional has now been changed to the wording that there would be a serious risk that it might be deemed unconstitutional.  Already, then, there is a difference in the opinion of the Government side.</P>
    <P>Only last week we had a Bill before the Dáil which proposed providing for the granting of voting rights to British citizens living here.  Initially, the Minister of State informed the Dáil that the legal advice was that that Bill would be constitutional but when the debate was coming to a conclusion he agreed with the strong view from Fianna Fáil that there was a possibility that the Bill might be considered to be unconstitutional.  There was unanimity on both sides here with the <Col N="597" /> suggestion that the President refer the Bill to the Supreme Court.  That is the only way in which a final determination of constitutionality can be made.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of the Minister for the Environment inquiring as to why we have decided to bring forward this Bill at this time, I would remind him that we have given the Government a reasonable length of time &mdash; since July last &mdash; but that we have not had any response to the appeal I made then when I urged the Minister to proceed immediately with the establishment of the tribunals so that the majority of the people concerned might have their cases heard.  I urged the Minister also then to take heed of what has been said during the debate and to go back to the Attorney General and seek further legal advice with a view to ascertaining whether what the House was asking might be done.  I urged the Minister to do what he could to help.  I concluded by saying that we did not wish to do anything that would prevent the Bill becoming law but that we accepted that there was a flaw in it.  We still believe that that flaw is there and we have the sorry spectacle of many people waiting to have their cases heard before the District Court, cases which make very sad reading.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the mechanics of the decision making of judges in relation to the levels of new rents.  That is a more complicated area.  I am concerned about the continuation of the hearing of these cases before the District Court.  It is incumbent on the Minister to take steps along the lines we are proposing which we claim are not unconstitutional.  In making that assertion I appeal to the Minister to accept the Bill &mdash; it is very short and consists only of one pertinent section &mdash; and let the House pass the Bill and let this question of constitutionality be determined by the appropriate authority, the Supreme Court.  I have no doubt that the President would respond to the wishes expressed in Dáil debates and would also respond to appeals which had been made to him by private tenants' action groups in this city.  I have here a copy of a letter addressed to the President and dated 21 October 1983 in which a <Col N="598" /> similar request regarding the whole operation of this Act was made by the Donore branch of the Private Tenants' Action Group calling on the President to intervene in view of the fact that there was no response from the Government.  If you will allow me, Sir, I will insert a small paragraph from this letter in the record. The letter is signed by Mrs. Sarah Murphy and Mrs. May Hoare.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Our question, Mr. President, is this ... when a Bill of this kind is enacted &mdash; who is appointed to see that it is carried out in the manner envisaged by the legislators?  In a Dáil Adjournment Debate on 24 March last, Mr. Ruairí Quinn, T.D. stated that he was aware that perhaps Section 13 of the Act was not being interpreted by the Courts in the way that the legislators wanted it to be interpreted.  He further stated that &ldquo;he would hope that the Courts in the general manner would take note of what we have said today and of what has been said during the passage of the Bill last July so that the proper relationship between what the legislators want, on the one hand, and what the courts have to administer, on the other, is clearly seen and that our intentions are clearly seen.  He would take the representations that have been made and bring them to the notice of the Minister for Justice to enable him to handle it in the manner that is appropriate for his jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>These people offered the comment:</P>
    <P>The very idea of hoping that the courts would take note of what was said re the Bill is utterly ridiculous &mdash; when the living standards of so many tenants lay with the proper interpretation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The whole solution to this problem is to get these cases out of the District Court and into the new tribunal situation where, it is to be hoped, all the relevant factors could be more appropriately and properly considered.</P>
    <P>We are appealing to the Minister today to accept our Bill and allow the President to refer it to the Supreme Court.  I quote an instance where only last week a similar <Col N="599" /> suggestion was accepted by the Minister although he himself was bringing forward the Bill on that occasion.  I do not think that the fact that this Bill is being introduced by an Opposition party should be a valid reason for the Government to reject it.  We have a role to play here in legislation, albeit not as active a role as Government because of their special position, but this House allows the Opposition the opportunity to introduce Bills of this nature where it sees a serious need exists.  In this case we believe that an emergency exists.  Legal opinion which the Attorney General is giving the Government need not necessarily be the only legal opinion in this matter, and I suggest that the Minister seek further legal advice from a wider source.</P>
    <P>Maybe the position is the Minister can claim that he is correct as the law stands, but let us accept the fact that this House is the only place where laws can be changed and new laws can be made. If the Deputies elected to Parliament are not going to take the initiative and change the laws to safeguard the rights of individual citizens, then there is obviously a very serious omission on the part of the Legislature, and we feel our responsibility rests in acting on behalf of those sections of our community who are not being dealt with fairly.  There is no doubt in any-body's mind on either side of the House that the trauma experienced by tenants who have had to suffer the indignities of court hearings in these rents cases is a serious blight on our society today which requires urgent action.  There have been moves by certain property companies to capitalise on the situation in anticipation of the Supreme Court decision, and advantage has been taken of elderly citizens in a large number of cases.  Serious concern is being expressed at the activities of a company known as the Folio Company, I think, who, I understand, set about purchasing nearly 600 artisan dwellings in this city at a very low price, something around £1,200.  They were of little value in view of the rent controls but they were acquired in anticipation of changes in the legislation. Now the tenants <Col N="600" /> in these dwellings which were bought at such a low figure by this Folio Company are finding themselves brought before the District Court to have their rents increased by enormous amounts which is causing great distress to the tenants of these dwellings whose whole enjoyment of life has been sapped away. Anybody who has met with people caught in this situation cannot but have the utmost sympathy for them in the tragedy that has befallen them in their later years.</P>
    <P>There is a serious obligation on all of us in this House to stand up, to speak for the weaker sections and to insist that Governments take appropriate actions. It is impossible for these poor people to understand that the TDs in the Dáil, where legislation is passed which has resulted in them finding themselves in such a serious plight, cannot take any action, or so they say.  The Minister says he cannot take any action to save them from this difficult situation because the matter is unconstitutional.  I tell the Minister that the laws are made here and the laws can be changed here.  We appeal to him to act along the lines suggested in our Bill.  If there is some other way better than the wording and method implied in the short Bill which Fianna Fáil are proposing here, we will readily welcome it and encourage the Minister to come forward with his own Bill to do what we are asking.  If our wording is inadequate in some way, then we appeal to the Minister to come forward with his own Bill but to act on behalf of the people I have spoken of as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of constitutionality, I suspect that that is the only opposition, defence, comment or contribution that the Minister for the Environment is going to make in response to this Bill.  I want to say first of all, that the tribunal which is under discussion here was established by the 1983 Act.  It must be presumed, therefore, to be constitutional as the Act has been signed by the President and is a law of the land.</P>
    <P>At present the parties may, on consent, withdraw the application from the court. That is the position under the 1983 Act. This Bill which we are proposing here <Col N="601" /> merely allows either party to withdraw a case that has not come for hearing in the court and to transfer it to the tribunal. We claim this is not unconstitutional. First, the jurisdiction of the District Court is statutory, not constitutional.  It may be added to or taken from by statute. Secondly, specific matters may be excluded from the District Court jurisdiction. For example, actions for libel or slander are so excluded.  Thirdly, only the High Court and the Supreme Court have a constitutional jurisdiction unalterable by statute.  I should like to refer the Minister to the Sinn Féin funds case in 1950 in the Irish Law Reports.  This deals with constitutional jurisdiction.  It does not apply to a jurisdiction which was conferred by statute and may be removed by statute.  The Sinn Féin case also relates to matters in the purely judicial domain. The fixing of rents is not in such a domain. If it were, the 1983 Act brought in by this Government would be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil would not object if the Bill were referred to the Supreme Court by the President to test its constitutionality under Article 26 of the Constitution.  This is the constitutional way to deal with the Minister's objection.  I believe the Government's motion is an attempt to substitute their view on the Bill's constitutionality by stopping it ever getting to the courts.  There is no bona fide doubt about this Bill.  The Government are afraid to approach it on its merits because they want to back the landlords who are making exorbitant profits.  They are afraid to be seen to do so and, therefore, they have invented this bogus technicality.</P>
    <P>People suggest to me that some relatives of people in high places in the Government may have a vested interest in some of the dealings in regard to some of the cases that are being brought before the courts.</P>

      <P>The debate that we agreed to allow to take place last July had to be short because the Dáil was going into summer recess and there was a considerable amount of legislation that had to be dealt with.  We were anxious that the Bill dealing with this matter should be passed into law and that the tribunals be established by the Minister.  The debate was a very short one.  The point I have made was brought out in that debate.  I tabled amendments on behalf of Fianna Fáil and there was also an amendment tabled by The Workers' Party.  The Minister rejected them on the grounds that his legal advice was such that they could not be accepted and that he could not promote legislation that was unconstitutional. There is a serious doubt about constitutionality.  I have mentioned some of the legal arguments against the Minister's claim that it was unconstitutional. We have had Bills during the years where doubt has existed.  I am suggesting there is sufficient doubt to warrant it being referred to the President.  I am asking the Minister to do that and to let the tenants have the benefit of the new situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> During the years the Labour Party have claimed in their policy statements to have a keen interest in the welfare of the weaker sections of the community. Therefore, the Minister for the Environment must be in full sympathy with the case I am making on behalf of these people.  I hope his response will be a dynamic, generous and positive one, showing his concern in a real way.  Too much lip-service is often offered in matters of this kind.  People outside cannot make any change in the present legal situation.  That falls to Members of this House and now we are giving the Minister an opportunity to correct what we consider to be a very serious wrong.  We are asking him to put an end to the fear and terror to which our elderly citizens are being subjected, not deliberately by anyone involved in the courts system but because of the nature, structure and the procedures of the courts.  They are totally unfamiliar to people who in most cases have never had occasion to visit a courthouse and certainly who have not been a participant in legal proceedings.  I do not think any words of mine could exaggerate the distress being caused and which will continue to be caused to many hundreds of people.  It is not good enough to allow that situation to continue.  When the debate was taking place in this House we were concerned to have tribunals set up to have the cases heard before them.  Now we know several hundred people will not benefit from the Act and their cases will be heard in the courts.</P>
    <P>I claim our Bill is not repugnant to the Constitution and I challenge the Minister to give good legal argument in substantiation of his claim that it is unconstitutional. It is not good enough to come here and tell us the Attorney General told him it was unconstitutional and, therefore, that all of us have to genuflect and walk away.  We do not accept that. We want to hear the considered legal opinion of the Attorney General and to have it on the record so that it can be examined by others who may have greater expertise in constitutional law than the present incumbent of that office. He does not hold all the knowledge and <Col N="604" /> I am sure he would be the first to agree with that.  If there is serious hardship being caused to so many citizens, surely there is an obligation on us to seek the best possible legal advice and to find a solution?  If the will is there, that can be done.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept our Bill and to allow the proper court of judgment to decide on the issue of constitutionality. I plead with him to accept the Bill and to allow it to go before the Supreme Court where it can be judged as to its constitutionality.  That is the only forum we can accept as final arbiter on this issue.  The elderly citizens of this country deserve that of the Labour Party and of the Government.  They deserve it for the great service they have given to the country during the years.  We should not let them down now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with some surprise I find we are here tonight discussing this Bill.  Deputy Molloy's main contention seemed to be that Fianna Fáil are the good guys in relation to the Rent Tribunal and that it was at the request and the urging on of Fianna Fáil that we introduced the legislation before the summer recess.  I think Deputy Molloy will remember right through the period from March to November 1982 on numerous occasions on the Opposition <Col N="605" /> benches both myself and Deputy Quinn and other Members of the Opposition were requesting the then Minister for the Environment to bring forward legislation to set up a Rent Tribunal at a time when the Order of Business was far more orderly than it is presently.  But, in fact, we were getting very little response.</P>
    <P>The Deputy makes the point that the legislation was perhaps rushed.  That might be a slight overstatement but there certainly was an urgency to bring the legislation before the House.  A commitment was given during the election campaign and, in fact, I think it was a major achievement that the legislation was introduced in the House before the summer recess.  It is less than four months since we introduced the legislation here, legislation which this Bill now seeks to amend.  Although the debate concerned was somewhat truncated at the time by the need to set up the Rent Tribunal before the summer recess, I believe the matter which is the subject of this Bill was debated in full at that time.  Further, at that time a clear and unequivocal statement was given of the reason why this type of amendment was not acceptable and I regret very much that the Opposition seem intent on seeking party political advantage at this stage in an area of such concern and anxiety for many elderly people in our community.</P>
    <P>The intent of this Bill is to amend section 10 of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) (Amendment) Act, 1983, to enable either party, the landlord or the tenant, to withdraw a case from the courts and transfer it to the Rent Tribunal. Of course, Deputy Molloy makes the point that it is for this House to legislate, and on that I can only agree with him.  In the past we have shown that we have sadly fallen very, very far behind in terms of being the proper forum for legislation, but I think Deputy Molloy will have to agree with me that this House cannot change the Constitution.  This proposal which Deputy Molloy is now promoting was one that was examined fully with a view to including it in the 1983 Act itself.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately &mdash; and I say this while agreeing with the sentiment and objective <Col N="606" /> behind an amendment like this, which is obviously in many ways commendable, and I find myself in agreement with the <i>raison d'être</i> behind Deputy Molloy's amendment to facilitate and relieve the anxieties and the traumas experienced by older people caught up in the courts for the first time in their lives &mdash; this course of action was not open to the Government some months ago and is still not open to the Government.  The clear advice of the Attorney General was that such a provision would be unconstitutional. Neither the Government in their legislation, nor any individual party to a hearing, can unilaterally withdraw a case from the courts and transfer it elsewhere. This proposed legislation will purport to give such a right and it is the legal opinion available to the Government that this could not be successfully defended from constitutional challenge.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat surprised, I have to admit, at the weakness in Deputy Molloy's argument because I felt coming into the House this evening that he would bring forward the weight of legal argument because he was well appraised last summer of the difficulties we had experienced in relation to this particular proposal.  I think he was also well appraised, and in agreement perhaps, with the desirability of a proposal such as this which the Minister of State would have willingly and gladly promoted at the time, but it was not possible.  I am afraid I am rather saddened at the lack of weight in any legal argument put forward by the Deputy in promoting this Bill this evening. It is very easy for any Opposition to sit back and demand that certain things should be done.  They are not charged with the responsibility of implementation. The Government of the day must act responsibily and cannot introduce or support legislative proposals which, it is advised, would be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>What the present Bill would purport to do is put a person, who has properly applied to the courts in accordance with the statutory right given to him in the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act 1982 to have his case determined, in the position of having his case struck out retrospectively, and thus his statutory <Col N="607" /> right denied, by the person who is the opposing party to him in the case.  This, we are advised, would be an infringement of his individual rights and would propably leave the Rent Tribunal, to whom the case would go, in the position where its decisions would be challenged in the courts.  Apart from the expense and serious inconvenience involved in shifting cases to the Rent Tribunal and back to the courts again on appeal &mdash; an expense which would not profit the interests of either landlord or tenant &mdash; the stress on the tenants concerned would obviously be considerable.</P>
    <P>And who would pay the costs, including those already incurred as a result of the application made to the courts?  The landlord could hardly be expected to pay on the double when he did not ask for the case to be transferred.  It would hardly be in the tenant's interest to ask him to pay the costs involved.  And what of the Rent Tribunal?  All parties in the House have expressed themselves to be in favour of the tribunal and it is hardly desirable at this early stage in its existence that it should become embroiled in controversy of this nature with the prospect that its involvement in particular cases could be found unconstitutional.  Not only would this be wasteful of tribunal time and taxpayers' money but it would be positively unhelpful to the tribunal which at this stage would naturally be anxious to secure general recognition of its independence and objectivity.  Neither can it be definitely asserted that the tenants would benefit from the roundabout the Bill might set up.  Is it not quite likely that they would be faced with bills for that rent from the date on which the landlord first gave notice of his intention to apply to the District Court?</P>
    <P>Frankly, I do not understand the motives of the Opposition in putting forward this Bill.  I think we explained the position fully when the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1983, was going through.  Deputies, on both sides of the House would have had it otherwise, but generally accepted the legal position as we explained it to them.  I thought, therefore, that there was substantial accord in <Col N="608" /> the matter between the Government and the Opposition.  I know there is genuine concern on both sides of the House for elderly persons, more often than not with limited means, when they are involved in tribunals or courts under legislation to have their rents settled and I believe the Government have done all they possibly could to meet the difficulties imposed upon these people under the 1983 Act.</P>
    <P>During the debates prior to its enactment we were urged to establish the Rent Tribunal in the shortest possible time. This was done.  The tribunal was established and in operation on 2 August, less than one month after the date of the introduction of the Bill, and less than three weeks from the date on which it was signed by the President.  The fact the tribunal was established within one month meant that all cases in which landlords had not given statutory notice to their tenants prior to the publication of the Bill that they intended to apply to the court would fall to be dealt with by the tribunal rather than by the court.  It is interesting to note that, as Deputy Molloy himself referred to the question of Folio Homes Limited and the fact that that is presently before the courts &mdash; in fact a case stated has gone to the High Court in relation to it &mdash; I do not think anybody in this House can condone the practice by speculators of buying up city properties, more so in the city of Dublin than any other part of the country.</P>

      <P>We ensured that the tribunal would be the adjudicating body for as many cases as was legally practicable and that there would be no unseemly last minute rush to the courts.  We covered all possible avenues at that time to make sure that when the Bill was brought into effect the maximum number of people possible could benefit from the legislation and we sought to alleviate the hardship <Col N="609" /> people had been experiencing and which came to the notice of all public representatives. Going before the courts and the formalities of court procedure was a traumatic affair for the many elderly people who had never been before the courts previously and there was genuine concern in this House that we would take all possible and reasonable steps as quickly as possible to remove the whole area of rent fixing from the courts, and this was done.</P>
      <P>The 1983 Act allowed parties to withdraw cases from the District Court and to transfer them to the tribunal without loss of entitlements where both parties agreed. Positive inducements were also provided to encourage the transfer of cases by setting up new procedures under the Rents Tribunal which would benefit both parties. The hearings would be held in a much more informal manner and anyone who has attended rent tribunal cases to date can see this working in practice with less emphasis on adversary procedures. People who have benefited from the Rents Tribunal have expressed total satisfaction with the manner in which the tribunal are conducting their business. There is no need under the Rents Tribunal procedures for teams of legal and technical experts to cross swords leaving the landlord and tenant to be buffetted by cross-examination and intimidated by oath-taking and ceremony.  The informality of the proceedings has proved to be satisfactory to landlords and tenants. Parties can have their cases determined solely by means of written submissions and do not have to appear in person before the tribunal.  Everything possible has been done by the Government to ensure that the tribunal will offer a good and fair service that both landlords and tenants will be prepared to use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the members of the Opposition will not take it badly if I remind them that this is not the sort of issue which should be considered on the basis of party advantage.  By now, nearly every Deputy has received representations from constituents concerning their fear of appearing before the courts.  For many of the persons concerned it is a matter of very great concern, perhaps the most serious <Col N="610" /> problem they have had to face over a long period.  At the centre of their concern is the uncertainty that they feel about being able to live without hindrance in their homes for the remainder of their lives.  It is surely the duty of Dáil Deputies on all sides to reassure these people and make them understand that they do have a legal entitlement to security of tenure and that in cases of hardship the Department of Social Welfare's rent allowance scheme will help them.</P>
    <P>At the outset Deputy Molloy seemed to question the position the Government are taking in relation to this Bill.  He seemed to read into the words &ldquo;in serious risk of being found repugnant to the Constitution,&rdquo; a weakening of the position as stated by my Minister of State during the debate last July.  I can assure the Deputy that it is not a question of a weakening of the position but a question of semantics more than anything else.  There has to come a time when the Government must act clearly on the legal advice before them and to make a decision based on that legal advice.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill which has been before this House in the last few weeks and to the fact that Deputies on all sides specifically expressed a desire for that Bill to be referred to the President and by him to the Supreme Court.  I could go one further than the Deputy in quoting the advice of three Attorneys General over the past two years on that Bill.  They were all in agreement that the point had not been clarified in law in relation to the voting rights for British citizens and because they were not in a position to state categorically that the matter would not be challenged before the courts it was desirable that the matter be clarified as soon as possible rather than attempting to correct the error in a post-election situation because the election could be challenged if the legislation was found to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned that this Bill would remove from the District Court the cases before it and that this Bill would not be unconstitutional in purporting to remove cases from the District Court which are now legally and lawfully before <Col N="611" /> the court.  The 1983 Act refers to the District Court and this is the only court of relevance in the first instance.  Cases can be appealed from the District Court to the Circuit and High Courts and the decisions of the Rents Tribunal can be appealed to the High Court on a point of law.  In my view, Deputy Molloy's points on that front do not stand up under examination.</P>
    <P>One of the unfortunate aspects of this Bill and the fact that we are debating this issue here this evening is the possibility that arising from this discussion we will add nothing but more uncertainty to the whole question of rent fixing before tribunals and before District Courts and that will be of no assistance whatever to the many tenants who are at present very uncertain about their position.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment, and with the help of my officials, I have tried to make the position as clear as possible over the past number of months.  We have done everything possible to be of assistance to tenants and tenants' organisations in terms of spelling out to them what their rights are under the legislation and in having their legal entitlements brought before the courts or before the Rents Tribunal.</P>
    <P>When we entered office we stated at the outset that we would bring forward the legislation and I can assure Deputy Molloy and his fellow Fianna Fáil Deputies that their concern in relation to the cases at present before the District Court is understandable, and that that concern is shared by all Deputies in the Government parties, but that is where the story ends.  Hard decisions have to be made on the best legal advice available to the Government and, in the absence of any contrary advice &mdash; and none was put forward here this evening &mdash; that advice stands.</P>

      <P>The Deputy would be well advised to read the Sinn Féin case in detail because my advice and my own reading of it is that the case would back up the constitutional right of the citizen as interpreted under our Constitution.  We cannot remove the right from citizens to bring cases before the District Court, a right which is exercised in the main by the landlords.  As our Constitution is interpreted by the Attorney General in his advice to the Government, we cannot remove from the District Court a case or cases which parties have brought before that court.</P>

      <P>I trust that from what I have said Deputies opposite will appreciate that the 1983 Act provides that both parties must consent to a case being removed from the District Court and placed before the tribunal.  Transfer without consent is not legally possible.  There is no choice.</P>

I am not a legal man but I think I have the capacity to balance what is placed before us and to apply whatever common sense I have to the statements made and thus endeavour to come at what might be a legal premise.  If the 1983 Act is already accepted as being constitutional and if tribunals have been established under that Act, why does the Minister fear now that the tribunals might be regarded as being unconstitutional?</P>

Why does the Minister see a danger of this being unconstitutional?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is like a prelude to a stab.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, when the 1982 Act was passing through this House I had the honour and benefit of sitting in the Chair occupied by your good self.  I heard expressed at that time the dangers that existed.  Reasons were advanced more forcefully and forcibly by the present Minister of State at the Department of the Environment than anyone else why tribunals were much more acceptable than the courts.  On Second Stage he said he was rejecting the Bill on the grounds that it did not provide for tribunals.  The following evening the present Tánaiste welcomed the legislation and tried to distance himself from Deputy Quinn.</P>
      <P>Under this legislation landlords, composite landlords, companies, have bought several houses in certain parts of Dublin city.  They put a tenant into a vacant house and charged him or her £70 or £80 and went to court the following day against the neighbour of that person. Based on the rent they were receiving from the new tenant, they were able to convince the court that they were entitled to increase the rent of the neighbour.</P>
      <P>The fact that I say that does not suggest that anybody in this House condones it. That is what is happening under the legislation. That is what is happening in our courts where the case is dealt with by legal men who all the while are growing fat on the fees they are getting&mdash; auctioneers and consultants many of whom, I fear, are part of the composite new landlordism abusing this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy's proposal is an effort to remove the opportunity for such abuse <Col N="616" /> and to bring these matters more correctly before tribunals which were promised by Deputy Burke when he was Minister. The legislation was urgent at the time and 25 April was a vital date in relation to the Supreme Court's decision.  At the time the Minister explained that, while he accepted the case being made for the tribunals, in the short-term he would have to confine himself to the courts.  He indicated to the House that, with a view to expediting the consideration of these cases, the Government proposed to appoint additional district justices.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste remarked on how easy it is for the Opposition to make a case when they are no longer in Government.  I propose to give the other side of the coin and show how easy it is for people in Government to forget what they said in Opposition. As reported at column 1132 of the Official Report of 31 March 1982 Deputy Quinn said:</P>
    <P>Deputy Peter Barry is correct in saying that this Bill is substantially the same as the previous one with the exception of sections 13 and 23.  When one looks in detail at section 13 one sees that the Fianna Fáil Government have effectively abdicated any responsibility in trying to establish what constitutes a reasonable or just rent and have dumped it all on the shoulders of the over-worked and unskilled justices who have no particular expertise in this field.</P>
    <P>That was not Deputy Tunney, or Deputy Molloy, or Deputy Wyse, or Deputy Fitzgerald, or Deputy Lyons speaking.  It was Deputy Quinn, confirming what the present Minister for Foreign Affairs had said earlier in the debate, and making the case that the tribunals which were not provided for in that legislation, which he envisaged and which he subsequently introduced, were the ideal mechanism by which these cases should be adjudicated.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to an aspect which has been overlooked.  We will leave the tribunals aside for the moment.  Take the case of the company to which I referred, Folio Properties, whoever they are.  As a <Col N="617" /> member of Dublin Corporation I said to the planning officer that he was never to put in front of me an anonymous application. I wanted the names of the people who were interested in the application.  I do not know anybody in Folio Properties, but I know they are indulging in a practice which is as abhorrent to me as the worst form of landlordism in this or any other country.  They are planting a tenant, often a friend of their own and charging him £60 or £70.  They then walk into the District Court and say they are getting £60 or £70 for the house next door and therefore they must get an increase in rent in respect of 127 Oxmantown Road or wherever it is.</P>
    <P>In the legislation is the understandable and welcome provision that the tenant who has been there for 15 years, an old age pensioner whose rent is now being increased to £50, will be subsidised by the State in respect of the increase.  When the 1982 Act was going through the House, Deputy Barry and Deputy Quinn were critical of the fact that there was only £6 million in the Estimate to provide such compensation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn said that in his constituency he had 4,000 of those people who would all need this subsidy and therefore £6 million was not enough.  That £6 million will not fall from the sky.  I am not talking about landlords who have been there from the beginning and who have all our sympathy and consideration.  I am referring to the new, mushrooming exploiter landlord.  What is happening? This House is asking the PAYE sector to suffer subsidised rents, ostensibly for an old age pensioner &mdash; which we are all prepared to do &mdash; but, in essence, a substantial contribution is merely being made to these rotten landlords.  I shall demonstrate the change when one moves from Opposition to Government.  We are accused of a certain irresponsibility because we are no longer in Government, but I shall quote the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, then spokesman for matters connected with the environment in respect of the subsidy which was necessary. He was maintaining that the £6 million was not enough:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> In the end, it does not matter whether the Department of Social Welfare, or the local authorities, or the Department of the Environment, or some other institution pays the subsidy.</P>
    <P>It did not matter, it would have to be paid.  I am sure that it was not his intention but he was, in fact, guaranteeing, in respect of these poorly based applications which are moving through the District Courts, the new landlord his increase, wherever it came from.  Every Deputy sitting here knows that there is only one place from which it can come and that is from the pocket of the taxpayer.  Are we happy that that should continue?  Is every Deputy content to tolerate those exploiters taking over and abusing this legislation and are we happy to guarantee that they will get their money, no matter where it comes from?</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy's Bill is an attempt at bringing reason to the existing provisions. It is not a question of trying to upstage the present Government.  I could quote <i>ad nauseum,</i> to the point of boring the House, comments from the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, demonstrating his lack of respect for our courts.  He went further than the District Court, he went up the line to the Supreme Court &mdash; the good gentlemen who made the original decision which led to the introduction of the initial legislation.  He said that they were all out of touch, should not be there at all and did not know the first thing about it.  I assume that if he attributes such lack of understanding to the gentlemen in the Supreme Court and High Court, he would not be all that enamoured of the decisions and operation of the District Court.</P>
    <P>I am more fortified than I was originally in respect of matters legal.  I detected a certain unease in the endeavours of the Minister for the Environment at convincing us that what was proposed in the Molloy Bill might be considered unconstitutional.  I do not think that there was any great conviction in what he said.  Heartened by that feeling. I shall place on record the legal position as I see it.  The tribunal was established <Col N="619" /> by the 1983 Act and must be presumed to be constitutional.  That is a fair statement to which nobody could object.  At present, the parties may, on consent, withdraw an application from the court.  Deputy Molloy in the Fianna Fáil Bill merely wants either party to have permission to withdraw a case and transfer it to the tribunal.  I do not see why the Minister for the Environment should anticipate any constitutional problems in that regard.  Deputy Molloy has already said that the jurisdiction of the District Court is not a constitutional jurisdiction. It may be added to or restricted by statute.  That is the entitlement of the Members of this House.  Already we know that specific matters may be excluded from the District Court's jurisdiction. We all know that actions for libel or slander can be so excluded.  My understanding is that the High Court only and the Supreme Court have a constitutional jurisdiction, unalterable by statute.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State is replying, and will have changed from that of last year his attitude in attacking the whole court system, he will get a certain relish from defending and protecting the interest of the courts which he so ably attacked last year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment referred to the Sinn Féin funds case.  This dealt exclusively with a constitutional jurisdiction.  It does not apply to a jurisdiction which was conferred by statute and may be removed by statute.  The Sinn Féin case to which the Minister referred also relates to matters in the purely judicial domain.  The fixing of rents is not such a domain.  If it were, the Government's 1983 Act would have been unconstitutional. Nobody has found the tribunal unconstitutional and I do not see why the Minister should now be expressing such concern.  Perhaps he was not aware of Deputy Molloy's real purpose in introducing this Bill.  As I have endeavoured to establish, it arises from the abuses which we know exist.</P>
    <P>The House may not be aware that some months ago members of this party, including myself, in pursuit of their interests and following on reports made to <Col N="620" /> them visited the courts.  We were absolutely appalled at what was happening.  I have not dwelt on the emotive business of dragging poor, elderly people before the courts.  Naturally, I have a concern for them which is shared by every Member of the House.  What I am concerned about is that they are being used as pawns in this exploitation of the taxpayer to the advantage of property owners, developers, legal men and all those who can put a respectable veneer on what would have been rejected by everybody and was rejected when the initial legislation was being introduced.  Indeed, as a final note &mdash; and I know that he will not mind my saying so &mdash; the Ceann Comhairle at the time when the legislation was passing through the House joined with others in expressing his fears that the legislation might be abused by those agencies, those groups, Folio Homes Limited, and the like, who had already begun in anticipation of the quick buck, the quick million, the quick £6 million which Deputy Peter Barry thought was not an adequate provision. They have already demonstrated that what happened was as was feared and the time has come when it should be terminated.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Proposed Closure of Tralee Factory.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I would like to give a few minutes of my time to my colleague, Deputy Foley.  I am raising this matter on the Adjournment because of the proposed closure of the Wabco-Westinghouse factory in Tralee.  This factory manufacture signalling equipment for CIE and there are 61 people employed in that factory which gives very much needed employment in Tralee.  Those workers got one month's protective notice two weeks ago and they are very worried about the possibility that they may lose their jobs.  The reason that this protective notice was given was that the factory have not got an order from CIE to make signalling equipment for next year.  Portion <Col N="621" /> of the CIE signalling equipment on the mainlines has been replaced every year and all this equipment had been supplied by the Wabco factory.</P>
      <P>The Wabco factory are put in great difficulty because CIE have not given an order to them for next year and this possibly will mean that the factory will close down some time in the New Year with the loss of 61 jobs.  I ask the Minister for Industry and Energy and the Minister for Transport to save this factory for Tralee and ensure that those 61 jobs are maintained. The Government will be giving a subvention of probably £96 million to CIE this year.  The Minister for Industry and Energy and the Minister for Transport could save this factory if they insisted that £1 million or possibly £1,500,000 of the subvention was allocated for signalling. If they did this the Wabco factory would be saved.</P>
      <P>Most of the CIE signalling equipment on the mainlines is obsolete and is not adequate.  My information is that this equipment from Dublin to Cork needs replacement.  It is not too long since we had a few rail crashes.  After the one at Buttevant there was a public inquiry.  The findings of this inquiry stated that the signalling equipment was not up to standard so it is very important that the signalling equipment on all the mainlines is replaced.  If CIE are to attract passengers back they must have a modern rail system equipped with the proper signalling equipment, so CIE will have to bring up their signalling equipment to international standards.  It is very important that we have a factory like Wabco to make the signalling equipment which will be required by CIE.  This is the only factory in Ireland which makes this type of equipment so it is up to the Minister for Industry and Energy and the Minister for Transport to rescue this factory.  If they do not do this the signalling equipment which CIE will need in the future will have to be imported.  This will mean 61 more people in Tralee on the dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Wabco factory have submitted to CIE proposals for air conditioning equipment which CIE instal in the new railway carriages they are manufacturing.  That equipment which is being imported at the <Col N="622" /> moment could be made by Wabco.  No extra machinery is required to make this type of equipment.  The Minister should investigate that and have the order given to Wabco.  This would ensure that the factory would not close.</P>
    <P>Tralee has suffered a great deal from factory closures in recent times, the most recent one being the Kingdom Tubes factory, which closed down with a loss of 295 jobs.  Very little was done by the Government to rescue this factory.  We also had the Burlington textile factory in Tralee who at one time employed 940 people and now employ fewer than 400. The number unemployed in Tralee and the surrounding areas is the highest in the country.  Tralee and North Kerry were declared a disaster area by the IDA some time ago.  In the past the industrialisation of Kerry was controlled from Cork but Kerry needed industry so much that the IDA decided to send one of their personnel permanently to Tralee.  The factory management and workers got in touch with the Minister for the Environment last June.  I saw a copy of the reply they received from him on 6 July acknowledging their representations but to date they have not received any further correspondence from the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to point out that Deputy Spring represents this constituency and there is a duty on him to work to ensure that the factory is kept open.  We were hopeful in North Kerry that Deputy Spring might succeed in having the Kingdom Tubes factory re-opened but that did not materialise and there was great disappointment throughout the constituency. I should like to appeal to the Ministers for Industry and Energy and Transport to ensure that CIE make a special allocation next year to be used for the purchase of equipment from that factory. I suggest that they allocate £1 million from the Government subvention for the purchase of such equipment.  The management of the Tralee factory told me that if they got £1 million from CIE the factory would be viable.  That factory also make signalling equipment for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a duty on those Ministers and <Col N="623" /> on the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, to ensure that CIE make money available to modernise the signalling equipment on the main rail lines.  If CIE are to make money they must modernise that system. It is no harm to point out that there is a need for new equipment on the Dublin-Cork line.  Action must be taken now to ensure that the 61 jobs in that factory are saved.  Signalling equipment should not be imported.  I understand that IDA executives travel around the world trying to encourage industrialists to establish factories here but in Tralee we have an industry which, if it was guaranteed £1 million from CIE annually, would be viable and maintain 61 jobs.  The factory is most important for Tralee, a town which has had massive unemployment in recent years.  I appeal to all concerned to take all steps necessary to ensure that the factory is kept open.  I hope the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, will lend a hand to the efforts being made to do this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the case made by Deputy McEllistrim on behalf of the workers at the Wabco-Westinghouse factory in Tralee.  It is important to note that 61 families in the town depend on the factory.  CIE are in a position to help keep the factory open. The Minister for Industry and Energy should use his influence with CIE to have a contract for signalling equipment placed with this concern.  If that is not done the equipment will have to be imported.  I understand that the Tralee factory has put in a very competitive tender for the supply of the equipment. Some slight adjustments will have to be made but in view of the fact that the jobs of so many workers are at stake the Minister should give priority to the Tralee concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tralee has been a black spot on the employment scene in recent years. During those years the town, and the north Kerry region, lost 2,680 jobs, a figure that has been accepted by the IDA. The IDA report for 1982 indicated that of the fixed asset investment of £143 million the Kerry region received £4 million while Cork got £139 million.  In the year <Col N="624" /> under review in that report Cork secured in the region of 3,000 jobs while Kerry got 1,400.  That represented a net gain for Cork of almost 2,000 jobs.  During that period Kerry suffered a net loss of 1,300. The situation in Tralee is being highlighted at present by the workers who have embarked on a sit-in protest at Kingdom Tubes.  The difficulty there has been going on for nine months and workers had hoped that a package would be put together to save that factory but there is little hope for them.  A public meeting has been called for next Monday night in Tralee to highlight the situation.</P>
    <P>On Friday last the workers in the local PMPA garage were given one week's notice.  Those workers are endeavouring to take over the concern as a workers co-op but their proposals have been refused by the administrator.  There is no doubt but that Tralee is in a very bad situation, possibly the worst in the country. The Minister has an opportunity to save this factory and he can do so by instructing CIE to put some of the massive Government subvention they get into that concern.  Such a move would mean that the jobs of the 61 workers would be saved.  I endorse the appeal by Deputy McEllistrim.  It will be too bad if the factory is allowed to close because CIE did not place a contract for the purchase of signalling equipment with them. Like the rest of Ireland North Kerry has a very young population.  Tralee can boast an exceptional regional college and AnCO training centre.  However, in the last four years we have lost eight factories. The onus is on the Minister to direct CIE to place the contract with the Tralee concern.  I should like to thank Deputy McEllistrim for giving me an opportunity to raise this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Deputies I am very concerned about the employment situation in the Tralee area and I fully share the regrets expressed by them concerning the exacerbation of the situation which the halting of manufacturing at the Wabco-Westinghouse factory would inevitably bring about. Wabco-Westinghouse (Ireland) Limited, <Col N="625" /> which manufactures railroad signalling equipment, is a subsidiary of a large US multinational company which, I understand is one of the major manufacturers world wide of this very specialised type of equipment.  Consequently, when the IDA agreed in 1980 to support the establishment of this manufacturing project in Tralee they were influenced largely by the promoting company's projections regarding the development of substantial exports by the Irish operation to both the European and Third World markets.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, however, the company's achievements in the development of the Irish operations overseas markets never reached anything approaching the level projected and it was this failure to meet export targets that has proved, in essence, to be the critical factor in the company's present difficulties.  Efforts have been made by the relevant State industrial promotional agencies, the Industrial Development Authority and Córas Tráchtála, in an endeavour to assist the company in developing their export market base.  Regrettably, these efforts have not proved as successful as had been hoped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been considerable reference in the course of the debate to the level of orders from CIE and CIE's responsibility to provide continuing orders to the company. I must point out that the affairs of CIE are matters outside my area of ministerial responsibility.  However, in so far as Wabco-Westinghouse is concerned, the position is that while this company, at the time of establishment, secured the contract to supply CIE's signalling needs in connection with the Howth-Bray electrification scheme, the intention was that this contract would simply provide the foundation or base on which the projected export business would be built. The signalling needs in relation to the Howth-Bray electrification scheme have now been met.  This means that future CIE orders must be confined to the company's needs in relation to mainline signalling. In this regard CIE have been modernising and upgrading their mainline signalling on a phased basis in the context of their annual capital programme and priorities.  The board of CIE <Col N="626" /> have included a number of signalling projects in their programme for 1984.  As the House is aware, the Government have been considering the 1984 Estimates for the public sector for a number of weeks now and the 1984 capital allocation for CIE will be settled in that context.  Consequently, until CIE's estimate has been determined and notified to their board, it will not be possible for them to decide on their investment in signalling for next year.  In this context I might point out to the House that the allocation of CIE's finances to any part of their capital programme must be related primarily to the overall requirements of that programme rather than the needs of any supplier or contractor.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the concern I share regarding the employment situation in County Kerry and in Tralee in particular. In this regard I might point out that the Industrial Development Authority &mdash; in recognition of the needs of the area &mdash; have concentrated their resources in County Kerry in developing a sound infrastructure for industry and the provision of advance factories and sites for industrial development.</P>
    <P>There is always considerable reference to projects such as Wabco-Westinghouse which are experiencing difficulties.  I might point out that the availability of the resources referred to have proved a great advantage in attracting substantial investment to the county.  To supplement the resources already available the IDA have commenced construction recently of five incubator units in Tralee for small industry projects.  A 28,000 sq. ft. factory is also under construction in the town. Both of those facilities will be available early next year.</P>
    <P>Also in response to the particular needs of county Kerry the IDA have opened an office in Tralee, a unique development representing as it does the first time that the IDA have opened a special office other than a regional one to service an area.  The Tralee office forms part of the IDA's south-west regional structure which has its headquarters based in Cork.  A primary function of this newly established Tralee office will be to liaise closely with the regional office in <Col N="627" /> Cork.  This will ensure, wherever possible, that overseas companies seeking to locate in the region will be brought to visit appropriate sites in County Kerry. This development will prove of very considerable long-term benefit to County Kerry.</P>
    <P>In the years 1980-82 over £6.5 million has been invested by the IDA in lands and factories in County Kerry.  Since 1980 some 200 projects involving a projected investment of over £24 million &mdash; of which the IDA are committed to subscribing <Col N="628" /> over £15 million &mdash; have been approved for the county.</P>
    <P>The activities I have outlined are a measure of the IDA's commitment to the development of County Kerry.  I should like to assure the House that every effort will continue to be made in the future to ensure that as many jobs as possible will be provided in County Kerry in general and in the Tralee area in particular.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 295 and 300 together.  My Department have asked all sanitary authorities to submit details of proposed domestic water charges to be levied by the authorities in 1983.  I enclose a table prepared on the basis of replies received to date, giving details on the lines requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am also enclosing a table setting out projections of 1983 revenue from water charges supplied by local authorities to my Department in connection with the local authority estimates 1983.</P>
      <P>The introduction and operation of domestic water charges waiver schemes is primarily a matter for each sanitary authority.  The criteria applied in assessing hardship in individual cases is also a matter for each authority.  I would, however, emphasise that I have asked authorities generally to examine applications for waivers of domestic charges on their merits and in a sympathetic and considerate matter.</P>
      <P>All sanitary authorities have been asked to submit details of domestic water charges waiver schemes to my Department. On the basis of replies received to date it would appear that a number of authorities are prepared to waive domestic water charges for persons dependent on old age pensions, for certain other social welfare recipients and for persons outside these categories to whom personal hardship would arise from the payment of domestic water charges.</P>
      <P>The procedures for collecting water charges may vary from one local authority to another.  The general practice appears to be for the issue by post of a demand.  Water charges, if unpaid after two months from the date on which they became payable, are recoverable by local authorities as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities are empowered by section 65 A (9) of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, as inserted in that Act by section 7 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962, to discontinue <Col N="437" /> a water supply where a charge remains unpaid after the expiration of two months after the charge has become payable.  As the power to discontinue water supplies in the case of non-payment of water charges is a discretionary one, it is a matter for each local authority to decide whether or not to discontinue a water supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 296, 297 and 303 together.</P>
      <P>Decisions as to the continued employment of non-officer grades by local authorities are entirely a matter for the local authorities concerned and one in which I have no function.  While local authorities are not obliged to inform me as to the numbers of employees laid off or put on short-time working, as far as I am aware the situation in this regard is as follows:</P>
      <P>Cavan County Council &mdash; 290 workers put on a three-day week from 3 October. 193 of these were brought back to fulltime working from 7 November.  The balance of 97 workers will remain on a three-day week until the end of December.</P>
      <P>Galway County Council &mdash; Between 9 September and 18 November, a total of 266 workers were on short time for between three and five weeks.  Since 18 November all staff have been on a full working week.</P>
      <P>Dublin County Councul &mdash; 77 workers were laid off at end September.  The county council states that these were workers taken on for a limited period only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of Dublin County Council carrying out development work by contract, the matter is one for the county council.  However, my understanding is that this work is done <Col N="440" /> partly by direct labour and partly by contract. Expansion of the direct labour operations would, I am informed, involve substantial investment in equipment and the employment of additional staff and raise a question of the economics of such a venture having regard to the volume and uneven flow of such work coming on stream.</P>
    <P>I would point out that this Government are keenly aware of local authorities' financial position and, since taking office, has taken major steps to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>An extra £31.5 million was provided through the rates support grants in addition to the amounts published in the public service estimates in November last. Also for the first time since 1978 local authorities were free to strike whatever rate they wished.  Thirdly, the enactment of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) No. 2 Act, 1983 greatly extended the powers of local authorities to supplement their resources giving them wider scope to charge for services.</P>

      <P>The period within which petition could be lodged to the Circuit Court requesting that the provisional order shall not become law without further inquiry expired on 8 November 1983.  No such petitions were lodged and Donegal County Council have applied to me for a confirmation order in the matter.  I will be making the confirmation order as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The county council will not proceed with the Brinaleck scheme until they have a supply from the Gweedore River.  Contract documents for a scheme to abstract the water (estimated to cost £100,000) are in my Department.  I will give consideration to approving this when all the remaining formalities in relation to the water abstraction order are complete and the council submit a certificate of completion of planning.</P>

      <P>There has been a sewerage pumping plant at South Park since the sixties.  Preliminary proposals for erecting additional pumping and maceration facilities at South Park were first drawn up in 1971.  These proposals have now progressed to the point where loans and tenders have been sanctioned for the additional facilities together with a longer outfall extending into the sea beyond Mutton Island.  Representations about the siting of the South Park pumping station have been received by my Department within the last month or so; previous representations sought to have the execution of the South Park project expedited.</P>
      <P>I understand that it would not be legally or technically feasible to relocate the South Park pumping station at this stage.  I am, however, assured that the additional pumping station superstructure will be attractive in appearance; that there should be no odour nuisance from the sewerage effluent; and, that the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards have advised that noise from the operation of plant at the pumping station will be within acceptable limits.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, it is not possible to give the information in the form sought by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In the initial years of the peat-fired power station programme construction was financed by advances from the State and from the ESB's internal resources. Since 1955-56 the board's capital programme has been financed by internal resources, stock issues, suppliers' credits and other State guaranteed borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years, expenditures have been undertaken by the ESB, from the total capital funds available to them from all sources, on power stations, transmissions and distribution facilities, working capital etc.  While it would be feasible to <Col N="451" /> ascertain the total capital expenditure incurred on particular projects, it would not be possible to say what portion of that expenditure was covered by individual borrowings.  These borrowings are not, I am informed, apportioned on a project-by-project basis.</P>
    <P>The total of State advances since 1946, when the peat programme started, was £54.8 million, at interest rates varying from 2½ per cent to 6¼ per cent per annum. State guaranteed borrowings and credits, raised since 1955-56, for the ESB general capital programmes have been at interest rates varying from 5 per cent to 13 per cent nominal; many of these borrowings have since been repaid or otherwise redeemed and the balance outstanding at 31 March 1983 is £946.4 million.  Over the period involved, the amount of capital expenditure financed from internal resources ranged from 20 per cent to 40 per cent of total.</P>

      <P>Since the closure of the Snia factory, the Industrial Development Authority have been making strenuous efforts to secure a take-over of, or a replacement industry for the factory. Details of the facilities available have been circulated to all IDA overseas offices and contact has been made with the major nylon yarn producers worldwide <Col N="454" /> as well as a number of nylon end-users and raw material suppliers.  However, no firm proposal for a take-over of the factory has so far emerged.  Details of the factory are also being brought to the attention of companies in other sectors who may require such facilities.  Every effort will continue to be made to secure a take-over or replacement project.</P>
      <P>A local task force with wide representation from industry, State agencies and community groups has been established to promote actively, especially among the former Snia employees, the facilities and incentives available through the small industries programme.</P>
      <P>The IDA have succeeded in attracting a number of significant new companies to Sligo this year, for example, Nielsen Moulding Design and Dyneer Corporation, which expect to employ up to 100 people between them over the next year. A total of 82,500 sq.ft. of advance factory space and small industry units totalling 8,000 sq. ft. in County Sligo, as well as over 150 acres of industrial land for development, are also being vigorously promoted by the IDA for new industrial projects.  In addition, 3,000 sq. ft. of small industry incubator units are being provided by the IDA at both Sligo and Tubbercurry.</P>

The faults in the subscriber's service have been due to a series of minor problems, virtually all of which affected the insulation on his line.  A major overhaul of the line was carried out in September and the linework to his house was renewed.  A separate fault affecting the subscriber's apparatus was reported on 4 November and cleared on 8 November.  Arrangements are being made to have the line and subscriber's apparatus specially checked again.</P>
      <P>As the subscriber is a consultant on call he is being afforded Priority A status for fault repairs which should ensure a speedy response to any future fault reports.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the reason a person (details supplied) in Dublin 14 has been excessively billed for telephone calls during the period October 1982 to October 1983; how his Department calculated that the number of local telephone calls made during this period for a domestic telephone came to a total of 6,623; and the credit his Department intend to grant to him in respect of the telephone accounts he had received for this number of calls having regard to the fact that he was recently advised that there was a fault on his telephone line, and to the fact that his telephone was out of order on a number of occasions during the course of this period.</P>

      <P>A sum equivalent to four weeks rental was allowed in the accounts earlier this year in respect of service difficulties during November-December 1982 and a further amount equivalent to one month's rental will be allowed in the next account in respect of service difficulties in the period March-April 1983.</P>

    <P>N.B.  The rates shown above are exclusive of bonus earnings.  Incentive bonus on an arterial drainage scheme is calculated on percentage basis related to the performance of individual employees, of the work gangs and of the scheme as a whole, as well as the type of work on which employees are engaged and to the effective bonus hours of each individual employee.  Bonus thus varies from employee to employee and from week to week and it would, therefore, not be feasible to quote weekly rates inclusive of bonus earnings.</P>
    <P>* By agreement with the Unions and with effect from 1 January 1983 the travel allowance which up to that date had been included in the basic pay and differential was extracted from these rates and is now shown as a separate allowance.</P>

    <P>At the time of writing negotiations were still taking place on the application of a special increase under clause 4.2 (e) of the 1983 Public Service Pay Agreement to the rates of pay of gangers and excavator drivers.  When these negotiations are complete and also when settlement has been reached on the revised rates of pay for work study assessors Grades II and I, for foremen grades III, II and I, and for craftsmen the then revised rates from 1 October 1983 will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</P>

I am not empowered by the Act to grant a licence in any circumstances which would be valid for less than 12 months and, therefore, I could not consider the waiving of existing licence fees in respect of the category of trader to whom the Deputy refers.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the 12th Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives.  This report deals with specifications for the identity and purity of certain antibiotics and their toxicological evaluation.  The report was compiled by the Joint Expert Committee in July 1968 and was published by the World Health Organisation in 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations contained in the <Col N="479" /> report were taken into account by the Food Advisory Committee in its 1971 report on antibiotics in food.  The report of the Food Advisory Committee formed the basis for measures undertaken during the 1970s by the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture to minimise the presence of residues in foodstuffs for human consumption. There is no evidence to suggest that antibiotic residues in Irish foodstuffs posed a particular problem at that time.</P>
    <P>The FAO/WHO report was prepared 15 years ago but I have asked the Food Advisory Committee to review the current position about antiboitics in food.  I expect to have this report in the near future.</P>

The issue of authorisations to proceed with fixed appliance treatments had to be suspended by the Department of Health in the absence of agreement with the private orthodontists on a scale of charges for the treatment. However, agreement on a scale of charges is expected to be reached very shortly.  A new post of consultant orthodontist for the Western Health Board was among five such posts which were advertised by the Local Appointments Commission on 26 October 1983.  The filling of this post should help to reduce considerably the present lengthy waiting time for orthodontic treatment in the Western Health Board area.</P>

      <P>The claim of the person concerned to unemployment benefit on 1 February 1983 was disallowed on the grounds that he did not satisfy the relevant contribution conditions.  He applied for unemployment assistance on <Col N="488" /> 12 July 1983 and was assessed with weekly means of £25.00 derived from the value of board and lodging on his parents' farm.  Due to an oversight delay arose in authorising unemployment assistance of £3.00 weekly being the appropriate maximum weekly rate in his case of £28.00 less the means of £25.00.  All arrears due were paid on 10 November 1983.</P>
      <P>Following the completion of inquiries to establish his entitlement to unemployment assistance from 1 February 1983 to 11 July 1983 payment of arrears due for that period will be made to him this week. He has appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and his case has been referred to an appeals officer for determination of his means.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the appeals officer's decision.</P>
      <P>In the meantime weekly payments of £3.00 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

The matter of non-compliance by his former employer has been referred to a social welfare officer for investigation.</P>
      <P>He was advised of his right to claim unemployment assistance but he declined to do so.  He ceased to sign as unemployed after 7 September 1983.</P>

    <P>According to the records of the Department she reached old age pension age in July 1976.  To qualify for the minimum rate of old age contributory pension she would require a yearly average of 20 contributions paid or credited over the 23-year period July 1953 to June 1976. Her total of 345 qualifying contributions in this period is equal to a yearly average of 15 and accordingly she is not entitled to this pension.</P>

      <i>Notes:</i> 1.  The relevant income tax year for pay-related benefit purposes is 1981-82.  The calculations are based on the basic pay of a road worker in Dublin County Council, excluding any overtime, arrears of pay or the effects of any absences from work during that year.  The amount involved is £5,102.</P>
    <P>2.  The amounts of pay-related benefit included are those payable to persons in the first phase of pay-related benefit on each of the dates mentioned.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit from 14 October 1983 in respect of an incapacity resulting from an occupational accident on 21 March 1983.</P>
      <P>Injury benefit is confined to a period of 26 weeks from the date of the accident. The period of claim was outside the maximum injury benefit period and accordingly injury benefit was not payable. Instead he was allowed disability benefit from 18 October, the fourth day of incapacity at the personal rate of £34.80 a week pending further investigation regarding his entitlement to dependants increases of benefit.</P>
      <P>He had previously been paid injury benefit in respect of an incapacity resulting from the same accident at work for the period from 21 March 1983 to 27 June 1983.  It has also been decided to allow payment of injury benefit in respect of medical evidence submitted for the period from 25 July 1983 to 15 August 1983 and a cheque for £151.69 was issued to him on 25 November 1983.</P>
      <P>Payment of disability amounting to £121.80 for the period from 14 October 1983 to 10 November 1983, date of the latest medical certificate received, has been withheld towards recovery of an overpayment of £290.42 incorrectly paid on his first injury benefit claim in respect of an adult dependant.  Further payments of benefit will be issued as medical evidence of continuing incapacity is received.</P>
      <P>In determining the amount of the payment account will have to be taken of his entitlement in respect of dependent children, about which inquiries are being made, and the overpayment still outstanding.</P>

      <P>The routes of special transport services are organised so as to cater for pupils who are eligible under the terms of the school transport scheme.  Fare-paying facilities may be allowed to non-eligible pupils provided there is spare accommodation on the bus and no extra cost to the State is involved.  The pupils in question here are ineligible under the terms of the school transport scheme, but availed themselves of school transport on an incidental and fare-paying basis.  From September 1983, the economical routing of the school bus service to cater for eligible pupils was such that the bus no longer passed through the area where the pupils in question reside and accordingly they withdrew their applications for fare-paying transport.  The children may still avail themselves of the service, but from a pick-up point on the new route which is much closer to Rathlee national school.</P>
      <P>It is not open to my Department to incur expenditure in maintaining the previous route in order to cater for children who are ineligible under the terms of the school transport scheme.</P>
