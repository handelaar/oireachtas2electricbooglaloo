Proceedings on the Bills being restored to the Order Paper today will commence, if reached, on the conclusion of the proceedings on item No. 15.  Private Members' Business will be item No. 16.  By agreement, proceedings on item No. 16 will be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. today if not previously concluded.

      <P>On yesterday's Order Paper, all stages of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill were to be taken.  Today it says &ldquo;Bills restored to the Order Paper will be taken&rdquo;.  For the purpose of putting forward amendments it is important that we would have some idea of what precisely will be happening in regard to the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill if it is restored to the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>If the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is restored to the Order Paper it will then take its place on the Order Paper and will <Col N="676" /> proceed in the ordinary way.  It has been provided in the Order of Business which has just been read out that it will be taken first after item No. 15.  When item No. 15 has been concluded, the Second Stage of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill will be taken.</P>

We do not know from the Order Paper how many stages will be taken today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of the price of building land and the degree to which the value of building land, artificially inflated by factors with which we are familiar, rebounded on house prices has been <Col N="683" /> known to everyone in the country who takes an interest in such things for 13 or 14 years if not longer.  At the beginning of the seventies a committee was set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kenny who was certainly among the two or three judges best qualified to judge the legal and constitutional aspects of any legislative attempt to control the price of building land; and the other members were at least as well qualified from technical points of view as any officials or, for that matter, politicians whom I can think of.  That committee reported in early 1973, and their report was one of the very first documents which lay before the Government of which Deputy Cosgrave was Taoiseach.  It was available to that Government during the four and a half years of their existence.  It was available to the Government led partly by Deputy Lynch and partly by Deputy Haughey, for four years between 1977 and 1981.  It was available to the Government presided over by Deputy FitzGerald in 1981-82.  It was again available to the Government presided over by the Leader of the Opposition last year; and has now again been available to the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know, in the interests of the public and the Dáil, whose procedures we are going to discuss under the next item, where is the justification for setting up a joint committee to discuss yet again something which was thrashed out over 10 years ago by a committee as well qualified as can be, whose deliberations I do not believe can be improved on?  If it is an attempt, by means of recruiting into the committee both sides of the House, to neutralise in advance any possible discussion or opposition there may be to whatever extent, that casts a reflection yet again on the way this House does its business.  If there is no difference in ideology or in purpose or principle between the two main parties of this House in their approach to a matter of this kind, they should not be on opposite sides; and the people's business should be done in a more orderly way than this, whereby a serious problem &mdash; which nobody denies &mdash; is long-fingered <Col N="684" /> for 13 or 14 years and is now to be remitted to yet another committee &mdash; but this time the committee will not contain the people or the expertise which Mr. Justice Kenny's committee contained.</P>

      <P>When this committee was set up originally we opposed the move by the Labour Party who had brought in a Bill seeking to have the price of land controlled.  They accepted a compromise from the then Fianna Fáil Government to have this committee look at the matter.  As the Labour Party are now in Government it would seem more appropriate that they reintroduce their Bill as a Government Bill in order to have this matter dealt with expeditiously.  I do not often find myself in full agreement with Deputy Kelly, but I do so today.  For that reason I oppose the restoration of this committee.</P>

A time limit has been set on the deliberations of the committee.  With due respect to Deputy Kelly and Deputy De Rossa who are forming a strange alliance this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I had very nearly concluded when the Dáil rose on Thursday last and I have not much more to say.  The last suggestion I was making at five o'clock related to Question Time and I had suggested in the hearing of the Minister for Industry and Energy that we might experiment informally&mdash;not necessarily adopt permanently&mdash;to see how much success we could achieve with a second row parallel question time in which Deputies would be in a more informed framework than that which the Dáil permits and enabled to question relatively senior officials in Departments about the kind of constituency problems which now clutter up the Order Paper and attract the attention of the entire Dáil quite needlessly. The Minister in front of me turned around and asked in a friendly way why I had suggested that there should be no chairman on such a parallel question time.  I did suggest that, but that is a very unimportant and marginal dimension of the suggestion I was making.  I have no objection to a chairman.  I meant simply that probably it would be more satisfactory for the Deputies concerned if they could exchange question and answer with the official, who would have in front of him the relevant file, in a more informal and less strictly regulated way than is customary on the floor of the Dáil.  It does not really matter if there is a chairman provided that object is achievable. I believe there might be something to be said for trying a parallel Question Time to see if questions could be taken off the floor of the Dáil and whether perhaps a Deputy might really in the end get more information from the Department concerned. I, of course, accept that a question with a political dimension, a question of genuine general public interest, would <Col N="686" /> not be appropriate for handling in this way.  I do not suggest that Deputies should in any way be deprived of the right to ask the Minister in the Dáil any question they please, and that it should be entirely within their discretion to decide what is a question of general interest and what is one which could be more easily and perhaps satisfactorily dealt with by this parallel official Question Time.</P>

      <P>Would you have the same notice for those questions that you have for ordinary questions in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I often think that the present notice of four days is not long enough. I can well imagine that there must be questions which absolutely convulse a Department by the need to have them answered in a form which can be presented in the House within 96 hours.  It may easily be that four days is not enough for some types of question.  I envisage that in a parallel Question Time the Department could communicate informally with the Deputy and say: &ldquo;Look, we are heavily under pressure on Tuesday, could we take this on Wednesday or Thursday instead?&rdquo; Alternatively they could say: &ldquo;We expect new statistics on the first of next month.  If you do not mind waiting until the first sitting day after that date we will give you the answer then&rdquo;.  I envisage an experiment which might be helpful on both sides, might ease the four-day pressure on the administration and might provide more information for the Deputy.  It might even shorten the route between the backbench Deputy and the Department by having the backbench Deputy speak face to face directly to the relevant official, and perhaps persuade him face to face that it is time to build this kiosk, to give the go-ahead to that group water scheme, to sanction that school extension or whatever it might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always been an advocate of experiment and I can see nothing wrong with experimenting with this.  It might turn out to be a shambles and not be satisfactory for a number of reasons which I do not now foresee.  What about <Col N="687" /> it?  We would have tried it.  We can always drop it again.  We do not need any change in Standing Orders.  It only needs an informal Government agreement to the proposal that on a very informal basis such a service might be provided for Deputies in some room in Leinster House or in some other convenient place nearby in Setanta House if one wished, that it would be done for an experimental month starting after Easter or some time like that.  If it is not a success, if it is a shambles, if it is expensive, if it turns out not to be worth the trouble and the money which it might involve then by all means drop it.  In all kinds of areas we are afraid to experiment in case we might look foolish if we were forced to admit that the experiment was not a success.</P>
    <P>I would like to add something to that in relation to the question of the publicity and the question of the supposed anonymity of public servants.  The anonymity of public servants is beginning to flicker at the edges a bit.  They are now frequently journalised, they are written about in the papers and gossip columns and in informal publicistic ways of all kinds.  Their performance is assessed, and epithets, usually flattering, and so usually well deserved, are applied to them by the media.  I do not know that there is any great point in keeping up this British pretence, that anonymity is a necessary part of the public service.  I can imagine, in regard to the publicity side of this, that if a parallel Question Time were open to the press &mdash; I do not know if the press would trouble to send anybody to cover it &mdash; I can imagine that public servants might perhaps gain from the experience of presenting aspects of their administration in that modest public framework.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that proposal would involve a change in the adoption of ministerial responsibility if officials were to defend policy in their own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there is that danger, but I believe that it could be informally understood that public servants would be entitled to say: &ldquo;Look, I have gone as far as I can go in regard to <Col N="688" /> my instruction, you are pushing me to the frontier of what is political, and if you wish to pursue this matter any further you had better put down a formal Dáil question&rdquo;.  I can see that there is that frontier and that there would be the danger of crossing it.  I am not advocating crossing it but I believe the right should be preserved for a Deputy, who had not got a satisfactory reply and felt there was some political meat in a question, to appeal his question on to the floor of the House in the ordinary way, even though it had an airing with the official previously. I do not mean to be flippant about this but I can even see that some officials might, apart from gaining in their own understanding of the way their work impacted on the outside world, gain a certain modest celebrity in the way, for example, that an English public servant did during the Falklands war by reason of the extraordinary potato-faced image which he projected when giving news of the war, whether it was good or bad.  That particular kind of personality would naturally not be much use to us in the framework I am suggesting we might experiment with; but I could see that public servants might enjoy an occasional outing to a session of this kind.</P>
      <P>Another thing I want to mention has a bearing on the parliamentary programme. There is such a thing as a parliamentary programme which is never published.  It is marked highly confidential and circulates to the Government at frequent intervals.  I forget what the intervals are although it was my job to circulate it.  I forget if it was once a year or twice a year but it contained a very large list of upcoming legislation with the projected launch date given by the Department. A large number of Bills would be mentioned by their actual titles, or by their possible future titles, with the Department's estimates of roughly when one might expect to see the Bills in print.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see that that kind of programme in its very early stages needs to be confidential, but I cannot see any good reason for not publishing it at some stage so that the Opposition and the world can see very roughly what is in the legislative pipeline.  I believe this would make <Col N="689" /> unnecessary a great deal of the sometimes ill-tempered exchanges which go on here on the Order of Business when Deputies ask: &ldquo;when is it the Government's intention to proceed with this Bill or that Bill?  When will we see some Bill which the Minister promised at a bun fight in Ballina last July 12 months?&rdquo; That kind of question which Deputy G. Brady rather ungraciously said to you a short while ago you were so good at raising yourself in earlier times is perfectly justified.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why the Government should not be asked those questions, but I can see a good reason for making them redundant by publishing a rough list at the beginning of a Dáil session, in October or after Easter, of what the Government expect to see on the floor of the House within the relatively near future. If there is some snag about some Bill, and it does not appear afterwards, let it be so.  None of us is perfect.  I believe that a lot of the trouble in politics derives from parties and individuals pretending they are perfect, that they are to be thanked when the sun comes up in the morning, and the other side are to blame when it goes down in the evening.  There is no reason why a Government should be ashamed of producing a programme of probable legislation so that the Dáil can see what is coming up to it.  There is no reason for the Government being ashamed, if six months later they have to say that the business was very congested and that there arose many problems that had not been foreseen, which resulted in the Government not being able to make headway.  Even within Departments there are dreadful snags in regard to Bills.</P>
    <P>During my time as Whip my heart was broken in trying to synchronise the progress of legislation in a steady flow.  That sort of situation would be eased very much by the publication of a programme which would show Departments what was being expected of them.  The type of situation that used to arise when I was Whip, and I suppose it still arises, is that one would be begging Ministers or Departments to go ahead with some Bill at times when there were large gaps in the business, and when one would be <Col N="690" /> here day after day listening to long boring Estimates debates; but the Minister concerned could not be persuaded to twist the arm of the Department or even if he were to do that the Department would not respond.  Frequently difficulties arose about drafting and so on, so that it was impossible to keep up a predictable flow of legislation coming to the Dáil.  Items that had been promised failed to arrive at the last moment.  That should not happen though I appreciate that many difficulties can arise in relation to a Bill, but the failure to have it ready on time should not happen with the kind of frequency with which it happened in my experience.</P>
    <P>I found, too, that when we got to the end of the Summer session, when everybody was anxious to go on holidays, these same Departments that had been fruitful sources of difficulty and delay up to then in the processing of Bills would come galloping to us and say that such and such a Bill would have to be put through before the recess.  That was the sort of situation which resulted in the imposition of time allocation motions by Mr. Cosgrave's Government, though largely the blame for those motions must rest with the people on the other side of the House because of the obstruction on their part. These time allocation motions of 1974, 1975 and 1976 were imposed reluctantly by the then Government because of these difficulties, and because, in respect of a number of items that had to be brought forward, the Government had not even been aware of them 48 hours previously.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the publication of a parliamentary programme, even in a tentative non-obligatory form, would be salutary and would be helpful to the Opposition, to the public and to the media.  In addition, it would be a powerful psychological impulse to Departments not to be seen to have been responsible for any delay, or for a public embarrassment of the Government in not having Bills ready at roughly the time at which the Government told the Dáil they would be ready.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of some of the Dáil conventions which are written into your book of precedents.  Some of these conventions are silly.  The absurdity of them becomes compounded and multiplied <Col N="691" /> as the years go on and as they develop a momentum of their own.  The original purpose of them is lost sight of. Indeed, they have disappeared in the country that originated them.  These are conventions that we ought to drop.</P>
    <P>One of these, for example, is the convention that prohibits us in this House from citing from a Seanad debate.  The fact that we must pretend to ignore that there is a Second House of the Oireachtas is a case of this Parliament keeping up, for some reason which it does not understand, a precedent the origin of which lies buried in the troubled history of seventeenth-century England.  Where is the logic in affecting to suppose there is no such body as the Seanad?  It would not matter if the convention were on some kind of joke level, but it is serious when it gets to the point where one is not allowed to cite speeches made in the Seanad.  At the same time a Deputy, a Senator or anyone else who makes a speech at a dinner or elsewhere outside can be cited here subject to the rules of relevancy.  Repeatedly here I have tried to bring into the debate something which Senator Eoin Ryan said at the time when Fianna Fáil were getting into a lather of sweat about our fishing limits, when they were willing to go to the barricades for the 50-mile limit.  They not only dropped that but also sabotaged the former Deputy Donegan's so-called box as soon as they were returned to office in 1977. However, at the time when they were frothing at the mouth about the 50-mile limit Senator Ryan, who was a big wheel in Fianna Fáil then as I suppose he still is, said in my hearing that if we did not get a 50-mile limit we should rethink the whole question of our membership of the EEC.  Those words came from a senior Senator, from one that both the business world and the political world look up to. He has been in politics since I was in short trousers.  There is a photograph showing him as a student in 1938 going across in a motor launch to Spike Island in the company of the then young Kevin Boland and Mr. de Valera.  In other words Senator Ryan has been around for a long time.  When a Senior politician <Col N="692" /> such as he makes a statement of the kind to which I have referred I would regard it as legitimate political ammunition.  It is a lunacy that one in this House should be estopped from firing that ammunition merely because it surfaced in the Seanad and not at some comhairle ceanntair meeting or at some dinner.  That is the sort of convention that makes us look ridiculous.  I trust that it will not be considered a matter too small to attract a few minutes of the time of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>Though not to the same extent, the same goes for the convention for not mentioning here people outside the House, whether to praise them or to criticise them.  I appreciate that different considerations apply in this case, and I accept that somebody who is not in the House and who has no champions here is not in a position to defend himself. However, the ordinary rules of human decency, fairness and politeness and the wish to behave like gentlemen, or ladies as the case may be, ought to restrain Members from unfairly blackening someone who is not in a position to defend himself, and blackening him under the protection of the privilege of this House, since in respect of words uttered here no proceedings, either criminal or civil, can be brought.  I accept that the Chair has a role in trying to recall Deputies to these ordinary rules of decent behaviour; but there is a long way between that proposition and the proposition that one cannot mention or discuss at all people who are not in the House.  Surely there are people outside whose conduct is highly relevant to public affairs, and which must be brought to the notice of the House, which cries out to be brought to the notice of the House.  In saying that, I have no special target in mind.  It could be that there is some figure in the CII, that there is some trade union leader or some representative of the farmers who by his activity is affecting public affairs.  The convention that we are not allowed to comment one way or the other on any such person is wrong.  Admittedly, it is not a rule that is enforced with great strictness, but it exists.  We should be allowed to comment on people who are <Col N="693" /> outside the House subject to observing ordinary rules of fairness and not abusing the privilege this House bestows on us.</P>
    <P>The last of the conventions that I wish to protest about, and have protested about before, is the so-called <i>sub judice</i> convention.  Put in a few words, that rule is to protect a court from having other people breathe down the back of its neck and tell it what to do.  In other words, in a country like ours, which has an independent Judiciary, everybody is expected to respect that independence; and a dimension of that respect is that people must refrain from telling a court and, <i>a fortiori</i>, telling it in loud, threatening or abusive language what it should do in deciding a particular case.  That is the only purpose of the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  For example, it would cover the case of a Deputy telling a court what to do in regard to a case that was at hearing.  It would cover the case of a Minister who took it on himself to express an opinion about litigation that was in progress.  I would support the application of the <i>sub judice</i> rule to prevent utterances of that kind.  But the rule has been brought to ludicrous lengths here.  I have heard occupants of your Chair, under the colour of it being an application of the <i>sub judice</i> rule, prevent comments even on judgments which had already been handed down and which were now in the past.  There is no such thing as a <i>sub judice</i> rule which inhibits you from commenting on a past judgment on a case which is not under appeal and which is over, and provided you do not speak abusively about a court or a judge or in such a way as to lower the standing and respect to the esteem of the court in public appreciation, you are entitled to speak your mind, either inside or outside this House, about the correctness or otherwise of a judgment.  I am perfectly entitled to say outside this House, never mind inside it, that I think Mr. Justice X was wrong and I am not committing a criminal offence nor am I in breach of anybody's civil rights in doing so.</P>
    <P>I have heard Deputies being prevented from speaking about a matter, even though it was a very general matter, such as an outbreak of hooliganism or delinquency, <Col N="694" /> on the basis that it might be <i>sub judice</i>, simply because it was likely that sooner or later the Garda would arrest somebody, charge him and that a trial might take place.  There is no reality in that.  For example, look at the experience in Limerick over Christmas where there was apparently a fairly widespread outbreak of lawlessness and violence in certain parts of the city.  Although it has not been tried out yet, I think the people in this House are perfectly entitled, perhaps even bound, to pay attention to what is going on there and to comment on it freely, not inhibited by any <i>sub judice</i> rule.</P>
    <P>I admit I would find it difficult to formulate, in a form which would be satisfactory to the occupants of the Chair, the <i>sub judice</i> rule as I would apply it.  I do not want to do that on my feet, because I may be overooking some germane factors, but I hope the <i>sub judice</i> convention could be severely looked at with a view to reconciling with reason the way it is applied.</P>
    <P>That is all I wanted to say.  I regret that the rules of order prevent me from repeating some of the points I made last Thursday, but I will save those comments for a future occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important subject to discuss but I am not sure if this is the right time or the right way to do it. The Minister has circulated a thought-provoking paper.  We sought a debate on the economy; there are major elements of law and order to be debated and the unemployment situation is very serious with over 700 jobs lost last week.  The Government have adjusted their unemployment target from an average of 177,000 to 190,000 with a peak of 218,000 this year.  It seems a little ridiculous in the context of certain serious economic catastrophes throughout the country that we will spend a number of days debating Dáil reform with a large number of Government speakers contributing to keep the debate going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not interrupt the Minister earlier.  Until there is Dáil reform I accept that this type of situation will continue but an outside observer might say that this debate would be very suitable for a special committee, after preliminary consideration in this House.</P>
      <P>We should be considering the Estimates at this time.  The purpose of publishing them last November was in line with the thinking of the Minister for Industry and Energy to have them debated before the budget was introduced. In this way the Minister for Finance would have the views of Members before the budget.  I am not suggesting that the Department should be hogtied by the views expressed in this House but I am suggesting that the reason for the Estimates being published early was to allow the House an opportunity to discuss them in advance of the budget.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate we did not discuss the Estimates, especially the major Estimates about which there has been so much contention in recent times, when the opportunity was presented to us.  A debate on those Estimates would have given the Minister for Finance some indication of the areas where he might consider giving extra support or withdrawing some resources in the budget and it would give him an indication of the feelings of the people as expressed by their public representatives.  The Minister for Industry and Energy said that very often Estimates are debated when most of the money has been already spent.  I agree with him, and that was the point in publishing the Estimates early and making them available for debate at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Industry and Energy on his campaign for Dáil reform.  He made a very interesting speech, including from his experience some practical caveats in relation to the kind of changes which might be made and to areas where they might infringe on Deputies' very fundamental rights of free speech.  This fundamental principle is very important in any consideration of the details of reform of this House.  We <Col N="696" /> must be careful not to take away the right of Members to full and open discussion on the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>This is our only National Assembly where Deputies from all parts of the country can come together, each with an equal right to put forward his views in an unfettered way.  He can express in his own way his views on all matters of state. This is not a House for the academic or for selected speeches, although that is the way the media tend to look at it, but the ultimate forum for the right of free speech.  Any changes in Dáil reform must not infringe that right because if they do all our institutions will be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>In that respect I would like to refer to some of the complaints and allegations made recently against Members on all sides of this House, and particularly against two former Ministers for Justice, at the end of the session before the last general election.  It should have been the duty of the House, which has processes and procedures for dealing with such allegations, to deal with these in an organised way which would give good example to our public adminstration as a whole.  The Taoiseach should have made a statement here about these matters. Instead, a selective, one-sided statement was made by the Minister for Justice on television.  This was a particularly reprehensible approach to the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Deputy a question which has no reference to the particular case to which he is referring? In general, would the Deputy think that in cases of this kind the House has adequate sanctions to take against Members in the event of their being found in default?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister is not referring to this particular case.  We should examine the available sanctions and the measures and methods which might be taken.  This area is open to further exploration.  I am not familiar with the details of the available sanctions within the Orders of the House, but this <Col N="697" /> is something which could bear examination.</P>

      <P>That is available, in any event.  It comes down to how far one wishes to go in imposing sanctions.  If this House, a public forum, decides on a motion of censure, or otherwise, this has a very dramatic and serious impact.  I speak now in the interests of our democracy and in the interests of this House.  I was, therefore, particularly concerned that such a question should arise without the right of reply in proper circumstances of the Members concerned.  This was a trial, a judgment and an execution by television, with free speech being denied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember the Chair mentioning to a member of The Workers' Party &mdash; and I am quite certain that it is on the record of the House &mdash; that this matter could be raised within the context of Dáil reform.  However, I accept the point made by the Chair.  This is quite pertinent to the way in which Deputies carry out Dáil business and is fundamental to their position as Deputies.  My view, as an elected representative, is important in this respect.  If there is a lack of natural justice in the way in which Members of this House are treated, this is properly a matter for debate on how this House conducts itself and the way in which we might reform our approaches to these affairs.  The Chair will recognise the direct relationship between the two.  The Minister said that television and radio might be brought into the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be difficult to participate in and consider reform if the basic functions of the House and of our institutions are to be set aside.  It is very important that we address ourselves now to the now past danger in relation to affairs outside the House.  The heat of that moment had its implications for the major Opposition <Col N="698" /> party but that is a separate question.  I am concerned about the implications for the future behaviour of the House in relation to its Members generally.  If we do not use the mechanisms of the House, we are in danger of allowing people from outside, through public relations operations and sophisticated marketing approaches to the presentation of material, to present, in a very biased and unfair manner, the behaviour of Members within the House or within their Departments.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of record in this House that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, initiated arrangements for a judicial inquiry to be undertaken in this matter and the present Taoiseach has promised to proceed with this inquiry. This would be the proper line to take in relation to such matters.  The available procedures were, by and large, agreed. They should have been pursued without entering into the show to which we were treated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Minister Bruton that we should have reform of our procedures, but only when the Government show due respect to the Members and the institutions of the House.  I stress particularly that this House can show justice to both the articulate and inarticulate Members.  I hope that the matters which I have discussed will be taken up by the inquiry.  In the long term, the processes of the House will be seen, in cooler moments, to have been those which should have been used in this case.  I look forward to calmer deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the sittings are concerned, I <Col N="699" /> have sat here for many and long hours during debates on different aspects on the business of the House.  Being a Dublin Deputy, it is no great hardship for me to attend the House at any time. Members have been prepared, in the past, to sit for longer hours when necessary and into the small hours of the morning on particular occasions in the interest of legislation or of the passage of some part of the budget and so forth.  We have seen the tragic results of the pressure being exerted on our country colleagues. Tragically, one of my colleagues, Deputy Coughlan, died yesterday.  We extended our sympathy in this House to his family and friends and we shall have an opportunity of doing so again at the Mass which will be offered for him tomorrow morning.</P>
    <P>We should be honest with ourselves when speaking and not speak solely from the capital city.  We should remember that there is great pressure on rural Deputies getting here.  There has been an arrangement in operation which meant they could get home and be with their families for the weekend while at the same time attending to their constituency work.  However, adhering to that programme constitutes an extremely busy weekend for them.  I would appeal to the Minister in his consideration of the reform of procedures of the House, especially in relation to sittings, that he give special consideration to the position of rural Deputies in this respect.  I believe there was much good sense in the arrangements made by our predecessors here.  Such arrangements facilitated rural Deputies in maintaining contact with their homes and constituencies.</P>
    <P>In regard to the drafting of Bills generally, I would recommend a thorough examination of the phraseology used. This is a matter raised quite often in the House.  We should now make an attempt to overcome the legal restrictions on us in so far as that can be done in regard to the modernisation of their phraseology. This is a matter which can be very confusing to us as laymen because we may want to include particular statements or kinds of feelings in Bills.  However, we <Col N="700" /> find that this is not so simple in practice with the constraints of law on us.  Indeed, such has led to confusion here at times in regard to the expressions included in Bills.  I experienced some difficulty in the House in regard to one Bill when people were inclined to think I was changing its emphasis when in fact I was merely responding to the requirements of the draftsmen.</P>
    <P>Committees of the House can undertake excellent work.  As Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare I dealt with the committee on the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill.  With the support of civil servants we on that committee did a great service to all public representatives and people concerned in regard to the application of social welfare legislation in the future.  But we discovered then that there was not anybody really interested in the work of that committee. One discovers when one passes such a Bill to a committee that there is not anybody interested.  I did not mind because at the time I was interested in the consolidation of this legislation.  It brought all social welfare legislation to date under the umbrella of the one Bill which we considered a useful exercise which would be helpful to people in the future.  Indeed, it should be done in respect of other legislation from time to time.</P>
    <P>I was conscious that the various Deputies and Senators involved in the work of that Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill committee would be engaging in a lot of work over a long period receiving no publicity whatsoever because it was rather dull stuff.  Yet the work was very relevant to presentday needs.  Indeed, it constitutes the basis on which many questions are asked in this House under the various subsections of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act.  If one examines various parts of that Act one finds that it deals with the allocation of funds of people in different circumstances and the terms governing that allocation.  At that time I made strenuous efforts to get the media along even for some photographs at the outset to show that these Members were engaging in this work.  A few photographs were taken, one only of which <Col N="701" /> appeared afterwards, that being of the chairman of the committee and myself. In all honesty I was least interested in getting my own photograph into the press.  I felt the Members of the committee were devoting a lot of their time to hard work and I should have liked to see them get some credit in the media. Despite my best efforts we did not manage to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet it was full of practical day-to-day matters often referred to in the House.  After all, parliamentary questions usually ask: &ldquo;Why does it happen this or that way?&rdquo; That constituted the broad content of that Consolidation Bill. Those elements were discussed and questions asked on them as our work proceeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asks what can one do about it?  I think other committees could be more specific and consequently more interesting.  Indeed, one could increase general efficiency by taking the Committee Stage of some Bills from the House to a special committee.  That may well be one area in which we should consider the introduction of radio coverage.  For example, if there is to be a special committee on, say, building land or some such subject, I am sure that is a matter in which there would be considerable public interest.  Perhaps if radio or even television coverage could be brought to bear on such an area that might warrant some trial in that direction.  I agree with what the Minister has said, that we should be prepared to try some things, to agree here that it is merely a trial, that not all trials prove to be successful.  We might well ask the media for once to cease acting childishly about trials, just as do Members in the House, but rather agree that trials are undertaken to establish <Col N="702" /> whether something will work.  One may not get the answer one wants but one may discover something through a trial. One may well find a new direction emanating therefrom.  It is much more important to get one's direction correct in such circumstances than that the trial be 100 per cent correct.  The impact of the media could be considerable in the area of special committees.  Indeed, such may well be necessary to increase interest in these committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is scope for committees.  But in regard to particular decisions to be taken in the House it is extremely important that Members have freedom to speak in the House in their own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that our research facilities are limited.  As people on both sides of the House are aware, there is the question of having back-up information readily available.  I know there are limited facilities available through the Library.  However, this is one of the great weaknesses of our present system which, in itself, takes from the quality of debate to be expected in the <Col N="703" /> House bearing in mind the circumstances in which we work.  Any improvement along those lines would constitute worthwhile reform and be welcomed by all Members.  In this respect there are some conventions here which would warrant improvement.  Even in regard to the forthcoming budget one finds that people are having to put down parliamentary questions about all sorts of straightforward calculations which are probably freely available to members of the press when they telephone Departments, to ask questions like how much revenue would a penny on the pint bring in or if one were to increase the level of VAT by 1 per cent or 2 per cent what sort of revenue would that yield?  There is a good deal of this factual information readily available.  Yet we must go through this process of asking parliamentary questions seeking such information.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance could make a fact sheet available in advance of the budget so that we could see the options and discuss the choices there may be. Such information is readily available on a whole series of items which are not confidential.  There is some information which would be confidential and this should not be made available.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance might consider this in relation to the forthcoming budget.  If such factual information was made available it would save a great deal of time in the House.</P>
    <P>When I was Whip I used to try to have a certain number of Members in the House at any one time.  There is an onus on the Government to maintain a quorum but we should look at the question of keeping a certain number of people in the House.  I could have 20 people in the House at a moment's notice.  All I would have to do is point out that there is not a quorum and people would attend.  We should look at that and come to some arrangement whereby people would be here on a more continuous basis even if it means dividing it up between the parties involved.  I know that Deputies have work to do in the offices around the House but it is an aspect which we should look at.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> We should also look at the whole question of divisions.  In other countries one or two hours' notice of a division is given. This means Members can attend to business and be back in time for divisions. We have a situation which, in terms of getting work done, is rather silly because we do not know when a division may occur and we are on standby all day.  If a person running a business had to keep people on standby all the time it would be very costly.  At certain times we agree to take divisions together, for example on Wednesday evenings.  This means Members can get on with their other business during the day.  We should look at that aspect and see if we can learn anything from current practices in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy think about the method of voting?  Would he favour an electronic system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be difficult. People have been known to change their minds walking up the stairs and people have been known to watch in what direction people went when they got to the top of the stairs.  Such a situation could arise in the near future.  A Bill was introduced this morning which could bring about such a situation.  As was pointed out, it is one of the few times that backbenchers get a good opportunity to talk to Ministers.  It is often an opportunity for a backbencher to get a Minister to agree to meet a deputation or whatever. I know it would be nice for a Minister to escape from such a situation although I know the Ministers opposite would never think of doing so.</P>
      <P>With increasing technology we must be careful that we do not drift from basic democracy.  Our system as it operates is a very democratic one despite what may be said about it by people outside the House.  We should build on that democracy and use the system to improve its effectiveness but we must be careful not to take away from the democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that more news items be announced in the Dáil.  I tried this once or twice but did not get a great response <Col N="705" /> from the then Opposition.  Perhaps it is not as practical as it sounds.  I was anxious to announce matters here so that people would see the relevance of Dáil Éireann and would have respect for the House.</P>
    <P>Many suggestions were made about confining localised questions to written reply.  Deputy Kelly mentioned having a parallel system for more local questions. To some extent this is a matter for the Opposition.  It is our duty to organise questions so that questions of national importance are given time in the House. It is something to which we will have to give attention.  We will arrange that questions of a more general nature are given time here.  Many of the other questions could be taken for written reply.  I would be reluctant to interfere with the parliamentary question system since it is one of the most elementary aspects of the whole process.  Deputy Kelly suggested a parallel Question Time with Departmental officials for some of these questions. I doubt that that would receive very wide support because it would be taking away from the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly made the point that the sitting hours are long enough if properly used.  There is a great deal of common sense in that. If items are dealt with in an efficient manner and people do not unduly delay the House or try to keep the House sitting, except in special situations, the time we have available is adequate.  Basically the purpose of the House is to debate and pass legislation.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary questions and Adjournment debates are very important to Members.  The Minister made some suggestion about Estimate debates. for example, breaking them up and having shorter contributions.  On Adjournment and Estimate debates Members of the Opposition usually want to make a reasonable contribution.  One might have a situation where there would be agreement to 20 or 30 minutes and then one could have a break with an opportunity to come back once or twice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Another possibility would be to allow the major parties or <Col N="706" /> even a Deputy to circulate with the Official Report a general statement of position which could then be discussed with the Estimate.  This would meet the point about longer presentation.  Deputy Woods raised the fact that Members do not stay in the House.  If there are long contributions like the ones we have all made in this debate, Members will not stay because their prospect of getting in is diminished.  If contributions were limited to five minutes the House would be much fuller because Members would have the prospect of speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that there could be circumstances in which five-minute contributions could be relevant but during certain debates, such as those on the Estimates and Adjournment debates, there is a need to examine the direction of Government policy.  On the latter occasions it is necessary to examine general areas but I believe contributions could be made fairly quickly.  It sometimes happens that Members speak for, perhaps, an hour-and-a-half and they repeat themselves or waffle on in order to fill in time.</P>
      <P>Regarding the circulation of documents, I would make the point that it is necessary to be able to digest these documents fairly quickly.  I recall an occasion when, as Minister for Health, I had a comprehensive statement ready for the Estimate debate.  For some reason it was not possible to adhere to the time arrangement which had been agreed in advance and I was able to give only a synopsis of the statement.  The full statement would have been of great advantage to Members because each of the sections was spelled out in detail and the relevant facts and figures were given.  I could not be allowed to circulate the speech or have it included in the Official Report.  If the Minister's point were adopted it would be necessary to have documents circulated well in advance of debates so that people would have an opportunity to read them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly important that we should have in this House the debate on the Public Capital Programme.  That can <Col N="707" /> be done as soon as the Government wish. Such a debate would help to make our deliberations more meaningful.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the line he is pursuing and on his initial contribution. I would be in favour of many of the reforms he mentions.  However, I would be fundamentally concerned that the freedom of speech, involvement and participation of the ordinary member should be absolute and maintained in the face of whatever changes take place.  I am talking about any Member, no matter where he comes from, no matter what his form or mode of speech and no matter whether people outside this House like it or not.  Members of this House are representatives of the people and if we lose sight of that aspect then all the rest will be of no value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as this is the first occasion on which I see you occupying the Chair I take the opportunity of welcoming you in this capacity and wishing you the very best of luck in your new position.</P>
      <P>It has to be accepted that in the eyes of the public the manner in which this House conducts its business leaves a great deal to be desired.  The House has been debased in the eyes of the public and is not seen to occupy itself decisively with the important issues of the day.  Members of the public see clearly enough what those issues are.  Most people would be aware of the importance of such things as the closing of the Ranks mill in Limerick, the likely closure of Clondalkin Paper Mills, the cuts in education and the increases in CIE fares.  These are the issues which are preoccupying the minds of the public but none of these matters is seen to be receiving the attention of this House.  In some cases the role of the House is completely irrelevant.  The education cuts were dealt with by ministerial decree without consultation in this House and in the absence of debate.  I shall be dealing with the question of ministerial decrees at greater length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House has virtually no control over public finances.  Perhaps in theory it has such control but the reality is otherwise. <Col N="708" /> The key matters are determined by the executive and backbenchers on either side of the House have very little input to the control or analysis of public finances.  Debates take place on Estimates and Supplementary Estimates and voluminous figures are produced but these debates are phrased in general terms and it is not possible for a Deputy to find out in detail how the money voted by this House is being expended.  Public money is expended not only by Government Departments but also by semi-State bodies and the semi-independent statutory bodies such as CIE and the ESB, and this House has no direct control or input on the expenditure policy of these bodies.</P>
    <P>As a Legislature this House has abdicated a very major share of the function and role it should play under the Constitution. The Constitution provides that there should be three basic divisions of government: the Legislature, this House which makes the laws; the Executive, that is the Ministers and the civil servants of the Departments who put them into effect; and the Judiciary, the body which determines and interprets them.  As far as the making of laws is concerned, the procedures of the House do not provide for or admit of the free introduction of the key, kernel issues which are facing the country at present.  We cannot speak here about crucial matters affecting the country.  Clondalkin Paper Mills are a good example of this.  Here is a case of a key industry of paper-making on the verge of disintegration.  If that mill goes the paper-making facility has gone and we know we will never get it back.  We are at a crossroads and yet, to bring up and discuss that very important matter, one has to rely on luck to raise it on the Adjournment.  It is not good enough.  The matter is too important to be decided on the throw of a dice as to whether one will be lucky or not.</P>
    <P>The Ranks situation is the same.  Many backbench Deputies would like to express their views on how that matter might be tackled to protect existing industries but the existing procedures of the Dáil fall down completely in regard to enabling Deputies to raise key, vital <Col N="709" /> and important matters of that nature in this House across the floor with the Ministers concerned and, perhaps in another venue, with the senior officials of the Department concerned.</P>
    <P>This House is supposed to be the law making organ of the State but to what extent is that the reality?  The real power in this State has gone from this House, and to some extent from the Judiciary side of government, and has become vested in the Executive side of government, by which I mean the Ministers and the civil service, especially at senior level of the civil service.  That is where the real power lies and the executive branch of Government are engaged in promulgating laws themselves without any real control or reference to this House.  They do that by various means authorised by this House in legislation and those laws which they bring in are known variously as rules, regulations, by-laws, orders and so on.  The volume of laws that are made by the Executive side of government, by Ministers and civil servants, is vast.  The volume of legislation that this House enacts is miniscule compared to ministerial regulations.  Those rules and regulations which the Departments and Ministers bring in affect the everyday lives of ordinary people every bit as much if not more than the laws enacted by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  They cover every field and aspect of life and every Department.  The reality is that the House exercises no real control over them and therein lies a very serious defect in our procedures and one which ought to be looked at and changed.</P>
    <P>If you pick up any Act of the Oireachtas you will find the enabling section giving power to the appropriate Minister to make his regulations.  When I was thinking of speaking on this matter I reached out for the nearest Act I had, which just happened to be the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963. I looked up the appropriate sections dealing with the matter of making regulations. Section 10 states that &ldquo;The Minister may make regulations for prescribing any matter referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed or in relation to any matter referred to in this Act as <Col N="710" /> the subject of regulations&rdquo;.  That is a pretty wide power to start with, an unfettered power that is given to the Minister.</P>
    <P>When I talk about &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in this connection and in any respect in which I am discussing this issue, the reality is that by &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in that context you mean the permanent officials of the Department concerned.  What is the role of the House in the regulations?  That is dealt with in section 10 (2) which says that &ldquo;Every regulation made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be anulled accordingly...&rdquo;.  Take the phrase &ldquo;the regulation shall be laid on the table of the House&rdquo;.  When I first came in here I looked around for the table in the House where these regulations were laid.  There is only one table obvious in the House and I never saw anything laid on it except the reporter's notebook.  I made further inquiries and I was told it meant being laid on the table of the Library.  There are many tables in the Library; I looked at them all but there was nothing to be found on any of them. It transpired that they are there all right, locked away in the Librarian's cupboard. These masses of laws which are enacted, not by this House or by vote and not scrutinised by this House are locked away in a cupboard in the Library.  I wonder how many Deputies examine them in any detail because they are not published or submitted to us.  We do not see them. Assuming a Deputy did go along and examine those regulations and decided that he was unhappy about one of them, what can he do?  It says here that there has to be a resolution passed by either House.  I wonder how a Deputy, whether on the Government or the Opposition side, could organise a resolution of this House to annual a regulation.  Has it ever been done in the history of the State?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be active.  We should have a committee of this House to consider and deal with sub-legislation. The wording of the subsection is very clever in the sense that it will discourage and make sure that a backbench Deputy who might have an interest in one of these matters will not be able to do anything about the regulations.  Such power as is given to the House is a power to annual regulations.  When dealing with a subject the Department concerned come forward with a set of regulations and Deputies are told they may annual the regulations if they like but we know that if the regulations are annulled the whole import and effectiveness of what is to be done will fall to the ground.  That is not something a Deputy would wish to do. However, what he should be able to do but cannot because of the way the sections are framed would be to amend the regulation in question.  We should not have to accept lock, stock and barrel what the permanent secretary of a Department happens to bring forward, without having an input into amending the regulation. We are given power to annual a regulation but not to amend it.  The enabling sections, as I understand them, do not give power to a Deputy to raise the question of amending the regulations.  This matter should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> In my view the body of laws, the sub-legislation, has got completely out of hand.  The House has legislated away the basic powers vested in it under the Constitution. We continue to do this all the time and the powers of the House and of its elected Members are being whittled away by our own actions.  An example that will come up in the future will be the taking away of a vital section, that of Posts ad Telegraphs, and instead of this House being able to monitor and control and have an input into the vital key functions in this area, An Bord Post and An Bord Telecom will be hived off and put in the control of civil servants.  Thus the Members of this House will be deprived of the authority to have a voice in the expenditure, operation and policies of those bodies.  This is part of an ongoing process.  This time it is Posts and Telegraphs, but what next?</P>
    <P>The same trend operates throughout the local authorities.  Elected members find themselves in little more than an advisory position.  Their powers have been whittled away.  Here again it is the public servants in the local authorities who exercise the executive key functions. The practice has arisen of giving a blank cheque to the executive side of government; we have given them very wide powers with no measure of control over them.</P>
    <P>To what extent can we bring some order into the chaotic situation that has developed?  Can any procedures be devised under which the House can exercise some measure of control over the sub-legislation?  The problem is that while Ministers are amenable to Dáil questions, senior officials and permanent secretaries in the Departments are not. The public rightly feel that real power is vested in them but they are not amenable to the elected representatives.  A possible procedure to deal with that situation would be to have permanent committees of this House that would have power to call before them the Minister concerned, the Minister of State, the permanent head of the Department as well as senior officials and also the heads and managers of the State-sponsored bodies and the semi-independent statutory bodies.  The committees should have the power to call <Col N="713" /> those people before them and to give evidence in public of what is taking place in the Department concerned.  They should be obliged to produce documents when required to do so by a committee and they should be open to questions in depth and in detail as to what is going on in the Department.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous reluctance &mdash; this has always been the tradition &mdash; on the part of civil servants to give information from their Department.  There is also a tremendous reluctance to produce documentation and people who have been involved in litigation with Government Departments are aware of this. Even when it comes to releasing documents for court cases there is a tremendous reluctance to let go reports or to give reasons for decisions made by senior civil servants.  We must face the fact that senior civil servants are acting not only as legislators in making rules and regulations but they are acting as judges also. We find this is the case in many tribunals. I gave the example of An Bord Pleanála and the appeals commission in respect of income tax.  The list is endless.  These people are performing judicial and legislative functions as well as their own executive functions but they are not answerable to and cannot be called to account by Members of the Dáil.  The Dáil has been seen to have whittled away and to have abdicated its powers to the executive branch of government and that is the reason the stock of this House has fallen in the public eye.  It is an ongoing process.  Unless some steps are taken to bring the executive branch of government under some kind of answerability to this House that situation will continue. The House will devolve even more than it is now into little more than a grand forum and debating society where backbenchers serve their constituencies but have little input into the real control of finances.  How can we find out details of a particular project from a Department, who is working on it and how many civil servants are involved?  To do that you would need to have the senior controller of the Department present to be able to question them in some depth to find out what exactly is going on in that section of <Col N="714" /> his Department, what documentation has been taking place there and to probe that in depth.  If that is done we would have some hope of bringing the Executive into some realm of amenability to this House. If not we will relax more and more into the level of a grand debating club.</P>

      <P>Dáil Éireann has the potential to be an extremely good democratic institution, but for the last 60 years we have had a Westminster inheritance which is centuries old already.

That is pitiable and in the light of it the Minister is seriously considering Dáil reform.</P>

    <P>The system at the moment is ridiculous, farcical.  Between the party system and the procedures in Dáil Éireann no elected TD can adequately represent his constitutents here in the Chamber.  If a backbencher on either the Government or Opposition side wishes to speak he or she must go through his or her party Whip and in so doing will be relegated according to position.  Ministers and shadow Ministers are allowed to speak first and any other Minister who wishes to speak usually is given preference over the backbenchers.  That is very sad. Deputy Woods said that this House was the Chamber in which Deputies had the right to free and equal speech.  They do not have the right to free and equal speech.  There are preferences.  I hope that when this Dáil is reformed all elected representatives will have more equal opportunity irrespective of status.  I understand that the Minister and shadow Minister of a Department must get preference but outside of that everybody should be treated equally.  The situation at the moment is very frustrating for backbench TDs because they cannot <Col N="715" /> truly and honestly represent their constituents. They are inhibited first by the party system and second by Dáil procedure.</P>
    <P>This House, and the Oireachtas according to the Constitution, are supposed to have the full and exclusive power of making laws for this State.  After reading that I began to consider what power the individual TD has or, indeed, the majority of TDs have in this House in influencing the laws put before us here. I suggest that TDs have very little influence, if any.  A Bill is presented which has been drafted and prepared by the relevant Department.  We are confined by our party Whip or party system.  We cannot be too controversial.  If we are on the Government side we cannot disagree strongly although privately we may disagree with what is being presented.  If we are on the Opposition side we can disagree, but on a vote the majority will carry it and the result is that there is not totally honest representation.  As Deputy Taylor said, Bills presented to this House are prepared by the civil service and rather than having a democratic institution we have a bureaucratic institution.  This must be looked at very seriously.  We have reached the stage where TDs are not seen as the primary representatives.  In recent times pressure groups have become very strong political forces.  Why?  This is so because in the past various Ministers have not heeded backbench TDs or the Opposition sufficiently.  If Governments were prepared to listen more to their backbenchers and to the Opposition there would not be the same necessity for pressure groups.  Pressure groups possibly have easier access to Ministers and to various Departments than backbenchers and the Opposition have.  That is sad.  We are moving away from what we are elected democratically to do.  There is an onus on this House to see that the public are better educated as to what this House is all about and the function of a TD.  All pressure groups should be directed to the respective TDs in their constituencies and these in turn should tackle the Ministers and Departments.  That situation must be examined very seriously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> The committee system as we have it at the moment could be very much improved and then the overall situation would improve.  If we want to improve it we must look at the American system. There is no point in creating new committees or increasing the membership of existing committees unless we are prepared to give them power and clout.  At the moment they have not a great deal of power.  Various approaches could be adopted.  A very rough outline of a Bill for a Department could be presented to a committee who could debate it honestly, and directly and constructive points could be put.  Power should be given to the committee to extend the Bill or to delete matters in that Bill.  The Bill, after being debated in committee, could be presented to the House and we would have had a fair representation of all honest viewpoints regarding it.  The committee should also have the power to call in any type of technical advice which they would feel necessary and to summon various people whom they might feel could help in the interest of what was under discussion.</P>
    <P>Another area is that of public accounts and public moneys.  We have an accounts committee at the moment and basically they are ensuring that money is spent in accordance with proper accounting procedure. That is all very well, but they should be doing far more than that.  As they stand they are merely a watch-dog on the accounts.  Power should be extended to that committee to enable them to give direction to Departments and to semi-State bodies on expenditure in different areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to semi-State bodies, in the past &mdash; I hope this will not continue &mdash; grave abuses and lack of control by respective Government Departments have existed.  Semi-State bodies appear to have no accountability to this House in regard to expenditure or the way they manage their accounts.  Suggestions have been made to extend the semi-State bodies system, but I have strong reservations about doing that in the present situation. If it is to be extended those bodies should have far more accountability to this House than they have had in the past. <Col N="717" /> After all, public money is being spent and this House should have control over what is going on.  At the moment it does not. I feel a lot of money could be saved if a far closer eye was kept on expenditure in that area.</P>
    <P>The Public Accounts Committee should have more responsibility for the public capital expenditure programme. That is a long-term type of policy and they could examine this on a long-term basis rather than under the existing system. An economic development committee should be set up which would deal with the development of industry, agriculture, forestry and fisheries.  I feel a committee like that could help a lot in the House.  It could be of great assistance to the respective Ministers and could come up with ideas other than those brought up by civil servants.  I have great respect for civil servants; I know they do a good job but unless you are on the ground meeting the people, talking to them and moving around a constituency or a county, such as every TD does, you will not have the same understanding or grasp of what is needed, what is practical and available.  A committee like this could be very helpful.</P>
    <P>I believe a committee on justice and law reform should be set up.  Too much time in the House is spent on discussing finance and the budget and very little time is given to law reform or the introduction of new laws.  If a good committee on law reform and justice was set up the situation could change.  Another committee could be set up to deal with welfare and I would include here health, social welfare and education.  A committee combining those three Departments could be very useful.</P>
    <P>Committees should be set up &mdash; perhaps it is a bit unfair to say this &mdash; to take certain powers from Ministers.  At the moment our system is becoming more bureaucratic.  This is the primary representative House and there should be more accountability to it.  The House has in fact delegated through the years a lot of its responsibility directly to Government. This is unfortunate.  Committees of the House should get more power, <Col N="718" /> take some power from the Ministers.  This would result in a better balance and there would be more democratic representation.</P>
    <P>Another area I would like to deal with is parliamentary questions.  This is the one thing available to all TDs which is worthwhile.  I know that at times there may be abuses of it and there may be matters put on the Order Paper which could be dealt with otherwise.  The Minister suggested that there was a restriction on time for Question Time because we needed time for debate.  I suggest that the time for debate in the House is far too long at times.  People get up and ráiméis and ráiméis.  Often the Whips of the various parties get people who are longwinded enough into the House to keep the debate going.  That is an absolutely ridiculous attitude.  If people could be short, constructive and fairly well researched it would be far better than being longwinded for the sake of speaking. I believe, rather than spending one hour a day on questions that two hours a day should be spent on Question Time. We should have an hour of questions in the morning and another hour in the afternoon.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider this.  The Dáil question is often the only means by which a Deputy can actually confront a Minister and get some very specific information from him.  The Adjournment Debate is not very widely used.  It could be far more widely used and I hope this can be expanded and more use made of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that we should extend the sitting days.  I was happy to note, when Deputy Woods spoke, that he had a special appreciation of rural Deputies.  I would be very slow to stay here on Friday for a Dáil sitting.  I feel we could actually resolve the situation in two ways.  We could do this, firstly, by curtailing the length of contributions which Deputies make, allowing more Deputies to contribute to the various debates and secondly, by having slightly shorter holidays and still having the three days a week and perhaps coming back in September after the Summer Recess.  As far as rural Deputies are concerned I do not believe it would be possible for them <Col N="719" /> to sit in the Dáil on Friday.  It is all right for a person within the radius of 40 miles from Dublin but outside of that it is totally ludicrous if one is anxious to get re-elected.  By all means sit in Dublin for four days a week if you do not want to stand for election the next time but if you want to seek re-election you would be a very foolish TD to sit in Dáil Éireann on a Friday.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the accommodation and facilities for Deputies which is absolutely appalling.  I have no doubt that if the Department of Labour were brought in and the various labour laws were to be applied in relation to the space and the square footage per person at work there is no way this House could comply with the rules and regulations or the existing laws.  The conditions under which Deputies and their staff are forced to work in at the moment are appalling. I hope the Minister will seriously consider the present situation and consider the accommodation and the facilities afforded to Deputies in Leinster House at the moment.  We vote large sums of money to semi-State bodies but if any of us visit those semi-State bodies we will find the various executives and staff working in luxurious offices with fantastic accommodation while we literally squat in corners trying to get our constituency work done.  It is most unsatisfactory and should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Dáil divisions. It is suggested that we might change over to the system used in Washington at the moment, the electronic system.  That could be wise but against that, as Deputy Woods said, we may not have the access to Ministers and have the type of social chat which is often part of the voting system at the moment.  It might be an idea, rather than doing that, to say that on Wednesday evening we will have divisions on a number of issues and set aside a certain time each week for divisions on all matters.  That may be wiser than our being confined to the House, not being able to go to any Department or to leave the House when the Dáil is in session.  That sort of situation is not conducive to good representation and is <Col N="720" /> something that should be considered seriously.  I trust that the Minister will consider all the points that have been made during the debate and that he will act on them as soon as he finds it possible to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Going through the different contributions that have been made during this debate one is reminded of the Latin phrase, <i>repetitio mater studiorum est.</i> Most of the points have been made and made well.  I consider this motion to be one of the most important to come before us for a long time and I congratulate Deputy Bruton both in his role as Minister and as Leader of the House for introducing the motion.  This motion has given the ordinary back bench Deputies as well as everybody else in the House an opportunity of voicing their opinions on what they consider to be right or wrong as the case may be in respect of the procedures of the House.</P>
      <P>We have many different kinds of Deputy here.  We have rural Deputies, urban Deputies, Deputies of some ambition, Deputies with not too much ambition, Deputies who are over-ambitious and so on.  However, all Deputies were anxious to come in here and once in they do not wish to leave.  Let us take the rural Deputy.  If he says to his constituent that he will be in the Dáil from Tuesday to Thursday of any week, the constituent might well ask what will be going on there, what will the Deputy be doing during that time.  The only confirmation of what goes on in this House is relayed to rural people either by way of radio, television or the press.  One of the reasons for a rural Deputy speaking at all in the House is that he has the opportunity of sending details of his contributions to local papers, thereby keeping his name before the people he represents.  This enables constituents to read what their Deputy has been advocating.  The Deputy from an urban area does not have to the same extent the service of local newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall walking through the lobby with another Deputy to vote in a division when he took from his pocket a small transistor radio on which he said he hoped to hear <Col N="721" /> on the 6.30 news what was going on in the Dáil.  The point I am making is that many Deputies vote here on matters with which they are not acquainted to any great extent.  I have done that myself since coming here in 1975.  For the first 18 months of that time when there was not a very strong parliamentary majority, there were divisions there was a quorum being called for by the then Opposition. This situation resulted in Deputies trooping up and down the stairs, having to leave committees or deputations in order to be here to fulfil their role in relation to the procedure of the House.</P>
    <P>The interpretation of what transpires here is relayed by the media but there are many people in rural Ireland who do not read national newspapers.  Indeed, in many areas the national newspapers are not received until a few days after printing. In most cases the emphasis on what happens here is relayed to rural Ireland by way of the local newspapers.  That is why it is so important from a rural Deputy's point of view that he makes a case here on whatever may be the local issues involved.</P>
    <P>We might ask what the ordinary backbencher does in relation to his membership of Dáil Éireann.  He comes here every Tuesday morning with a briefcase full of correspondence.  This correspondence relates to such items as medical cards, dentures, hip replacement operations, land division, blocked drains, potholes in the roads and so on.  During the three days he spends here, the Deputy writes about these various matters to the people on the Front Bench and receives an acknowledgment which he then passes to the relevant person at home.  He will say that he had a letter from his TD but that the potholes, for instance, are still in the road.  The Deputy gets in touch with the county manager who says there is no money to carry out the work concerned. In turn, the case is put to the Minister for Finance through the Department of the Environment but the potholes remain in the road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a Deputy here once who advocated digging potholes in the roads in the interest of creating employment.  If procedures in the House were operating properly, Deputies would be able to take the more important aspects of their correspondence and deal with them effectively.  The time of too many Deputies is taken up in dealing with what is very often wasteful correspondence. That has resulted from a system that has become very bureaucratic in recent years.</P>
      <P>So far as being noticed in the House is concerned, I might refer to Deputy Gregory-Independent who, because of not wearing a tie, got the attention of the national newspapers.  I suppose that if somebody were to arrive in a tracksuit he, too, would be given attention by the media.  If a Deputy wishes to be put out of the House, he will probably talk to the Chair beforehand and tell him that he intended to create a racket and wished to be thrown out.  The Deputy would get considerable attention in the newspapers with the result that constituents might say to the Deputy that he was doing a great job in putting on pressure in respect of whatever was the issue involved.  That is the kind of procedure that we have had for a long time so that one's role as an effective legislator has been diminished by the antics of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House was in existence long before I came into the world.  There were many people here before I came on the scene but one tends to get the impression that those earlier people were of a much higher calibre and were much better people in many ways than is the case of today's Members.  That may well be true. I do not wish to take from any of them in any way but this whole business of politics has changed enormously in the past decade in terms not only of the volume of legislation going through the House but in terms also of the volume of correspondence received by every public representative as a result, in many cases, of constituents being made aware of their rights in relation to various laws.  People query public representatives on these matters and if one is not entirely up to <Col N="723" /> date with what is going on, one can find oneself at a severe disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The work of every public representative goes on almost around the clock.  He is continuously taking telephone calls, attending meetings at which he may be either praised or abused, being stopped in the street and so on.  All of this means that a Deputy does not have sufficient time to get through even a minute quantity of the correspondence that he finds on his table.  To be an effective Deputy one would need to concentrate on three or four specific areas only instead of attempting to be an expert on all matters.</P>
    <P>In the last number of years the irrelevancy of the House has grown in the public mind.  I do not think that the power of the media in relation to this is understood fully by many people.  The impression that the ordinary man in the street has of Dáil Éireann is that it has become an irrelevant institution.  That is why the Minister, as Leader of the House, whatever that means &mdash; I hope he will explain it to us later because it is a rather nebulous title &mdash; will push through effective reforms that will allow every Member of this House to play an effective role in so far as the processing of legislation is concerned.</P>
    <P>I have much respect for a former Minister, Mr. Justin Keating.  I spent many hours listening to him speak here.  One of the reasons for his not being returned here was his concentration on his ministerial duties.  This meant that he was not available to answer the everyday whim and call concerning all the little problems in his constituency.  Deputies are between two minds, whether to try to become effective legislators or to give a social service second to none.  In my case I travel all over my constituency, which is 110 miles by 70 miles, and try to service the needs of my constituents as far as I can, as do the other Deputies representing the same constituency.</P>
    <P>Many people have made the point that this institution is based on Westminster structures and has become outdated in many respects.  The broadcasting of portion of the debates is very necessary, but <Col N="724" /> there is an inherent danger there.  Certain Deputies have a vocabulary second to none and they could dominate broadcasting time thus minimising the effectiveness of the role of the ordinary run-of-the-mill Deputy.  If broadcasting were introduced it would have to be structured in such a way that the Ministers and Deputies better able to perform would not take away the opportunity for the less able Deputies to make their case.  Broadcasting debates would enhance the view people have of this House.  I listen to the broadcast of Question Time in Westminster and I would not like the Chair to take the same line as the Speaker of the House of Commons.  For example, I would not like the Chair to say to my good friend and colleague Deputy Donnellan from Galway &ldquo;Would the Right Honourable Member from Galway West sit down?&rdquo; If he were in Opposition the Deputy might tell the Chair to &ldquo;mind himself&rdquo;.  That is not meant to be a derogatory comment on Deputy Donnellan, who is a straightforward Deputy.  That type of comment from the Chair would not be relevant to this House because we are a different people, behaving in a different way and trying to get the job done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The parliamentary question is the only recourse open to many backbench Deputies. Before the Minister answers a question he asks his civil servants the type of supplementaries he might be asked.  If the civil servant is good at his job, he will have five or six answers prepared for every parliamentary question.  When the Minister comes in he will give as little information as possible in his reply to the Opposition Deputy, but if he is a good Minister he will have phoned the Government Deputy telling him his Opposition colleague has asked a question and he will tell him the answer he is giving.  He will caution the Deputy that he did not give him that information but that he can use the information if he wishes.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> The point made about debating the Estimates before the money is spent should have been introduced a long time ago.  Every week we get reports of bodies which spent the money being discussed two or three years ago.  It is past time that this procedure was reformed.  If this were done, various pressure groups and organisations could meet their public representatives and have their case debated in front of the Minister before the budget was finalised.  A budget debate might last six or eight weeks after its introduction and Deputies from all sides make their cases, very often repeating what already has been said, about what they consider should be done or what should be implemented in the budget.  Such a debate would be much more relevant if it took place before the budget was introduced.</P>
    <P>If the committee system is introduced it should get its share of national publicity. Committees should have power to call witnesses and get the evidence they require.  At present many committees are held in Setanta House and it could take 20 minutes to get a quorum.  If the division bells are rung or a quorum is needed in the Chamber, the Deputies have to come back to Leinster House.  Only a small proportion of them might return to Setanta House for the second part of the meeting.  Deputies spend most of their days running up and down stairs, taking telephone calls, going on deputations to Ministers and Ministers of State, meeting visitors at the gate, showing them around and bringing them into the Public Gallery. They often remark that there are very few Deputies in the Chamber.  The Deputy in the Chamber may be making the best case possible, but the public get a wrong impression when they do not see Deputies occupying their seats in the Chamber and they do not regard this as an effective Parliament.  They get the impression that Deputies get free meals and free drinks and that this is a kind of circus.  Sometimes one would want to bring in a symphony orchestra to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery to liven things up.</P>
    <P>The reform of our parliamentary system is of the utmost importance in the context of the very large numbers of our <Col N="726" /> young people.  A recent United States report indicated that by the year 2000 all the goods at present manufactured will be manufactured by 3 per cent of the population.  That trend will eventually hit us, leading to higher unemployment and more leisure time.</P>
    <P>In terms of the effectiveness of our present institutions, this motion and the Minister's responsibility is very important. Prior to the recent election I remember canvassing a certain Government building.  I say this with no disrespect to the people working in that building, but I met two officials &mdash; clerical assistants &mdash; who told me their section did not have any work.  They said the work comes in waves every six or eight months when they work non-stop, but during the lull there is nothing to do.  The staff in income tax are over-worked and under great stress.  Because of the union system and the different grading system operating, the officials who might have nothing to do for certain periods are not allowed to help out in an overworked section.  That is something the Minister for the Public Service should bear in mind.</P>
    <P>The procedure for transfers needs to be centralised.  An official who wishes a transfer to the west for family or other reasons might be fifth on the transfer list this week, but next week she might be fortieth.  There should be a central list for people in the same grade.  A transfer should be granted in order of application and if an official declines a transfer he or she should be able to do so at his or her own discretion.</P>
    <P>I wish Deputy J. Bruton well in his role as Minister with responsibility for this area.  He has the parliamentary strength to bring in reforms which will make this Chamber much more effective in the years ahead and which will show the people that the role of the public representative is not merely providing a social service, being a messenger boy or as fodder for the lobbies, but is part and parcel of the principle of democracy which allows the people to go behind a screen on election day and vote for a candidate of their choice.  When a voter sees his candidate elected, he likes to know his <Col N="727" /> TD will make effective points in debates in this House.</P>
    <P>I remember having the doubtful fortune of appearing on a well-known television programme where a well-known journalist said of me: &ldquo;This guy purports to be a Deputy, but he did not even speak in that Dáil.&rdquo;  That Dáil only lasted for a short time, but the journalist was right, I did not speak in this fashion in the chamber during that Dáil.  The number of people who commented on that fact was unbelievable.  I thank the journalist for pointing this out in his own way. Indeed, I go further and remind him of my invitation to a week of travel around a rural constituency to see how TDs live and operate, which challenge has not yet been accepted.  If he wants to accept it and give a full report in that well run magazine and all the publicity which he wants, I will pay him royalties.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I trust that Deputy Bruton, in his wisdom, having previously written the document in relation to many of the finer points regarding parliamentary procedures in different countries, will shortly introduce into this House an effective procedural Bill which will allow all elected representatives to play a really effective part in the governing of our country.  It is high time that we were given this opportunity and I thank Deputy Bruton for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first speech in this new Dáil.  I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputy Bruton on their appointments.  I am very pleased that part of the Minister's portfolio deals with this matter.  He has shown a great interest in it and has done much very good work.  I was happy to witness this in the sessions of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges before the break-up of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I begin where Deputy Kenny left off. He is quite right that the public's perception of a TD's work is limited to what they read in the news media about what the Deputy does in this House.  We all know the tremendous workload which has to be carried by all Members, with good humour and conscientiousness. <Col N="728" /> Rural TDs, having covered extensive areas, have to attend the House and debate on legislation.  We appear to operate a cabinet system, with very little contribution to legislation from backbenchers. One of the great problems facing us and the Government, is the shortness of the time of office of Ministers. They are transferred to another Department or, as in the last couple of years, there are frequent changes of Government and it is a miracle that any policy can evolve.  For that reason alone, I hope that there will not be an election for another few years, if only so that policies can be pursued.  I hope that the Members will be enabled to contribute more towards policy-making.  The only way in which this is possible&mdash;and this has been mentioned in the House and by the Minister &mdash; is by having a proper committee system, with the back-up of public servants. While it would be to the benefit of the country to have parliamentarians more engaged in the actual legislative programme and contributing towards the drafting of policy, it is essential to recognise that constituency work still must continue. The Minister must bear in mind that if ultimately we are going to do something as constructive as he proposes, we will need facilities for the management of our constituency affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been considerably improved by the previous Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite correct.  He introduced secretarial services for the first time.  When I became a deputy, these services were not available.  Then we got one secretary for six Deputies, later one for three Deputies and now we have a secretary each.  This has certainly made a tremendous difference to my workload. Nevertheless, we could examine the framework within each constituency.  I would not have the same difficulty as a rural Deputy.  Some of these have secretaries operating from their constituencies, but they need management of their constituency affairs &mdash; representation, visiting people on their behalf &mdash; if they are to spend more time in the House and if the number of sitting hours is to be <Col N="729" /> extended.  It has been proposed that the House sit on Fridays on a regular basis, for debating Estimates and so forth.  That might not require the attendance of every Deputy at any particular time.</P>
      <P>We know how inaccurate is the belief that because the Dáil only sits for three days a week, the TDs work for only three days a week.  Most TDs who attend the House are very impatient to get back to their constituencies, where their main workload is.  I also understand the anxiety of Ministers in Cabinet who see their fellow members working at constituency level while they are locked in, as it were, in their legislative position, legislating for the country.  They must seek re-election at election time and the man who has had the freedom of the constituency will get more votes and gain from the man who has been doing important work at Cabinet or junior Minister level.  The Ministers have facilities for running their constituencies, clinics and so forth, but the position is still worrying for every Minister. Only fellow TDs can appreciate the concern of TDs in this connection.</P>
      <P>I look forward to more information as to what is happening in other countries, other democracies.  At some stage, the possibility was discussed of examining some of the other systems.  We should educate ourselves as to what would suit our system.  One cannot say that the Australian, New Zealand or American system would suit us.  Each country is different. Here we have a much more homogenous population.  No other country gives greater access to public representatives than this.  I am quite sure of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to speech for the sake of speaking, in order to keep a debate going because something else is not ready.  A lot of this goes on.  I would be very much in favour of a system which restricted speakers to a shorter time, perhaps allowing them to speak as frequently as they wished on Committee Stage.  By so doing the work of this House could be rendered more meaningful.  It is embarrassing sometimes to have to get up and waffle on for the sake of keeping a debate going.  This really is a problem of governments <Col N="730" /> rather than of opposition.  From reading the Minister's remarks if, as I hope, it is the intention to break away from this system I would support it.</P>
    <P>I might just say also that very often the well-prepared speech, one on which a Deputy has worked really hard receives no more media space or time than the speech of a Deputy who has been told just to go in there and speak for 15 minutes or so.  Very often this is discouraging to new Members who feel somewhat aggrieved.  They feel: what is the point? I have worked very hard on the preparation of my speech, undertaken a lot of research, yet it gets two or three lines press coverage while a Deputy who may have made a lot of noise saying nothing receives just as much or even more coverage.</P>
    <P>I think this House has served the people well but, legislatively speaking, we are moving into different times when governments more than ever will need the collective good sense of the whole of the House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for improved mechanisms to provide for fuller and more efficient consideration of public policy issues by public representatives in my view is well established. The proposal for parliamentary committees contained in the Government's programme is an indication of our commitment to development in this area.</P>
      <P>A full analysis of the problems affecting the financial business of the House is contained in the Government Discussion Paper published by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Energy when Minister for Finance.  At the time of its publication this document was circulated widely and received a very favourable welcome.  Many bodies and individuals commented on it.  Their comments have been and will continue to be taken into account in the formulation of proposals for reform in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the impetus given to the reform process by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Energy.  I know he has a long-standing interest in these matters and a deep commitment to them.  I have every confidence <Col N="731" /> that, with the agreement of this House, he will bring about substantial and constructive reforms.  While the subject of reforms in parliamentary procedures touches on a great variety of issues I shall address myself mainly to the handling of financial business and to financial procedures in this House in particular.</P>
    <P>Of course the most important event in our financial calendar is the budget.  I might make the point that in some countries our system would seem very strange. The presentation of our budget is preceded by more or less intense speculation by the media and by interest groups. Much of this speculation is inspired and a great deal of it highly imaginative.  The presentation of the budget itself is followed by immediate reaction by the Opposition.  I might add further that, having been on both sides of the House, the same qualifications could be applied to parts of the reaction from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Very different procedures are followed in other countries.  For example, in Sweden the Government's budget Bill is seen as the first step in a long process of negotiation. The Bill itself is a long and complicated document and is presented to the Swedish Parliament when individual Members can add amendments.  There then follows a process of consideration in parliamentary committee before the final Budget begins to take shape.  In the parliamentary committees the Government will often make alterations in order to achieve consensus.  I am not suggesting that we change overnight from our traditional way of doing things or attempt to disturb unduly our processes which have the advantages of being well tried and well known.  But we can perhaps learn some useful lessons from other countries in this regard.  I might make the point also that a number of us are familiar, in one capacity or another, with the procedure of drawing up the EEC budget, which is rather similar, goes on for a long time and where there is a great deal of room for suggestion, input and amendment by the people involved in the budgetary process.  Again this is a procedure <Col N="732" /> which produces a great deal of involvement, debate and inevitably consensus in its preparation.</P>
    <P>The matter of budgetary timetable is one which we must consider.  The Programme for Government envisages the earlier presentation of annual Estimates so that the Dáil can have an opportunity to consider them before the beginning of the financial year.  Deputies will be aware of the practice which has existed for many years of presenting the annual public expenditure Estimates to the House in January which means that much of the expenditure has taken place before the Estimates in question can be debated. We all realise and accept that a debate in such circumstances can be expected to have a very reduced influence on policy. Deputies know also that substantial amounts are voted through the House each year without any worthwhile scrutiny or debate because we have neither the time nor the procedures necessary to undertake such scrutiny.</P>
    <P>A start has already been made on the process of making public expenditure plans known at an earlier date.  The Estimates for 1983 were published last November by the former Government, the procedure having been initiated in July 1981 by the present Minister for Industry and Energy when he introduced his first budgetary proposals in this House in that month.  I hope to secure a further improvement in that timetable this year. Ideally a substantial part of the budgetary process &mdash; including perhaps the budget itself &mdash; would be concluded before the start of the financial year.  The extent to which this could be achieved is not yet clear.  I would hope that further discussion during the debate on this motion would help us to get an indication of the way Members feel we could manage this process.  What is certain is that we can and should secure fuller consideration of the Estimates by the Dáil before the beginning of the year to which they refer.</P>
    <P>There are of course a number of drawbacks in earlier presentation.  For example, the outturn figures for the current year would be very tentative as the figures for the final quarter would not be available.  If existing practice were to continue <Col N="733" /> Supplementary Estimates for the current year would still require to be presented after the Estimates for the coming year.  However, when due allowance is made for these constraints it should be possible to provide sufficient information to allow consideration of at least the main thrust and implications of the Government's public expenditure proposals for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Consideration is also being given to the feasibility of publishing, at an earlier date, a general indication of the outlook for revenue in the coming financial year. This would enable the House to consider both the taxation and borrowing implications of a given level of public expenditure. A new procedure being followed by the British Government is of interest in this regard.  In 1982 the first edition of their new Government autumn publication was issued.  This is the autumn statement in which projected revenue and expenditure for 1983 were discussed together with some of the bases for calculating revenue changes from various options.  This corresponds to a point raised earlier this morning by Deputy Woods.  Certainly it is something I will take on board and review in the context of the general improvement of information available to the House in advance of discussions on the Estimates and on budgetary matters.  It is a matter of great importance to create an awareness of and acceptance by the community as a whole that levels of expenditure and taxation are inextricably linked.  The kind of presentation to which I have just referred would be of immense assistance in bringing people's minds to bear on this inextricable link between expenditure and taxation.</P>

A factory unit of 7,000 sq. ft., and a cluster unit consisting of three 3,000 sq. ft. factories provided by private finance are also under construction in Letterkenny.  The IDA also have 55 acres of land available for industrial development in Letterkenny and five acres in Lifford.  All of these facilities are being vigorously promoted for industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the recent level of job losses in manufacturing industry in Tralee.  I would point out, however, that the Industrial Development Authority have secured a number of major industrial projects for the town such as Borg Warner, Burlington, Shop Vac Limited, Wabco Westinghouse Limited, and Jasan Products Limited, all of which are now well established and provide employment for over 900 people at present.  A number of jobs have yet to be provided from projects approved by the IDA over the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> The IDA have over 28 acres of industrial land in Tralee, which together with the 24,000 sq. ft. advance factory and 3,300 sq. ft. cluster unit, are being promoted for suitable industrial projects.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the scope of the services programme identified under the legislation whereby the IDA were given authority to depart from traditional industry into the services area.  There is a specific list of activities which are considered to be <Col N="742" /> appropriate for promotion by the IDA. It does not allow them to get into all forms of services, merely a specified list which would be considered to have an export potential.  It is desirable that the IDA should not become involved in promoting services directly in competition with services domestically provided otherwise.  They must be services with an export potential and this limits the number of services in which they can become involved.  I have not available at present the comprehensive list of those services as defined under the Act and I am speaking entirely from recollection.  I will make the list available to the Deputy.  I also propose to make available to him by letter, if this is satisfactory, a detailed statement in so far as it is available as to precisely what the IDA intend to do in the services park.  I would agree with any suggestion that this should be more widely discussed because it is a new development and is, in a sense, a pioneering venture.  I would hope to provide him with information which may provide scope for a further question.</P>

    <P>As to the future of the company, I would hope that the substantial financial assistance being provided by State agencies and accompanying measures being taken by the group would provide a sound basis for the continued operations of Irish Leathers.

      <P>If the Deputy wishes to put down a question about cattle exports he is at liberty to do so, but in relation to this firm I should like to tell the House that it experienced difficulties towards the end of the seventies.  Indeed, the tannery in Gorey closed in 1979 with the loss of 186 jobs.  Since then State agencies have been involved in assisting the company.

      <P>There are three categories of registered persons:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the registered importers/assemblers <Col N="749" /> of Community vehicles who maintain their 1965 level of assembly and employment.  These are free to import fully built-up vehicles, for which they are registered, without restriction as to quantity.</P>
    <P>Secondly, any person who, subsequent to the commencement of the 1968 Motor Vehicles Act, commences assembly of vehicles from new aggregates of parts which qualify as completely knocked down, will be eligible for registration for the importation of fully built-up vehicles provided his assembly reaches the required level and for so long as assembly is maintained at that level.  The required level of assembly is as follows:</P>
    <P>(i)  5 per cent of the total market then current for private cars, where the assembly of private cars only is involved, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  10 per cent of the total market then current for commercial vehicles, where the assembly of commercial vehicles only is involved, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  5 per cent of the total market then current for private cars and commercial vehicles, where the assembly of both private cars and commercial vehicles is involved.</P>
    <P>In the case of a person who commences the assembly of vehicles of non-Community origin, such as Japanese vehicles, and reaches the required level for registration, then imports of fully built up vehicles will be restricted on a ratio basis.  The ratio applied is that existing between the total number of vehicles of Community origin imported fully built-up and the number of vehicles of Community origin assembled in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, in accordance with the global quota arrangements under Article 3 of Protocol 7 any person appointed sole importer in Ireland for a make of vehicle originating in the Community, but which is not already receiving special treatment under the scheme, may apply for registration for the importation of such vehicles in fully <Col N="750" /> built-up condition.  The global quota is fixed annually as a percentage of the number of vehicles assembled in Ireland during the previous year.  The percentage was fixed at 3 in 1973 and increases by one percentage point each year to reach 14 per cent in 1984.  The quota for 1983 is 13 per cent of the total number of motor vehicles assembled in 1982.</P>
    <P>The global quota is allocated between the following categories of vehicles: viz., private cars &mdash; 85 per cent of the quota, and commercial vehicles &mdash; 15 per cent.  The quota for each class is further subdivided into two categories &mdash; cars not exceeding 1500cc get 75 per cent of the car quota and 25 per cent goes to cars exceeding 1500cc.  Similarly, the quota for commercials is divided as to 75 per cent to commercial vehicles not exceeding 3.5 tons tare weight and 25 per cent to those exceeding 3.5 tons.</P>
    <P>In addition to the importation of fully built-up vehicles by the categories of registered importers I have already mentioned, section 6(1) of the 1968 Motor Vehicles Act empowers the Minister to authorise a registered person to import a motor vehicle of a make or type not entered in the register.</P>
    <P>The Act also provides for the importation by non-registered persons of fully built-up motor vehicles not intended for sale where it would not be appropriate to authorise the importation by a registered importer.  These importations are mainly confined to cases involving permanent transfer of residence from abroad which do not fully meet the requirements for duty-free importation under the Transfer of Residence Regulations administered by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

Each category is dealt with differently under the Act.  The Deputy can be assured that my Department are very much aware of the need to conserve employment in the industry, and that all applications which come before us for the importation of fully built-up units are looked at very closely.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The special arrangements for the motor vehicle assembly industry, negotiated at the time of our accession to the EEC and covering the period up to the end of 1984, were intended to afford a long period for transition to free trade in motor vehicles. Under these arrangements it was envisaged that any firm ceasing assembly and which provided comparable employment for their assembly workers by diversifying into suitable alternative manufacturing industry would continue to enjoy facilities for the importation on fully built-up vehicles.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, changes in the structure of the motor industry world-wide and the economic recession in the conditions unfavourable to new investment, have created serious problems for firms wishing to cease assembly and establish new manufacturing projects.</P>
      <P>Firms which can no longer continue assembly and whose consequential arrangements do not fully meet the diversification requirements may be granted facilities for built-up vehicles but on a restricted basis only.  The extent of such facilities will depend upon the proposed alternative arrangements.  In such cases the primary aim is to preserve as many jobs as possible.</P>
      <P>Every possible effort will continue to be made between now and the end of 1984 to induce firms either to continue assembly or, failing that, to provide alternative employment for their assembly workers.  It is, however, only realistic to recognise that the proximity of the date for termination of the special arrangements, the depressed state of the motor vehicle market world-wide, and the extremely poor international climate for new investment, are serious constraints on the industry.</P>

      <P>More than 50 research studies are being conducted under the four headings mentioned by the Deputy.  Details of the studies under way are contained in the annual publication by the National Board for Science and Technology entitled &ldquo;Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Projects Inventory&rdquo;, published in June 1982.</P>
      <P>The research and the development associated with new and unconventional sources of energy can take several years before detailed results are available and most of the Irish projects are still at the preliminary stage.  It is important to appreciate that, however promising alternative energy sources may be for the future, considerably more time and experience will be required to develop commercially viable equipment.  Of the areas mentioned by the Deputy, I feel that windpower and biomass are likely to be of most relevance in Irish conditions. It is in these areas that the larger part of our research moneys are being expended. In the areas of wave power and solar energy, we are keeping abreast of technology and contributing to international studies under the aegis of the International Energy Agency and the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress earlier I had been making the point that there would be a number of advantages in the earlier <Col N="908" /> presentation of financial information and proposals to the House and, while earlier presentation in itself would be a considerable advance on present practice on its own, this would not be a sufficient reform since the format and contents of the existing financial documentation would not provide Deputies with the kind of information needed for fully informed debate of the proposals.  Better information is a prerequisite to informed debate.  As the Discussion Paper, <i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances</i> made it clear, there is a need to improve both the amount and quality of information made available to the House on financial matters.  I recognise that I have a particular responsibility in this regard.</P>
      <P>Most developed countries now routinely produce annual public expenditure estimates in a presentation designed to highlight the most significant elements of public policy.  This, in essence, means a listing of expenditures according to classifications based on significant policy areas separately from accounting-type classifications.  The division of public expenditure into allocations on this basis facilitates the consideration of policy issues since these can be debated in the context of the relevant activity, or programme, such as agricultural subsidies, housing, or telecommunications development. In many cases annual expenditure plans are placed in the context of a multi-annual national plan containing projections on a longer time scale than that of the annual allocations.  This sets the framework of Government policy within which a rational approach to annual allocations is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With these considerations in mind my Department have been developing, separately from the Estimates, a comprehensive programme presentation aimed at highlighting the important areas of public expenditure, revealing the total financial commitment &mdash; not just the voted commitment, an important distinction &mdash; in those areas and supplying relevant supporting information, with particular emphasis on those areas where the existing Estimates volume provides little, if any, information &mdash; for example, in the case of the grants to the major agencies <Col N="909" /> where there is very little detailed information on the use that is to be made of the grants.  It is proposed to complete in the context of the 1983 Estimates a presentation of some 20 public expenditure programmes containing for each programme the following data:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I Summary of all attributable costs;</P>
    <P>II Description of the activity in question;</P>
    <P>III An indication of policy direction where appropriate;</P>
    <P>IV Details of activities with appropriate measures of performance, where feasible.</P>
    <P>That is being done, as I said, on the basis of the 1983 Estimates.  At the end, we will present an analysis of those Estimates according to this new presentation in a way which, I hope, will allow a better view to be taken and clearer insights to be gained into what kinds of programmes are involved, what the total expenditure is, what the balance between the different types of expenditure is and, indeed, giving us the basis to construct a measure of the performance of each programme.</P>
    <P>I hope to be in a position to publish the results of this pilot development in the near future.  The question of extending this type of presentation to the whole range of public expenditure can be considered in the light of reaction to the pilot presentation and I look forward to this, receiving the views of Deputies and other interested parties when it is published.  I might add that the views of Deputies in particular will be essential because they are the people who will be using this, we hope, in order to inform themselves more closely on the implications of proposals for public spending.  That will be necessary so that we can have a direct user view of the new presentation of the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Reforms aimed at streamlining the Government accounting system are under examination in my Department. <Col N="910" /> The principal document in which the Government's public expenditure proposals are laid before the House, the Estimates for the Public Services, or annual Estimates volume, is essentially an accounting document.  Its roots go back to the 19th century and it is designed, together with the Appropriation Accounts, to ensure accountability to the Dáil for the expenditure of public moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point for Deputy Lenihan that I am concerned with improving the total clarity of the expenditure proposals as they are laid before the Dáil so that in this House we can have a more informed and therefore a more useful discussion of the total volume of public moneys concerned.</P>
      <P>Since the Estimates are the basis for the final Appropriation Accounts they are of central importance to the system as a whole.  Care is therefore needed in approaching any revision of the structure of the volume.  The approval of the House will of course be sought through the Committee of Public Accounts before any changes are implemented in this area.  All financial and non-financial information in the Estimates is being examined to ensure a more balanced document in which a reasonable level of detail is provided on all major provisions. Among the reforms under consideration are:</P>
      <P>better structure of the Votes aimed at a more balanced overall presentation;</P>
      <P>the use, wherever possible, of standard expense classifications to streamline the accounting system;</P>
      <P>provision of more detailed information on many large block grants for which at present only very general data are presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the more streamlined system being developed will facilitate the control as well as the handling of public moneys so that the way will be open to <Col N="911" /> better financial management throughout the public sector using the techniques of modern management accounting.  In this context I am particularly concerned that the very large volume of spending now accounted for by the semi-State area should become more visible to the Dáil and the public generally.  I therefore attach great importance to the review of the budgeting, accounting and reporting arrangements of semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>My Department are at present considering what changes might usefully be made in the format and content of reports of State-sponsored bodies with the general objective of making more information available to Members of the Oireachtas and to the public about their operations and financial arrangements. In addition, my Department are examining the introduction of a system in which commercial State-sponsored bodies would prepare targets for their activities for future years and would submit regular reports giving details of their performance against those targets, including explanations for significant variations.</P>
    <P>For some ten years now we have resorted to deficit budgeting.  There have been repeated expressions of intent to reduce the current budget deficit, but on the whole, the outturns have not matched the aspirations.  The reasons for repeated failure in this regard are well known.  The fact is that growing expenditure is generally welcomed, taxation is deplored and borrowing, to the extent that it is considered at all, is almost regarded as being unrelated to the other two components of the equation.  Part of the difficulty at present may be that, in this House, expenditure and taxation are not debated together while borrowing and its purposes receive little detailed consideration. In the context of the kinds of deficits we have seen emerging in that period, that is a subject to which we should turn our attention urgently.</P>
    <P>Governments should be required to justify deficit budget proposals.  What is most important is that there should be full awareness of our financial situation and of what we can afford.  This House has a vital role to play and indeed a duty <Col N="912" /> to carry out in putting forward a coherent expression of our priorities in relation to spending and in examining the consequences of these priorities on the levels of taxation required to support a given level of expenditure, taking full account on both sides of the calculation of the constraints, both internal and external, relating to borrowing.  Deficit budgeting requires current taxpayers to fund decisions made in previous years, and to defer part of the cost of current spending and investment activities to taxpayers in the future years.  Its implications for financial management and for economic policy and its effects on our ability to conduct social policy in response to our developing needs are far greater than is generally recognised.</P>
    <P>The mechanisms for consideration by this House of public expenditure estimates and related matters will benefit from review and reform.  In developed countries generally the mechanism of the parliamentary committee, or committees, for consideration of spending proposals is normal.  Such a development would not be out of line in our context. The question of input to the Dáil by official sources arises in this context and it is one to which we shall have to give further consideration.  I am conscious of the need to avoid a growth in bureaucracy or red tape associated with the examination of Estimates, an already laborious process.  On the other hand, it is essential to the process of informed discussion that the participants have access to as much as possible of the background to the budgetary and expenditure data they are discussing.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis it is the duty of Government to make decisions regarding control of the public finances and this obligation cannot be evaded or delegated to others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, the contribution, the preparation and the approval of the decisions made by Government in this House need to be illuminated to the maximum extent possible. It is in that context that I am reviewing <Col N="913" /> these financial procedures in conjunction with the overall approval of the review of our parliamentary procedures that is being carried out by the Minister for Industry and Energy.</P>
      <P>In relation to the <i>post hoc</i> review of expenditure, I consider that the important role of the Comptroller and Auditor General must be reinforced as far as possible. If it were considered that his role required expansion I would be favourable to this but it remains to be seen to what extent this is actually necessary, given that the Comptroller and Auditor General already enjoys informally, if not statutorily, powers to identify waste and inefficiency and has the full support of the Public Accounts Committee in exercising those powers.  I trust that Deputies will direct attention to this aspect.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to say, as a Member of this House, that moves to bring about useful reforms will have my full support.  Elected representatives have a difficult job to do.  Many of the difficulties in their way are not fully recognised by the general public, a public which increasingly expects its elected representatives to carry out their legislative duties with greater despatch and efficiency. We owe it to the public and to ourselves as their elected representatives to bring about sensible and progressive reforms in the way we carry out our business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to begin this debate in the most constructive way possible. So far the whole tone of the debate, especially the last contribution, has been excellent.  I wish to make merely a few practical comments on how we can improve the procedures here in a realistic way.  In particular I have in mind our financial procedures which are central to the whole business of Government and which are central to the whole operation of the House.  In our efforts we must not forget that at the end of the day the buck stops with the Government whoever they may be at any time.  Governments are the people who must make the decisions and consequently, that consideration is central to the whole issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever we do here as parliamentarians <Col N="914" /> must be regarded essentially as a kind of subsidiary or advisory function in that regard.  I have no objection whatever to that.  The more we have of it the better but it is a fundamental principle that the ultimate decision must reside in the elected Government.  If we begin departing from that we will be entering a shilly-shally situation in which there is not a decision-making process working to its fulfilment.  Fundamentally, what we are all concerned about in a representative democracy is electing people who will come here and elect a Government. By reason of the system of election this may not have been satisfactory in recent times but that is another day's work. Regardless of the manner in which the Government of the day are elected, they are the ones who must carry out these functions.</P>
    <P>I do not envisage any reform working out other than in an advisory or consultative way.  I am not knocking the idea but it must be put into perspective and we must end up with a consultative and advisory procedure in regard to decision-making.  Such procedure would not have any function other than advisory and consultative.  That should be made very clear because that is what democracy is about.  In this context I have in mind some dangerous phrases such as that in the speech of the Minister for Finance in which he said that Governments should be required to justify deficit budget proposals and that what is most important is that there should be full awareness of our financial situation and of what we can afford.  That is part of politics.  It is why we are here, regardless of which party we represent.  Political decisions of that kind are matters for us.  They are not matters for people who are not accountable through us to the public.  Civil Servants are excellent people.  I have travelled a fair deal and I am confident that we have the finest civil servants in the world but the ultimate political decisions reside here.  We must have the maximum advice possible from the civil service in making political decisions but I would not agree with any committee system that would in any way intrude on or obstruct the basic decision-making process of politicians <Col N="915" /> elected to Government, regardless of which party or parties may form the Government.  When politicians elected by the people draw back from that situation it is very serious.  As far as civil service and the media are concerned it is very important that we get our priorities right.  At the end of the day we, the elected representatives, are the people to legislate.  The day we pass these powers to the civil service, semi-State bodies or the media, is the time the people will ask why we were elected.</P>
    <P>I believe in the politician, no matter who he is.  I believe in his right to stand up in the parliament and express his views.  When we pass our powers to any outside body, democracy will be in jeopardy and open to question.  If we pass our powers to the civil service, the media or any other body, we will make ourselves redundant.  This matter should be looked at very seriously.</P>
    <P>I agree with improving the procedures of this House but that could be done within the ambit of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I have no objection to the establishment of any committee to examine reforms of Dáil procedure but I object to the thinking and philosophy behind this motion.</P>
    <P>I am speaking as a democrat and a politician.  I believe in the practice of politics.  As practising politicians we play a very important role: we are not elected to run messages from one Department or another.  We can play our role properly so long as we do not give to any other body powers that should reside only with the duly elected Government.  We should do something constructive in this area while maintaining our priorities.  Neither this, nor any other committee should try to take the legislative powers of this House.  We cannot have a committee making financial decisions while the Government are also making such decisions too.  That could be very dangerous. I am in favour of setting up a committee who know their terms of reference but not a committee set up as an alternative Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been watching the workings of the Dáil as a Member for about 20 months and previous to that for a period in excess of 20 years when I watched it from the vantage point of the Press Gallery.  Naturally one's priorities change during the transition from one area to the other.  I do not want a crisis every day now.</P>
      <P>Whatever one's vantage point in watching the Dáil, the most obvious deficiency, not necessarily the most important, is the absence of clear-cut, beyond question, undisputed procedures by which one can get current issues of national importance onto the floor of the House for adequate debate.  That is the single most glaring deficiency.  It can be got, at times, through agreement or it can be dragged on by skilful debate or subterfuge of one sort or another, but even then it is not on for adequate discussion. What is needed, and what I hope will come out of this debate, is a very clear-cut procedure whereby any person can get on the floor issues of national importance, as of right, for adequate debate.</P>
      <P>Nothing is more damaging as far as the image of the Dáil is concerned or more likely to make it irrelevant in the minds of the people than the fact that we cannot have discussed current issues of importance which are being discussed in every forum throughout the country &mdash; along the bar counters, on television and right along the line &mdash; but not in this Parliament. The need for reform in this area has been accelerated by the astonishing and very quick developments that are taking place in communications.  This is the era of the instant comment with full colour pictures from outside the Dáil, and perhaps from other parliaments, on issues of vital importance to Ireland but which cannot be brought onto the floor of the House because of present procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I have seen over the years is Opposition parties in particular fulminating about this, totally frustrated because they genuinely cannot get onto the floor of the House issues of this nature. One would expect, once the transition was made to the Government benches, <Col N="917" /> and they were in a position to do something about it, that this would be their first reform.  However, it then fades into the background and is no longer a priority, certainly has not been up to now. There may, of course, be a reason for that.  The net beneficiaries of being able to bring up these issues, by their very nature, are the Opposition of the day. Certainly, the net loser in this is very much the Parliament, because it becomes totally irrelevant in the minds of the people when these high profile issues cannot figure in the House.  I hope that the result will be speedy remedial action in this case.  As Deputy Lenihan said, judging from the general tenor of the present debate, reform in that area will have the support of all sides.</P>
    <P>The second area of reform which I would like to see has nothing to do with the rules of procedure as such, but much more to do with the political parties.  We have now a very traditional approach in the House.  Once a Minister has outlined the Government's position, then, with minor changes of emphasis perhaps, invariably Members supporting the Government take virtually the same line, by and large.  Once the spokesman for the Opposition has given his point of view &mdash; let it be for or against the legislation being discussed &mdash; generally speaking, the Opposition take the same stance.</P>

      <P>It adds an air of insincerity to the Parliament, something of the atmosphere of the L. and H., where <Col N="918" /> points are made for the sake of debate, perhaps for the sake of the national or provincial press, or, worst of all, to fill the space because the Dáil happens to be continuing until 7.30 p.m. or 8.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>The parties can do something about this by taking a much more liberal or open attitude in this respect.  Then a Deputy who is behind his or her Government or Opposition front bench can make a point which is in contradiction or contrast to the point being made by the front bench man and is not regarded automatically as being disloyal to his or her party.  One very important way in which this can be encouraged is by having far more free votes in the House.  We would thus have a far more significant input into the current legislation.  Once the legislation was introduced, it would not be taken as going through, without the possibility of any change.  We might then have legislation more in conformity with the wishes of the people than at present.  Civil servants, as the Deputy has mentioned, are excellent people, but they need not have the total right to reading the legislation from the start. There can be amendments, there can be adjustments.  If one had the type of debate of which I am speaking, these would be much more likely to occur than with the prevailing atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate, other than the contributions by the Minister for Finance and Deputy Lenihan, previously focused, and rightly so, on the rules, procedures and Standing Orders of the House.  As everyone who has listened to the procedures of the Dáil knows, these are an on-going source of contention.  They are open to different interpretations by different people and, indeed, by the same person, depending upon the side of the House from which he is speaking.  This is very understandable, because, in particular, the precedents have been built up in an haphazard fashion, many under pressure and without very mature consideration. We must face the fact that like our Constitution, these are showing their age, becoming a little tattered at the edges. Many of the laws governing the procedure of the House were made for a Dáil of a different time which did not, to any <Col N="919" /> degree &mdash; such as the Government does now &mdash; impinge on the everyday life of the citizen.  In this case we could attempt, if we wished, to do a piecemeal amendment. However, we should, arising out of this debate and, of course, with all-party agreement, tackle the whole body of regulations governing the functions of the House and write them anew with a view to the current situation and what the 24th Dáil is all about in the eighties. Possibly, we could achieve the same results by piecemeal amendment, but a much better and braver approach would be to wipe the slate clean and have a new set of regulations governing the working of the House.</P>
    <P>Another fundamental problem arises, which was, indeed, touched on by several Deputies whose contributions I heard &mdash; it is that most Deputies now can really only give token recognition and application to the actual job for which they have been elected &mdash; the role of legislators. The volume of constituency work for the average TD prevents his or her giving any worthwhile application to the job of legislator, in the House certainly it prevents him or her from doing any worthwhile research.  It is only fair to say &mdash; and most Members will totally agree &mdash; that the results of debates show a lack of research work on the part of Deputies.  As a consequence, they fail to have the input into legislation which they might otherwise have.  Unfortunately this situation cannot be mended by improving the rules and procedures.  There is no automatic solution to this problem.  One possible solution mentioned earlier in the debate, and an improvement anyhow, would be to have the transferable vote, single seat system.  Another way would be through the list system as operated occasionally in many countries on the Continent, whereby there would be people who would devote all their time to legislative work, without needing to look over their shoulders at what the Opposition might be doing in their constituency, or indeed what their own colleagues might be doing, equally or more important.</P>
    <P>That there is no obvious solution to this problem does not mean that we <Col N="920" /> should not at least try, arising out of this discussion on reform of the Dáil.  It is possibly one area in which we could have had a citizen's advice bureau through which the electorate could become better acquainted with their rights, rather than giving their Dáil Deputies a lot of what is, in fact, unnecessary work.  If we cannot find a solution in that area, we should get more secretarial help for Dáil Deputies. Until recently Deputies had to share a secretary.  We have now proceeded to the point where we have one secretary for each Dáil Deputy.  In passing, we should pay tribute to the present leader of the Opposition, the former Taoiseach, for introducing the idea, which was long overdue, of one secretary for each Deputy.</P>
    <P>If we cannot get any solution we must face the situation.  Dáil Deputies are now totally overburdened with constituency work.  As they become more professional and better at it, unfortunately the work multiplies.  Indeed, I am not sure that the work has not multiplied arising out of the availability of secretaries to Dáil Deputies.  This is an area which must be tackled.  In present circumstances there is no way a Deputy can even do the minimum work demanded of him in his constituency while applying himself to the role of legislator in the manner in which he should be applying himself to that role.  Unless a Deputy does his work in his constituency he will very quickly have neither role.</P>
    <P>The idea of broadcasting the workings of the Dáil has emerged in this debate. My belief is that, whatever our present attitudes &mdash; and generally they seem to be favourable &mdash; that is inevitable.  That is the way things are proceeding on an international level, that whether we like it or not there will be parliamentary broadcasting.  Therefore, rather than have the inevitable result forced on us we should take the initiative in this respect and accept the fact.  It is not a very simple matter and will not be of automatic benefit to the Dáil.  Our overall objective in the long term should be to strive for a situation in which there would be an electronic version, if you like, of the Official Report, the entire proceedings of the <Col N="921" /> Dáil going out live, perhaps first on radio to be followed later by television.  This is the system as it operates in many parliaments throughout the world.  The leaders in this field appear to be the Canadian Parliament.  But at present RTE would not have sufficient airways to make this possible.  Therefore an intermediate stage obviously would be to have sections broadcast, perhaps the broadcast of Question Time in its entirety, with perhaps edited versions of some debates. Our overall objective should not be anything below the total broadcast of the entire Dáil proceedings.  In a very significant way this would bring democracy to the people when there would probably be a substantial interest shown by the electorate.</P>
    <P>When we reach the stage of broadcasting Dáil proceedings we shall be traversing a minefield, especially if edited versions of proceedings are going out, delicate on an inter-party basis and within the parties themselves.</P>
    <P>There is then the question of who will control these broadcasts.  In the Canadian Parliaments the person in control is one's counterpart, the Speaker of the House. He is the man in charge overall.  There is there a combination of the broadcasting people and the Parliament.  But in that case the overall control rests with the Speaker of the House.  The broadcasting people act only as carriers, if you like.  In their case they are able to avoid a lot of potential difficulties because of the many channels available to them and the fact that most of their broadcasts go out live in their entirety.  In fact the control rests with the parliamentary broadcasting unit. This might or might not be acceptable in our case.  The broadcasting regulations applicable to the House of Commons are somewhat different from that.  This is an area which will have to be examined. However we should take the initiative as far as this House is concerned, accept the fact that we will have broadcasting, accept that it can be a very good thing for Parliament.  If there is to be an all-party committee on Dáil Reform then a sub-Committee should be established immediately with a view to working out the mechanics of the introduction of broadcasting. <Col N="922" /> Properly handled on all sides it can be of advantage to the House but warrants very careful preliminary consideration.</P>
    <P>We are afforded now an excellent opportunity of making the Dáil more relevant. It will require courage and total reform of the Standing Orders and the procedures governing our practices here. Major reforms are necessary, something accepted by all sides and there is at present a mood in favour of such reforms being introduced fairly quickly.  The 24th Dáil could establish its reputation for many reasons, perhaps by being the longest Dáil; it could do so also by virtue of good, reforming government.  This Dáil could play a significant role if it becomes known as the Dáil that reformed itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to and read some of the contributions to this debate there appears to be unanimity on the necessity to introduce certain Dáil reforms.  Many Deputies have expressed the difficulties they have encountered in their experience.  I was somewhat disappointed that the Minister of State who preceded me did not mention that it was the former Minister for the Public Service who helped to provide those secretaries for Deputies.  I do appreciate that they were needed and certainly they are worked to the fullest extent.  A heavier workload is but one of the problem with which we must contend.</P>
      <P>I remember making my maiden speech in this House on, I think, a Posts and Telegraphs Estimate.  Those Estimates when discussed here were irrelevant because we were then discussing an Estimate at the tail end of a year when obviously no matter what comments were made they would not change the emphasis on where that money was spent in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last Government worked very hard to have the Estimates ready for discussion in the last autumn session.  Events dictated otherwise.  But it is true to say that it was the first time that Estimates were put before the public at that time of the year.  They were not an election issue on the basis of being controversial to any great extent but they had been prepared <Col N="923" /> and were accepted as having been prepared and published, which constituted a major step forward.  I look forward to this Government continuing in that vein. It is extremely important that they be prepared early enough to be discussed in the course of the autumn session.  At least it affords Members on all sides of the House an opportunity to make suggestions in times of financial stringency. Nobody wants to increase taxation nowadays. We see if there are services which are expendable or areas where expenditure could be reduced.  However, we must not err too far on the other side.  If we endeavour to bring the Estimates in too far in advance there is a danger of greater inaccuracy and bureaucracy.  This would defeat the purpose of having reasonably accurate Estimates before the House which could be discussed by all sides.  The Government of the day could take the points made into consideration. While in Government we made substantial progress in this respect.</P>
    <P>I have some experience of the committee system.  It has many advantages.  We are at one across the House on the need for reform although we may differ slightly on points of detail.  The committee system was used more in the period 1973-77 than in the 1977-81 period.  The experience was mixed, perhaps for the reason advanced by the Minister of State Deputy Nealon, the workload of Deputies. The problem of contending with the essentials for re-election &mdash; catering for constituents and doing constituency work &mdash; and contributing here and in committees is a serious one.  Any day of the week there are deputations, meetings, representations and visits to Departments. This must be taken into consideration in the working life of Members.  There was difficulty in getting a quorum in some committees.</P>
    <P>If there is not a great commitment to the committee system and if Members are overworked and unable to accommodate the system it would not be a solution.  We must be careful to work towards easing the constituency workload of TDs.  I do not say that there should be less work for TDs.  The TD, <Col N="924" /> often criticised by the press no matter what party he belongs to, fufils a public need.  People come to us with problems and that is a tribute to the trust and confidence they have in us.  It is unfair to say that they come to get this and that done.  They come for advice, to have their entitlements explained to them and so on.  We provide a very useful and interesting, if at times demanding, service to the public.</P>
    <P>How can we ease that burden?  I am sure the Government have not yet adopted any changes in plans but it is important to decentralise Government services.  We cannot discuss Dáil reform without talking about the growth of the public service.  In clinics at weekends we often get warning signs of problems in different Departments whether it is late payments from the Department of Social Welfare or a delay in payment of grants from the Department of Agriculture. Even if we start now it will be a long time before we bring Government down to the people and give them confidence to go to local employment exchanges and to local agricultural offices to push their complaints harder.  The service given by TDs to the public is useful and not easily replaced.  Through their constituency work TDs become aware of difficulties arising during the life of any Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister commented on the State-sponsored bodies sector.  Over the years successive Governments have given independence to State bodies and boards.  Some have been extremely successful but not so others.  During Question Time, Ministers have defended their position and said responsibility rests with the various boards.  It is important that we have the correct link between the democratically elected Government and the need of the community.  Who knows the need of the community better than those of us who have been elected to this House and who depend for re-election on the people we represent?  No group of people can judge the needs of those in Cork, Sligo, Leitrim and so on better than those elected to represent them. Members from a particular area have a vested interest in seeing that that area is <Col N="925" /> served because they have to face the ballot box and render an account of their stewardship.</P>
    <P>I favour the committee system.  A great step forward was taken with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies which allowed Members to examine in depth the activities of these bodies and have before it the senior people of these bodies, hear their opinions and, hopefully, get a receptive response from them.  I should like to see the committee system developed further and improved.  However, there must be commitment to it.  Deputies representing different parts of the country have a difficult task commuting to and from Dublin weekly.  I am not so badly off coming from Cork.  Yesterday morning's tragic death of one of the Members on this side was an example of the hazards that involves.  There is also the question of time and risk involved.  What I said regarding information and warning signs is probably more relevant to the out-of-Dublin situation that it is to the Dublin situation as many of the Departmental offices are closer to the Dublin person. That is not to say that problems do not arise.</P>
    <P>The committee system has a number of advantages.  Too often we try to score political points.  We are concerned how certain points of view would be received by our constituents and we ask why we should concede that some good ideas can emanate from the other side of the House.  In committees we have a more subdued and constructive approach and we are less in the public eye.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I did not hear the Deputy's contribution this morning but I know he has espoused this subject and has spoken on it at length over the years.  He has a commitment to Dáil reform and I am glad of the opportunity to discuss this subject so early in the life of this Dáil.  The previous Government made a major advance in the preparation of the Estimates at a time when discussion on them would have <Col N="926" /> been relevant but unfortunately the opportunity did not present itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be glad to concede that the previous Government were the first to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This is not a political debate because we are at one on the need for reform.  We may differ on points of detail but these are technicalities rather than major difficulties.</P>
      <P>I have no great objection to broadcasting the proceedings of this House so that there is a greater awareness among the public of its role.  There are risks.  The broadcast could not be edited because all of us would scream that we were being treated unfairly and the people responsible could not live with that.  There is also the risk that people might try to use broadcasts for their own advancement and that would not lead to greater involvement in legislative procedures. Politicians are not shy when it comes to publicity; the opposite is the case.  There are also many reasons why Members may not be available in the House.  We must become involved in meeting our constituents and various deputations.  If broadcasting becomes a reality I hope it will not affect contributions in a harmful way or lead to the expression of views designed for public consumption.</P>
      <P>My first speech in this House was on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I was told to carry on for about 20 minutes.  It did not appear to be a matter of what positive contribution I could make but rather a matter of keeping to a specific time.  That should be changed because it has tended to make politicians longwinded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the point made by Deputy Kelly illustrates one of our biggest problems.  He gives the impression that the man who is now a member of the European Parliament should be disliked by those opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I mean it is a good thing for a Whip not to make enemies easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there was a good relationship between Deputy Lalor and Deputy Kelly when they were both Whips.  Those holding such positions are aware of the improvements which could be effected in Dáil procedures.</P>
      <P>Question Time provides a great opportunity for Opposition speakers to highlight problems and get the maximum publicity. That is an important part of democracy.  It has been suggested that more time should be allowed for parliamentary questions but it is important that they should be relevant to the problems of the time.  We were a very disciplined Opposition in the 1973-1977 period and succeeded in limiting the number of questions on the Order Paper so that relevant questions would not be so far down the list as to be outdated by the time they were reached.  An important question may not be reached for several weeks and reform is obviously necessary.</P>
      <P>I must express criticism of the then Opposition during the previous Dáil. Their performance on the Order of Business was of circus proportions and there was competition as to who would get the best headlines.  Such behaviour is not right but there is a need for the ability to introduce a relevant topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my colleagues referred last week to the burden of constituency work and the competition created by multi-seat constituencies.  The amount of work probably varies depending on the strength of that competition.  It is too late now for any changes in the type of constituencies or in the electoral system.  It is not something that would be easily <Col N="928" /> achieved.  There is no doubt that the changes mooted in the House last week would lead to a greater emphasis on legislation and the activities of the House. We have an obligation to strive towards reform and updating and modernising our institutions.  Democracy must be preserved. Pure democracy is scarce enough in the world today and we must strive to preserve it.  We must ensure that our people realise it is not outdated or archaic.  We must be brief in our contributions also.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister who has been given responsibility for Dáil reform well in his efforts.  To suggest that we should make more use of the committee system is wise but we must experiment first.  We must have trial runs.  We are governed by Standing Orders, precedent and procedure; but whatever about them we should be able to change to cater for the needs of the day.  The most important needs of the country are the creation of jobs, catering for our growing population, a spreading of the tax burden so as to lessen the load on some sectors of the community and looking after the underprivileged. We have a responsibility to adjust the procedures of the House to ensure that those matters are dealt with in an urgent, efficient and flexible manner. That is why I welcome the opportunity to discuss Dáil reform.  We must have trial periods for proposed changes so that if they do not work efficiently they can be changed.  It would be bad if we carried out reforms now only to find that later we are bound by decisions that would strangle or obstruct us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a relatively new Member of the House and most of my experience in political life has been outside. My view of the Dáil must be taken in conjunction with what it appeared to be during the years I was slowly making my way to this House and the situation I found when I was elected a Member. Most of the young people I met in Macra na Feirme, Young Fine Gael and voluntary organisations down the years looked to the Dáil as the focal point of Irish politics.  They felt that the Dáil was the only institution that had the power to <Col N="929" /> change matters.  Those people in their own groups wanted power to change things to make them more relevant to the needs of the day and to correct the injustices in society.  Those who aspired to become Members of the House felt that in the Dáil they would have the power to institute changes.  It must be disappointing for those who have been elected Members, without having a knowledge of how the system operates, to discover when they come here that power is almost as elusive as ever.</P>
      <P>A year ago I discussed my position as a member of two Parliaments with colleagues in the European Parliament and it was suggested to me that I should stay in the European Parliament because the facilities there were better and it was a nicer place to work.  It was also pointed out to me that the European Parliament was important to Ireland because of agriculture.  While I accepted that the development of agriculture would be more influenced by decisions at European level than at home I expressed the view that what was done in this House was more relevant to the everyday needs of my constituents.  My friend went on to point out that there was not power in the local Parliament.  Having been a member of the Bundestag for 12 years my friend said he found that there was no power in that Parliament either.  We must adjust in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is less power in the Chamber than there is in the party rooms of the political parties.  Certainly, there is more power in the party room of the group that happens to be in office than there is in the Chamber.  In theory the power may rest in the Chamber but in reality it is more concentrated in the party room. The ultimate power is with the Cabinet. We should seek to change this situation. We must initiate changes so that backbench Members will have more input into legislation.  We do not realise how important this power is.  The percentage of GDP administered by the Government increases annually.  Today the Government administer in the region of 57 per cent of our GDP.  In that regard we are the third highest in Europe &mdash; only the Netherlands and Denmark are higher.  In <Col N="930" /> Britain the Government administer 40 per cent of GDP.  The effect this power can have on the lives of citizens can be underestimated but yet most of the time we allow the situation to drift.</P>
    <P>In the years when we had a high annual growth rate we floated with the tide of economic growth and expansion experienced by neighbouring countries with whom we traded.  When the recession came we dropped faster and deeper than most countries and that happened because we were not ready.  We did not seem to have at our disposal the means to readjust our policies quickly and put things right.  Our unemployment situation has been worsening in recent years but we could have reacted to that problem in a better way.  If we had another system of Government giving greater freedom and scope to Deputies we might have been able to readjust our economic sails to maintain the course we wanted to stay on in the recent stormy years.</P>
    <P>I would like to see backbench Deputies have a greater opportunity to make contributions. People believe that the Cabinet prepare legislation behind closed doors after consulting with civil servants. There is a general feeling that civil servants have more input than Ministers and Cabinet.  The fact is that the Cabinet have the power but, because of the manner in which legislation is prepared for presentation, the public have not got a clear perception of how the Cabinet work.</P>
    <P>If we had some sort of committee system there would be room for initiatives by individuals who could propose legislation. That legislation could be taken to the relevant committee and debated and perhaps amended.  This could all be done in a much more relaxed and informal manner than it is done in this House where every word spoken must be considered carefully in the light of the effect it will have on the image of the speaker, and on public opinion.  If we had an informal committee system, individuals could speak their minds more clearly and discuss the pros and cons of the legislation, instead of being obliged to support blindly whatever is suggested by the party leader or the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>We could readjust the legislation to the <Col N="931" /> requirements of the times and we could do this more quickly and more efficiently. As somebody suggested, we might have free votes in this House.  No side of the House has a monopoly of wisdom or concern. We could leave it to the wisdom of the House to make decisions on legislation. This would not take power from the Government.  The Government need not necessarily lay their reputation on the line on every matter which comes before the House.  I appreciate that the Government will have their own policies to pursue and their proposals to make on important issues, and the future of the Government may well depend on whether they get their proposals through. On other occasions we could have a more relaxed attitude and rely on the collective wisdom of elected representatives.</P>
    <P>On two occasions recently the budget came before the House shortly after a general election.  Newly elected Deputies with very little experience had to support what was proposed to them three or four minutes earlier.  They did not have a chance to assess its merits or to understand what effect it would have.  They did not know what it was all about.  The budgetary procedure is very important in view of the fact that 57 per cent of the entire production of the State is administered by the Government.  The budgetary procedure has an important bearing on the direction of our economy and how it performs. This procedure should take much longer.</P>
    <P>Early in the year we should start to lay the foundations for the budget of the following year.  We should look at the performance of the economy in the light of the budgetary procedures of the previous year, how much taxation was coming in and what next year's budget should be, instead of coming in with proposals at the last moment which have to be taken for better or worse, and decisions taken by a busy Cabinet with a crowded agenda.  At the moment we know that automatically one side of the House will vote for these proposals and the other will vote against.</P>
    <P>If we had a committee system the Minister for Finance could consult with the <Col N="932" /> budgetary experts of any political party and discuss proposed changes in taxation, prepare documents for consideration by the Government and prepare a draft Bill. In the end we would have much more constructive budgetary procedures when the final proposals were made.  At the end of the year when the money was spent, it might be a good idea to have a procedure by which Deputies could comment on how things had gone.  Parliament could then discuss fully the performance of the economy, where the money came from, how it was spent, and where we had failed to realise the expected revenue. Such a debate would be very useful.</P>
    <P>We cannot divorce the position of individual Deputies and their performance in the House from their everyday life in their constituencies.  This subject has arisen very often before.  I remember meeting a rural Deputy some years ago. He was at the end of his political career and he told me he was inundated with requests for assistance and with representations at his clinics for letters to be written.  He said that when he became a Member of this House 20 years earlier, he listened to debates for hours at a time, and he did not have nearly the same amount of pressure from people calling to see him with questions and representations. In the meantime the Government have involved themselves at an ever-increasing rate in the lives of the people. When that man was first elected planning permission was not required.  There were not the same number of grants available. The system has become clogged and people have to come to their Deputies for assistance.</P>
    <P>In the area of social welfare much could be done to reduce the number of schemes and the administrative costs and complications involved.  One would need to be a computer to remember all the social welfare assistance and supplementary schemes and all the personnel involved in their administration.  A good committee should be able to reduce the number of schemes by half.  Because of the lobbying of pressure groups and vested interests over the years we have added to the system until it has become extraordinarily complicated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> With regard to the Department of Agriculture, I remember when you could tell a farmer how to apply for schemes and aids available.  Today the proportion of the budget spent on agriculture is much less than it was.  It is down to 4 per cent from 14 per cent ten years ago.  A vast number of civil servants are now involved in a vast number of schemes.  This is wasteful of administrative personnel and of money, and is not in the best interests of the agricultural industry.  Large numbers of people ask their public representatives to inquire about their rights, and sometimes we have to chase small irrelevant assistance schemes which could be made easier to implement by some other administrative means.  I welcome the introduction of secretaries and typists but, on the other hand, no young person with shorthand and typing qualifications can carry out the task of investigating the vast number of problems which come to us.  One needs to be an expert in every area of government to deal with these matters unless we behave like civil servants and write evasive letters.</P>
    <P>We must streamline our administrative system and set a time limit for Government Departments to reply to applications for various schemes for assistance, grants and so on.  I realise it will not be an easy problem to solve.  Very often people walk into a public office to request a telephone or an application form for the Garda or some other matter and public servants often tell these applicants that it would not do any harm to have a word with a politician.  I do not mind a person coming to me looking for a job but I resent a public servant, who should know better, advising people to come to me.  I have met people who have had housing grants turned down because the work was not of a sufficiently high standard to qualify and an inspector has told that person that maybe he should have a word with a public representative.  The inspector is the person who has the responsibility to make that decision and we must all try hard to explain to the public, without offending them, where politicians can help and where they cannot.  By degrees we should introduce some sort of restrictions <Col N="934" /> on canvassing so that everybody will understand our position.  People should be made to understand that they do not need to know a public representative to get a job and that the system is fair and equitable.  To my knowledge, the element of political pull hardly exists.  I try to tell people this but, nevertheless, I have to spend a lot of time making representations for my constituents when I should be in this House being stimulated by other people's opinions, making suggestions and, within the system, seeking to have the Government introduce legislation which will improve and change matters which need to be changed.</P>
    <P>During the recent election campaign, many people said they must exercise restraint and work a bit harder but that Deputies should reduce their own salaries and give a lead to the rest of the country.  I never had to depend entirely on a Dáil salary because I have a job in another parliament but I would like to speak for Deputies who do not have another source of income.  Deputies with young families have been forced to contest three elections in the past year and the public generally may not be sufficiently conscious of how costly that has been for the average young Deputy who is a fulltime politician and who has spent a lot of his own money seeking to be elected to this Parliament.  There were travelling and postal expenses and they had to make sacrifices in order to stand for election.  I would love to see leadership being given by Deputies in this regard but I do not think they could afford a drop in income.  Deputies often have to travel a hundred miles at the weekend to attend in other constituencies and to represent the parliamentary party because they feel this contact is necessary and healthy.  Contrary to the general belief that the Deputy has a great life, a good income and the best of everything, I believe that wages and conditions of work are at the very minimum you could offer to anybody in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>We should seek to create the structure and the atmosphere here in which those individuals can give the sort of service to the people who elect them.  We could <Col N="935" /> improve on it immensely, because far too many of us spend too much time doing things that could be done by someone who does not have a mandate to represent or to legislate.  Most of us spend far too little time in this House and do not sufficiently understand the procedures. This should not be a political issue and I have been very encouraged by the sanity and the calmness with which this whole debate has been discussed.  I sincerely hope that everybody intends to pursue this through to the stage when we can begin to change those structures and to create a flexibility where we will be able to readjust our thinking and our policies at short notice in a world which is rapidly changing.  Problems of immense importance can occur very suddenly and we should be able to readjust our laws and our system at short notice.  The vast majority of people in this House are inclined to take this task very seriously.</P>

      <P>Like many previous speakers, I would like to compliment the Leader of the House, Deputy John Bruton, for introducing this motion.  This House has served the nation well over 60 years and it is appropriate that we should now examine what goes on here because often reference is made inside and outside the House to the relevance of Dáil Éireann in the eighties.  Not alone should the Dáil be relevant, it should be seen to be relevant by those outside.  One of the reasons why people do not see the Dáil as being relevant is that over the last 20 years, other groups from outside the House have exercised a lot of influence. We have seen examples where Governments met outside pressure groups and, following their meetings, perhaps changed an item of policy.  Any change in policy, particularly with regard to financial matters, should be announced first to this House.  That would help to make it more relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the questions Members of this House ask themselves when speaking here is: to whom are they speaking?  Are they speaking to the Chair, to Members on the opposite benches, to the Gallery, to the nation, to their constituents or to <Col N="936" /> the Press Gallery?  The probable answer is that at various times we are speaking to each of the groups I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartin referred to the input of backbench Deputies.  There is a tradition that a Bill is not circulated to the parliamentary government party until it is published and circulated to the House. I think the broad headings of a Bill should be discussed by the parliamentary party before it is published.  If that were done the Minister concerned and the Government might receive some useful suggestions with regard to the legislation and this could be of some considerable benefit.</P>
    <P>Deputies expected that the pro-life amendment would be taken today but we discovered at 10.30 a.m. that was changed and that item was not on the Order of Business.  If Deputies were given more notice of what would be taken on a particular day more of them would be prepared to contribute to the debate. When our Whip, Deputy Ahern, was speaking in the debate he said that on occasion Members were sent in to speak for 45 minutes to keep the debate going. I think there should be shorter contributions. The former Deputy Horgan, who is now in the European Parliament, told us at a committee meeting that the average speech in the European Parliament takes seven minutes.  He said there is always a queue of speakers waiting to contribute and one is not allowed to continue for longer than seven minutes.  He told us that he had often spoken in this House for one hour or more but he found when he went to Europe he had to condense the important points he wished to make.  He found it was possible to do that.  I am not suggesting that speeches here be confined to seven minutes but in response to the suggestion that we have a longer working week, with the House sitting on Fridays, I suggest we try to do more business on the three days during which the Dáil sits.</P>
    <P>The budget is a statement of financial policy.  Probably it is not as relevant now as it was 20 years ago.  In the past there was only one budget in the year but many people would say that the pattern over a number of years has been to have many <Col N="937" /> budgets during a year.  In a sense budget day has lost its relevance and I think that is a pity.  Apart from legislating, our most important function concerns the expenditure of money and obviously Government financial policy is important.  The introduction of new taxes and borrowing proposals are important items and they should be told to Members of this House once a year on budget day.  Perhaps it might be more relevant to budget for five years because of the necessity to have forward planning.  Local authorities and health boards do not always get their allocation from central government in time to ensure that they get the best results.</P>
    <P>The committee system works relatively well and it is possible to get a quorum for the various committees.  Suggestions have been made that more committees be established but if there are too many committees it might be difficult to get Members to attend.  If a Deputy has to sit on several committees he may not be able to give them the attention they deserve.  I am in favour of the committee system but where an issue is of major public importance we should have a full and frank debate in this Chamber in which all Members could participate rather than have that important issue discussed in a committee and then presented to this House.</P>
    <P>The question of a free vote is worth considering.  Personally I believe we should have a free vote on all issues except on budgetary matters and on votes of confidence or, alternatively, have a system similar to what we have in our parliamentary party where we decide on the matter at the parliamentary party meeting and then all vote in one way.  I do not think the image of the Dáil is improved by having a free vote on a controversial issue and by not having a free vote on a non-contentious issue.</P>
    <P>Much has been said during the debate about parliamentary questions.  We are unhappy at the time we have to wait for answers from Ministers who are far down on the list.  Perhaps something could be done to improve matters.  The Adjournment debate is a method of raising matters of urgent public importance but this <Col N="938" /> takes place late at night.  Rather than having the Dáil sit on Fridays perhaps it might sit on Tuesday mornings during which Private Members' business and the Adjournment debates could take place.</P>
    <P>The number of parliamentary questions is a matter of concern to everybody not alone the Members in the House but the officials in the various Departments who have to answer them.  Last Wednesday, the day this debate opened, there were 1,000 questions on the Order Paper. Half of those questions were to Ministers in two Departments, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Social Welfare.  Most of the questions related to the payment of grants and benefits. This matter must be taken up very urgently by the Government.  They must ask why it is that so many questions are being put down to those two Departments about the payment of benefits and grants.  A constituent waits a reasonable time before coming to his or her TD. Most of the TDs' queries are done through the post and only a small percentage of them get on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>I feel that the answer in both Departments is more decentralisation.  I do not see any reason why in the eighties the files in relation to new housing grants and home improvement grants for County Monaghan should be retained in Dublin. I am sure office accommodation is a lot more expensive in the centre of Dublin than it is in one of the towns in my constituency. I believe that if we had decentralisation these applications would be processed more speedily and efficiently. This would reduce the number of parliamentary questions and would give the public servants more time to work on other matters.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the social welfare questions.  Most of those questions relate to the delay in payments.  I have to admit that in relation to some of them the applicant has not sent in the number or has not sent in the right number.  Not-withstanding that there are still delays. The questions which reach the Order Paper are only a small percentage of the total number of queries which come through the Department of Social Welfare. I believe decentralisation would go <Col N="939" /> a long way towards improving the situation. If a constituent could go into his or her local office, perhaps have the relevant information with him or her and get the reason why there is a delay in payment, this would go a long way towards streamlining the system and would take a lot of the questions off the Order Paper.  If the questions relating to benefits and grants were eliminated from the Order Paper we would have Ministers coming in much more frequently to answer relevant important questions to other Departments.</P>
    <P>We all agree that constituency work takes up far too much of our time here. This has been improved by the secretarial and research assistance which are available now.  More staff in the research area might be a help.  With regard to the time of Deputies taken up with constituency work, I believe the only answer to that in the long term is electoral reform.  Deputy Fitzgerald spoke about it and said that it would be in the long term before we saw any effort made to change the manner in which Deputies are elected from the multi-seat constituencies.  The multi-seat constituency puts undue pressure on all Deputies in it.  My constituency stretches almost from the east coast near Dundalk to the west coast, approximately 13 miles from Sligo.  Five Members are in that constituency.  It is impossible for the five Deputies to give attention to every part of the constituency.  If they are not giving attention to every part of the constituency there is a good case for having smaller constituencies.</P>
    <P>I believe we should again look at the question of single seat constituencies perhaps with a transferable vote.  Each Member would then be elected for one area only.  He would look after that area and would not be in competition with his colleagues from his own party and from the Opposition parties.  When it comes to votes he would only have the Opposition party to contend with and would not have to contend with members of his own party.  He would be well able to cope with the workload in terms of representation. He would be able to give more of his time to the formulation of legislation.  In general, <Col N="940" /> I believe he would be a better representative because of that.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the question of Friday sittings.  I believe we could do a lot of our business in the three day week more efficiently if the time of speeches was cut down and if the business was ordered in such a way that it would not be necessary to keep the House going when certain motions and legislation were talked out.  We must be very proud of our democratic system.  There is a big obligation on all of us as Members of the House to ensure that we hand on the great freedom we have to those who come after us.  By reforming the Dáil now we will make a valuable contribution towards ensuring that we will hand on the democracy as we found it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express a welcome for the opportunity of making a contribution to an important discussion. The whole concept of Dáil reform is increasingly coming into focus by virtue of the wide acceptance that we have real and fundamental problems within our Dáil system in the House.  The public view at present would be that in general Dáil Éireann is failing and in recent times has failed the people.  It has not met the real needs of our people.  As a Dáil it shows little interest in meeting the day-to-day challenges and difficulties confronted by the people and, generally speaking, Government &mdash; that is the Cabinet &mdash; operate outside the Dáil and in many cases have viewed the Dáil as an irritant to the functioning of the Government. That is the way it has been.  Any facility which this House is being afforded to consider how best we can improve that situation is very timely and welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present parliamentary system we have is a direct carbon copy of a system inherited from Westminster, as are so many of our practices and procedures, and is in urgent need of overhaul.  I would like to advance some suggestions in this respect, not all of which, I have no doubt, will be welcomed by the Members of this House or the members of my party.  I am particularly saddened by the fact that in general terms little or no leadership function appears to be exercised by the Dáil. <Col N="941" /> It is very rarely innovative, very rarely affords inspirational leadership to the people and is generally preoccupied in dealing with semi-relevant legislation long outdated, in some cases decades beyond the era in which such measures should have been considered.</P>
    <P>Prior to this discussion I went to the trouble of getting a list of the business we transacted in this House in the last calendar year.  Among the measures were some proposals dating to the last century updating Acts of Parliament which had become so archaic and irrelevant as to be ludicrous.  Unfortunately, either in our day-to-day functioning or in our longer-term objectives within the Dáil we rarely get to grips with the issues of the moment. To give a concrete example, it is a long time since we had a meaningful, inspirational discussion on the problem of jobs in this House or one that could lead the public to believe that as a group, a House, an Assembly, we cared or that we had solutions.  We have gone through the ritual posturing and ritual cock-fighting we indulge in and we have gone home satisfied that we have done our bit, but that is not the kind of meaningful Dáil I am talking about.  We are reactionary in the literal sense of that word.</P>
    <P>What should we expect from this House?  Among other criteria we should expect six characteristics.  It is reasonable to expect leadership, that is the ability to bring people with one in pursuit of good objectives.  Again, it is a long time since we have heard any new ideas of a historic or significant nature advanced, and when such ideas are loosed usually nets are thrown at those ideas to keep them from flight both in this House and outside. Secondly, we expect from this House reasonable and accurate representation of public views.  I distinguish that from the echoing of strong or vocal lobbies many of whom are unrepresentative, and the ability to withstand the increasingly vocal and vehement challenge of sectional interests outside the House.  That will be a major challenge for this Government in this House.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we expect this House to be a true democratic forum in which all Deputies can participate in some degree in <Col N="942" /> Government in the day-to-day contribution which they should be able to make to the work of Government.  That does not happen.  Deputies do not see the Bills until they are tabled in front of them, and it is expected from Deputies on the side of the Government, whichever Government are in power, that they will all nod their heads in a vertical direction, and Deputies on the opposite side of the House are expected to do the opposite, regardless of the content of the Bill. Many of us on both sides have struggled now and again with reasonably sensible amendments which are, in Pavlovian fashion, opposed by the Government of the day simply because it is not considered within the ambit of the Opposition ever to offer constructive ideas, or it might be an irritant to change the Bill. Perhaps that is leaning in the direction of caricature but generally it is true.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, we expect this House and the Seanad to be an intrinsic part of Government and not an appendage or irritant out there on the wing which must be placated or humoured and to which now and again a bone has to be thrown for it to chew on.  Rather it must be something vital right at the heart of the governmental process through which the collective wisdom, aspirations and expectations of the Irish people are reflected and which should, therefore, ennoble and strengthen the legislation emanating from this House.  That does not happen.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, it should reflect and be an example of the very best of the Irish people.  It should be able to show standards of courage, inspiration, example and dedication and of all the virtues which many believe the Irish people possess.  I do not remember, certainly as a common feature, acts of physical courage being the norm in this House.  Under those criteria this House can reasonably be said to be failing.  Therefore, a fundamental review should be taken not just of the structure of this Dáil but as to whether this Dáil in its present shape, the Houses of the Oireachtas or a one-forum Dáil is any longer the appropriate answer.  In other words, there should not be a question of dealing cosmetically with the way this House functions.  It should be to ask <Col N="943" /> a very fundamental question: is this House in its present form able to deal with the problems now confronting it? That major review should be undertaken at two levels and at both of those levels it will be found to be wanting.  One level is that fundamental area, the ability of a Government to ask the basic question: is the answer, some new type of participative forum different from what we now have?  At the second level, in the day-to-day mechanics of the way we run our business here, unquestionably many improvements are possible.</P>
    <P>The House is failing because it is wrong structurally in many respects.  We assume &mdash; on many occasions aping slavishly example from other countries &mdash; that a model which is appropriate for a different type of society in a bigger country &mdash; an industrial country, for example &mdash; is appropriate for us.  That assumption must be questioned.  Let us look for a few moments at the House we have and see how we can make it more effective even within the terms on which it presents itself.  A number of things seem to cry out for reform.  One is the fact that every bit of Government business must go in linear fashion through all Stages in this Chamber. It is patently nonsensical that a long queue of Bills needing attention should have to be dealt with at all Stages in this Chamber.  Clearly, it is acceptable and possibly necessary that the introductory stage and the final Stage of a Bill should have discussion and consideration in the main Dáil forum.  However, it is no longer important or appropriate that Committee Stage should be dealt with here.</P>
    <P>I see two advantages of proposing a change in that respect.  One is that much more business would be done, assuming, for example, that there could be three, four or more Bills being dealt with simultaneously in separate chambers elsewhere by the specialists, the spokes-people and others interested in the matters involved.  Secondly, this would mean much more genuine and much improved legislation because it would get in those other chambers the consideration that is possible where the pressure of <Col N="944" /> time, the pressure of the Order of Business and the pressure from other Ministers who wish to have their Bills put through the House is removed.  That operation could be improved by a procedure of this kind.  At this point in time it should be reasonable to expect that in different parts of this House &mdash; assuming there is space, but that is another issue &mdash; there would be a number of Bills under deliberation.  There is no reason for a Bill to be processed here in every detail.</P>
    <P>While my next point may not be universally popular, the truth of it will be forced on us eventually, that is, that we should look at the quality of the TD's work.  If we do so we will find that in many cases it is preoccupied almost exclusively with what is a vast charade of writing letters to Ministers and Departments or to local authorities or private institutions appearing to seek preferment or advancement for constituents or for clients but in truth probably doing very little about it.  That charade is based on the public assumption that we as politicians have in some way an inside track whereby we can obtain for our constituents benefits which otherwise they would not achieve.  The result of this is that most of us are engaged in frenzied activity, writing letters to which we receive standard type answers.  The fundamental concept of this is both offensive and unethical. It is particularly offensive in respect of some Departments rather than others. I suggest that if we are anxious to improve the quality of the House and of the TD, we should consider making it an offence to seek preferment or advancement through a public representative especially in the area of justice and in general in any other area where the criteria on which a TD seeks a response to his constituent is one where he seeks advancement for the client simply because a client has approached a TD.  I would stress, though, that we must exclude from this cases in which a TD acts as a type of local ombudsman where there is reason for believing that clients have not been given fair treatment.  In such circumstances a TD would have an obligation to make inquiries.</P>
    <P>The majority of the letters that all of <Col N="945" /> us write amount to no more than our participating in a massive deceit on the public &mdash; that we are engaged in some type of procurement of an advantage for them which otherwise would not come their way.  It is wrong to suggest that we have outstanding results in that respect. It is wrong because it damages what we should be doing here and also in the sense that it is offensive to all right-thinking people.  Those who gain advantage in that way do so in the knowledge also that it is wrong.  Therefore, I would consider it a very healthy step that a Bill be introduced making it a criminal offence for anyone to seek such advancement or interference particularly in relation to Garda matters. Such a Bill would not need to relate exclusively to Members of this House but should refer to anyone else seeking such advancement.  I consider interference with Garda matters to be particularly offensive.  I would be quite happy to have it made a criminal offence to write a letter or to make a phone call or any other form of representation seeking the dropping of charges or seeking any other type of interference with the normal course of justice.  Enough damage has been done in that area.  It is time that we took a step forward in that respect.</P>
    <P>I would not see anything wrong either with the outlawing of similar seeking of advancement in any other area of Government activity.  Why should somebody seeking a medical card or a house grant or a job in the civil service or with a VEC come to me or to any of my colleagues on such a matter?  Some of these representations can be extremely offensive.  Blatant offers of financial reward have been made to me in some instances.  I find that offensive.  First, it is offensive to me that anyone should be under the impression that a TD could be bought in that way and, secondly, because it causes grevious damage to the integrity of the Members involved.  Until such time as we have the maturity to say that this sort of thing must stop it will continue to be the practice and the only way we can call a stop to it is by way of an all-party agreement to the effect that from a certain day forward such requests will not be entertained and will be considered <Col N="946" /> an offence.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I would exempt from such an approach genuine areas where there is some degree of evidence that someone was dealt with unjustly and, consequently, is entitled to the services of a public representative to further his case.  Undoubtedly there are some &mdash; and I suppose I fall into this category to a substantial degree &mdash; who depend on clientism for votes and who may find my suggestion peculiar if not downright politically naive but I am willing to take a chance on that in the belief that the net effect would be that our attentions could then be focused on issues above and beyond the procuring of the maximum vote for ourselves and on dealing with the issues of the day.</P>
    <P>I say that the sort of representations I am talking about are a charade because by and large they are recognised for what they are and treated accordingly.  They are responded to automatically by way of standard replies which in many cases are less satisfactory than are direct representations by the clients themselves to the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>Another major area of reform would be by way of a genuine attempt by the party leaders &mdash; the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Leader of the Opposition &mdash; to do whatever is possible to ensure that there are no artificial polarisations or extremities of views in respect of issues on which there are no significant or meaningful differences.  In a sense we are all prisoners of the civil war politics which unfortunately even cloud the politics of our own day.  Therefore, we are programmed, Government and Opposition, to oppose each other on all issues. It is nonsensical to suggest that there are differences between Government and Opposition on every issue.  We should work constructively at seeking common ground where such exists.  That is not to blur any ideological difference that might exist between parties but genuinely to depoliticise those areas in which that would be possible and to work constructively on such areas for the common good.  Some of these areas are relatively minor ones but others are major areas. Whether the issue be one such as the <Col N="947" /> restoration of the Irish language or should it be concerned with the desired unity of the peoples of this island, an all-party or a non-party political approach would have achieved a great deal more than what has been achieved in those areas and others like them so far by this adversary system from which most of us are unwilling to break.</P>
    <P>As a child I could never understand why adults on one side considered everything to be wrong while those on the other side considered it to be right.  Then, when we would have an election and if there were a change of Government the yeas would become nays.  This was a case of the child being wiser than the adult.  A constructive and determined all-party attempt should be made to remove from party and adversary politics those areas where there is common ground, to build on that, thereby giving public example and restoring credence and integrity to the public perception which at present, so far as I can judge, is at an all-time low in relation to how this House is managed.</P>
    <P>Unquestionably, there should be a committees system in this House and I am confident the Government will introduce such structures.  It is very important that any such committees should be set up in the context of a genuinely new approach to the business of Government rather than as a possible out for responsibility. If these committees are set up they should be meaningful, accountable, publicly accessible and should be doing their work openly and subject to scrutiny. They should not be a forum into which a recalcitrant Minister can kick an issue simply to evade responsibility or accountability in this House.  I am sure no one will quibble if I raise that point because many committees in the past, whether they were of the all-party or the House variety, were unfortunately consciously or otherwise used to some extent to achieve that end.  Time and again people's queries were frustrated by the fact that somewhere a committee was working without a time scale or in some cases without terms of reference, which, for some reason or other, could be argued as a basis for not answering a particular <Col N="948" /> query.  A committee system yes, but qualified along the lines to which I refer.</P>
    <P>I truly believe that there is on all sides of this House a resource, expertise, potential and talent in Deputies which have not been utilised properly.  The Taoiseach picks a Cabinet and his Ministers of State, but outside that all other Deputies appear to be somewhat alien to the whole process.  Despite the fact that there are Deputies with long years of service and vast experience in this House and other walks of life, none of those resources seems to be galvanised into a positive contribution to the way we run our affairs.  Every Member of this House should be afforded an opportunity to make that contribution and specific responsibilities should be entrusted to virtually all Deputies willing to accept them, whether they be to assist in a particular area or to take another area of responsibility for which there is not a portfolio as such but for which there is, nevertheless, a need.  Greater emphasis on the talent available is important rather than seeing the TD outside Cabinet or Minister of State rank as being cannon fodder or lobby fodder, which is the standard perception of the TD in the House and it is even worse than that outside the House on occasion.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that we should try to diminish as far as possible the need for TDs to run each other off their feet by this frenzied activity of writing confetti letters day in and day out.  If that is to be done, however, it has to be recognised that many constituents come to a TD because they can get no satisfaction or no accountability of a satisfactory nature from many areas of the public service. Another proposal the Minister might consider is the possibility of introducing a statutory time limit within which all replies would have to be answered satisfactorily. The civil service will quail to hear such a suggestion, but whoever introduced the two-month time limit in relation to planning applications to a local authority had the right idea, and the system has worked.  Ironically in that regard, the whole thing is negatived by the fact that if you appeal to the Planning Appeals Board you can be waiting for <Col N="949" /> ever.  Therefore the spirit is not carried through.</P>
    <P>The principle within which a member of the public should be able to obtain from the public service &mdash; who are there to serve the public &mdash; reasonable responses to their queries within a given time, should be introduced whether by statute or otherwise.  If we put more emphasis on the up-dating of our information system &mdash; and the technology is available to do this &mdash; to ensure prompt, courteous and efficient replies, we would have an automatic de-escalation of the frantic letter writing we are all involved in.  It would be no harm if the public servant drafting this letter took time out to learn basic good manners.  I have seen extraordinary letters written to recently bereaved people in respect of their widows' pensions and to people who were retiring after years of service, few of which showed any spark of humanity or interest in the person's plight or difficulty. I think it is appalling that the public service should be able to treat its masters, the public, in that way.  Today's public servants have inherited that approach from their forebears, but I do not thank anyone for writing a courteous letter with an understanding of the individual's plight.  I realise that reform of the public service is another area but one of the reasons there are standard letters is that anybody might, by some chance, take the initiative and put a comma in the wrong place or allow a human gesture to escape into a letter which would rock the civil service to its foundation.</P>
    <P>I take the view that it is time we over-hauled our present communications system. That could be extended in another reform to the measures we introduce in this House.  There is no reason why Bills, particularly in respect of the Explanatory Memoranda, should not be written so that laymen could understand them.  In my darker moments I have been prone to the suspicion that perhaps these documents are written so that we do not understand them.  I have seen extraordinary convoluted attempts at writing as many words as possible for what could have been said, and in fewer words, more plainly.  In some cases I challenge Members <Col N="950" /> of this House and members of the public to understand what is really said. If something can be said in three words &mdash; perhaps I should apply this dictum to myself even in the context of this speech &mdash; let us say it in three words rather than three paragraphs.  The material produced here is obviously not for the layman or for public consumption, but for a small group of specialists and in many cases a small group of lawyers.  In my view Bills introduced are public property and wherever possible the language contained in them should be seen in that light.</P>
    <P>Another way we might de-escalate this clientism which runs through our daily work which beggars the work we should be doing here, is by changing our system of election, introducing a roll-over type system, by which I mean that a certain number of Deputies would be elected in a specific election and mid-term there would be another election to elect the balance.  In this way, there would be a continuance and at any given time at least half the House would feel they did not have to be frantically concerned about the next election because they would not be involved.  That sounds a little desperate but it is an attempt to remove from people the increasing fear which understandably we have had in recent times that an election is just around the corner and, whatever about standing up in this House at this hour of the evening talking at length, it would be much more important to be upstairs attending to my correspondence. I do not denigrate that work because I am one of those who believe the clinic is a good thing.  It earths us and keeps us in touch but it should not take the place of the central forum of this House.</P>
    <P>Unquestionably, our rigid system of whip voting is wrong.  It is irrational and leads to a very blinkered approach to improving the quality of our work.  I agree with previous speakers who said there is no reason why we should be whipped into every vote or why we should be expected to respond in a certain way on every issue because we are either Members of the Government party or the Opposition.  In truth, that has come about because of another extraordinary <Col N="951" /> anomaly which has developed.  If by some chance an unfortunate member of a Government party with a slim majority got ill or was abroad and could not catch a plane home, an embarrassing vote could bring about the downfall of the Government.  The day will come when people will look back at that type of concept and laugh about it as something outlandish.  To imply that a Government had forfeited confidence because one of their Members had broken his foot or because there was a fog at London Airport is about as sensible as the most ludicrous possibility anyone would consider. There is no sense in such a proposal and, as far as I am concerned, there is nothing whatever wrong with a Government introducing an issue in the context of the innovation and the leadership which is spoken about, being defeated in the House and not feeling obliged to have an election.  It is nonsensical to presume that any Government have a monopoly of wisdom in this House or that they should be right all the time, at least numerically. That kind of thinking has, to some extent, brought us to the present situation.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that a Government should make a habit of being defeated in the House.  After a certain number of defeats it would become positively plain that they were incapable of governing.  However, there are issues which are non-confidence measures and, unfortunately, at present in those cases a defeat for the reason mentioned earlier is a source of enormous embarrassment, usually responded to by the proponents suggesting a vote of confidence.  This is, if one thinks about it, slightly nonsensical.  We should have a more flexible approach to voting in this House, whereby Members could speak their minds and give the service which they can best give, which is to be true to themselves, without fear that they will embarrass their Government, or bring about its defeat.  Nobody would want that, except in the most extraordinary circumstances.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion which could be introduced at local level immediately would be for individual Deputies in each <Col N="952" /> constituency to take courage and, in consultation with their colleagues, Deputies of all parties in their constituencies, discuss &mdash; particularly now, at the beginning of what I hope will be a period of stable Government for the next four or five years &mdash; the possibility of introducing a code of practice for themselves which, in so far as it is possible, will remove this frenzy of clientism which is at present demeaning the running of this House.  I see nothing wrong with one Deputy in each constituency calling together his colleagues and saying: &ldquo;We all know that this is not what we should spend this portion of our time at.  Let us see if we can come to a sensible agreement to refer certain queries to the agencies to which they should be referred, to agree not to pursue such queries and to tell the people jointly that we will not pursue them.&rdquo;  I know that such a proposal is fraught with difficulties.  The mere agreement of all the Deputies does not mean that the job will not be done by some aspiring Deputy.  However, Deputies should consider such an approach, pending the measures of reform which we are discussing. Certainly I intend to take that initiative &mdash; and have met with a very encouraging response, thus far, from my colleagues &mdash; of a local code of practice and procedures whereby we can bring some rationale and order back into our daily affairs.  We should insist on standards and ensure that we are not prey or prone to having to make inquiries or representations of a nature which we all know are less than ethical.  A restoration of standards, or indeed any improvement of present standards, would be very welcome and is very badly needed.</P>
    <P>Further, it would be appropriate that this Government begin the process of ensuring that, when a Minister wishes to introduce a new Bill or measure in the House, he circulates to all Deputies the concept of the Bill or its heads, seeks genuine participation or contributions from such Deputies and says &ldquo;We want to hear what you have to say&rdquo;.  Such a proposal would lead to a better quality Bill and better politics.  Unfortunately, the present system, whereby the first sight the Opposition obtains of the Bill is <Col N="953" /> on the date of its publication, means that the Opposition, to justify their existence, believe that they must automatically adopt an adversary posture.  They must go into the fighting cock approach.  It has been made too easy for them to do so. The Government, for their part, believe that they have now to put themselves into a foxhole and defend, at all costs, every line and every scintilla of the Bill. Whether or not there is wisdom in the Opposition's opposition or the Government's staunch defence does not arise.  It becomes a question of numbers, of confidence. A sensitive approach by the Prime Minister in circulating the idea of the Bill, not just to Members of this House but to people outside the House, saying &ldquo;We believe that the Government of the country can benefit from the best of all the resources which all the people have to offer&rdquo;, would be a lot more enlightened than the present system and lead to better legislation, less polarisation in this House and to a speedier approval or endorsement of the measure coming through eventually, because less tension would surround its discussion.  That would not breach any major barriers of protocol.</P>
    <P>In passing, I refer to a minor but archaic aspect of business in this House &mdash; the voting system where by we, sheep-like, troop up the stairs, turn left and right into two pens.  Surely it is possible to improve on that system and vote by means now utilised in parliaments throughout the world, either by pushing a button, or by some other indication from one's seat.  This is a symptom of how archaic and outdated our methods have become.</P>
    <P>Standing up on the morning of the day of business and announcing an Order of Business for that day is no longer acceptable. It is, of course, an accurate reflection of the respect traditionally granted to Deputies in this House by successive Governments, by whom a Deputy is seen as no more, in most cases, than fodder for votes in the lobby.  There is no reason, by and large, with possible exemptions and exceptions, why the Order of Business for this day fortnight could not have been circulated today.  I know that this <Col N="954" /> would require a little more effort, discussion and agreement, but there is no reason why it could not be settled now, thereby affording would-be speakers and contributors to the debate generally a much greater opportunity of preparing their remarks and considering the matter seriously.  Once again, we have an example of the way in which we treat our business and our Members, by throwing the bone to the House on the morning in question.</P>
    <P>Question Time is another irritant.  I will not delay on this point, but it has been pointed out that under the present system it is conceivable that some Ministers never get to answer questions.  One simple proposal &mdash; and I cannot understand why it has not been introduced until now &mdash; is that questions be taken in chronological order.  On today's Order Paper, without reference to it, the Minister for Finance is presumably first after the Taoiseach.  If I am cute enough and have my question in before 10.30 or 11 o'clock in the morning, it will mean that my question, tabled today, can be answered next week, whereas questions to the Ministers down the line which may have been tabled since before the Recess will not be answered for many months yet.  Why should my question, tabled today, go in this section of questions to the Minister for Finance down for answer today?  It should obviously go at the tail end of the agenda, in its chronoligal order.</P>
    <P>Much more time, also, could be given to Question Time, although even Question Time has a certain degree of artificiality. It appears to be largely a device exploited by willing Oppositions &mdash; and I did enough exploitation of it in my own time &mdash; in order to embarrass, if possible, Governments and Ministers.  The more embarrassment, the better.  It did not seem an area in which one genuinely sought information or enlightenment.  In fact, the best questions that one could ask were ones to which one had already the answers, but, in the full knowledge that the answers were not quite in accordance with standards which would reflect <Col N="955" /> well on the Government, one persisted in asking the questions anyway.</P>
    <P>I agree with suggestions which have been made that we should consider the possibility of introducing a time limit on speakers.  Any such time limit would, undoubtedly, mean that I would have stopped speaking some time ago.  I would suggest to the House that many of us come in with a great deal to say but, if a time limit were imposed on us, this would mean that we would condense our remarks.  However I have one rider to add to that.  I believe that in the interests of democracy it should be allowable that a speaker would go in and speak and speak again if necessary &mdash; in other words, that a 15 or 20 minutes limit could be put on each contribution so that a Member could put his name down at the tail end of a debate again.  In practice very few would do this unless he or she felt there was something particularly weighty to be said.  In most cases it would mean more efficient debates, a word which in the context of this House is a complete misnomer because there is no debate except on Committee Stages of Bills.</P>
    <P>With reference to many of the set pieces we have in the House, whether it be an adjournment debate or a budget debate, there is a great degree of artificiality about them sometimes because of the fact there is not the cut and thrust which one might expect of such a debate. An adjournment debate is a catch-all debate: the primary interest is the vote at the end with very little attention being paid to its content.  The Minister involved should examine the possibility of getting a much more pungent and meaningful debate, avoiding if possible a general catch-all debate, whether on the economy, on jobs, on the adjournment or on the budget.  Issues for debate should be as specific and precise as possible except on rare occasions where that general approach is necessary.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that we should work longer hours.  I would not disagree with that in principle except to say the following.  It is a matter of indifference to me and, I feel sure, to the <Col N="956" /> people of this country how many hours we work if the quality of that work is not to be improved.  There are circumstances in which we in this House could work fewer hours but do better work.  By and large we should give public example and a House closed more often than open, a House which is closed for six months of the year, is giving bad example.  But I stress that quantity is not the primary criterion and that it is quality with which we should be concerned.  For example, merely to have Friday sittings to start immediately &ldquo;discussing&rdquo; Estimates &mdash; by which we mean that Opposition spokesmen would stand up and, in some cases exchange prejudices or opinions &mdash; is not in any serious fashion working longer hours.  It is simply filling in the time and will have very little to do with improving the quality of our work.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that a major problem of this House is our inability, because of these constricting structures we have inherited, to deal with the issues of the day.  Time and again I have seen Members frustrated in endeavouring to deal with an issue arising at this moment, in the morning or in the afternoon.  There is no mechanism at present under which a public representative can stand up and ask to have that matter dealt with immediately. Perhaps that is a little unfair because there is the possibility of an adjournment debate, but that is a matter at the discretion of the Chair.  Therefore, apart from the possibility of an adjournment debate, or of a Private Notice Question being accepted, there is no automatic procedure whereby an issue of importance and immediate relevance can automatically be discussed in the House.  It is extraordinary that, for example, we can on the one day be discussing a Bill perhaps about bankruptcy, dating back in terms of its need to the last century while, if you like, Rome burns, while factories are closed down or while there are major issues to be dealt with at national or local level and we are apparently unable to deal with them.  That is the essence of irrelevance.  Some formula must be devised whereby immediate issues causing concern or interest to one or perhaps <Col N="957" /> a group of Members can be dealt with and must be dealt with on that day or within a day or so.</P>
    <P>When considering this debate I would ask the Minister to ascertain whether the fetish that this House appears to have with the secrecy of budgets is any longer relevant.  It is not acceptable, particularly to backbench members of a Government, that the first time they will hear of any scintilla of information about a budget is on the day it is read in this House, on budget day, and that they must wait with bated breath hoping there is nothing in it which will conflict with or offend very important principles for them.  I know there are good reasons why certain specific tax proposals cannot appear before then.  But I see no reason why, in the same way as I proposed earlier a discursive approach to Bills, a similar attitude could not be taken with regard to options for tax-raising, revenue generation or other fiscal measures.  I do not believe that this obsession, with the whole community suddenly buying stocks of booze in fear of an increase in the price of the pint, should allow us to be backed into a position in which nobody in this House, bar the Cabinet, has any inkling whatever of what is going to be in a budget.  Not alone is it offensive to all Members of this House to be treated in this fashion but is also politically precarious because the insight and wisdom on all sides of this House could help a Government in a difficult situation to keep a proper perspective, a sense of political perspective and perhaps a socially just perspective, which they might otherwise lack in those respects if the opportunity to make that contribution was not afforded.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, in the context of this debate, to consider to what extent we could have a pre-budget discussion on what should be or might be in the budget in the same way as the Green Paper issued last year by the Fianna Fáil Government presented some options for revenue raising, though obviously it was not clear which proposals precisely were being put forward.  But at least one had some indication of the kinds of measures then in the Minister's mind.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly that any proposal <Col N="958" /> to change our approach in this House should lay strong emphasis on the need for open Government.  Unfortunately those two words have become a cliché and, I suppose, are the subject of derision in many respects by the people now.  I believe there should be broadcasting of the proceedings of this House, that there should be broadcasting of committees with the ability of either the House or committees to go into camera, when appropriate, without apology to anybody. If there is to be broadcasting of this House or of the committees it should be thought out carefully and preference given to the committee work.  All of us know from our committee work that that is where the real business of politics is often done.  Nobody wants to encourage a Star Chamber here which would be prejudicial or detrimental to the solid and constructive work being done in private behind committee doors.  Therefore, if there is a choice I would choose the broadcasting of committee work where I assume people would see public representatives giving of their best in a non-party political atmosphere and with the good of the people uppermost in their minds rather than the public posturing which goes on in this House, again of which we are all guilty.</P>
    <P>Such an open Government approach should emphasise the importance and entitlement of the public to have access and scrutiny.  I know that at present the public are somewhat disinterested.  Who can blame them?  But, if we galvanise our systems in here, we can gather momentum in terms of public interest.  We should insist that the business of the House is conducted in public, in the open wherever possible.  Indeed this brings one to the point of whether or not some of such work could be done in other venues around the country.  I see no reason why a Committee Stage of a Bill or the deliberations of a select committee of the House could not be dealt with in, say, Galway, Cork, Limerick or Tipperary where there would be the possibility of the public seeing how it worked and bringing with it a decentralisation of all things in Dublin as at present.  I should like the Minister to consider that suggestion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> It is appropriate to refer briefly to the possibility of reforming the Upper House because after all, that constitutes an intrinsic part of our business also.  One of the areas of the Seanad and its performance which should be looked at is the voting system, which is clearly unjust. Some councillors have a disproportionately large weighting in terms of their vote compared to other councillors.  We should review whether councillors, Deputies and outgoing Senators are the correct electorate.  There is no justification for a councillor representing 1,000 people having the same weight to his vote as someone representing 40 times that number.  The Minister should end the nonsense whereby good men and women have to go haring around the country at enormous personal expense to try to meet every councillor on the register.  He should consider regional elections where we might be able to give candidates some degree of proximity to their electorate. This is not just for the convenience of Members but because at present those with most resources are in a position to do best, although this is not always the case.</P>
    <P>There is no justification, if there ever was, for the retention of the university seats.  I find it offensive and obnoxious that a small elite echelon of our educational system should have the right to nominate one-tenth of the Upper House. It is not justified particularly in the light of developments in other areas of education and walks of life.  Although it will result in some bellowing and opposition, it is an aspect of Seanad reform which should be brought about.</P>
    <P>The count is similarly ludicrous.  It seems to have been devised by sadists who were never Seanad or Dáil candidates. It takes a week for a Seanad count to elect 60 Senators whereas the presidential election in America is decided in a matter of minutes.  Unless Senators and would-be Senators have a great desire to be masochists we should introduce some whiff of a modern system into the count system.  Perhaps we could also do this in relation to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We should look again at whether the <Col N="960" /> concept of the Taoiseach nominating 11 people is a reasonable prospect.  It may be.  However, I am not convinced that it should be automatic because it is designed to give the Government of the day a majority.  That majority may be desirable and essential but I should like to see the case put for retaining that measure.</P>
    <P>Another innovation I should like to see is the removal from the House of the offensive mechanism of TDs having to approve their own salary increases.  I make no apology for regular, systematic and genuine improvement in the salaries of Members of the House.  At present salaries are disgraceful.  What is particularly odious is the perception of the public that we increase our salaries at regular intervals.  All we want and all we are entitled to is the same treatment given to any member of the public or private sector, that is, increases in reasonable line with inflation and perhaps automatically index-linked to wage agreements, inflation or other economic norms.  A mechanism should be devised outside the House for that.  It should not need discussion in the House at all.  That is not to say it cannot be brought up in the House if a Member so wishes.  The impression that we come together every six or eight months in a cabal and grant ourselves an enormous increase is wrong.  It is an offence not only to TDs but to their wives and families.  We could diminish that greatly by removing from this forum the right to fix our own salaries and make it an automatic increase where appropriate in line with other economic indicators.</P>
    <P>I should like to add to criticisms which have been voiced in relation to the working conditions of Members.  They are a disgrace.  They are in breach of the norms which local authorities set down for employees in other walks of life.  If one of the clients I spoke about earlier came to us and was running an office in the conditions in which we and our staffs have to work, we would advise him that he was in breach of the law.  If we cannot regulate our affairs to ensure that Members of the House and their staff are working in sanitary, healthy and good conditions, we can hardly manage the <Col N="961" /> economy or any other aspect of the country's wellbeing.  The purpose of improvements in this area is not to garner for ourselves more office space but to improve the quality of work.  This should be the central point of concern in this area.</P>
    <P>We should look at areas of work which could be decentralised.  I include some areas of grants and other aspects of what appear to the TD to be power broking which could be done at local level and which should only be raised in the House in extraordinary circumstances.  I have heard the national Parliament debating at great length an instance where someone was refused a grant or otherwise.  I do not wish to disbar that occasionally being brought up if it is important.  However, true decentralisation of the work of Government should mean a more productive use of the time of the House.</P>
    <P>Another reform long overdue is that of the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  I have heard various Ministers and Governments leading with the chin and claiming responsibility for various acts of commission or omission.  It is nonsense to think that a Minister is deemed to be responsible for every single act of every single official under his jurisdiction.  It is neither factually correct nor politically appropriate that that should continue.  There is nothing wrong, particularly in the context of committees, in real accountability being laid at the door of those who take decisions.  The converse is that those who make good decisions should be rewarded.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who say we should reconsider the possibility of the single seat transferable vote constituency.  Such a possibility would improve the probability of a less sectional, less clientism orientated approach to politics and may lead to more responsible representation in this House.  In recent times we have seen a sad and somewhat sordid picture portrayed of the House.  There are reasons for that.  I know I have been critical in what I have said but there is much good work done here and this Parliament has stood us in good stead in many respects. There are aspects of our business which are never given public attention.  The <Col N="962" /> Minister should give consideration to the possibility of better marketing and selling of the work we do.  There is no reason why we should not be able, on an all-party or committee basis, to put forward to the people, particularly the young, the work we do, warts and all to show that the caricature of the TD as an ignorant gombeen man concerned only with securing votes at any cost is a grave slur and no longer justified, if it ever was, in respect of the overwhelming majority in the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider the possibility of utilising the services of public relations consultants who would advise the public and the young people in our schools who are bereft of any kind of political education even about the structures or institutions of politics that there is another side rather than the lurid and sordid one which is presented to them in the more colourful areas of the media. There is another positive, constructive side which must be emphasised.  We should put our best foot forward.  Members work long and hard in committees and in their own rooms researching and working on issues and this positive aspect should be emphasised.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party have a policy document in relation to Dáil reform which is available from headquarters.  It is a very constructive and deliberate document drawn up by the Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy Bruton, who was then spokesman in that area.  It is a thought-provoking document which anticipates much of this debate and contains extensive proposals for radical reform in areas which have been mentioned and in other areas which have not been touched upon in this debate.  He refers to the need to set up select committees with extensive powers.  The document endorsed by our party in June 1980, also adopts a much more sensible approach to the discussion of Bills.  Very few things are more ludicrous than the sight of adults discussing Estimates when the money has already been spent.  It is difficult enough in discussing an anticipated action to change the inexorable outcome.  A prior discussion of Estimates does not appear to be a radical or earthshaking <Col N="963" /> innovation but apparently it must be spelt out as desirable.</P>
    <P>The document refers to the need specifically to the debate borrowing and capital budgets of Government and would be in line with my earlier suggestion to have discussion on the budget prior to its formation.  I am suggesting an open, healthy discussion which would allow the shape of the budget to be perceived in general terms by the House and the people prior to its introduction.  The document also refers to the need for a review of Question Time and states that State-sponsored bodies should be subject to scrutiny of some kind.  I entirely concur. I see no reason why agencies which are increasing in number and receiving ever larger amounts of public money should be beyond public accountability in this House merely because they are semi-State and therefore outside our direct aegis.  There is a proposal for special committees on delegated legislation with motions to amend orders to be allowed under the 21-day rule.  There are also proposals to increase our working hours and change the recess times in order to achieve a more productive and constructive Dáil forum.</P>
    <P>There is also a proposal to institute joint committees on non-commercial State bodies and to draft Bills on the subject matter of the reports of the Law Reform Commission.  This work, although important, is not usually seen to be a priority and needs attention.  I also agree with the suggestions that more time should be allowed for Private Members' Business and I do not think that backbench members of the Government party should be excluded from the possibility of introducing a Private Members' Bill.  Obviously this would need detailed consideration but I would argue that there should be more flexibility to ensure the full participation of all Members.</P>
    <P>There should be provisions to prevent the abuse by Deputies of any new powers. Unfortunately, we have recently seen alleged examples of behaviour which none of us would wish and which Members when first elected would not <Col N="964" /> have foreseen themselves becoming involved in.  There should be specific sanctions and powers to ensure that such abuses are not possible.  There should also be power to compel witnesses to appear before committees.</P>
    <P>Reports are presented to this House far too late for any meaningful consideration of discussion.  There should be some type of statutory inducement or encouragement to ensure that, finished or not, interim reports are brought before this House in regard to any annual report to which this House is entitled to have access or witness.  I would extend that to include some kind of capacity for the public to scrutinise certain files in Government Departments.  An Act dealing with freedom of information is badly needed which would allow reasonable access to the public, our ultimate masters, with the security of the State being protected. At present there appears to be an absolute refusal to disclose even the most mundane details.  We could all cite examples of innocent requests being refused and officials in this House have told me of the possible interpretations of the law to which they are open if they discuss particular matters.  A new approach to the business of the people &mdash; Government business &mdash; is necessary.  There should be as much emphasis on assess as is consistent with public order and security.</P>
    <P>Many speakers in this debate have concentrated on the need for improvement and we may have given the impression that those here before us were acting in a fashion less than satisfactory and did not stand the country in good stead.  That is not my opinion.  We are talking about a Dáil which must face the challenges of unemployment, deep international recession and the uncertainty of the next 20 or 30 years.  The traditions of this House and the wisdom which has been passed on from previous administrations must be combined with an open, fresh and radical approach to reforms where they are desirable.  Much about this House is still healthy and good and we have recently seen evidence of that.  Despite the occasional skirmish, we have a democratic system, a free Parliament and a people <Col N="965" /> who, if properly motivated and led, can rise to great heights.  This Dáil has a role to play in that inspirational process.  I do not think it can realise that potential in its present form but I would like to think that some of the points I have touched on might be conducive to that end.  I offer those thoughts respectfully to the Minister and thank him for the opportunity of contributing to this important debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I congratulate you officially on taking up your esteemed office which I hope you will occupy for many years.  I also congratulate the Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy Bruton, on his appointment and on the initiative he has shown over a number of years in trying to drag this House into the twentieth century. The only thing that I am afraid of is that it is still pie in the sky.  Would the Minister get the necessary good will from the senior civil servants and from the Cabinet to carry out the reforms which are so badly needed?  The civil service has given a great service but, like the new model car that is introduced every two years, we must look at it closely to see how it works and if it should be changed.  The civil service has not changed much since the twenties and whether that is a criticism of successive Governments who did not carry out reforms or of Members who were afraid to express their views is a matter that will be judged by the public.</P>
      <P>Those who watch the RTE programme &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo; learn a lot about what happens behind the scenes.  Why is it that females have not got senior appointments in Departments of State, as secretaries and so on?  There has not been a female secretary of a Department since the forties when Dr. Thekla Beere held such a position.  Why is it that such posts have been occupied by males only?  Is it due to the fact that female civil servants got married and did not return to work or were they passed over?  I am unhappy that we allowed that situation to continue. In order to rise to the rank of secretary of a Department one joins the civil service possibly at the rank of clerical officer and then is promoted to HEO.</P>

      <P>The Dáil would not function without the civil service and if we are to reform the Dáil we must also consider reforming the civil service.  They go hand in hand, like a marriage.  If the Chair insists on inhibiting me at such an early stage we should forget about Dáil reform. For one to become a secretary of a Department it is necessary to avoid blotting one's copybook anywhere on the promotion line.  As a HEO one must be a good boy or girl and one must be good from then on.  The time has come when the senior positions in the civil service should be open to the public and not confined to the service.  We must be practical and accept that there are many men and women of ability outside the service who would be able to make a fresh input into the service.  I should like to refer to an incident that occurred when I was in charge of a Department 12 months ago. I had a private secretary who was promoted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is going further out of order.  The further he gets involved in the civil service structure the more he is moving from the motion before the House which is concerned with Dáil reform.  I must ask the Deputy to return to the terms of the motion before the House.</P>

      <P>To reform the Dáil we must also reform the civil service.  Before the arrival of the Chair in the House the Acting Chairmen permitted Members to travel from one end of the world to the other without interruption but I have been speaking for only ten minutes and <Col N="967" /> the Chair has interrupted me three times. The Chair is being harsh on me, unintentionally, I might add.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to develop the point about reform.  If we are to consider reform we must question the operation of semi-State bodies.  Twelve days ago I submitted a parliamentary question asking the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he was aware that RTE in their accounts had provided money for bugging equipment but the Chair informed me &mdash; I respect that decision &mdash; that the question was being disallowed and yet we levy taxes on our people to provide money for State-sponsored bodies.  The Dáil is irrelevant as far as some of those organisations are concerned and any reform must make them more accountable to the House.  Some semi-State bodies are monsters and they are sucking the nation's blood like weasels but they are not accountable to the House.  One has only to look at the disgraceful carry-on in Údarás na Gaeltachta to realise the problem. If we are paying the piper surely we are entitled to call the tune.</P>
      <P>I accept that RTE is doing a public service but it should be subject to scrutiny by the House.  It is only right that politicians should be asked to account for their actions on current affairs programmes but I should like to know how a member of the RTE Authority can be a promoter of ballad groups on that station?  I will not name the person involved but how is that member of the Authority permitted to remain in that position while at the same time he promotes ballad groups on that station?</P>

      <P>The Deputy cannot avail of the debate to discuss matters regarding a semi-State body which is not within the ambit of the debate.

      <P>There is no point in talking pious platitudes about semi-State bodies, as has been said in this debate, unless you are specific so that the public will know what is going on.  If there is to be public accountability for public representatives &mdash; and it is only right that there should be &mdash; let us have public accountability on the part of the people who are presenting those programmes.</P>
      <P>When the Minister introduced this document I am sure he had every intention of seeing that it was implemented. There are many gaps in this document as compared with the original document. Has the dentist got at it?  Have the main teeth being pulled from the original document? That is a question which bothers me.  We can all say we want this, that and the other but, if we have not got the will to see it carried through to the end, we are only codding ourselves and the people who will take note of this debate. The select committees which are to be set up will not be worth anything unless immunity is given to key witnesses who will attend the hearings.  By that I mean that they will not suffer because they have the guts to come forward and tell a select committee that money is being misappropriated in certain areas.</P>
      <P>I take issue with you, a Cheann Comhairle, when you say I cannot be specific about civil servants.  I want to tie the two things together.  I took a certain initiative and the minute I left my Department the people who stood by me on that initiative were scattered to the four corners of Dublin.  If that was not victimisation by the civil service of some people who were prepared to stand on their two feet and take an initiative because they were asked to do so by the Minister of the day, I do not know what it was.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle is in rare order this evening.  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle will not interrupt me if I speak about the select committees and how they are to work.  If I know a gentleman down in Kerry who is prepared to give me classified information on how he sees money being spent, and if he is extremely unhappy about the way the money is being spent, I want an assurance that he will not be victimised the minute the findings of the committee are completed. That assurance will have to be written in to the workings of these select committees.</P>
      <P>If an official of a semi-State board is prepared to come forward and say: &ldquo;I am unhappy about the fact that many millions of pounds are going to a fish processing plant in Dingle because the last three went burst&rdquo;, I do not want that official victimised because he had the guts to say the squandermania should be stopped.  When the Minister is replying to this debate I hope he will say he will give immunity to the people who will enable those committees to work.</P>
      <P>We have a golden opportunity here if we avail of it.  There is no point in our using catchy phrases and saying we will do this and that if eventually we do nothing. That is the image of politicians at the moment.  If witnesses and civil servants and other people who are prepared to give evidence to these committees know they have immunity and that they will not be prosecuted or victimised, I am quite sure the committees will work.

      <P>At the outset I should like to express my satisfaction at the fact that this debate is taking place.  I must confess that as a new Deputy I thought at the beginning that Deputies were satisfied with the running and the performance of the Dáil.  Some Deputies seemed perfectly happy at their elevation to the status of Deputy and gloried in the attention they were receiving.  Others seemed to be happy to toil away at insignificant tasks in substandard accommodation and to <Col N="970" /> enter this Chamber only when a vote was being taken.</P>
      <P>Happily I detect among my colleagues a new breed of Deputy who is not overcome by his new-found status and who is not on an ego trip but has entered this House with serious intent and wishes to make a contribution towards improving the quality of life in the country.  He is not satisfied to attend and become lobby fodder for those few who see their goal as holding ministries and positions of responsibility.  If these people are not given a chance and if they are not invited, encouraged, or allowed to participate, they will try to change the system and, if unsuccessful and beaten by it, they cannot in honour continue to be members of this Assembly.  I refrain from describing it as august, although I am sure it is.  I must admit that I am less than impressed by what I have seen of the workings of the Oireachtas since I was elected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to reject any proposal to close the rail line from Rosslare Harbour to Limerick or Rosslare Harbour to Dublin for passenger or freight service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving the motion I would like to refer to a report commissioned by the south eastern regional organisation in 1982.  In 1977 when CIE proposed to terminate services on the Limerick Junction &mdash; Rosslare Harbour Railway, the <Col N="971" /> local authorities, regional development organisations, chamber of commerce and trade unions in the area served by the line opposed the closure and submitted a joint case for its retention to the Minister for Transport and Power and to CIE. Following the statement issued by the Minister on 19 January 1977 this proposal was not proceeded with.  This statement was subsequently reiterated in the Dáil in reply to an Opposition motion, &ldquo;that Dáil Éireann, believing that for economic and social reasons the Rosslare &mdash; Limerick Junction railway service should not be discontinued, calls on the Government to ensure that the service on this line is retained&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 4 December 1981 the chairman of CIE stated that the question of termination of the service was again under consideration, that a decision had been deferred and that proposals would be examined in four to five months.  Arising from this, a joint meeting of the local authorities, regional development organisations, chambers of commerce and other bodies in the area affected by the closure was held on 15 April 1982.  The meeting reaffirmed its opposition to withdrawal of the service.  This is the reason for the motion here tonight.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council, Wexford Corporation, the urban councils, district committees, Gorey Town Commissioners and Rosslare Harbour Development Board have all spoken out strongly against the closure of both lines.  Indeed, all five TDs are represented on bodies, having been elected thereto by the people of Wexford, and in their capacity as members of the organisations mentioned, have declared their intention to support at all times the continuation of this line. Deputies, county councillors and all members of these bodies have been vociferous in this regard and I hope our friends on the Opposition benches from County Wexford and the areas affected by the proposed closure of the two railway lines will show their true colours because they have made many promises and given many commitments with regard to this matter.  A watery amendment <Col N="972" /> will not be acceptable to the people of Wexford or indeed to the people in the south.</P>
    <P>The area served by the line is one of rapid population growth and projections show that this will continue.  There was a population increase of 16 per cent in the decade to 1981 and a continuation of this trend would mean a population increase of up to 60,000 people by the end of the century.</P>
    <P>Allied to this is the expansion of the manufacturing and commercial sectors. Manufacturing employment increased by 20 per cent in the decade up to 1982 and this rate of increase must continue to cater for the increasing population.  The line serves a number of industrial sites of great potential for large-scale industries, both in Waterford Harbour, the Suir Valley and, more particularly, south Wexford. It is in the regional and national interest that nothing is done to diminish this potential.  Everybody will agree that a railway service is a particularly important part of infrastructure for this type of industry.  The railway line should be retained for those developments.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Thurles sugar factory even though my colleagues from Tipperary will expound further on the subject.  As shown in the 1977 submission, the termination of the rail services would have a very adverse effect on the sugar industry in Thurles and could render that factory non-viable.  A beet depot was built at Wellingtonbridge, County Wexford, in 1978 at a cost of £1 million to the taxpayers.  All the beet from south Wexford is collected at this depot for transport by rail to either Thurles or Tuam beet factories.  This project, unlike many others, has been and is working exceptionally well and has exceeded the expectations of the 650 growers, the Sugar Company and CIE.  In this respect, great credit is due to the local manager and staff who are doing an excellent job trying to keep beet growers happy while delivering beet or collecting pulp.  At a time when tractors and trailers are at peak demand that takes fair organisation. The depot was built around rail facilities and every aspect is adapted for railways. <Col N="973" /> Surely it cannot be the Minister's intention to turn this into a white elephant?</P>
    <P>Cómhluct Siúcre Éireann estimate that the additional cost of conveying the beet to Thurles by road rather than by rail would be £600,000 per annum.  Even if the Carlow sugar factory could process the beet, the additional haulage costs would be £400,000.  To haul the beet by road, it is estimated that more than 100 articulated trucks would be needed.  The capital cost of this would be approximately £3 million and we can well imagine the effect that more than 100 articulated trucks would have on our roads, particularly the road between New Ross and Thurles.  I travel it quite often, it is one of the worst roads in the country and I would hate to meet an articulated truck on any part of it.</P>
    <P>Additional fuel usage must also be an item of great concern because it is estimated that 180,000 gallons of diesel would be needed to haul the beet by road as against 50,000 gallons by rail.  It is in the national interest that this saving in fuel should be continued if the Government are intent on conserving energy and I have no reason to believe otherwise. The cost of beet growing would be substantially increased if the rail transport was replaced by road haulage to Thurles and any other sugar factory.  Road freight rates are higher than those for rail.  Road freight costs £6 per ton whereas the rail freight is in excess of £3 per ton.  County Wexford grows 25 per cent of the national beet crop and the area is noted for its very high yields.  Anything which would render it uneconomic to continue growing the crop would have grave implications for the Sugar Company.  It is most unlikely that the acreage would be taken up by any other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the ground in Wexford is ideal for growing beet.  The expertise of the Wexford people in beet-growing would be lost and expertise in this matter cannot be acquired overnight. A former Taoiseach of the Minister's party once said that 25,000 jobs were estimated to come within the ambit of the Sugar Company.  If anything happens to diminish the attractiveness of beet-growing in south Wexford, which accounts for <Col N="974" /> one-quarter of the nation's crop, the Sugar Company will fall on hard times. It is well to remember that 25,000 jobs depend on it.  In south Wexford there is a turnover of £7 million per year, £5,500,000 of this being paid to the farmers in the area.  However, the effects would extend far beyond the direct loss in sugar production.  Wexford is the most intensive tillage county, it has the highest acreage of wheat and barley and it is the second highest in feeding barley and root crops.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion refers to passenger or freight service.  If the Minister listens a little more attentively he will find out why I am placing so much emphasis on the carriage of beet from Wexford.  If beet-growing diminished, other forms of tillage would decrease also <Col N="975" /> and this would be a serious national loss at a time when strenuous efforts are being made to increase tillage farming and to replace imported feedstuffs with homegrown products.  Farmers in Wexford have a large investment in machinery which is absolutely necessary for beet production and much of this investment would be lost if beet-growing ceased.  I would point out that approximately 120 people are employed on contracting.  This is the growing, spraying and harvesting of the crop.  As tillage farming is more intensive than other farming methods both directly and in the off-farm jobs it creates, a change to other farming systems would aggravate the serious unemployment problem in Wexford where 5,500 people are unemployed at the moment.  There would be losses also in the Sugar Company, in CIE and those involved in haulage.</P>
      <P>The expansion of traffic through Rosslare Harbour has been remarkable in recent years.  This has been so because the natural and commercial benefits of the short sea routes to the UK and Europe are recognised.  The investment by CIE in the additional pier and other port works is evidence of this.  In their development plan for Rosslare Harbour, Wexford County Council have set out a framework for the orderly development of the area and have committed substantial capital investment for the infrastructure of the area.  The number of passengers has increased from 383,000 in 1970 to 477,000 in 1979.  Therefore, it is crucial that nothing be done at this stage of the port's development that would hinder its growth or be interpreted in Ireland or abroad as a lessening of the national commitment to its development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a case being made at Rosslare Harbour for a limited liability company to co-ordinate the efforts of the many groups involved in Rosslare port.  They are working well but as individual sections and in a rather ragged fashion.  There is a definite need for co-ordination.  In this connection I mention the reference to Shannon recently quoted in the British press and which would be ideal for Rosslare. I ask the Minister to take a personal <Col N="976" /> interest in the excellent idea which includes the rail service.  This would be a necessary element in the successful development of the area.  However, the Minister should be warned that there are fixed ideas in his Department with regard to this development.  Any new project will cause headaches but this project will justify any number of headaches.</P>
    <P>There is also a suggestion that the Waterford-New Ross line be closed.  This would have a detrimental effect on the viability of the Rosslare Harbour-Limerick line.  Albatros Fertilisers use this line extensively and also use the station for storage.  It can be said that 400 tons of fertiliser can be moved from New Ross to any Munster destination within 24 hours.  It is a speedy and clean operation. The service is vital at peak periods and the closure of the section would have the effect of raising the price of fertilisers thus making Albatros more vulnerable to imported fertilisers with a resultant loss of employment in a town where unemployment is at 1,100.  Unemployment has trebled in the past six years.  In addition, CIE would have to lay off their own staff in the depot.  The line is also used for the transport of cement and for agricultural machinery to a lesser degree.  With imagination, goodwill and commitment I am sure this line could be of benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>The primary function of the services is to bring passengers to and from Rosslare. A feature of the traffic on the trains is the variation in the number of passengers from day-to-day and week-to-week.  This poses special problems in the provision of alternative services.  On a number of services five or more buses would be required to replace the train services. Special account must be taken of the fact that the trains are servicing the boats. Travellers could not plan journeys to Rosslare Harbour if they were not sure of getting to the port.  This would reduce the number of passengers and would affect adversely the viability of the shipping services.  Boat fares from rail passengers are in the region of £175,000. Sealink are obliged to provide an economic service and there would be a grave danger of the discontinuance of the <Col N="977" /> service.  This would have serious repercussions in the entire south.  It would deprive the area of a major facility and would affect seriously the tourist industry generally.  It would also make the area less attractive for industrial and other developments.</P>
    <P>At this stage I appeal to all Members to support the motion.  It has been debated on a number of occasions both here and elsewhere.  Wisdom has always prevailed and the line has been kept open.  I ask all to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes that the authority to terminate train services is vested in the Board of CIE but urges CIE to take due account of the social and economic implications for the regions affected of any such decision and of the £86 million subvention limit for 1983 as set out in the Book of Estimates published on 18 November 1982.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let me first make it clear in relation to the motion by the Opposition that CIE are not considering the closure to either passengers or freight of the Rosslare to Dublin line.  Where the line from Limerick to Rosslare is concerned the only proposal under consideration by the Board of CIE is the termination of passenger services on the Limerick Junction to Waterford section.  For that reason I interrupted &mdash; and I apologise for doing so &mdash; Deputy Byrne, because much of his contribution was based on concern for freight services to and from Wexford which are not at all threatened or up for discussion.</P>
      <P>The terms of the 1958 Transport Act passed by this House place on CIE the obligation to provide reasonable, efficient and economical transport services. Consistent with this, CIE may, subject to certain procedures, terminate uneconomic train services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must emphasise that I as Minister have no statutory power to compel CIE <Col N="978" /> either to operate or terminate particular services.  Deputies will be aware that CIE have for some time been considering the termination of passenger services on the Limerick Junction to Waterford line.  My predecessor, Deputy Wilson, was familiar with this proposal and indeed in a reply which he issued on 3 December 1982, scarcely two months ago, to representations on the subject referred to CIE's statutory powers under the 1958 Act and to the need for CIE, like other semi-State bodies to take all practicable measures to reduce demands on the Exchequer, particularly in relation to services which were not adequately used by the public.  He also stated that, while he would regret the withdrawal of any services, the present serious financial situation was such that consideration would have to be given to all practical options. I may say more on that.  Deputy Wilson, who to my surprise signed this motion, refused to meet a deputation of Fianna Fáil TDs at their request to discuss this, whereas I have agreed to meet Deputies of all sides before a final decision is made on the matter.  That, I hope, will take place shortly.</P>
    <P>This question is now a live issue because of the need for the economies to contain CIE subvention requirements in 1983 within the limit of £86 million.  CIE's deficit on subventable activities in 1982 amounted to some £106 million and I have no doubt that the requirement to live within a subvention of £86 million in 1983 means that CIE, and indeed the community generally, face some very tough decisions in the public transport arena in the current year.  I must remind the House also that the subvention limit of £86 million was imposed on CIE by Deputy Wilson and the previous Government who were well aware that such a reduced subvention would inevitably necessitate hardship and perhaps unpalatable economies.  I should mention that the CIE chairman had indicated to my predecessor the type of measures which would be necessary to enable the board to live within a subvention limit of £86 million which he set.</P>
    <P>I as Minister am particularly anxious to ensure, as indeed are the Government, <Col N="979" /> that no one section of the population or area of the country is asked to bear more than its fair share of the necessary economies in public transport.  It is a matter for CIE to formulate the necessary proposals for living within the subvention limit of £86 million and I have asked CIE to develop an overall strategy for this purpose.  It will be the Government's concern to ensure that CIE's proposals are achievable and compatible with the subvention limit.</P>
    <P>If we could do as we liked and if our finances were unlimited we would prefer that there would be no question of reducing services.  Given the real state of affairs there is no option but to take a hard look at every service area.  This is not to imply that possibilities for savings or improvements elsewhere will not be examined. Deputies can be assured that the board have been instructed to see to it that no other area of spending and no section where there is room for improvement in financial performance is excluded from scrutiny.  That is why I emphasise the request I have made to the board for an overall strategy, one in effect which will consider all options, to enable them to live within the subvention limit.</P>
    <P>On account of various representations made to me by public representatives regarding the question of the termination of passenger services on the Limerick Junction-Waterford line I felt that it would be undesirable to have this particular economy measure dealt with in isolation from the overall strategy for operating within a subvention limit of £86 million in 1983.  Therefore, on 14 January last I asked CIE not to take a decision on the question of issue of notice of intention to terminate passenger services on the line so as to allow time for the wider strategy to emerge and to permit the consideration of views which local interests had sought to put to me &mdash; those local interests that had been refused the time by the previous Minister to allow them to put their views to him.  The board, although of course not statutorily required to do so, acceded to my request. There is, therefore, further opportunity for local interests to make whatever case <Col N="980" /> they consider appropriate before a decision is taken in this matter.</P>
    <P>I should point out that in making my request to CIE I was not taking up any position in regard to the future of the service.  I myself will be meeting in the next few weeks the local Deputies and Senators and local bodies to hear their suggestions about the line.  CIE argue that the numbers of passengers on the train service between Limerick Junction and Waterford are light and even in the high peak season could be comfortably catered for by two or three single-deck buses.  CIE also say that on the Limerick Junction-Waterford route they already provide four bus services daily each way and would, I understand, provide an additional service between Limerick and Waterford for the specific purpose of linking up with the rail service which will continue to connect Waterford and Rosslare Harbour.  It should also be noted that although Rosslare is one of our major ports of entry there has been a significant decline in the number of foot passengers requiring rail transport.  CIE have indicated that the numbers involved have dropped from 142,000 in 1970 to over 58,000 in 1981, a decline of approximately 59 per cent.  Not all of these, of course, would have been seeking to avail of the rail service to points beyond Waterford.</P>
    <P>From the details which I have given Deputies will appreciate the factors which influenced CIE to develop their proposals for the termination of these services.  While there is probably wide acceptance that the present services are uneconomical there appears to be a view that the services can be revived by new carriages, more investment, better marketing or better co-ordination with the ferry services.  While I would accept that the rolling stock in use on the line is well past its best, I think it unlikely that upgrading the service would justify the investment involved.</P>
    <P>On the wider issue of closure of lines, there have over the years been a series of cutbacks in rail services and, indeed, the Opposition while in Government have presided over many of these.  There has always been a public outcry about the <Col N="981" /> termination of railway services.  It is understandable, of course, that no one likes to see a rail service terminated.  The railway is regarded as a precious amenity even if it is used only occasionally and by a small fraction of the population.  It would appear that there is a very deep nostalgia for the railways among a great part of our population, most of whom never use the railways.  The question arises, is nostalgia enough to justify the cost involved?</P>
    <P>Whatever the ultimate decision by the CIE board regarding passenger services on the Limerick Junction-Waterford line the line itself will remain open for freight services.  This leaves open the possibility that passenger services, if discontinued, could be resumed in the future.  The dilemmas which face the public transport industry are not unique to Ireland.  In Britain, for example, there is a vigorous debate in progress on a new report which has been prepared on the future of the railways in that country.  The report, known as the Serpell Report, suggested that railway planners are too optimistic in their view of the future and see little prospect of better financial performance on the railways.  They believe that better results could be achieved by staff reductions, sale of some elements of the business of British Rail and more effective use of facilities.  The report is criticised strongly by railway interests and its merits and defects are being hotly argued by commentators.  Some of the issues involved have their parallels here but in many ways we are more sympathetic to the issues involved.</P>
    <P>There is no magic formula whereby CIE will cease to be a major charge on public funds.  It has long been recognised that a national railway network cannot be maintained without support from the Exchequer.  More recently, CIE bus services, particularly in urban areas, have been incurring large deficits.  Where Exchequer funds are involved, there must, however, be public accountability. This is a simple, well tried and long accepted principle.  CIE's annual subvention requirements have been escalating at an alarming rate.  I recognise this is due <Col N="982" /> in part to factors outside the board's control. However, when regard is had to the public disenchantment with at least some of the board's services it becomes a matter for this House to consider what can be done to ensure that the vast sums being paid in subvention are being used in the most effective possible manner.</P>
    <P>Due to the unfortunate and necessary adjournment of the Dáil yesterday in tragic circumstances my contribution to this debate is of necessity curtailed.  I had a great deal more I wished to say.  I would like to say, in conclusion to my limited contribution to this debate, that we have got to face up to the problems that confront us.  As I am sure the Deputies opposite know, we have a catastrophic economic situation.  There is simply no way to redeem ourselves from this situation except by major cuts in services and major increases in revenue.  The £86 million subvention limit set by the previous Government and by Deputy Wilson, when Minister for Transport, represents £22 million less than the outturn of the CIE deficit for 1982.  If that deficit was simply to remain the same for 1983 it would imply cuts of £22 million.  Unfortunately, given that inflation is projected to be something of the order of 10 per cent and that the CIE deficit has over the last decade increased by many times the rate of inflation, we are talking of limits set which imply major cutbacks.  I would be interested to hear what the former Minister for Transport has to say about how this £86 million limit, which he set is to be achieved, I do not make that as a party political point.  I make it as the Minister for Transport who now has the task, on behalf of the House, and on behalf of all our citizens, to see that CIE live within that subvention.  I would be very glad to hear the ideas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my duty to second the motion so ably proposed by Deputy Hugh Byrne.  First of all, I would like to welcome the announcement by the Minister that the rail line from Rosslare Harbour to Dublin is to remain.  However, I am still concerned about the line from Rosslare Harbour to Limerick Junction from a freight and a passenger point of view.  From the information I have it has already been discussed at CIE board level that those lines are to close.</P>
      <P>The termination of rail services would have a serious effect on the beet industry in Wexford and Thurles.  In the region of 40 per cent of beet supplied to Thurles comes from County Wexford by rail.  If the farmers have to change to another system of transport beet growing will no longer be economical and as a result Thurles sugar factory will no longer be viable and approximately 600 jobs will be lost between the factory closure and spin-off services.  This would be disastrous in an area where already we have a high unemployment rate.  Many Wexford farmers are totally dependent on beet for survival in these difficult times. Therefore, it is essential for the economy, particularly where the south east region is concerned, that the beet industry is not affected by the proposed withdrawal of rail services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both lines mentioned in the motion are very important for freight services.  They presently cater for roll-on-roll-off services through Waterford port for beet, cement and fertiliser transportation.  To create a situation where those firms would have to make heavy expenditure to change to a new system of transportation would put many of the firms out of business with a consequent loss of jobs.  If the rail lines, particularly the one on to Limerick Junction, cease to operate we will have no option but to use the roads. I have to agree with Deputy Byrne when <Col N="984" /> he says that the roads in the south east region are possibly the worst in Ireland, if not the worst in Europe and with so little money available to local authorities to continue even the ordinary maintenance of the roads there is no hope that they will be brought up to the standards required for heavy trucks.</P>
    <P>Rosslare Harbour is described by many people as the gateway to Europe.  It has seen a tremendous increase in the amount of traffic going through the harbour in recent years.  Large amounts of money have been invested by CIE and Wexford County Council in developing the harbour.  It is very important that nothing is done at this stage to hinder further development at the port.  The withdrawal of the rail services, in effect, would mean that Rosslare would no longer be acceptable as a port.  In fact, I have to state that we would surely be the laughing stock of Europe if we expected people to use the port that no longer had rail services to the southern part of the country.</P>
    <P>A number of passenger services operate to Waterford catering for people arriving by boat, people travelling to work and for children travelling to school.  If this rail line is discontinued those commuters will have no alternative available to them.  It must be acknowledged that the railway lines to Arklow and to Limerick Junction service passenger boats and if they are discontinued people could not avail of Rosslare Harbour to enter or leave the country.  If Rosslare Harbour is to remain viable the present position of train-boat service must be maintained because if not it will have a tremendous effect on the tourist industry in the south east region.  The future development of tourism is very important to this region and to County Wexford in particular.  According to predictions it will be the major growth industry in the world during the next decade. It is very important that we have the facilities in order to avail of this growth industry.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that 50,000 people came through Rosslare from different parts of Europe during the past year.  The ongoing development of tourism needs a <Col N="985" /> major rail service.  Euro-Rail has become a major part of the tourist industry, but for Rosslare Harbour to benefit a proper rail link is both desirable and essential.</P>
    <P>We hear talk of up to £100,000 being saved in respect of the line from Rosslare Harbour to Limerick Junction being closed.  I suggest that it is the duty of the Minister to investigate the entire CIE operation in the area.  I say this because of the competition there between buses and trains, because of the situation that persists whereby trains leave minutes before a passenger boat arrives from Fishguard.  It is in respect of such matters that major improvements could be made in the operation of the system.  I would say that £100,000 would be the least amount that could be saved if the system were operated properly.</P>
    <P>I do not think it right that CIE should single out the line to Rosslare Harbour as not being economic.  It is probably more economic than many of the other lines on which the company operate services.  In making such judgments CIE must consider other factors such as the long-term consequences of the discontinuation of the service, the effects it would have on the Thurles sugar factory and on the many farmers involved in the beet industry, not to mention the consequential loss of jobs in an area already devastated by unemployment. Another factor is the effect that the withdrawal of the service would have on tourism. It is very important that part of the £86 million subvention is allocated towards keeping both rail lines operating in the future because in the Wexford area we are totally dependent on tourism and on the beet industry.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister, too, to investigate the possibility of the setting up of a limited liability company for Rosslare Harbour on the same lines as SFADCo and to ensure that proper freight and passenger rail services both to and from Rosslare are maintained.  Rosslare Harbour has become downgraded in terms of its rail facilities in the past 10 to 15 years. The rolling stock is antiquated.  We must update Rosslare as a port for the benefit both of Ireland and of Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it intriguing that this motion should appear in the name of the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Wilson, who, I understand, a week before leaving office refused to meet a deputation to discuss this issue when he was requested to do so by his colleague, Deputy Aylward.  That could be indicative of the whole attitude of the Irish people towards CIE.  On the one hand we are saying that we need a particular service and on the other hand we are expected to perform on a commercial basis.  I understand that only one railway system in all of Europe operates on a commercially profitable basis.  That is the Swiss rail system.  The Minister is to be commended for persuading the board of CIE to defer a decision to close the line in question.  The whole matter must be considered on the basis of a comprehensive plan.  I think that either the board of CIE or others there are making a political football out of this line and they are doing something that is bordering on political blackmail.</P>
      <P>We are told that £100,000 would be saved by the withdrawal of the service but I suggest that such an amount is not sufficient to buy CIE's requirement of 7-UP or Coke for 12 months.  The Minister is right in saying that the whole system must be considered in the context of a comprehensive plan.</P>
      <P>We should give serious consideration to what we expect from CIE.  We are talking about a social service and naturally we must expect the company to perform in as satisfactory a manner as possible. There is a problem in regard to the elimination of existing shortfalls.  Perhaps that could be considered with a view to doing something about eliminating that shortfall and talking about a new agreement between CIE and the Government. As one who lives in the region in question and many of whose constituents are employed in CIE, I am aware of the disastrous effects that would result from the closure of the Rosslare to Limerick Junction line.  These effects would be felt in both the mid-western and south-eastern regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a whole spin-off social factor there that would be brought into play in <Col N="987" /> the event of the line being closed.  The closure is being resisted by all the public bodies, the regional development authorities, the trade unions, the local authorities and the chambers of commerce.  At a meeting of these bodies on 12 April last year the appeal that the passenger line would be kept open was reaffirmed.  I have a particular interest in that in so far as I believe that its closure would affect the long-term prospects for tourism in the area.  I say this because the line is being used increasingly by students from Europe and if these people were to be deprived of that access from Rosslare Harbour, there could be damaging long-term effects for tourism in the whole area.</P>
    <P>The area served by this line has experienced a rapid population growth of 16 per cent in the decade leading up to 1981.  If this trend continues we will be talking in terms of an increase of 16,000 in the next 18 years.  Manufacturing employment in the area has increased by 20 per cent in the decade leading up to 1982 and this must continue to cater for the growing population.  Any withdrawal of the rail service in question would be detrimental to the region and its infrastructure in terms of its industries and the spin-off industries involved.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the beet-growing industry in the area.  The withdrawal of the rail service would have the effect of putting on to the roads traffic that they are not capable of taking in their present form.</P>
    <P>As part of the review plan I urge the Minister to think about development of a national transport policy.  The party I represent subscribe to a public transport policy but we do not consider that this whole concept has been dealt with fully or fairly by any Government up to now. There was an Oireachtas review body which considered CIE in the context of an overall plan and who made some very good recommendations.  For instance, they recommended that where applicable subvention payments should be made above rather than below the line in the accounts of CIE.  They suggested that subvention payments would consequently <Col N="988" /> be treated as receipts along with revenue from rates and fares in compiling working accounts rather than as a provision to cover losses.  The committee went on to say that in practical terms the impact of such a change would be small and would not reduce the cost of running the rail service but that, nevertheless, it would be more consistent with the logic of EEC regulations.  CIE and all the rail systems under their control should be looked at.  The Minister is right when he asks CIE to defer their decision to give local interests an opportunity to put forward their case.  I commend this line of action to the Minister.  I commend the Minister for preventing the closure of the line although strictly speaking that is the legal function of CIE, not of the Minister. I am glad he used his good offices in recent times when such a decision was on the cards.</P>
    <P>To close this passenger service, taking into account the social advantages it provides to the region concerned, would be a disaster.  The West Clare railway, which would be a mammoth tourist attraction today, was closed for £19,000.  To take such a decision in respect of the Limerick-Rosslare line would be looked at equally ludicrously in ten years time. The Minister should ensure that CIE take a look at themselves and ensure that their operation is made a more attractive proposition and, where possible, project a better image to the public and encourage them to use those services.  There is a great deal of selling to be done by CIE in this area.  I strongly oppose any closure of this line and urge the Minister and CIE to look at all the difficulties involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion and compliment Deputy Prendergast for his support and the honest way he expressed his views.  As a man from the Limerick area he appreciates the damage that could be done if a hasty decision is taken by CIE.  I agree with what he said about the West Clare line and the lines closed in Dublin.  I am not here to make a political football out of this because members of all political parties in the counties involved have pulled together in recent years to support the retention of <Col N="989" /> passenger and freight services on this line.  The Minister said they are closing the Limerick to Rosslare line for passenger services only, but that is merely the thin end of the wedge.  Successive Ministers have been too lenient in allowing CIE to close down services in many areas. If we allow this to happen in our area, it will be the beginning of the end for that line.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay a tribute to Senator Ferris who spearheaded the campaign for the retention of this line.  As a member of the Government parties I am sure he will use his influence to ensure that the Minister arrives at the right decision. Senator Ferris and all the Oireachtas Members for South Tipperary, county councils and members of corporations in South Tipperary, Limerick, Waterford and Kilkenny have met on a number of occasions in recent years and have been unanimous in their decisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I did not mean to omit North Tipperary because you too have been involved and played your part in these meetings.  All public representatives in the region were united and it would be a pity if a rash decision to close the line was taken.</P>
      <P>We could look at other areas in which CIE are involved.  There are what I call &ldquo;wanderly wagons&rdquo; travelling on our roads, empty buses which do not stop and empty buses which should be carrying the old age pensioners who are supposed to have free travel.  These services are wasting taxpayers' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities have very little money to maintain the roads, never mind to improve them, and have reached a crisis situation.  The traffic on our roads today is very dangerous in every sense of the word.  CIE are responsible to the people and they are wasting taxpayers' money.  I ask my two colleagues on the Government benches and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to use their good offices to ensure that the Minister reaches the right decision and that the people in <Col N="990" /> CIE will listen to commonsense.</P>
    <P>In my view, the argument that £x million is provided each year stands.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is being mean, but any Minister in any Government will try to get value for money.  I am sure CIE could make economies in other areas, instead of triggering off a situation which could have terrible effects in the areas of tourism, jobs, farming and so on, as well as making our roads more dangerous.</P>
    <P>It has been shown what the effects of this closure would be in the Thurles area, which has a sugar industry.  In 1982, 40 per cent of the beet went through the Thurles area and that amount is expected to be even higher this year.  At a time of mass unemployment we have to take a serious look at our native industries if we are to provide extra jobs.  I do not doubt the Minister's sincerity, but I do not think this House should allow CIE to close the passenger line.  If they do they will regret it.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of jobs at stake not alone in the beet factory but on farms which could be affected by that decision. We should look at this problem very calmly because, as was highlighted by Deputy Prendergast, there were very expensive, hare-brained decisions taken in the past.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the Department of Social Welfare will be liable for £500,000 in social welfare benefits to redundant workers in the first year of the closure. Many politicians ask why we do not provide these people with jobs, which would be more satisfying for their families and themselves, rather than have them on the dole which makes many of them very unhappy.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that the additional cost of conveying beet to Thurles by road rather than rail will be £600,000 per annum. Even if the Carlow factory could process the beet, the additional haulage cost would be £400,000.  This would have many side effects.  The cost of growing beet would increase very considerably if rail transport were replaced by road haulage in the Thurles area, as has been highlighted by previous speakers. <Col N="991" /> Twenty per cent of Ireland's total beet crop was grown in the County Wexford area and farmers in that county are to be complimented on providing valuable employment in the factories to which the beet is sent and also for the creation of employment in CIE.  I have said before that we will have to look very seriously at the development of our basic industry, which is agriculture.</P>
    <P>I was a little disappointed with the Minister's speech.  I do not wish to be critical of him, but wish him well in his very important office and also his Ministers of State.  I am sure that they will do their best.  At the beginning of the debate the Minister was a little confused regarding Deputy Hugh Byrne's remarks on the effects which would follow on the closing down of the passenger service in the areas of tourism, jobs, agriculture, chaos on the roads, additional expense and unemployment. When he considers the points made by previous speakers, he will see that they have great common sense.  We have, in the past, suffered from the belief that if a decision is made in the CIE boardroom, there will be very few long-term effects.  However, in the rural areas their shortsighted decisions have cost jobs, the loss of tourist attractions like the West Clare railway and caused additional expenditure in avoiding the chaos of Dublin traffic.  When they closed down the lines a few years ago to make a small saving, they were not looking very far ahead.  Had they listened to the commonsense suggestions of the local authorities in all the effected counties representing all shades of political opinion, CIE's outlook would have been broader, their decisions more sensible and the whole nation would have benefited.</P>
    <P>I appeal to my respected colleagues, Senator Ferris, Deputy Prendergast and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to use their good offices with the Minister concerned to avoid the fatal mistake of closing down the passenger services, leaving it open to close them down fully.  If the line is closed down, in a short time the Minister for the Environment will be seeking extra millions which will put the present figure in the shade.  Our roads are already falling <Col N="992" /> apart because of heavy traffic and are becoming daily more dangerous.  If we spare in one Department and have to spend tenfold in another, that is false economy.  Please God, we will not long be in the present recessionary period, but will soon come out of it, our young people will gain employment, there will be more industry in the area and farming will generate more jobs.  It would cost millions to keep the line in proper repair if it is not fully used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few points to raise on the amendment before us. Being a TD from County Wexford, I am extremely interested in the retention of the passenger services on this railway line if at all possible.  The importance of Rosslare Harbour to the economy of our area does not need to be stressed.  Many other speakers have already mentioned that. One point, however, needs underlining. The number of foot passengers using the rail services from Rosslare has been declining and we must ask ourselves why this is so.  We could request CIE to review their timetable and rationalise their services so that the trains do not depart a moment, or even up to an hour, before the arrival of the scheduled ferry services. I know that with ferry services there are delays due to weather conditions and that various other parameters have to be taken into account.  However, at the moment and for some time past the scheduled departure of the trains has not corresponded with the arrival of passengers on the ferries and this is causing much adverse criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the fact that Rosslare is the fastest growing area in the country. At present one of the most interesting developments in the tourist business in <Col N="993" /> Britain and on the Continent has been the growth of Eurorail.  It is in operation here but has not had the success which it should have had.  The use of Rosslare, combined with a really up-to-date passenger service to Dublin and to Limerick Junction from Rosslare, would be of tremendous benefit to all the neighbouring counties.  I am one of the many TDs who have been pressing the Minister to meet a deputation to put our views and see if at all possible we could save this line. Indeed, the Minister has agreed to meet us next Thursday to listen to our different cases.  Only today I was in touch with SERDO and our county development officer in County Wexford arranging for them to be here to put as strong a case as possible outlining why the retention of all of the passenger services is essential.  I will do all in my power to see that CIE rural passenger services are maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport and at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Donnellan) Minister of State at the Department of Transport and at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Donnellan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport and at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Wilson for having allowed Deputy Avril Doyle say a few words on this motion.  My contribution will be rather brief.</P>
      <P>In looking at transport needs and policy it must be remembered that we live in a world which is changing at an enormous rate.  If transport is to serve the community and to facilitate social development it must respond to all of these changes. The problem for everybody concerned with railways &mdash; whether as politicians, managers, engineers, trade unionists or onlookers &mdash; is that the radical changes over the past 50 years have led to a dramatic fall in the pattern of demand for the railways and a consequent decline in their financial fortunes.  The railways still have many advantages and attractions for particular transport needs &mdash; for moving very large numbers, for bulk commodities and for dangerous substances.  There are arguments related to safety, environmental factors and energy utilisation that are also relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side there is no way to demonstrate, in the circumstances of today, that it is possible to operate a railway system on a commercially viable <Col N="994" /> basis.  This problem is not peculiar to Ireland.  It applies equally to Britain, France, Germany, Japan and indeed virtually every country in the world.  It means that the maintenance and operation of a rail network depends on a very substantial measure of financial support from the Exchequer &mdash; and that means from the taxpayer.  It is essential that any discussion of railway policy or of individual railway services should face this problem frankly.  There is no advantage in ignoring or masking this inescapable feature of railway operation.</P>
    <P>This brings up the question of our inconsistent attitude towards transport users.  We tend to take up different attitudes depending on whether we see ourselves as motorists, pedestrians, public transport users or taxpayers.  Most of us of course are all of these at different times and we naturally seek to have the best of all worlds.  We advocate the retention of an extensive public transport system, including a rail network, but resist efforts to persuade us to leave our cars at home. We express dissatisfaction about an inadequate level of service but complain about the magnitude of the investment costs and operating subventions.  We criticise the restriction of competition in the road freight sector but expect the railways to continue to provide freight services.  Finally we reserve the right not to use at all the public transport services which are provided for us.</P>
    <P>Governments and transport planners everywhere are faced with critical problems about the railways.  Different Governments have tried different solutions. In Northern Ireland, for example, where distances are relatively short, policy has been based mainly on the road network leading to the closure of all railways except a very small and basic network. Here &mdash; as in Britain &mdash; there have been closures over the years but we have endeavoured to preserve a system that would serve the principal centres, based mainly on a radial network.  Despite the progress of CIE, under successive Governments, in pursuing efficiency the railways are constantly confronted by problems of huge investment needs and <Col N="995" /> increasing operating deficits.</P>
    <P>This is just part of the background against which we must consider the subject of this motion and everything that it implies for CIE, for our transport services and for the country.  It is good to see that Deputies are prepared to discuss these difficult matter constructively.</P>
    <P>From one end of the year to the other a service like the train between Limerick Junction and Rosslare trundles along without either notice or much support from the people it is meant to serve. Except in the peak season the train only has a busload aboard and really cannot justify itself in financial terms.  It is, at least, debatable whether there is sufficient justification to warrant retention of such services on the basis of vague social and economic considerations.  However, the moment there is any threat to that kind of service it becomes vital to everybody within any distance of the line and generates a mass of representations involving local people, Government and CIE itself, in a welter of activity which may be both futile and wasteful and which might never have been called for if the service had been given the support it deserved.</P>
    <P>Many of these issues might never have arisen if our public transport services were adequately supported.  Let me declare quite plainly that the Government are in favour of promoting and developing public transport and that the strategies in the transport field to be pursued by the Department of Transport will generally favour the professional carrier. But these strategies cannot be developed or brought to fruition without support from transport users, from local representative bodies and from CIE itself.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent particularly on local bodies to take cognisance of existing public transport services which are available and to see them as benefits to their areas rather than waiting until they are threatened with withdrawal for want of support. In these difficult times, with energy costs in particular at levels that could not have been imagined ten years ago, the most economical means of transport are likely to be in well-supported public <Col N="996" /> transport services, And well supported public transport services will also pay off in terms of reduced congestion on the roads, more safety for people who have to be on the roads, including pedestrians and cyclists, and less pollution in our towns, cities and countryside.  The role of CIE will be to support the Government in renewed efforts to ensure that the services it provides are adequate and give satisfaction.</P>
    <P>On the other hand services which are superfluous will have to be listed for termination. We can no longer afford the luxury of subsidising services for which there is little or no real need.  We must be prepared to examine this aspect in a rational manner and not be overwhelmed by emotive arguments.  We have to recognise that transport requirements have been greatly altered by the prevalence of the private motor car.  There was in 1980, one car for every 4.6 people, as against one for every 10.2 people about 15 years ago.  As regards rail services, arguments can be advanced on grounds of energy conservation, the oil crisis and so on, but even at this level, the value of lightly used trains is questionable.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to refer to some opinions expressed from the other side of the House, particularly when people talked about the closure of the freight services.  There is no question of the closure of the freight service.  One would begin to wonder whether that continued expression of opinion from the benches opposite was not the proposal that they intended putting into operation had they remained in Government. When opportunity arises perhaps Deputy Wilson would express an opinion on it so that at least the Deputies sitting beside him would understand that there is no threat to the freight service in that area.</P>
    <P>Indeed it would be fair to say that proposed closures of this nature have arisen before.  Regardless of when or from where they have emanated one might find oneself on this or that side of the House.  It might well be a good idea if we politicians, rather than being critical of one another in regard to proposed closures of this nature, or indeed in regard to many of the closures that have <Col N="997" /> taken place many years ago, would come together, if not politically then as a unit, to devise some sort of comprehensive transport policy so that we might agree on the closure of certain uneconomic lines, or we might, as politicians in Opposition always advocate, retain services which are totally uneconomic or open services which have been closed for years.</P>
    <P>I heard one Deputy talking about the West Clare scene.  In the constituency I represent, the line to Connemara was closed years ago.  That was the line between Galway and Clifden.  There are many people who say that if the line was in operation at present it would be a big tourist attraction in the area.  Rather than being critical of one another and of a decision which may be made by this Government if we came together and gave good service all around we would not waste the time of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister has agreed to meet the people involved and have a chat about this.  It would be unfair to make a comparison between the present Minister and the previous one, Deputy Wilson, who refused to meet a deputation.  In a letter which he wrote to a member of his party, Liam Aylward, on 3 December 1982 he stated: &ldquo;You are no doubt aware that CIE are empowered under the Transport Act 1958 to terminate uneconomic rail services subject to certain statutory requirements and procedures&rdquo;.  In the last paragraph of the letter he stated: &ldquo;As the primary decision regarding the future of the line is a matter for the board I do not consider that meeting a deputation would serve any useful purpose at this time&rdquo;.  He said he had taken note of his representations and would pass them on to CIE.  I am sure that as a result of the previous Minister passing on these representations to CIE and of the present Minister meeting a deputation, there is a good chance that the request in the motion may be acceded to.  If that would serve all the interests which were mentioned tonight it would be of benefit to that part of the country.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his elevation to <Col N="998" /> this position.  I also congratulate the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, on his appointment as Minister for Transport, and Deputy Donnellan, although from my reading of the record of the House he does not seem to have been given any role in the Department of Transport.

      <P>That is what I thought.  I thank my fellow Deputies on this side of the House for making a very good case for maintaining the Rosslare-Limerick Junction line.  The point was made that the Deputies concerned were talking about freight and in his simple and devious western way the Minister said that perhaps the reason they spoke about freight was that they found that their own Minister was thinking of discontinuing freight services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made it clear that it was a director of CIE who mentioned the possibility of discontinuing freight and if a director does not know what may be in danger I do not know who would know.  The Minister said that full competence rested with CIE in this matter.</P>
      <P>I do not need to reiterate the arguments advanced from this side of the House.  Whether it is freight or passenger a strong case was made for maintaining the service.  There are implications for the population and for industries in the area.  This argument holds whether we are dealing with freight or road passenger services.  The roads are being hammered by vehicles which are much heavier than was ever envisaged.  I was in the area referred to and made an extensive tour of the roads.  I fully accept the arguments made on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very good argument was made on the basis of the economy.  Deputy Hugh Byrne made the point that the cost of <Col N="999" /> transporting goods and passengers by rail may be substantially lower than the cost of transporting them by road.  With regard to freight he said that 50,000 gallons of diesel oil by rail did the work of 180,000 gallons on the road.  This is very important.  We hear that there may be a reduction in the cost of oil but it is important to make the best possible use of oil which for the moment we must import.</P>
    <P>The argument was also strongly advanced that tourism would be affected by any deterioration in the rail service.  I am glad that Deputy Prendergast fully supported maintaining all passenger services in this area.  In doing so he was consistent with the Labour Party manifesto of 1982 which promised that the Labour Party would dedicate themselves to maintaining rail.  We are confident we have strong allies in the Labour Party in maintaining all passenger services in that area.  Suggestions were made that additional passenger facilities should be made available in the area mainly concentrating on the town of Clonmel, which has a population of 14,000-15,000, to give them a link in to the Dublin rail line.  I am sure that with the backing of the Labour Party, the strong arguments advanced on this side of the House and the commitment to provide social amenities, consideration will be given to this suggestion.  I was a little disappointed with the Minister for Transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I regret that I have not more time to deal with the meanderings of the Minister. It is not his business to whimper; it is his business to make decisions and to see to it that this service is not interfered with by CIE.

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Clondalkin Paper Mills Closure.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation to the Chair and the officials in his office for giving me the facility to raise the situation with regard to the Clondalkin Paper Mills on the Adjournment. Briefly, I should like to recall the history of this mill, the last fine paper mill in Ireland.  The operations of the mill were crippled as a result of high energy costs and the inability of the firm to compete in Europe where energy costs of paper mills were heavily subsidised.  However, the prospects for the mill have radically changed as a result of the Kinsale gas situation and I understand the pipeline passes close to the mill.  The Fianna Fáil Government gave an undertaking to have the mill open by 9 June last.  That did not prove possible but that Government carried on negotiations.  They brought the matter close to completion, so much so that all necessary formalities for a takeover by the State were agreed by all parties. At the last minute a legal technicality held the matter up.  I understand provision has been made for acquisition in the Estimates.  The Minister and the new Government are faced with the critical and vital decision which must be made now on whether they will adopt an arrangement which was negotiated through to a conclusion by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time for decision is now.  This is the last opportunity the Government will have to preserve a paper mill for posterity. The liquidator of that company has indicated in an affidavit to the court that very shortly he will break up the equipment and machinery of that mill, which goes back so many years, and sell it off to an American firm.  In my view it will be nothing short of a national tragedy if that is allowed to happen.  If a decision is not made affirmatively and quickly, the situation will go by default.  The machinery will be sold off and we will have lost <Col N="1004" /> the opportunity forever of having a paper making capacity.  We must all know and concede that, once it goes, the cost of setting it up anew will not be met and the country will be deprived of this vital asset.</P>
    <P>Our consumption of paper is enormous. We see the consumption of paper in this House.  We know that the consumption of paper by Government, semi-Government and local government sources would be sufficient to keep the mill going at full tilt.  We spend large sums of money through the IDA and so on in creating new jobs.  We have seen the enormous costs of creating new jobs and setting up the industries.  Why do we not spend a far lesser sum to preserve this industry and to preserve those jobs, rather than spending much larger sums on creating new ones?</P>
    <P>We are often told &mdash; and it has been pointed out by the Taoiseach on many occasions &mdash; that things are very difficult now with the world recession and so on but that in another year or two there will be an upturn and then we will have good times to look forward to.  I want to ask this question.  If we allow vital, key and essential industries like Clondalkin Paper Mills and others to go under and be lost, what will happen when the upturn comes?  These industries will be gone past the point where they can be reclaimed. There will be no advantage in having the upturn at that stage.  When this last remaining mill has gone it will be far too late.</P>
    <P>The production of paper is a highly skilled operation.  It requires great training and skill acquired over generations. The workers of Clondalkin have acquired those skills through the generations. They are anxious, willing and determined to carry on their operation and to preserve their jobs.  They are so willing that they have indicated that they are prepared to go to jail rather than obey a court injunction to evacuate the mill. That gives some indication of their dedication to the preservation of their jobs and the mill.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, it is essential that this matter be faced up to now. If nothing is done now that does not mean <Col N="1005" /> we can make a decision on this later.  We cannot.  The liquidator has sought an injunction from the court.  He has indicated that he is negotiating with an American firm.  Therefore, the whole setup in the factory will collapse within days unless the Government make the decision.</P>
    <P>Before the last election the Labour Party gave a commitment to the workers in Clondalkin that they would do their utmost to ensure that the mill would continue in operation.  I understand the Fine Gael Party also gave an undertaking and commitment to the workers in Clondalkin that they would honour any commitment entered into by the previous Government.</P>

      <P>The previous Government made a commitment to keep the mill open.  I beseech the Minister and the Government to seize this last chance to take over this mill before it slips away forever.  The set up is there.  The reports have been made.  The consultancy firm are organised to run it.  I have no doubt that in years to come it will be a major profit earner for us as a nationalised industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 8 December 1982 the then Minister for Energy submitted a memorandum to the Government seeking a direction from the then Government as to whether the purchase contract for Clondalkin should be signed.  In the course of its presentation to the Government the Attorney General, to whom the Chief State Solicitor has referred the title deeds for examination, advised that a number of issues apparently of a substantive nature would require resolution before any signing took place.  In the event the then Government decided that a decision should be postponed, in their own words, &ldquo;pending further consideration of certain outstanding issues&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I took responsibility in this area, within the limits of the very heavy <Col N="1006" /> demands on all Ministers involved in the preparation of the budget, I have been studying the brief on the Clondalkin issue.  I have met very widely representative delegations organised under the auspices of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who presented their views to me in a very strong and sincere manner.  I realise that it is an important decision from the point of view of the considerations mentioned by Deputy Taylor and also from the point of view of the possible financial commitments into which the Government would be entering which must be weighed up very carefully in view of the very difficult situation we are in with regard to finances and the Government's commitments in the industrial area.</P>
    <P>The position is not quite as Deputy Taylor outlined it.  The assets which the liquidator is seeking to sell are not among the assets which would be bought by the Government in the event of the Government being in a position to go ahead with the takeover.  This is confirmed in a letter from the liquidator which was given to me by the trade unions, a letter to Mr. Peter Keating of the Federated Workers Union of Ireland.  The second last sentence of the letter from the liquidator speaks about the disposal and says that this disposal in the first instance will concentrate on the assets which the Government have indicated they will not require if they proceed with the purchasing of the mill.  So, the problem is not quite as immediate as Deputy Taylor indicated.</P>
    <P>A potential purchaser, a German interest, visited the mill as recently as a fortnight ago and is studying at present the further possibility of his group becoming involved in paper manufacturing here.  It will be some time before this potential purchaser is in a position to indicate finally his intentions in the matter.  Basically that is the situation as it now stands. The Government appreciate the importance of the matter and are anxious that a decision should be taken as soon as possible.  They have to satisfy themselves about the various commitments which would be involved on their part and they also have to bear in mind the other possibilities, such as the one I have just mentioned, <Col N="1007" /> which might enable the manufacturing operation to survive, which we all wish if it is possible.</P>
    <P>I am glad the House has had an opportunity to discuss this subject.  I am glad Deputy Taylor in particular, who I know has taken a major interest in the subject has had the opportunity to put forward his point of view.  It is a point of view, naturally, to which the Government will give serious weight as they will to the <Col N="1008" /> representations made by the workers through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The Government have to take other considerations into account in coming to a final decision in view of their wider commitments.</P>

      <P>The telephone account in this case was issued on 9 November and a final account was issued on 1 December stating that service would be disconnected if payment was not received <Col N="783" /> within seven days.  The bill was not paid until 14 January, an incorrectly endorsed cheque received earlier having been returned to the subscriber on 13 December for correction.</P>
      <P>Arrangements to disconnect were initiated on 13 January for non-payment and were put into effect on 20 January before the payment was credited to the subscriber's account.  Service was restored on 24 January.  The problem in this instance arose from the delay of over two months on the part of the subscriber in making valid payment.  However, as service was disconnected a few days after payment, I have arranged that a reconnection fee will not be charged.</P>

      <P>The Consultative Council on the Ambulance Services was replaced in 1976 by the Ambulance Services Committee.  This is an informal advisory group representative of the Department of Health, the health boards, the Dublin Fire Brigade service and the Army.  Since it was established the committee has made recommendations to my Department on the organisation and development of the ambulance services.  In the past two years the committee has made a number of submissions including recommendations on ambulance design specifications and equipment, radio/telephone communications for health board ambulances, health board major accident plans and grading structures and training requirements for ambulance personnel, which have been taken account of in the organisation and development of these services.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was awarded a prescribed relative's allowance, with effect from 13 August 1982, in respect of her daughter who is providing her with full time care and attention.  On request, she returned her pension book with the last order cashed dated 7 January 1983.  A book at a higher rate payable from 14 January 1983, which included the prescribed relative's allowance, was sent to the head post office in Galway on 10 January 1983 for collection by her.</P>

    <P>As the new pension book may have got <Col N="802" /> lost in the post a replacement book has been issued to the post office on 31 January 1983 and the widow has been notified to this effect.</P>
    <P>There are no arrears due to the claimant in this case as supplementary welfare allowance had been paid by the Western Health Board in respect of the daughter and all arrears of prescribed relative allowance for the period from 13 August 1982 to 13 January 1983 are recoverable by the health board as an offset against the payment made by them.</P>

A penalty of disallowance of benefit for six weeks from 6 December 1982 to 15 January 1983 was then imposed.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 9 November 1982 but failed to qualify in respect of her claim for the period to 1 January 1983 as she had a total of only 15 contributions to her credit in the contribution year 1980-81 governing her claim.  She was informed of this position.</P>
      <P>From 3 January 1983 the contribution year governing her claim changed to the 1981-82 contribution year and as she had 52 contributions paid in that year she qualified for benefit at the maximum rate of £31.65 from 3 January to 17 January 1983, the date of the latest medical evidence received.

      <P>An analysis of socio-economic data collected in respect of parts of Counties Cavan and Monaghan which, although designated as disadvantaged have not been classified as more severely handicapped, is at present being proceeded with in my Department.  This is being undertaken in conjunction with similar data for the many other areas throughout the country also under consideration. The analysis is a prelude to an examination being carried out in due course by the Government and, eventually, by the commission of the case for further adjustments to the disadvantaged areas boundaries here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: The number of women prisoners in Limerick seldom exceeds nine or ten.  As the Deputy will remember, it was decided some months ago, with the Deputy's active support, to provide additional workshops and indoor recreational facilities for the men prisoners in Limerick.  That could only be done by reducing the size of the space available to the women prisoners for outdoor recreation.  The reduction was from approximately 9,880 square feet to approximately 6,196 square feet.  There is no possibility, certainly in the short term, of any extra space becoming available for outdoor recreation in the prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the terms of the Garda Síochána (Appointments) Regulations, 1945 to 1982, applicants for appointment to the force must pass a qualifying educational examination and a competitive interview, which are conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners. The commissioners have informed me that the order of merit of candidates is determined solely on their performance at the competitive interview. Indeed, they have a ruling that any candidate at a competition held by them will be disqualified if they consider that <Col N="832" /> an attempt is being made to influence their decision in his/her case.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána (Appointments) Regulations provide that before appointing any candidate who has qualified for appointment as a result of the competitive interview, the Garda Commissioner has to be satisfied that the candidate fulfils other requirements which are set out in Article 4 of the Garda Síochána (Appointments) Regulations, 1945, as inserted by article 3 of the 1981 regulations.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is not involved in the selection of individual persons for appointment to the force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Garda recruitment is continuing this year, 57 recruits were appointed to the force on 26 January and 45 more are due to be appointed within the next month.  The total number to be recruited in 1983 will depend mainly on the funds provided in the Garda estimates, which have not yet been finalised. The regulations governing Garda recruitment are the Garda Síochána (Appointments) Regulations, 1945 to 1982.</P>
