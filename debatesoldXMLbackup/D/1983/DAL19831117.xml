        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I wish to thank the Opposition for their co-operation in this matter.  In the course of negotiations yesterday it was agreed that, because of the debate, the Minister would be allowed to reply at 7.45 p.m. The wording may not make that too clear, and we are asking the agreement of the House that that is understood.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will understand that the Minister of State made a statement in the House last night and, subsequently, the Minister for Industry and Energy made another statement on television.  It would be appropriate and proper for the Minister for Industry and Energy to make a full statement to the House because there is a fair amount of confusion as to what exactly has been decided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate gives us an opportunity of bringing home to the people the realisation of what would be the situation if the super-levy were to be imposed on us.  Any such move would put a stop to the expansion of our dairy industry.  We rely on our dairy industry to a far greater extent than the other member states.  Our milk production accounts for 4.5 per cent of our GNP. That is four times greater than the figure in any of the other countries of the Community. Milk and beef which cannot be separated account for 10 per cent of our GNP.  That is six times greater than the situation in any of the other member states.  Milk and beef account also for almost 70 per cent of our output which is double the corresponding figure for any of our European partners.  Therefore, in so far as this sector is concerned, we are far more vulnerable than any of our partners. In addition, we produce this milk and beef while using a much smaller input of concentrates or of imported cereals than these other countries.  On average, we use 11 cwt. of concentrates per cow whereas in Holland the figure is 43 cwt. and in Denmark it is 45 cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be seen therefore that our contribution to net exports is far greater than if we were using the factory system that is used in other European countries.  It is not in the interest of this country that our dairy industry be curtailed.  It is an industry that is 95 per cent self-sufficient in <Col N="2676" /> terms of inputs.  If and when we achieve the derogation, our work will only have begun in reaching an acceptable level of production per cow.  This achievement will not come about by way of across-the-board cuts of 6 to 8 per cent in Government Departments nor will it come about by way of employees in the agricultural business sector seeking wage increases that are above the norm.  Neither will it come about by way of the Department of Finance pursuing the attitude that they have been pursuing for the past 10 to 15 years, that is, the attitude that support for agriculture is a waste of time.</P>
    <P>Given the right climate and the sort of leadership and guidance that our Minister for Agriculture has shown himself to be capable of giving, agriculture will make a major contribution towards eliminating the massive public debt that has been incurred by Governments in the past five to six years.  We should be asked only to make a contribution in line with the amount of the problem we have caused.  The EEC have asked us to pay for 10 per cent of the total problem whereas we have caused less than 1 per cent of that problem.  What the EEC require of us would close us down in terms of development and all because of the problem caused in the main by our EEC partners.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 years we in this country have done more to sell our products on the market place than any of our European counterparts.  As a percentage of production we have put less into intervention than any of our European partners. If this proposal is implemented not alone will there be lost 10,000 jobs in the processing industry but 10,000 farmers will be put out of business, which means &mdash; with an average of four people per farm, which would entail 40,000 people in family farms &mdash; all of these people will be affected by the Commission proposals. None of us can allow that to happen. It is time our financial institutions, unions and every person with a job in this country came out, supported and was seen to support whatever measures are taken by the Government to ensure that the proposed <Col N="2677" /> super-levy will not be imposed on us.</P>
    <P>Not alone will milk producers be affected but our cereal producers will be equally adversely affected.  If we are not allowed increase production our inputs will be less, which will mean that the farmers at that end of the industry will be in as bad a position as those to whom the super-levy will apply directly.  Neither will our beef producers have animals for the production units, which will also have an enormous effect on our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Our objective in joining the EEC was to ensure that the common agricultural policy would help us increase our output and develop our main industry, that being agriculture.  It is now practically 11 years since we became members of the EEC and, despite the moneys we have received through the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy, we have lost jobs in industry.  I believe the initial thinking behind the Treaty of Rome was that this country, being an agricultural one, should be afforded an opportunity to develop in the way our European partners had developed.  At the time of our accession I do not believe any of us thought the Commission ever intended to put proposals before us which would mean the total downfall of our economy, but that is what these proposals now before us will mean.  If they are interested in the preservation of the terms of the Treaty of Rome, as drawn up, the larger countries such as England, Germany and The Netherlands should realise &mdash; although I believe they do but are not prepared to do anything about it &mdash; that we cannot stand idly by, as our Ministers and Government have been telling them for the last eight or nine months throughout the length and breadth of Europe.  Proposals such as these would mean that 10,000 of our farmers would be out of business within 12 months, 10,000 people in the processing industry would be out of a job, with an enormous amount of other job losses in the ensuing two to three years in the beef and other ancillary industries.</P>
    <P>I would say to our partners in Europe that we are so serious about this proposal <Col N="2678" /> that we cannot and should not accept such a proposal, which would bring about our total economic ruin.  The biggest problem facing the EEC, from reports we have read, is that the larger countries are not prepared to endeavour to alleviate or eliminate the problem they are causing through their importation of cereal substitutes.  In the Netherlands they comprise 46 per cent of total inputs, with Great Britain and Germany almost as bad.  Then there is the importation of 87,000 tonnes of New Zealand butter. There is at present a Commission proposal before us to reduce that by 2,000 tonnes a year over the next four years. There is no concrete proposal to tackle that problem.  We are entitled to retain the jobs existing in our agricultural industry and, above all, be allowed to add to their numbers through increased production. Nobody in this House or indeed anybody involved in any union in the country should be seen as not objecting to the proposals before us.  Our unions and their leaders should be condemning these proposals now rather than when such a levy is imposed on us.  If they do not then we will find ourselves in a situation in which we are opposing the loss of 10,000 jobs in the processing industry over the next two or three years.  I must stress that now is the time for united action against these proposals.  Our Ministers for Agriculture, Foreign Affairs, Finance and the Taoiseach have been doing an excellent job in highlighting the situation over the past six months even though we have not as yet had agreement to our submissions.  They must be complimented on their unwavering attack on the super-levy.  The most important thing is that they do not allow themselves be side-tracked into alternatives, which would be a disastrous tactic.  They have said at all times, in all places, to everybody they have met: we cannot have any super-levy; we require a derogation for four years, or as long as such super-levy lasts.  We must be allowed increase our production to a level commensurate with that of our European partners, indeed to the level obtaining in Northern Ireland where the average milk production is over 1,000 gallons per cow.  Each time we <Col N="2679" /> receive any concession in the course of negotiations in Brussels, particularly in recent years, Britain has always contended that such applies to Northern Ireland as well.  We are seeking to increase our production to the same level.</P>
    <P>Coming from a farming background and having developed a dairy herd, I would not like to see eight years after we had been told to develop our farms and to increase our production, a proposal introduced which would mean that farmers with incomes of less than £5,000 would have to carry this heavy financial burden.  We cannot lay sufficient emphasis on this point often enough because every Irish citizen will be affected by this proposal if it is accepted by this Government. Perhaps after this debate the people will be more aware of the real problems facing us.</P>
    <P>A great deal of money has been collected over the years to finance the Common Agricultural Policy. The bigger states in the Community will object to increasing this 1 per cent until something positive is done about the surpluses, surpluses which were not of our doing. When we get to the level of our European partners none of us will object to paying our contribution to that surplus, but to be asked to bear the brunt of a 10 per cent levy across the board when we are contributing to less than 1 per cent of the surplus is not realistic and every Member of this House strongly objects to this measure.</P>
    <P>It is very important to have this debate. I was one of the first to ask the Taoiseach and the Government to make time available for this debate and to outline the seriousness of the problem to the people. In doing this we would also be outlining the seriousness of the problem to our European partners.  There is no way our European partners, powerful as they may be at negotiating level, could be allowed to implement proposals which would have a detrimental effect on our economy.  None of us could stand for that.</P>
    <P>At the summit meeting in Athens I <Col N="2680" /> hope we will emphasise the fact that we cannot accept this proposal at this time. We must be entitled to extra years to develop our family holdings because at present many of our farmers have incomes of less than £5,000 a year.  A Commission proposal which would have a detrimental effect on such people is very short-sighted.  In the final days of negotiating for an exemption for Ireland the Taoiseach and his Ministers must insist that Ireland be given extra years to draw level with our European partners who are involved in this most important industry.  The reason we are so far behind our partners is that in the sixties and seventies we concentrated on industrial development.  It is a pity we did not spend pound for pound in agriculture as we did in industry.  Knowing the farming industry inside out I can assure the House that if we had got an injection of money at the time we joined the EEC in 1973 we would have had no problem meeting the same levels our EEC partners have reached today.  We have the capacity for increased production; we have the best soil in Europe and, most important of all, we have the people to do the job and at lower costs.</P>
    <P>We say no to the introduction of a super-levy and to the unions we say that we need their support to ensure that this proposal does not come into effect.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> Before Deputy Collins speaks may I say a few words?  There is a long list of speakers on this debate from both sides.  I have been speaking with our friends in the Opposition and appeal to Members if at all possible, to make their contributions in 15 minutes because that might make it possible for everyone to speak.  I know the order states that Deputies have 30 minutes but if we could agree to each Member taking 15 minutes, I am sure everybody who wishes, could make his or her contribution.</P>

      <P>I will do my best to oblige the Chief Whip.</P>
      <P>We are convinced that the handling by the Government of the super-levy is an object lesson in how not to conduct diplomacy. It is surprising that a Government headed by a former Minister for Foreign Affairs should handle a matter of vital interest to Ireland so lamentably badly. If Ireland has a vital national interest in the European Economic Community, then surely it is our agriculture, and particularly our dairy industry.  It is by now obvious that this Government are completely lacking in backbone and a real will to resist outside proposals destructive to our vital interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael school of diplomacy advocate treading softly in case some nebulous goodwill might be upset somewhere. Let us not forget the contrast between this Government's approach and the resolute no-nonsense handling of the super-levy by us in Government in 1980 <Col N="2682" /> and 1981.  The Taoiseach had an opportunity at the Stuttgart Summit to make it clear that we could not accept the super-levy proposal.  Deputies need only read the records of this House to see how the Taoiseach, who likes to present himself as an experienced international statesman who regularly rubs shoulders with the Gaston Thorns, the Leo Tindemans, the Henry Kissingers, the Rockefellers and the like, completely misread and misjudged the result of the Stuttgart Summit.  He said on that occasion, and I quote as recorded in the Official Report of 22 June 1983, Volume 343, column 2687:</P>
    <P>The Minister and I,</P>
    <P>&mdash;In this instance the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;</P>
    <P>with gratifying support from colleagues, were successful in preventing damage to Irish interests in the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>They were successful in preventing damage to Irish interests in the common agricultural policy.  He goes on:</P>
    <P>In fact, a comparison between the proposals circulating recently on that subject and the conclusions of the Stuttgart Council will show a really remarkable degree of understanding and support for the basic principles of that policy ...</P>
    <P>How naive and foolish that seems on reading it today, 17 November 1983.  I find it past belief that the Minister for Foreign Affairs could still speak yesterday of a successful outcome to the Stuttgart Council.  If he thinks it was a success he must be inhabiting a world different from that which I inhabit.</P>
    <P>My party leader, though he did not have the advantage of being at the meeting, gauged the situation far more accurately. What he said stands up to an accurate appraisal now.  He said, and I quote from column 2703 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>Again, looking at the Conclusions of the Summary I do not think that the Taoiseach and his Minister for Foreign <Col N="2683" /> Affairs in Stuttgart have done a great day's work for Irish farmers, because it is only necessary to read the list of questions which are going to be examined under the heading &ldquo;Common Agricultural Policy&rdquo; to realise that they constitute a major onslaught on the Common Agricultural Policy and I regret very much that such a list was adopted as a conclusion of this particular European Council.</P>
    <P>In effect, it could be said that the Taoiseach helped to open the door to new revised super-levy proposals backdated to 1981.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that when the EEC's proposals were published at the end of July this Government were taken completely by surprise.  The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, was quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 29 July 1983 as saying that the Government would have their backs against the wall in the fight to gain exemption for Irish farmers.  It is curious that one month after the Stuttgart Summit, which was supposed to be so satisfactory from Ireland's point of view, we found ourselves with our backs to the wall.  When the Taoiseach's friend, Commissioner Gaston Thorn, came to Dublin on 29 July 1983 the Taoiseach criticised the proposals.  He said they would be severly damaging to this country and would also operate in a manner that would be inconsistent with the principles of Community policy.  The Minister for Agriculture said, and I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 30 July 1983:</P>
    <P>I would be much more impressed if we had got a derogation from the proposals... I hope he is going to consider us in a special light.  I hope we will get major changes.  These proposals are not acceptable in any form.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one or two observations about these remarks which illustrate why Ireland has made such little impact in Brussels to date.  The Minister's two statements, &ldquo;I hope we will get major changes&rdquo; and &ldquo;These proposals are not acceptable in any form&rdquo; are contradictory. Secondly, and more importantly, at <Col N="2684" /> no point in the public comments of either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Agriculture was our clear and unequivocal opposition to the super-levy articulated. From the start the Government seemed to have made it clear that we would accept super-levy as long as it did not apply to us.  This is a far weaker position than saying that we are opposed to the very principle of the super-levy because it is of vital national interest and we will prevent it being enacted, if necessary by using the veto.</P>
    <P>If the super-levy is inconsistent with Community principles, then surely that is true in regard to whatever country it applies to.  From the start the Government, instead of opposing the super-levy in principle, unfortunately have clearly signalled our acceptance of it provided, in the Minister's own words &ldquo;that there is a special derogation for Ireland&rdquo;.  I believe sincerely that this was a mistake in our negotiation tactics.  Opposition to a proposal in principle is always easier to argue than trying to seek special treatment or exemptions.  By limiting our case to seeking a derogation or an exemption we have ensured that any such derogation or exemption is likely to be of only limited duration.</P>
    <P>At the end of August this year the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced a ministerial tour of the capitals of members states of the EEC.  The French Minister for Agriculture came here in September. There is no indication anywhere on record that any particular understanding was reached with the French Minister for Agriculture.  Then the Taoiseach went to the Greek capital, Athens, and he seems to have convinced himself&mdash;but nobody else&mdash;that he procured a valuable ally there.  The Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Papandreou, assured him that his Government understood fully our problems, the problems faced by Ireland in the present situation and fully supported, in his words &ldquo;their just demands&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, a few days later the Greek Presidency put forward divisive compromise proposals to use the 1983 milk production rather than the 1981 milk production as the base.  This was rejected by us as totally unacceptable.  When this contradiction <Col N="2685" /> between the statements of support of the Greek Government and their actions were put to the Taoiseach by me earlier this week he sought to distinguish between their Presidency role and their national role.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that the Greek Government have little interest one way or another in the super-levy.  It is difficult to see how they could be a staunch ally when they have no interest of their own at stake.  Ireland's support for special treatment for Greece in other areas, while useful, will hardly improve significantly the bargaining position of Greece in the Community.  If the Taoiseach was addressing himself primarily to the Presidency, the proposed two-year exemption means very little.  The Taoiseach sought to claim that it amounts to a valuable recognition of the principle of an exemption.</P>
    <P>The question of a two-year exemption was raised long before the Taoiseach went to Athens on 31 October.  As reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 12 October 1983, the Minister for Agriculture angrily denied a suggestion that the Government would be prepared to abandon their opposition to the EEC super-levy in return for a two-year exemption for Irish farmers.  He blamed the report on red herrings and leaks from the EEC Commission. Those were the Minister's words.  An informal proposal which was angrily dismissed by the Minister in October was welcomed last week by the Taoiseach in the Dáil when questioned by me.  He welcomed it as a recognition of the existence of a special Irish problem.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the emotional reaction of the Minister for Agriculture should be discounted. I am sure he realises that the television interview in which he said he was nervous and anxious before flying out to an EEC meeting did not impress anybody about our resolution and determination on this matter.  An unfortunate sequel to the Taoiseach's visit to Athens was the cancellation of the visit of the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, to Ireland, a friend and political ally of his, or so the Taoiseach claims.  It was a great pity that that visit was cancelled because <Col N="2686" /> the Germans have always been most helpful to Ireland.  They helped us in the EMS negotiations.  That was a notable example.  The Federal Republic of West Germany are as concerned as other countries about wasteful expenditure in the Community, but they have never pushed their views or interests unreasonably on us when they would have had detrimental effects upon us.  It would have been of value had Chancellor Kohl come to Ireland as Chancellor Schmidt did during our time in office.</P>
    <P>Then the Taoiseach went to see the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher. We all know how fond the Taoiseach is of telling us that he has known her since 1975.  At his press conference he said he fully explained our position to her.  He almost convinced members of his own party that we could expect help from Mrs. Thatcher but, within the same week, the British displayed a special hostility in the EEC to any special exemption for Irish interests.  This time last year the Taoiseach, who was not Taoiseach then, was fond of telling us how high our standing in the Community was when he represented Ireland abroad.  Where are all his so-called influential friends now?  Will Mrs. Thatcher support our case?  Will President Thorn support our case?  Will Chancellor Kohl support our case?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has not yet sought the support of the Danes, or the French, or the Dutch, or the Italians, or the people of Luxembourg.  Last week I put down a question to the Taoiseach asking him what arrangements he had made to meet the remaining Heads of Government within the Community to make sure that they fully understood our problems and the implications of the levy for us.  Unfortunately that question was not allowed. I understand why it was not allowed.  I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's decision on it and I accept that decision.</P>
    <P>On 26 October the Taoiseach said that between then and the settlement of those critical Community issues he would have whatever other discussion with Community leaders were necessary to ensure that our vital national interests were protected. I regret that there were very few Fine Gael party members present, but <Col N="2687" /> somebody should tell the Taoiseach that there are more important matters in Ireland today than the by-election in Dublin Central.  As Prime Minister he should meet with the leaders of the other nations he has not yet met to ensure that everything possible is done to enlist their aid for us on this very critical issue.</P>
    <P>I submitted a number of questions to the Taoiseach for next Tuesday's Order Paper.  I hope they will be allowed.  That is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle and I know he will deal with them fairly and properly.  I want to ask him if he is aware of the opposition of the Danish Government to any concessions for Ireland on the super-levy, and if he is prepared to meet the Danish Prime Minister before the Athens meeting to present our case to him and seek his help in protecting our vital national interests.  I also want to ask him if he will meet President Mitterand and discuss our situation with him.  We do not know whether we made any progress with the French Agriculture Minister when he was here.  The Taoiseach has an obligation to forget about the by-election and do something worthwhile for the nation.  Why has not the Taoiseach met Prime Minister Craxi in Rome?  If our position were properly explained to him, I would have thought we might get some help from the Italians.  Why has the Taoiseach not met the Dutch Prime Minister? Why has he not met the Prime Minister of Luxembourg who might have some little influence on a former Prime Minister of Luxembourg who is now President of the Commission, Gaston Thorn.</P>
    <P>I am not alone in holding this view.  I feel the Minister for Agriculture shares my view.  He is reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of last Tuesday as saying it is now a matter for political decision and that he has gone as far as he can go as Minister for Agriculture.  He is now putting it up to his boss, the Taoiseach to do something about it.  Yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs said the Government had made a fantastic diplomatic offensive on behalf of the Irish people and not just for the farming and dairying sector of our community.  Somebody should tell the Minister for Foreign Affairs immediately <Col N="2688" /> that this diplomatic offensive which he seems to think has been effective has of today resulted in nothing whatsoever for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Many of us are convinced, as I hope are many of the farming community and of the community's leaders, that this Government, despite all the help and support which we are giving them and the fact that we will not make party political issues out of this problem, have failed to do what any Government should do. They have failed to communicate firm opposition to the super-levy.  One can scan the colums of <i>L'Agence de l'Europe</i> and look at reports of meeting after meeting without finding any reference to Irish opposition to the super-levy.  I am very much afraid that nobody in Europe believes that the present Irish Government are prepared to hold up an EEC package agreement, however detrimental to Irish interests.</P>
    <P>I liked very much the comments of the Minister for Agriculture at the recent Fine Gael Ard Fheis that if there has to be confrontation there will be confrontation. I implore the Minister to have a word with his colleagues but, above all, with his Taoiseach and let him know what is expected of him in this very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>The Government have made it clear that they will not use the veto.  They have cast doubt in this House on whether it exists.  Everybody appears to believe that Ireland can be bought off with minimal concessions or perhaps no concessions at all on the super-levy.  Ireland finds itself diplomatically isolated on an issue of vital national importance.  Does anybody seriously believe that the Greek Presidency will hold up agreement on account of Ireland or that Mrs. Thatcher, perhaps, will come to our rescue?  This is what is being told to us.  This is all that we know about &mdash; perhaps they know more and are not telling us.  However, I doubt that very much.</P>
    <P>I warn the Taoiseach that if the super-levy is imposed here he can have all the influential friends that he likes in Europe, but his reputation here will be shattered.  He is the man who has been presented to us as uniquely and <Col N="2689" /> supremely qualified to represent Ireland in Europe.  I say to the Government Parties that the Taoiseach had better deliver. We have always said that we will support the Government to the hilt if they adopt a firm approach.  That we will do. Equally, we will not support weakness on the Government's part.  We demand their best efforts and that the Taoiseach, who is now totally involved in trying to win a by-election seat in the Dublin Central constituency, get his priorities right.</P>

      <P>When the Heads of Government met in Stuttgart they did agree that certain negotiations should be carried out.  They agreed that there should be negotiations about changes in the Common Agricultural Policy.  They did say that the basic principles of that policy should not be interfered with. This they had to say because they had to have due regard to the appropriate Articles in the Treaty of Rome.  It is our duty now to insist that, having examined the proposals put forward by the Commission, these proposals do not in any way interfere with or endanger the basic principles of the Treaty of Rome.  We must be extremely watchful and careful of what is emerging.  The statement issued after Stuttgart said:</P>
      <P>Certain regions such as the Mediterranean region, mountain regions and other regions are at a disadvantage because of natural economic features.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is equally extremely important for us now to make sure that due regard is given to this part of the statement.  We recognise very much that the Community are in an extremely grave financial position at present and these difficulties will be added to if Spain and Portugal are admitted to the Community.  On every occasion in this House since the Dáil reconvened after the summer Recess, I have pointed out strongly that political considerations on their own should not be enough to <Col N="2690" /> sway the present membership of the Community to bring in Spain and Portugal. I am talking about NATO political considerations.</P>
    <P>There is no room for ourselves in Europe at present because of the state of finances and we should make sure that those with other interests, such as NATO interests, will not put those interests before the interests of the members of the Community.  We must recognise that there are deep financial problems in Europe and that it is in our own interest that these be tackled straight away.  It is accepted that we are prepared to contribute our part to the re-direction of Europe which is at present at the crossroads.  We are prepared to take our share of the additional burden, but must insist that we are only prepared to take our share and no more than that.</P>
    <P>There are many benefits to a small country like ours, with its very open economy, in the Community and it is vital for us that the Community should thrive and prosper.  We must not forget that not only was Stuttgart concerned with the question of the adaptation of the Common Agricultural Policy but all of us in a search for a method of relaunching the Community and rediscovering the sense of European progress which has tended to become dim, indeed I might add lost at times under the effects of the world recession.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are extremely interested in agriculture which is so important to us, representing almost 15 per cent of our GNP &mdash; twice or three times that of the vast majority of our colleagues in Europe.  We must insist that anything that would tend to adversely affect agriculture would hurt us to a far greater degree than it would many of our European partners. The Government have a very great responsibility to defend our situation throughout the negotiations.  I hope this Government, and in particular their leader, will play their part in helping the Minister for Agriculture who seems to be becoming more and more isolated within the Government in dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>Whatever decision is finally arrived at, I want to see that it will be a decision <Col N="2691" /> which has come about as a result of total Government involvement in the presentation of our case and that if anybody has to carry the can at the end of the day, that it will not be just the Minister for Agriculture.  It is far too serious a matter for us.  There have been too many hits and misses.</P>

      <P>It is correct to say that we could not be discussing a more urgent or pressing matter than the one under debate at the moment.  I want to express my displeasure at the shortness of this debate.  This debate could go on all today, all through Friday and if necessary, all through Friday night because so much of the future of the country <Col N="2692" /> depends on the issue we are now discussing. This is the most important issue we could debate.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Athens Special Council, which sat last week in connection with the future policy of the EEC, the whole question of the financing of the Community was debated and, as we were told yesterday, the Community had under consideration three things.  The first was to help to make up the ground where development is backwards.  Development is more backward in Ireland than in nearly every one of our European partners. We must benefit if the Community are to spend their money in that regard. The second matter was to speed up convergence in both industrial and agricultural regions in decline.  There is no country in the Community in which agriculture is in greater decline than Ireland.  The third matter was to combat unemployment, especially youth unemployment. Youth unemployment and unemployment in general is now reaching a desperate proportion in this country, where it is a cancer eating into our whole social, economic and political life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will not improve this situation by attacking the Taoiseach.  I want to express my admiration for the manner in which the Taoiseach spoke in Athens in relation to the super-levy.  I also want to express my admiration for his speech in Brussels, which was regarded as one of the best speeches he delivered, in relation to agriculture when he condemned the whole matter of the super-levy.  I also want to congratulate him on the manner in which he presented this serious problem in London.  All members of the EEC have a bounden duty to cut out completely New Zealand imports into the UK.  The EEC are not doing their job if they allow New Zealand to continue exporting butter to the UK.  I saw a New Zealand delegation in Strasbourg last year, one of the most high-powered delegation of parliamentarians, who came to Europe for the purpose of exploring every avenue to get more agricultural produce from New Zealand dumped into Britain.  The production of butter and milk products has already gone up in Britain but there is still importation of <Col N="2693" /> New Zealand products.  This is having a serious effect on our situation.</P>
    <P>The Government and our Minister for Agriculture have an obligation to see that when we are in the Community we get what the Community has for us.  We should remember that Europe does not owe us anything.  We have to fight every inch of the way.  Every speech the Taoiseach has made about the super-levy was a fighting speech.  I am convinced that he meant every word.  I want to pay a tribute to Mr. Cashman of the IFA and the Creamery Milk Suppliers for the manner in which they have united their members because of the vital importance of this issue to Irish agriculture.  I urge every political party in the country to stand firmly behind the Government and the Minister for Agriculture and, if necessary, to use the veto to reject this unsound procedure which will be the death knell of Irish agriculture and will drive our farmers into the already over-packed and practically closed workhouses. This is a most serious matter for agriculture.</P>
    <P>Reference was made yesterday to the fact that the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities have not met.  I deplore the fact that this Joint Committee have never met to deal with this matter.  On 1 September 1983 I wrote to the clerk of the committee and stated:</P>
    <P>Please have the following notice of motion on Agenda for Meeting of the Joint Committee.  This is a very important matter on which the views of the Committee should be expressed. There is no matter so vital for the future of our economy than this matter.</P>
    <P>That the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities emphatically reject the proposals of EEC to implement spending cuts which can cost Irish farmers £150 million.  That the suggested super-levy 70p per gallon be not implemented and that united opposition be organised in every part of Ireland against it as such would be the end of the dairying <Col N="2694" /> industry in this country.  That the calf premium scheme and the EEC butter subsidy should not in anyway be interfered with and we call on the Government to implement the veto in regard to these penal and unjust proposals which could ruin for all time the Irish economy and we further call on our EEC partners to reject these proposals because of their serious effect on our farmers livelihood.</P>
    <P>EEC farm cuts can cost our farmers £150 million at a time when they cannot afford the loss of a single penny and when farmland prices have plunged down 20 per cent since the boom years of the late seventies.  The CAP was the only reason why Ireland joined the EEC.  It was because of the CAP that our farmers solidly voted in favour of Ireland's entry. I was never impressed by our entry into Europe.  I felt that the big powers of Europe would not give any serious thought to the economic problems which are characteristic of a small country on the western seaboard of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speeches in London and Athens expressed thorough objection to these proposals.  Every speech of the Minister for Agriculture which I have read was an emphatic rejection of these proposals.  If the other members of the Community do not agree, the veto can be used.  The farmers' organisations and the trade unions want the veto used in relation to these proposals, because as well as the farmers being put out of house and home if these proposals go through the meat industry, the creameries, the people in Mitchelstown and Avonmore, those engaged in every branch of agriculture in which labour is employed, even those in garages where farm machinery has to be repaired, will be affected.  There will be fewer mechanics needed and there will be less goods needed for the shop assistants to sell.  There will be less on the shelves.  If the Common Agricultural Policy is tampered with it will ruin our farmers because it is the strength of the Community. We were asked to join the EEC because there were 250 million people waiting to buy our agricultural produce. <Col N="2695" /> Are they now going to renege on us?  I hope not.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government have their minds firmly made up to put this to the test and the people are behind them in this regard.  Political parties, farmers' organisations and social and regional organisations should not let the European bureaucrats get away with this because they are going to sell the Irish farmers down the drain.  We must cut down our imports of vegetables and horticultural products and we must not be afraid to tell the European Community that we are going to have a big campaign to buy Irish, because there is no point in buying expensive imported products to the detriment of Irish workers.  It is wrong for Irish people to buy imported agricultural products.  It is wrong for Irish bakers to use British flour and to import so much wheat when our farmers are not engaged in wheat production.  When will sanity be restored to our economy?  There was a time when we grew wheat, oats, barley, beet, potatoes and vegetables.  What has gone wrong?  It is time to ask why the bread we are eating is made from British flour.  I hope and trust that steps will be taken in this regard.</P>
    <P>I also want to advise the Minister for Agriculture not to let the Common Agricultural Policy be dismantled because we depend too much on it.  Do not allow New Zealand and Australia to poach and take our share of what should be going into Europe.  Cut them out of it &mdash; that can and must be done.  We will have to adopt a fighting attitude and we must not show a white flag.  We must be determined to win on this issue.  I hope that steps will be taken to ensure that we all stand behind the farmers' organisations and the Minister for Agriculture, who is sincere in fighting this issue.  It is not enough to get an exemption for Ireland because that means in a few years we must face the same problem again.  We cannot have this cloud hanging over our farmers who must be able to plan and develop for the future, because with sane and sound planning there is a future for Irish agriculture.  It is contrary to the original intentions of the Community to <Col N="2696" /> have Canada, Australia, New Zealand and others dumping their produce into the Community when we should be getting our share of it.  No wonder our farmers are depressed and that there is such unemployment in agriculture.  No wonder so many farmers have left the land and are still leaving it.  There is a depressing prospect facing young farmers who are taking over land and they are slow also to lease land because there are little prospects for the future.  The Irish farmer must be the best in the world because, if not, he would have gone down during the early years of the Economic War; and when he survived that and the policies of Fianna Fáil he will survive anything.</P>
    <P>There have been hard and lean times since then but the Irish farmer stood up to them well.  No section of the community has suffered greater losses than our farmers.  They are being penalised with bank interest payments.  I know that because I live in a good farming area and I have farmers coming to me every weekend. They appear to be some of the biggest farmers in the midlands, but the real test of their standing is to examine their bank accounts.  The Minister must reject this proposal and adopt the suggestion made by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hegarty, who delivered an outstanding address in my constituency lately in relation to the purchase of Irish agricultural produce by our people.  The farmers' organisations must exhort the people to do this.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach to convene a meeting of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities so that we can deal with matters of this kind.  It is all very well for Deputies to be highly critical but the lives of tens of thousands of our people depend on the courage, determination and political will of the Government.  The trade unions must also stand behind Irish farmers to ensure that their livelihoods are not snatched away from them as a result of this insane proposal from the Community.</P>
    <P>I cannot subscribe to the suggestions made by Deputy Collins that the Government <Col N="2697" /> have not thoroughly canvassed the Heads of State of every member of the Community.  Perhaps Deputy Collins is not sufficiently satisfied, so I hope a guarantee will be given to him that in relation to Denmark, Italy, Holland and Luxembourg, Ireland's position has been made very clear.  We want the support of all our colleagues in the Community in relation to this matter.  Many people think this only affects the farmers but it affects the livelihood of everybody.  Our whole economy depends on the future of agriculture and our economy is sinking fast at present.  I hope the united effort of all our people of every shade, creed and class will be in support of the Government if they decide to implement the veto in order to ensure that no steps are taken to wreck the CAP or to destroy the prospects for Irish agriculture, for those who have built up dairy herds and who have invested in milk production, moneys which are not likely to be paid back during the lifetimes of the grandchildren of those people.  Are we to stand by while their livelihoods are taken from them? We are talking about an issue that affects every constituency.  We must stand solidly behind the farmers' organisations and let them know that we mean what we say.  If we do not build up a prosperous Irish agricultural sector, other sectors will not succeed either because agriculture is our key industry.</P>
    <P>The Government mean business.  We must speak with one voice in telling Mr. Thorn and our respected Greek parliamentarian who is President of the Community that it is &lsquo;no&rsquo; from Ireland in relation to the proposed super-levy.  We must let these people know that we oppose the super-levy because we are satisfied that it is not in our interest to have such a levy imposed on us and also because it may not be in the interest of other agricultural countries either despite the fact that none of those countries depends on agriculture to the same extent as we depend on it.  In these circumstances we have an obligation to our farmers, to our nation generally and to our Parliament to ensure that the people in Europe are not allowed impose a levy that would be disastrous for us.  If the super-levy <Col N="2698" /> were to be imposed the rich lands of Ireland would become a vast desert within a number of years.  By all of us speaking with one voice on this issue we are giving some encouragement to our farmers and in particular to our young farmers in terms of their future.</P>
    <P>I am making my appeal today as one who has long experience as a parliamentarian. Let us reject the proposal in the interest of our economy, a matter that must be first in our considerations.  While we share problems in relation to our economy that are experienced also in other countries, we must look after our own people.  That is why I am glad that this Parliament has had the opportunity of telling the governments of the Community that we regard the proposal as distasteful and bitter and that we will not swallow it.</P>
    <P>If future generations of Irish farmers are as good as those who have gone before them we will never have a bad farmer on the land.  But we must give them a chance.  We must ensure that there is available to them the markets they were promised.  We must ensure that they have the facilities that were promised them in terms of our EEC membership.</P>

I regret also that there is no agricultural spokesman present on the Government side.  The Minister for Agriculture is missing as also are his two Ministers of State.

        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> On a point of order, comments are being made consistently about the Government imposing a time limit on this debate.  The debate was agreed by the Government having regard to the seriousness with which we regard the matter.  It was agreed with the Fianna Fáil Whip that one-and-a-half days would be given to the debate.  Fianna Fáil had put down a Private Members' Motion which they did not even move this week. In these circumstances I am asking the speakers to refrain from putting the blame on the Government for the shortage of time.  We would have allowed two-and-a-half days for the debate if that had been requested but the request from the Opposition was for a one-and-a-half day debate.  I hope that Opposition Deputies will refrain from making these smart political remarks by which they are destroying the co-operation that we have built up here in regard to having such important matters debated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised clearly both in this House and by the farmers that Fianna Fáil have been pressing for a debate on this urgent matter.  Within the limited time available the House has been debating for the past two days, in what is almost an emergency session, the threat to our entire economy in the form of the proposed milk super-levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this proposal were to be implemented even in part it would undermine and damage permanently the only viable base on which future progress can take place.  It is recognised by politicians, by trade unionists and by many other groups that the only credible and sustainable way forward is, in the first instance, through the development of our national resources of land, forestry and of the sea. Following the development of those resources all other development would <Col N="2700" /> follow, too late, perhaps, for a philosophy of this nature, but not too late if we are now seriously tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>It is nothing short of a national tragedy, when we are seriously contemplating and planning going down this particular road of development, to find the carpet being pulled from under our feet by our EEC partners, if one can call them at this stage of the negotiations &ldquo;partners&rdquo; of any kind.  This threat must be resisted, fought and won.  I emphasise in particular the word &ldquo;won&rdquo; because there are no acceptable alternative proposals which would not restrict our overall national development in a very serious way.  I would, in fact, maintain that the very credibility of the EEC itself and its alleged commitment to implementing the underlying philosophy of the Rome Treaty to safeguarding, protecting and assisting in the development of developing nations, such as Ireland, must now seriously be called into question.</P>
    <P>Where, I ask, is the evidence in recent weeks of this commitment?  To take the example of our closest neighbour, Britain, the British Prime Minister has clearly indicated her opposition to any concession as far as Ireland is concerned.  So much for the friendship our Taoiseach has claimed to have generated with Britain and the British Prime Minister as a result of his recent meeting with her.  It is now painfully obvious that the Taoiseach and the Government have failed to make any impact on the heads of Government in the other EEC countries.  Our farmers have been lulled into a false sense of relief that the threat of the levy will not eventuate and, in the closing stages now of this very serious national debate, we find ourselves in an almost panic situation. We, on this side of the House, as has already been said by previous speakers, have no desire to capitalise politically on this failure.  In fact we place ourselves fully at the disposal of the Government, collectively and individually, to fight and win our rights within the European Community, our rights as a developing economy.  We are entitled to know where we stand because, if the Government fail, we all fail and this Parliament will have <Col N="2701" /> failed in a matter of great national importance and in what is certainly the greatest challenge we have faced since we became members of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I call on the Taoiseach and his Ministers to come in here today and tell the House and the nation that there will be no weakening of our position, no compromise and, if necessary, we will use our right of veto to bring, as Margaret Thatcher did, these negotiations to a halt, and renegotiate our entry, because at the end of the day, unless we sustain and maintain and support our main basic industry, which is agriculture, there is no point in being within the confines of that particular Community.  Let us at this stage as a small but independent nation display that strength and independence. Let us really test the credibility of the concept of a united Europe politically and economically.  We all remember, and we campaigned strongly for it, our joining the European Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost impossible for me because I had hoped to give some practical examples.  I did a certain amount of research into the consequences of this proposal and it is a pity that my time is so short.  We should as I say, display our strength and bargaining power within Europe.  If necessary, we should use the veto, a veto we are entitled to use as a member state with the same voting powers as all the other nations in the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to give some examples. They may be regarded as being somewhat regionalised.  The Avonmore milk area covers the greater part of the midlands. It is an area in which farmers have a capital investment of £106 million.  This investment has been built up by the farmers, managed by top management and the share capital out of the farmers' pockets has been considerable.  The co-op gives employment to 1,400 and has a wage bill of £15.5 million of which £5 million goes back to the State in PRSI contributions.  The proposal if implemented, <Col N="2702" /> would lead to a loss of 400 jobs, representing a loss to the State in PRSI contributions, while creating an additional demand on State resources through unemployment benefit payments. There are 6,000 suppliers, 2,000 of them less than 20,000 gallons, indicating the large number of small family farms dependent on the co-op for a living. These are anxiously watching the outcome of this debate in regard to the viability of their future.  Avonmore is a developing area.  The processing plants have been designed to cater for an expanding dairying industry and so any cutback in relation to development would have disastrous consequences for that particular region.</P>
    <P>I would like to give some more examples. If we take 1981 as a base, the Avonmore intake was 100,000,000 gallons and the projected increase for 1984 is 135,000,000 gallons.  This represents a difference of 35 million gallons at an average price of 70p.  It represents £25 million or over £4,000 for the farmer supplier in the region.  Alternatively, it could also mean a reduction of approximately 18p for every gallon of milk produced in that region.  Is there really any need to say any more in relation to the catastrophic effect any restriction would have on the Avonmore milk complex serving the entire midland region?</P>
    <P>There is one last point I should like to make.  It relates to the farmer rescue package.  I will give just one example to show how seriously this proposal, if implemented, would affect farmers in the rescue package area.  In County Laois there are 220 farmers in the rescue package having their cases accepted and examined for benefit under that particular scheme.  Up to 80 per cent of these 220 have been planned towards a developing dairy enterprise.  In other words, unless they reach a target of 950 gallons within the duration of the rescue plan they will go by the board.  That is one small, isolated, practical example of what would happen to 220 farmers in one single county.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach to ensure that, under no circumstances, will any restriction be <Col N="2703" /> accepted so far as this super-levy is concerned. At the conclusion of this debate I hope the Minister will reassure farmers and farming organisations that we will resist any restriction, any introduction of the levy and, if necessary, that we shall invoke the veto because that is what our farmers are expecting to hear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity of debating this serious matter concerning our agricultural sector.  At the outset I should point out that, directly or indirectly, our agricultural industry employs approximately 40 per cent of our total labour force, provides approximately 35 per cent of our gross exports and practically 50 per cent of our net exports.  It should be remembered that all of this is achieved by an industry which is under-capitalised and the least developed amongst EEC countries, excluding Greece where there is an entirely different type of agriculture prevailing.  Over 90 per cent of our farmland is under pasture, its two main products being beef cattle and milk.  Together they provide 70 per cent of our gross agricultural output. It is estimated that 80 per cent of our grassland is badly farmed and that a doubling of the output from our grassland is an achievable target.  Full exploitation of our grassland would take a considerable period of time, longer than the EEC appear to think.  In the meantime, however, between £500 million and £600 million extra could be produced from our existing cattle population primarily through better management, increased milk production and reduced calf mortality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our present farming population is ill-equipped to adopt such a course because of age, lack of training, marital status and so on.  It is well-known that 25 per cent of our farmers are over 65 years of age compared with 7.5 per cent of Dutch farmers.  In itself this has an impeding effect on getting our milk production on a level commensurate with the European yield.  In addition our under-utilised land must be made more readily available to our younger, energetic, trained farmers. The utilisation of our two most valuable <Col N="2704" /> resources, our land and people, is the best if not the only hope of solving our serious economic situation.</P>
    <P>Our present population of dairy cows could give 50 per cent more milk by raising output per cow from the present average of 630 gallons to the European average of almost 1,000 gallons.  The average Friesian cow here is capable of producing between 900 and 1,000 gallons, at a stocking rate of one cow per acre, with a concentrated output of ten hundredweights per cow.  With no increase in capital investment and only a marginal increase in input costs this would have an outstanding effect on our economy.  To any farmer who could achieve that milk production increase from 600 to 900 gallons per cow it would mean an increase of 34p per gallon on his present production level.  Additionally it would mean that each extra 100 gallons per cow, on a national basis, would entail an additional £150 million in exports.  The present calf mortality rate of 15 per cent, if reduced to 5 per cent, would mean an extra 200,000 calves per year.  That would represent a saving of over £20 million in calf losses per annum, at no extra cost, merely through better management or, looked at in another way, an extra 200,000 cattle per year for export, giving the nation over £100 million additional exports.</P>
    <P>We have the fifth largest area of farmland in the EEC, with Luxembourg the only member of the Ten having a smaller population than ours.  Consequently we have a vital interest in ensuring that our dairying industry, within the common agricultural policy, is not damaged by excessive imports from countries such as New Zealand, or excessive increases in milk production by our EEC competitors, who at present utilise cheap imported cereal substitutes, particularly Holland, Great Britain and France.  The fact remains that we have a greater dependence on agriculture than any other country in the world, with the exception of New Zealand.  Nevertheless, we have the most under-capitalised, least developed and lowest agricultural output of any EEC country prior to the accession <Col N="2705" /> of Greece whose agricultural pattern is much different from ours.</P>
    <P>Our milk production is four times more important to our economy than is Danish milk to theirs.  It is three-and-a-half times more important than Greek milk is to their economy and six-and-a-half times more important to our farmers than is overall milk production to our EEC partners. Eighty-five per cent of our dairy herds are comprised of less than 30 cows. Forty-six per cent of the cow population in Holland is comprised of herds of less than 30 cows, with 35 per cent of the cow population in the United Kingdom being comprised of herds of less than 30 cows. The Irish cow gives a yield of 650 gallons per lactation, compared with 1,081 gallons per cow in Holland and 1,040 gallons in Germany.  When one bears those facts in mind and also that cows in certain parts of the world can produce as much as 2,500 gallons per lactation as in California, one immediately sees how backward we are in milk production.  At least we should be on a par with our European partners.</P>
    <P>It should be accepted that Ireland receive special recognition and treatment to enable our farmers reach the European standard of milk production, in other words give our farmers an opportunity to reach 1,000 gallons per cow, per lactation period, putting them on a par with their European counterparts.  Our farmers, if given the chance, would rise to the occasion.  It is well-known, however, that progress in that respect has been inhibited over the past five or six years, indeed one might say for the past ten years here, due to the bovine TB eradication scheme which wiped out hundreds of thousands of our cattle, putting farmers back years in their efforts to achieve the yield of their European counterparts. It is well-known that, because of our geographical position, our economy depends mainly on agricultural inputs.  It is also well-known that there is no way in which we will ever benefit from the huge tobacco, wine or soft fruit subsidies in the EEC.  If we were situated ten or 20 degrees further south of the Equator we might have some hope of cashing in on those valuable incentives under the <Col N="2706" /> Common Agricultural Policy programme. But we are doomed to remain mainly an agriculture-based economy. Even when the last litre of oil and gas is drained from the Celtic Sea agriculture will still pay its part in our economy.</P>
    <P>I was amused earlier this morning to listen to statements emanating from across the House.  Deputy Collins reminded me of the hurler on the ditch. I appeal to him and to his colleagues to support the work which Deputy Garret FitzGerald, the Taoiseach, Deputy Deasy, Minister for Agriculture, Deputy P. Barry, Minister for Foreign Affairs, started six months ago.  It is well-known that the Minister for Agriculture has been working night and day for the past six months in co-operation with other members of the Cabinet and the farming organisations &mdash; the IFA and the ICMSA, who are playing no small role in the fight towards staving off this very serious threat to our agricultural production.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest faith in Deputy Deasy.  He comes from a farming background and knows the ins and outs of agriculture.  I believe there is no better man to represent this country as a negotiator at the European table.  We are proud to have him as Minister for Agriculture. He will not shirk his responsibilities. I appeal to Fianna Fáil to stop trying to score political points.  Come out and let it be seen in Europe that we speak with one voice and that we are behind our farmers who are the backbone of our economy.  I was amazed to hear Deputy Collins criticising the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins need have no concern about the future of agriculture.  Remember, Fine Gael were associated with the progress of agriculture <Col N="2707" /> since the foundation of this State. Paddy Hogan, the first Minister for Agriculture had the slogan one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough.  He set the headline for agriculture in Ireland.  Was it not James Dillon as Minister for Agriculture in an Inter-Party Government who put the lime lorries into the fields and who increased the fertility of our soil to its present level?  Was it not Mark Clinton as Minister for Agriculture who spearheaded our greatest agricultural achievements? Was it not Alan Dukes, as Minister for Agriculture, who a few years ago again spearheaded prosperity for the Irish farmers by the introduction of the calf subsidy and in-calf heifer subsidy? Now the mantle is falling on the shoulders of the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy.  He will rise to the occasion and see that Irish farmers get their chance to reach the same income levels as their counterparts in Europe.</P>

I guarantee that if we get co-operation from Fianna Fáil &mdash; and I hope to see such co-operation in this House before the day is out because there are men and women with commonsense on the Fianna Fáil benches&mdash;we could make this a valuable debate for our agricultural enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture is the cornerstone of our economy and we must insist that this situation is not changed.  Our benefits from the EEC accrue under the Common Agricultural Policy.  I know the Minister will be able to conclude a very good deal for our farmers which we will be proud to stand over.  The road ahead is very difficult and the discussions which are entering a very important stage will be even more difficult, but it is a consolation to know that we have as Taoiseach Deputy Garret FitzGerald, the most respected Minister for Foreign Affairs this country ever had, Deputy Deasy as Minister for Agriculture, and fellow <Col N="2708" /> Corkman Deputy P. Barry as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  That team will fight our case in Europe and will leave their imprint on agriculture.  They will give our farmers an opportunity to raise their incomes to the same level as our European counterparts.</P>
    <P>Remember, Ireland contributes only 5 per cent to the butter and milk mountain but the outcome of these negotiations could be a matter of life or death for our agricultural industry.  I wish the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Foreign Affairs the best of luck in their endeavours to maintain the <i>status quo</i> for our farming industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate which has very serious implications for our agricultural industry and for all those involved in that industry.  In case Deputy Sheehan misunderstands the position, we will support any Government efforts to have this super-levy rejected but we would like to know what efforts the Government are making.  We are not happy that a sufficient effort is being made by them or that they are speaking with one voice.  We would like the Minister to tell us clearly that he is confident the super-levy will be rejected.  There is no point going back and mentioning various Coalition Ministers who contributed to agriculture; I could give a list of Fianna Fáil Ministers but we must look to the future and urge the Government to have this super-levy rejected.</P>
      <P>In his contribution yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke about the success of the European Council in Stuttgart. He said &ldquo;Stuttgart spoke of relaunching the Community and of providing a solid basis for its further dynamic development during the rest of the decade. This must not be done at the expense of any one member state&rdquo;.  That is very encouraging &mdash; I presume he is saying that that development will not be done at the expense of Ireland.  I am a bit confused because that statement is at variance with the conclusions of the Stuttgart Summit which gave the EEC Commission the authority to put forward proposals for the super-levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2709" /> The basic unfairness of these proposals on the super-levy has infuriated Irish farmers and people involved in the agricultural industry.  In this country we produce no more than 4.5 per cent or 5 per cent of Community dairy milk supplies and our dairy farmers get a price for their milk which is low by European standards. We are only developing our dairy industry and if this super-levy is to be introduced it will be a complete departure from the terms under which we joined the EEC.  A former President of the IFA, Mr. Paddy Lane, recently queried the legality of the super-levy.  He stated that it would seriously contravene Ireland's rights under the EEC Treaty and it must be contested in court if necessary.  He went on to say that Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome clearly establishes Ireland's right to exemption from the super-levy and all sections must unite in a positive battle to gain that exemption which is our right under the Treaty.  I am sure the Government are continuing to query these matters and we would like to know from the Minister what is their response.</P>
    <P>I would like to know also what allies we have in the EEC to support our case. First, have we sought allies and, if so, what response have we got apart from encouragement from the Greek Government? <i>The Irish Press</i> of yesterday, Wednesday, 16 November, published an article which stated that Denmark had become the latest EEC country to oppose any attempt to spare Irish farmers from the pain of the new milk super-levy.  The article stated that Britain, the Netherlands, Italy and France have already objected to even the limited special deal for Ireland suggested by the Greek Government.  I hope the Minister will give us information on these reports printed in the media.  It is very discouraging to hear that we are losing allies day by day.  One must ask what the Taoiseach has done in an effort to get our partners in the EEC to understand our position. The Minister for Agriculture is a sincere, genuine man, but the Taoiseach as Head of this Government should have explained our case to our partners in the EEC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2710" /> On the adjournment of the House recently I spoke about the super-levy and I mentioned farmers in the west of Ireland who were advised to go into dairying and who had increased production particularly in the last few years.  The province of Connacht is an area which has a great deal of land classified as severely handicapped and great difficulties have been experienced there, as the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton is aware, in trying to increase dairy production, and the figures for that in that area are very encouraging.  The Minister in reply to me on that occasion said that he appreciated the problems but he could not make any special case for the west.  I was not asking him to do that.  I was giving a localised, regionalised example and explaining that he should have an understanding of the situation there. Farmers in County Galway, my county, have increased milk production there by 16 or 17 per cent over the last two years. It would be disastrous for them having been advised to go into dairying and having invested money in it, to have a 70 per cent levy imposed on them.  I give an example that would be common to many parts of Ireland.  If a farmer who had 15 cows in 1981, which we are told is the base year, were to increase his herd by ten cows in two years he would have to pay a levy of 70p per gallon on 6,500 gallons of milk, taking the average yield per cow in County Galway as 650 gallons. Such production would be small enough compared to some parts of Ireland and small certainly compared to countries in Europe.  The imposition of the proposed super-levy on such a farmer would mean a sum of £4,550.  If such a levy is to be imposed on a County Galway farmer the consequences for farmers in this country can be imagined.  I hope that the Government will continue to communicate these facts and figures to our partners in the EEC.  We cannot allow our vital national interests to be damaged.  We must state clearly that we will have no hesitation in employing the veto should it come to such a pass.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Noonan, mentioned the alternative attack that should be made on imports of New Zealand <Col N="2711" /> butter the contract for which I understand comes up for renewal at the end of this year, and the question of the import of cheap feeding stuffs and also, something of great interest to all farmers, the levy on milk factories.</P>

      <P>
        <i>The Irish Press</i> of yesterday contained an article by Mr. John Lichfield in Brussels which stated that plans to impose a further tax penalty on the so-called factory milk farmers had been revived.  Maybe the Minister when he is replying will tell us why this tax was not on the list of proposals and why it is now being revived.</P>
      <P>This type of production in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark is causing a glut in milk supplies. I hope he will explain why it is only now we are looking at the question of a tax on these milk factories.  Countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany base their production on heavy feeding of cows with concentrate feeding stuffs.  Their type of farming is different from what we are accustomed to.</P>
      <P>The Government should seek the elimination of all MCAs as they give an unfair advantage to several member states at the expense of the Community.</P>
      <P>As regards the super-levy on milk the question of the farm rescue package arises.  Part of the farm rescue package for many dairy farmers is that they would benefit from increased milk production. The implementation of the milk super-levy would put the whole rescue package at naught and would make nonsense of all the hard work that went into that rescue package.  Deputy Hyland has given examples of the targets that farmers were to achieve to make the rescue package viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are cutting down on expenditure on agriculture.  I sympathise with the Minister.  It must be difficult to negotiate on farm prices or on trying to extend the area of land considered to be severely handicapped areas, or fighting against the proposed super-levy.  We <Col N="2712" /> have no farm modernisation scheme and we are losing money from the EEC.  We cannot recoup in 1984 the grants we lost this year.  The Minister told me that we will be losing approximately £3 million because of the suspension of the farm modernisation scheme.  Last week we were told we will lose £50 million of EEC funds because farmers were not able to finish the work on their development programmes under the farm modernisation scheme and the western drainage scheme.  The Government erred in not allowing farmers who were short of cash to have their deadlines extended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that farmers who had not finished all the work will not get the total amount of the grants under those headings.  There is some confusion about the rescue package.  Many farmers who are awaiting the restoration of the farm modernisation scheme are confused about what proposals will be in the restored scheme.  They are being told the western package will deal with some of their investment problems.  The Government should make this very clear.  Will they lift restrictions on the western package to allow investment in buildings?  Can the Minister tell us that the farm modernisation scheme is definitely being restored?  Early autumn, late autumn and 1 November were given as dates by the Government for the restoration of that scheme which is so important for our farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this debate will impress upon the Minister and the Government the importance of allowing Irish farmers to develop.  This is an emergency debate to <Col N="2713" /> try to make the Government realise that they must fight for the complete rejection of the milk super-levy.  I was disappointed to hear many speakers talking about a derogation for a year or two, that there will be a compromise and we will get a special deal.  We want the complete rejection of the levy and I hope the Minister will be able to confirm that.</P>

      <P>Members of this House should have no doubt about the seriousness with which the Government are approaching the discussions now going on to prepare for the European Council Meeting in Athens on 5 and 6 December.  I should like to make it quite clear that, in approaching those discussions, the Government have been at considerable pains to make it abundantly clear to our partners in the Community that there are some things we cannot accept.</P>
      <P>During the course of this debate Deputy Kitt seems to have heard some suggestion that there was talk about a derogation for a year or so.  I do not know where he could have heard that suggestion. He certainly did not hear it from the Government.  As recently as last week, we made it very clear to our Community partners that, for all of the reasons which have been developed by speakers and by the Government, and which will be set out in even more detail by the Minister for Agriculture, we cannot accept the application of a super-levy in the form now proposed.  We have told our partners in the European Community that that will be our position during the next special council meeting on 28 November which I will attend with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and that that will be the position of the Taoiseach at the European Council Meeting in Athens on 5 and 6 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the framework of those negotiations that is an absolutely crystal clear statement of our position on that issue.  We will not change our position on that issue. It is obvious and understandable that agriculture and the question of the super-levy in particular should tend to dominate this debate.  A soundly based agricultural sector is of crucial importance <Col N="2714" /> to our economy.  It is the life blood of our economy.  It is so much a part of our economy that it is impossible to conceive of our going along with any action which would frustrate the further development of that sector.  Within that sector milk and its associated activities are extremely important.</P>
    <P>At this point in the debate I should like to draw attention to some of the other matters involved in the negotiations which, in themselves, also have a central importance for the future development of the Community, and the ability of the Community in the future to carry out the type of role which the Treaty gave it, and which very largely influenced the perception of the electorate here when we decided to join the Community in 1972.</P>
    <P>There is a central part of these negotiations which is concerned with the Community's own resources.  It might be useful if I were to illustrate briefly what the own resources system of the Community is, and how the Community finances itself.  The existing revenues required to finance the Community's activities consist of customs duties, agricultural levies on imports from outside the Community, levies on sugar production within the Community, and the proceeds of a flat rate of value-added tax calculated on a harmonised basis right across the Community. That rate currently is 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>The institution of this revenue system, the own resources system, in 1970 was a major achievement for the Community and gave it a financial base which had to be ratified by all the member states.  This gives the Community a legal right to the resources which are produced from the various elements I have just outlined.  In 1970 a limit of 1 per cent was set on the VAT part of the own resources which is by far the greater part of the own resources.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the total of the resources available to the Community under the own resources system, that is, the customs duties, the agricultural and sugar levies and the proceeds from the VAT will come to a maximum of 25 billion European currency units, roughly £18 billion. This total sounds large in our terms.  It <Col N="2715" /> would be the equivalent of 1¼ times our gross domestic product.  Of course it is quite small in overall Community terms. The total of the financial resources available for financing the Community's activities in any given year represents less than 1 per cent of the Community's gross domestic product.  The growth in own resources available has maintained a fairly stable trend over the years, over the last four years having been in the region of 10 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>Customs duties and agricultural levies cannot be relied upon to produce any real increases in revenue in the next few years.  The trend is for a slight decline in revenue from these.  Given the development of trading relations in the world and the various agreements which cover that aspect, the prospects are of a further decline in the amount of revenue being made available from those sources.  The VAT element now constitutes about 60 per cent of total own resources in the Community and can be expected to show some buoyancy in line with the gathering momentum of economic recovery in the Community.  The difficulty is, of course, that Community expenditure in the foreseeable future is likely to outdistance the growth in own resources.  This is where the central financing problem, which is the kernel of this negotiation, arises.  In recent years, expenditure from the Community budget has increased fairly substantially. It was 14 billion European currency units in 1979 and reached 25 billion in 1983.  Of the 1983 total, the provision for agricultural guarantee expenditure is about 15 billion ECUs, or about 61 per cent of the total budget.  That proportion in itself has fallen fairly substantially in recent years.  Agricultural spending accounted for about 75 per cent of total Community expenditure through most of the seventies.  The fall in the proportion accounted for by agriculture is attributable party to developments in agricultural spending reflecting market developments, a fairly restrictive price policy in operation for a number of years, the co-responsibility levies and other levies implemented since the later part of the seventies.  It is partly due, on the other <Col N="2716" /> side, to a real increase in budgetary allocation in areas other than the FEOGA guarantee &mdash; which, in part, finances the agricultural spending&mdash;and notably to increases in the amount of funding made available for the structural funds, particularly the regional funds and for development aid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Sixty-one per cent. Another element which has brought about a shift in the balance of expenditure in the Community and which again is a key element in these negotiations has been that <i>ad hoc</i> refunds to the United Kingdom since 1980 have added a significant new expenditure onto the budget.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, the trend of expenditure on agriculture will obviously be influenced to a very considerable extent by the measures at present being discussed to achieve greater control of agricultural spending.  As the Minister for Agriculture will be commenting on these at a later stage in the day, I do not intend to dwell on them now.  It is fairly clear that, even on the most extreme assumptions about the amount of saving achievable in agriculture, the normal growth of existing own resources will not be sufficient to meet expenditure requirements of the Community in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The central point which I want to come to is that the European Council are now faced with the issue of providing sufficient finance for the Community in the years ahead.  There are a number of reasons why this should be so. The cost of enlarging the Community, for example to include Spain and Portugal, has been estimated to be the equivalent of about 7 per cent of the budget, or about 1.7 billion ECUs annually in 1983 terms&mdash;that is about £1.15 billion.  It is clear that they will need additional own resources just to deal with that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2717" /> We have made it very clear during the negotiations that it is our view that the Community budget as it stands, at less than 1 per cent of the Community GDP, is not of a size that can bring about a substantial redistribution of income or of economic activity in the Community.  Its absolute volume is too small to allow that to be done.  That is a reason, and a most compelling reason in my view, for increasing the size of the Community budget.  It is also very clear that there are a number of new policy areas with which the Community should be involved which will require additional expenditure.  This, again, is a case which was made very strongly.  We have made the point that we would consider an increase of the VAT limit to 2 per cent to be justifiable. The latest proposal put forward by the Greek Presidency is for an increase of 1.8 per cent.  We have supported that, while saying that we still believe there is a case for going even further.  We are not the only member state in support of that.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that a number of member states, while agreeing on the need for increased own resources, are unready to specify a figure before they consider that enough progres has been made in bringing about savings in the current pattern of expenditure.  One member state has refused to contemplate the possibility at this stage of any increase in own resources.  There is a clear issue to which we have addressed ourselves and which we will continue to raise during the course of these negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we guess which member state?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Deputy would have too much trouble in guessing who that might be.  The other key issue involving the same member state covers the so-called problem of budgetary imbalances.  As I have said, a number of <i>ad hoc</i> solutions have been found in recent years to deal with what is essentially a problem for the United Kingdom, although it is perceived as being a problem for Germany also.  Over that period from a purely political point of view, on a pragmatic basic and in order <Col N="2718" /> to ensure the continuation of Community activities, we have accepted that the Community should make refunds of this kind, although Members of this House will not be surprised to hear that I believe that the basic justification for making refunds of this kind is very suspect, both in terms of Community financing and because it is based on a very narrow budgetary view of the Community's activities.</P>
      <P>Essentially, there are a great many Community activities that confer economic advantages on member states that are not and cannot be reflected in the budget.  Therefore, our position is that to base this discussion solely on budgetary growth means that we are taking a very incomplete view of the situation.  However, because it is particularly important for this country that the Community should continue to develop and that we should avoid having, year after year, these extremely bitter wrangles about this question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am about to conclude. Because we take that view we have gone along with the need to make arrangements like that but will, of course&mdash;and we have made this clear to our partners &mdash;be very jealous about the size of any arrangements because of the damage that these could potentially do to the Community's ability to finance policies in other areas which are of direct importance to us, or which we believe are of a wider importance to the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to concentrate my attack on a government, but for a change it is not this Government, it is the British Government, and particularly the Leader of that Government who, over the last number of years, has succeeded almost single-handed in bringing about a change in direction, a deviation from the principles of the European Economic Community and, quite frankly, a <Col N="2719" /> crisis within that Community.  In doing that, I am not just engaging in what might be seen as the vindictive role of Brit-bashing from this side.  I find myself in the distinguished company of the President of the Commission and very many members of the Council of the European Community.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance was dealing with the forthcoming European Council. I remember the 1978 European Council. I want to indicate what we can, hopefully, do to get the Community back on course. At that European Council we were then talking in terms of developing policies for Europe and about the funds necessary for those policies in a way consistent with the principles of the EEC.  The record will show that that Council came to the conclusion that distortions in the CAP should be eliminated, particularly those represented by positive MCAs.  They were first introduced in 1969 because of the then French devaluation by 11.1 per cent and German revaluation by 9.2 per cent.  They were meant to be temporary, but like many things in the European Community what was introduced as temporary became quite a characteristic of the Community policy in the intervening years.</P>
      <P>The European Council of 1978 unanimously decided that the EEC would move towards gradual but immediate, over a foreseeable period of five to ten years &mdash; five years was the time scale in mind&mdash;elimination of the positive MCAs because it was seen as being a distortion to maintain what was introduced as a temporary mechanism to deal with the French devaluation at the time. That was the intention until the British budget surfaced.  It surfaced in a way that everybody at European Council level and at Commission level were forced thereafter to react to the demands of one member state and one head of Government: &ldquo;I want my money back&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The imposition of the MCAs has three effects as it continues to be applied notably in the UK, the Federal Republic of Germany and The Netherlands.  It means that because you have a higher level of prices than the common price structure, <Col N="2720" /> which is an essential characteristic of the CAP, you get a higher level of milk production in each of these countries than otherwise you would have under a common price structure.  This has given rise to what has been called during my own time in the Council and the Commission as agriculture without soil or sun.  One of the basis of the CAP was to maintain as many involved in agricultural employment on the land as possible.  I cannot go into this in any great detail, but everybody is familiar with the principles of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The second consequence of those distortions is that you get higher consumer prices in the same countries.  As these countries are the main consumers it means that the level of consumption in those countries is lower than it would otherwise be.  You then get higher production encouraged by artificially high prices and lower consumption discouraged by the level of these prices.  You also get distortion where you have imported products which are not covered by the CAP.  These imported food products are tapioca, oil seed and many others.  The prices of those relative to the milk prices are reduced and thereby the importation of these substitute food inputs is encouraged.  The consequence of all of this is that we now have a surplus in the EEC costing the budget approximately 4,500 million ECUs this year.  It is not the sole cause of the problem but it is one of the major causes, because it is a departure from the principles of the CAP, meant to be temporary, but now is nearly enshrined as permanent.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister and the Government that they concentrate on coming back to that at the next European Council.  I am sure they have been arguing this because it is a resolution of the European Council.  I would also like to suggest that they concentrate on the principles of the European Community, which we have been obliged to ignore because of the attitude of the British Government and its Prime Minister in particular.  The reality is that before that budget demand emerged &ldquo;I want my money back&rdquo;&mdash; I heard those very words used at a European Council &mdash; the principle <Col N="2721" /> of <i>juste retour</i> was utterly contrary to the principles of the European Community. It is now apparently accepted as a norm.  Obviously differences arise even to accept and qualify how much money one is entitled to get back.  The very fact of the importation from third countries into Britain particularly from New Zealand, gives rise to tariffs at the border, which is part of the structure of the budget of the Community.  This is claimed as being a contribution by the United Kingdom to the EEC from the UK.  It is not any such thing.  It is simply a collection agency, like any other government would have to put up at the border on behalf of the Community under the rules of the Community and it is not part of a British budget contribution. It is time the heads of government clearly stated that.</P>
    <P>I noticed recently that unfortunately this position of a government has actually given rise to internal dissension within the Commission.  It is not the first time that the head of a government, the British Government particularly, directly intervened to try to influence allocations of responsibility within the Commission. That is utterly contrary to the basis on which the Commission must operate as an independent body.  It now emerges that apparently the tensions between the budget commissioner, who is from the UK, and the other members is such that people within the Commission are being accused of cooking the books when the Commission come up with proposals which demonstrate from their new appraisal that the British contribution is not of the order it is suggested to be. Unfortunately, the budget commissioner apparently felt constrained to suggest that this seemed to suggest that either he was being accused of cooking the books to show the British contribution higher than it actually is or that his colleagues were doing so.</P>
    <P>Every member state will be reacting to these problems until it is clearly stated that if the European Council is to have a role it will be a role, as it was originally suggested it would be, to create initiatives for the Community, which was protected by the institutional framework of the <Col N="2722" /> Commission, of Parliament and of the Council of Ministers before the European Council was dreamed up.  If it is to continue to simply be an occasion where the power of one member state or the stubborness of one member state demanding what I am glad to say was not conceded at the European Council in Dublin which I attended with the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, then it will eventually fail.  This Council was described in the British press, and some of our own press afterwards picked up that line, as a failure if not a disaster.  That Council was the great success of that period because the Council were not prepared to come to conclusions on terms which would undermine the whole basis of the European Community.</P>
    <P>It is important that these facts are stated.  The consequence is that the budget has been central to the whole argument with a view to accommodating the British case.  Agriculture has been attacked and the Minister has pointed out that the level of spending on agriculture, as a proportion of the total budget has dropped from something in the order of 75 per cent to 61 per cent.  If there was to be an attack, it should have taken place seven or eight years ago, but the British budget was not an issue at that time, hence the attack did not take place.  It is now taking place as a consequence of that budget.</P>
    <P>Over the last 15 years or so, we have watched agricultural employment drop from approximately 20 million to around eight million in the European Community. The numbers who have been displaced are now about the same as the numbers of unemployed in Europe.  If we are to continue on this pattern, especially in Ireland, what is the alternative option for farmers here or elsewhere who are going to be displaced as a consequence of this reaction to a budget preoccupation which was no part of the Community we joined, enshrined in the great names that we now just call upon like Gaspari, Schuman and Spaak?  I often wonder whether this generation will leave the memory of even one name in Europe that can be honoured as previous men were.</P>
    <P>The principles of the Common Agricultural <Col N="2723" /> Policy are what all governments should be relying on.  Of course one must point out that this proposal is not consistent with what those principles enshrined.  However, it is not the first time that this proposal was suggested. When I was a member of the Commission, this proposal was being suggested, and even before that.  I do not know what line of communication the Government have to the Commission, but they have left it very late to make their views known.  During my period in the Commission we used every opportunity to get support from like minded people within the Commission and like minded governments, and what was emerging as a proposal never saw the light of day.  The Government, for some reason, were not aware of what was likely to happen and, when it did happen, they had left it too late.  Maybe it is not too late yet but the strong demand is not always the most effective way of doing things.  We must insist on the principles of the Treaty, recruit the aid of our colleagues in the Community on that basis, and point out that any other way is not just disastrous for Ireland but also for Europe which, God knows, at this stage is very short on idealism.  Everybody recognises that.  The Government have been a little less than effective in bringing this matter to our attention.</P>
    <P>I hope that this debate will be seen as support for the Government in the broadest possible sense, some might say to stiffen their resolve or to criticise them but, above all else, to demonstrate through our Government, to our partners, especially to any one Government which can set back the whole pace of Europe, which has happened, that we will not tolerate this.  That should help the Government.</P>
    <P>On the question of veto, everyone knows there is no formal declaration of that term in the Community.  Certain decisions are to be taken unanimously and, that being so, the consequence is that if someone does not agree it is, effectively a veto.  I assume that the Government will not agree to this proposal, which is contrary to the principes of the <Col N="2724" /> Community, particularly as it applies to Ireland.  They will not be the first Government to impose the veto.  I heard it imposed, where it was never even intended to be considered at the European Council, not once or twice but four times by the Prime Minister of Britain.  I heard it imposed by her various Ministers at many other councils, and if that can be done in the national interest of one country, surely we can do it, not just in the narrow interest of Ireland, but in a way that is much more consistent with the principles of the Community we joined and the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy that are a central area.  If there are surpluses, we too must recognise that the way to tackle the problem is in the manner in which I suggested earlier on.</P>
    <P>We also need to recognise that we have done very well from this and many other policies and that sometimes we have not always applied them to the best effect. We owe it to our Community partners to ensure that every penny which is debated here is not dissipated either because of lack of efficient production or wasteful administrative expenditure.  I hope this debate will not only stiffen the resolve of the Government but will enable them to demonstrate to their partners that the unanimous position here is one of adhering to the principles of the Community we joined.  If the decision of the European Council, which is really an institution of the Community, will put more people off the land here or elsewhere, then I am afraid Europe is going to move into an even sorrier state of decline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of speaking here on this issue because there are times when I wonder whether our people fully appreciate what exactly is at stake.  I come from an area in North Cork which produces an enormous amount of milk, and all the population there, under one guise or another, are dependent on a strong and determined agricultural economy.  I do not know if they realise the loss of jobs that can and will occur if the super-levy comes in, whether in the dairy industry, co-operatives or the suppliers of dairy <Col N="2725" /> products, etc.  I do not know whether people in trade unions fully appreciate either what is at stake, and I do not think we are treating the issue as seriously as it deserves.  We have almost a crisis of confidence in the dairy industry, but I am glad to say that there is an appreciation that all the political parties are united in supporting the stand taken by the Government on this issue.  There are so many problems which should be taken into account and the consequences are so grave, that every section of the community must clearly indicate their total support for the Government in their fight in Europe.</P>
      <P>Confidence was being restored to the agricultural industry, especially dairying, this year.  There was a considerable rise in production of milk over the last year or two and now that confidence is being eroded.  This is regrettable.  The agricultural industry has suffered terribly over the past three or four years.  It is regrettable that at a time when confidence was being restored, this levy should be proposed. I suggest that the proposal is at the behest of some of the more powerful countries such as Germany, France and Britain.  We should not be slow in informing these people that it was not this country that created the surplus, that it was created by the very countries who are now pushing for the super-levy.  The figures indicate that our contribution to the surplus is of the order of 4 per cent.  If it transpires that we must pay in full so far as the super-levy is concerned, we will not be talking of the kind of EEC that we joined ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On average, our milk production yield is 700 gallons per cow whereas the northern European average is 1,200 gallons per cow.  Our farmers must be given the opportunity of reaching that higher level of production.  But when we compare northern European farmers with ourselves we are not comparing like with like having regard to the imports of cheap cereals that contribute substantially to the production of milk, close to the Port of Rotterdam in particular.  If we were to be given the opportunity of increasing our milk production to the north European average, we would be in a position <Col N="2726" /> to negotiate as equals but that is not the position at this time.  There is a great deal of resistance to what we are seeking. Neither the British nor the Germans are anxious that there be a derogation in our case.  In addition, it has come to my notice that COPA, the umbrella for organisations for the farming groups in Europe, are not supporting us either in this matter. We must not forget that.  There is a duty on our farming organisations to fight with determination to win the support of COPA in relation to a four-year derogation at least because that body could play an important part in this matter.</P>
    <P>There is a major duty on members of the European parliament to work with determination and with diplomacy to indicate clearly our dependence on the agricultural industry.  There may not be any country in the Community prepared to support us fully in this instance.  That is why I am so pleased that the Taoiseach has met the Heads of State of Britain, Germany, Greece and other countries and has made clear to them the importance of this super-levy in so far as we are concerned.  I must compliment also the Ministers for Agriculture, Finance and Foreign Affairs for the efforts they have been making to bring about a derogation.</P>
    <P>We joined the EEC in the confidence that our membership would mean a long and bright future for our agricultural industry.  We realised then that some of our more traditional industries would suffer. To that extent we have paid the price but the one industry above any other that membership was intended to help must not now be subjected to this severe blow of the imposition of the super-levy.</P>
    <P>If we are successful in our efforts to secure a derogation, the Italians may say that the same concession should apply to the South of Italy or the French may say that the poorer areas of that country should also qualify.  The British might say that Scotland or perhaps Northern Ireland should be treated in the same way.  I am not sure that we have the power to persuade these other countries of the absolute necessity for our not being subjected to the super-levy but in order to have the maximum power possible, <Col N="2727" /> the Government must have the support of all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture must be complimented on the stand he has taken in relation to the imports of New Zealand butter, particularly into Britain.  Those imports are playing a significant part in the British market, a market that is declining annually.  If the sort of determination that has been shown in this regard by our Minister is brought to bear in relation to the super-levy our position will be very much strengthened.</P>
    <P>Our level of dependency on agriculture is five times greater than is the case of any other member state.  In those circumstances I do not think that any increase in social funds or in any other fund will contribute to the alleviation of the hardship that will follow from the imposition of the super-levy.  We must be strong and united in fighting this issue.  We must continue to seek a full derogation from the super-levy.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the smaller and poorer nations are getting the type of break they need and that is a reason for giving a good deal of consideration to the use of the veto.  I do not have the knowledge of the technicalities of the EEC that the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture or Deputy O'Kennedy may have, but regardless of how much talk there may be about MCAs and so on, the fact remains that the whole issue relates to the question of whether farmers in the west or in the south or in any other part of Ireland will have to cut back on their production of milk.  They are wondering whether they should invest more money in the dairying industry, buy more cattle, erect more buildings, or begin to withdraw, whether they should begin to consider getting out of cattle altogether.  The consequences of such a decision for our industry, our co-operatives, for those people working in firms supplying agricultural machinery, hay sheds and so on will be dire.  Very quickly we will find ourselves in a situation in which there will be fewer people working with more and more people seeking unemployment benefit. When that begins to happen we will realise there is less money available to <Col N="2728" /> those in need and there will be no jobs available to those seeking work.</P>
    <P>This has been a useful debate.  This House should give the Minister and the Government absolute support in what they are doing and I sincerely hope their efforts will be crowned with success because, as a nation, we are in dire need of that success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to be given an opportunity of contributing to this debate.  Since I came into this House over ten years ago there have been very few debates of such importance to our people and the country as a whole.  My only criticism is that it has been limited. It is sufficiently important, indeed of such vital importance to our whole economy, that it should have been allowed continue until everybody in the House had had an opportunity of contributing.  I shall revert to that point later.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Crowley has just said, there were many reasons for our joining the EEC.  Those of us representing rural areas realise that our principal reason for joining was that we be given an opportunity to develop our greatest natural resource, that being land and, in particular, our grasslands.  Our farmers accepted the challenges of that time, borowed money to carry out various developments and purchased extra land and machinery.  Many of them, after their day's work in the fields, underwent educational courses in order to improve their theoretical knowledge of agriculture. While southern and eastern farmers had a headstart, western farmers responded to those challenges and opportunities and set about availing of new markets and better prices.  As one representing western areas, like the Minister of State, I should say that not alone is this proposed levy of immense importance to the east and south but is of considerable importance to the smaller farmers of the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally recognised that dairying presents our small farmers with the best possible opportunity for economic expansion and development.  Western farmers took full advantage of the new situation, despite their poor land structure and the fact that a large number of <Col N="2729" /> their holdings were in the hands of older men and women.  Indeed, there has been a dramatic expansion of dairy produce in western areas.  But we must still travel a long way in the west before reaching the national average output.  However, our farmers were confident that development already undertaken, investment already made and the hard work put in would pay off in the near future so that the west would no longer be the poor relation. Then we had the bombshell of this super-levy, when the hopes and aspirations of thousands of families were dimmed.  While some people might be inclined to feel that this proposed levy might affect the larger producers only, we in the west know that it will freeze the further development of the dairying industry, in particular in counties like Mayo and Donegal.  In Mayo there are approximately 3,500 suppliers.  The total output in 1981 was 19 million gallons of milk.  The output in 1983 is estimated at 23 million gallons and it was confidently expected that there would be an increase of 20 per cent in 1984 over the 1981 level. A cursory examination of the levy shows how dramatic its effects would be on western areas.  I shall revert to that later if I have time.</P>
    <P>If we examine the concept of the super-levy &mdash; and we have been told that it will be imposed in order to penalise those who have contributed to the present overproduction and overcapacity in Europe &mdash; then we will see that its objectives should bear equally on everybody. It is our contention that that is not the case, that the criteria being applied to each country are not fair.  The reality is that the levy will not meet the criteria and will affect us to a much greater extent than any other country.</P>
    <P>This figure probably has been mentioned many times but it is no harm to repeat that our total consumption amounts to approximately 4 per cent only of total EEC production.  It is also important to realise that agriculture, of which the dairying sector is the mainstay, amounts to 43 per cent of our total economic output.  The current November-December 1983 edition of the magazine <i>Europe</i> contains an extensive article <Col N="2730" /> entitled &ldquo;Agenda for Reform&rdquo; which all Members of this House should read.  It contains the following under the heading &ldquo;Common Policies&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>On this basis the Commission, in its review proposals to the EEC Council of Ministers, stressed two fundamental principles: The structural funds of the Community must be agencies of structural development and adaptation, rather than channels of financial redistribution. They must support actual Community objectives, not just contribute to projects decided at national level.</P>
    <P>That article continues to say: under the heading &ldquo;Agricultural Reform&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>It is therefore, the very success of the CAP, the achievement of its principal initial objective, which makes the review necessary.  The policy cannot remain the same when the goal is to achieve self-sufficiency in food, if this goal has been overtaken.</P>
    <P>The whole tenor of that article is sympathetic to and supportive of the present proposals of the Commission.  It would be fair to say, since its author is a freelance journalist, that the main information contained in that article probably was contributed by the Commission, either from among its members or staff. However, this article appears to me to contradict the terms of the Treaty of Rome.  Among the objectives of the Treaty of Rome are included those of promoting throughout the Community by harmonious development of economic activities continued and balanced expansion, increased stability and an accelerated raising of standards of living.  Therefore, I do not think those two statements can be reconciled.  The rules of the Treaty of Rome, as were referred to by Deputy O'Kennedy, are being changed by stealth.</P>
    <P>Recently the Taoiseach received a document from North Connacht farmers seeking the approval and aid of the Government for having certain areas in Ireland redesignated or reclassified.  In the course of that letter they said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2731" /> In any negotiations which should take place in future we would be most disappointed if the Irish negotiators would allow any benefits to Mountain Areas (i.e. areas coloured brown on the map of Europe), without getting similar benefits for the Severely Handicapped Areas in Ireland which have been shown to be even more disadvantaged than some of the Mountain Areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the problems when we are limited to 15 minutes. That document contained the following:</P>
      <P>Again, one of the main objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy is &ldquo;to ensure the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If this levy goes through the document from the North Connaught Farmers Co-operative Society will have been a waste of time.</P>
      <P>One of the problems of a short debate is that people who would have liked to speak could not.  Deputy Coughlan asked me to say that Donegal farmers will suffer a loss of approximately £3.5 million if this levy goes through and their future development will be severely curtailed.  In Donegal, as in Mayo, the smaller herd owner &mdash; in the 12 to 15 cow bracket &mdash; will be badly hit.  In those counties milk production is expanding and this levy will kill that expansion.  Contrary to all the commitments, promises, help and assistance to the disadvantaged areas of the Community, it would in reality forestall and stifle the initiative of people in some of the worst disadvantaged areas of the Community, who only want a fair opportunity to develop to the utmost one of the best options they have for development, that is, dairying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Mayo 30 per cent of suppliers will go to the wall.  These are the people who borrowed money and who need to expand to pay their interest and other <Col N="2732" /> charges.  Most of those who are getting assistance from the Government under the rescue package will be affected because further expansion of their enterprises is needed.  The dairy industry forms a far greater percentage of our GNP than it does for any of our EEC partners and bears unduly heavily on this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture is quoted in the CBF news, winter 1983 edition, as follows:</P>
    <P>Up to now, most of the attention on the proposals has been focused on the milk super-levy and the other suggestions to curb surpluses in the dairy sector.  This is quite natural, because the imposition of such a levy would penalise our dairying industry in a grossly unjust and inequitable way. However, apart from the implications for the dairying sector, the super-levy would also have serious implications for the beef sector on in that 80% of our beef production comes from the dairy herd; quite obviously, any restrictions on dairying would also damage the beef industry.</P>
    <P>We must also take into consideration one of our fastest growing industries which is referred to in the IDA News, No. 2, 1983, headed &ldquo;Agricultural Processing: Ireland's Most Important Industry&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I cannot complete all I want to say in one minute, but I would like to read part of a letter from the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society Limited:</P>
      <P>It must be understood that this issue is not necessarily an agricultural one. The dairy sector is a labour intensive industry employing approximately 20,000 workers, not to speak of the service sector which is so dependent on co-operative agribusiness in Ireland. These proposals further threaten a major number of these urban and rural jobs, at a time when we can do without such threats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is up to the Government to go forward <Col N="2733" /> now knowing they have the full backing of every Member of this House.  I say to the Minister and to the negotiators: go forward and do not be afraid of the word &ldquo;veto&rdquo;.  As Deputy O'Kennedy said, it has been used on many occasions before but never will it be used to greater effect and never will it have a greater influence on our national interest than it will now. I say to the Minister go forward, use the veto if you have to, and you will have the unanimous support of this House and the backing of most of the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this opportunity to put on record my total rejection of the current EEC proposal, particularly the super-levy on milk.  Having listened to contributions of other Deputies, the theme enunciated by all is solidarity for the action taken by the Government in opposing this levy.  It is difficult to confine oneself to 15 minutes on such a wide-ranging debate which has very serious implications for every sector of the economy, not only for the farmers whose livelihood derive, from milk, beef and other farming enterprises, but for all associated enterprises.  The number of jobs directly related to agriculture will be seriously curtailed if this levy were to go through in the form originally proposed.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the people in Europe who thought up this levy believed it could be imposed in the spirit in which the European Community was set up.  It was part of the original plan that the weaker sections of the Community would get specialist treatment.  That is completely inconceivable in the proposal in its present form and would effect Ireland in the final analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1972 I and many others committed ourselves to bringing Ireland into the EEC because of the advantages we felt would accrue from participation in a wider market.  For far too long we had been incarcarated by the policies of the United Kingdom in relation to farm produce. It was our market, and their cheap food policy kept the development of Irish farming at such a low level that even in the 11 years of our membership of the EEC it was impossible to achieve a level of growth that other countries had <Col N="2734" /> enjoyed for a far longer period.  Because of our low level of productivity in milk compared with that of other member states we must fight tooth and nail in resisting this imposition with all the resources at our disposal.</P>
    <P>The problem which has brought about this proposal appears to be the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy and Community expenditure on agriculture which is regarded as excessive.  When we examine the facts do we find it excessive? FEOGA, the farm fund, represents no more than .5 per cent of the Community GDP, compared with expenditure on the provision of arms and nuclear warheads which would rise as high as 20 per cent. Yet the attempt is being made to undercut further the investment in agriculture and the development and growth of food that is so essential to the survival of not only the people of western Europe but of the world at large.  The resources in western Europe are far in excess of resources of many other parts of the world, the Third World for example, where millions of people die each year of starvation. What kind of Christian philosophy have we if we are attempting now to use measures that will curtail, cut back, prevent the growth of essential food products? Surely it is not too difficult for the administrators in and outside the EEC and other trading units and regions throughout the world to devise some policy that would re-distribute that food rather than build up mountains of it.  We need a newer form of technology.  A speaker in the House yesterday evening referred to the fact that about 60 per cent of milk production here was converted into butter in 1972.  Since we joined the EEC we have doubled our milk production and now 80 per cent of our total milk production is being converted into butter.  In that context we are not examining the new technologies available to us.  We are not investing, and Europe has failed us in this respect.  An insufficient amount is put aside in the budgets for food development, the presentation of foods for consumer purposes, new products and the use of milk not only for butter, and there is a cutback in the use of butter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2735" /> In expenditure in agriculture even since 1978 there has been a decline in the percentage of the money being spent on the preservation of the very institution that really enabled Ireland to join the Community.  It is probable that that institution caused our nearest neighbour to have scond thoughts about joining the Community.  I refer to the CAP and its impact on that country's budgets in terms of industry and so on.  The costing of agriculture with the imports into the EEC of agricultural produce from certain third countries does not take into account levies raised on agriculture in the Community which if were taken into account would reduce it even further.  Any dismantling of the CAP will have disastrous consequences for the Irish economy.  If we are serious about developing our economy then milk and related agricultural products represent the only way forward.  How often in debate in this House have Members referred to that? Farming organisations and trade unionists recognise that there is a great potential for industrial growth in agriculture, and if we are to accept what is being proposed in even a milder form the consequences for us would be significant.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record the value of agriculture to our economy.  It contributes 12 per cent of our GDP and 35 per cent of our exports.  That is a significant creation of wealth in our economy, and any attempts to interfere with that would have the most awful consequences for each and every one of us.</P>
    <P>I sympathise to some extent with any negotiator who has to deal with the more powerful institutions of the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, you have five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>However, we must face up to our responsibilities in this respect. Mention has been made of the veto.  I believe that at the end of the day it will not come to that.  I feel that Britain would love to see us using the veto because they want a way out of the EEC, or at least they try to make that case.  The veto should be mentioned only as a last resort. <Col N="2736" /> They have mentioned the veto before now and I think they did so because they believe that the disintegration of the CAP would be in the best interests of the UK. Agriculture is vital to our economy and we must bear that in mind and not allow ourselves to be caught up in a situation where we may have no escape or redress.</P>
      <P>I am mindful of the pressure brought to bear on the Community budget in relation to the measures brought by Denmark when they were fighting for certain concessions in regard to their fisheries. They fought a hard battle.  They came back time and time again and did not concede until they felt that they had secured something worth while.  A similar attack on the present composition of all the institutions within the EEC is demanded at this stage.</P>
      <P>It is easy to make a defence for the retention of what we have in relation to growth and milk productivity.  Mention has been made here of our 750 gallons per animal compared with 1,200 or 1,300 gallons elsewhere, and a Member here this morning said that in America they are now producing animals and feeding them with highly concentrated compounds so that almost every time they raise their heads they are fed and they produce milk.  We are talking about 2,500 gallons per animal.  Where will it all stop? There must be a ceiling, but the ceiling cannot be aligned to the 1981 levels of milk production.  We have increased milk production significantly since 1981, perhaps by 16 or 20 per cent, and I can envisage a much greater increase.  Farmers here advocate and advisers recognise that there is real wealth to be generated in the production of milk and industries related to it.  They have been mentioned here.  One speaker referred to disease eradication.  I did not agree with the point he made.  Without disease eradication and involvement and investment in it, we would not be at our present state of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the wider European farming organisation, COPA, there is not support for us.  All farming organisations have to protect the interest of their individual farmers.  As a result of the efforts of the Taoiseach in going to Athens to meet the <Col N="2737" /> Greek Prime Minister, and the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture and his advisers, there is a recognition that Ireland has a special case.  Within that special position we must ensure that the best possible benefits are achieved for us. We hear talk about derogation.  Farming organisations are requesting a derogation. I would support derogation for the period of the three proposals up to 1989. The situation could be reviewed at that stage.</P>
    <P>I could say a great deal more but I cannot do so because of the agreement. I support the Minister and the Government. I am glad to see unity and solidarity on both sides of the House.  That will demonstrate to the bigger members of the EEC the determined mood of the Irish people to defend our basic livelihood and our dignity as a nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this very important issue.  I was unable to be in the House yesterday because I was expelled on Wednesday week when I demanded that this issue be discussed.  Many local authority members, county councillors and others have discussed this issue.  As a relatively new Member of the House I was annoyed and shocked that the Government were treating the matter in such a careless way.  We had to have an unseemly half hour of wrangling to alert the Taoiseach and the Minister to the fact that the issue was serious enough to have it debated here.  Even though the time is short I am pleased that the Government gave time for the debate.</P>
      <P>Last week the Taoiseach said that if we in Fianna Fáil were serious we would put down a motion.  Our spokesman tabled a motion almost three weeks ago.  It was unfair of the Taoiseach to suggest that we were not responsible.  It is stated in today's papers that the IFA and the ICMSA were disappointed with the attendance at the debate here yesterday. I could not be here, but last week I played my part in no uncertain manner, not by being unruly but by supporting our spokesman in his efforts to have the matter raised.  Within 12 hours agreement was reached and time was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2738" /> I agree with what the IFA and the ICMSA said about the Government's lack of interest in this issue up to this moment.  I do not know why they waited until the eleventh hour to debate it.  It is a national issue.  It concerns workers and farmers.  Weeks ago we in Fianna Fáil gave a commitment to support the Government in any action to reject the super-levy out of hand.  As the days passed by, statements were made here and in Brussels.  We were led to believe that our cause was getting weaker and weaker.</P>
    <P>We must stop being nice guys in Brussels. We have been good Europeans in every sense of the word over the past ten years.  We should take a leaf out of Mrs. Thatcher's book.  I do not suggest we should try to wreck the system as she has tried to wreck it.  She must be admired for one thing.  She fought for her own people and she gained what she was trying to gain.  We must not shilly shally. This is our basic industry.  We want to strengthen the Government's hand.  Why was the Taoiseach weak-kneed?  I do not know.  It is his responsibility to support his Minister.  We must fight this issue.</P>
    <P>In a few weeks' time we will know what type of new farm modernisation grants are to be introduced.  These grants were discontinued on budget day and almost 5,000 farmers were chopped off and deprived of their grants.  I appeal to the Minister to show a little courage and show people in Brussels that we believe there is a future in farming.  Those farmers should be paid their grants when the scheme is reintroduced.  On the advice available to them they tried to improve their holdings and to create employment in milk, bacon or beef.  They were sold down the drain on budget day.</P>
    <P>What kind of treatment can we expect in Brussels if our Government show a lack of faith in agriculture and especially in our small farmers?  I do not want the Minister to say in two or three weeks' time: &ldquo;We have a new modernisation scheme and to hell with the 4,600 farmers who complied with every regulation and were then cut off.&rdquo;  They should be paid their grants.  In my own constituency 93 applicants were deprived of those grants. <Col N="2739" /> Let us show the people in Brussels that we have faith in our farmers.</P>
    <P>Ireland's average milk yield is 680 gallons compared with over 1,000 gallons in the Netherlands and other countries where they have cheap imported raw materials to support their milk farms. Over 85 per cent of Irish dairy farmers have fewer than 30 cows.  Over 53 per cent of Irish farmers depend on milk production. In other words, the average small family holding will be crucified by this super-levy.  If we play the nice gentlemen in Brussels we will regret it in the years ahead.  Of course the British want cheap food.  We were long enough under the thumb of the British, but we will not be under the thumb of Mrs. Thatcher any longer.  We are an independent State and we should go out there and fight.</P>
    <P>Eighty per cent of our beef comes from the dairy herd and 11,000 people are employed in the processing industry generally and 6,000 in beef processing.  If anything detrimental happens in this area, our co-operative movement will collapse and our beef production come to a standstill.  We will have dole queues from here to Donegal, and neither the Government nor we want that to happen. We are now at a crossroads.  We may talk about the hard work done by the IDA down through the years in bringing industry into this country, but all that effort and public money will be gone down the drain if this super-levy is imposed.  We are in danger of losing a chance of stabilising our basic industry if we do not fight hard.  When county councils and ACOT can have taken the matter so seriously for weeks past it is a reflection on the Government that they did not debate the issue.  If we had been given a three day debate it would not be a waste of time, it would be time well spent.  This is the most serious issue to be debated here since the thirties &mdash; the time of the economic war, which was brought about again by the tyranny of the British trying to keep us down.</P>

      <P>If this super-levy is introduced, in the first year alone it will cost our farmers £146 million.  That is a lot of money and its loss will cause a lot of hardship.  The bulk of these small farmers who would be affected have borrowed heavily over the last number of years to finance buildings and livestock.  A lot, through no fault of their own but through TB or brucellosis, have suffered losses in their herds.  These farmers went through many difficult years, especially the last four years, when the cost of their input was so great that they were only barely surviving and trying to keep at bay their bank managers or other lending agencies, which are quietly behind the scene threatening and frightening the life out of these honest people.  These farmers very seldom look for handouts or cry out for help.  They do their work and work long hours.  If they are going to be let down on this issue, we will regret it for years to come.</P>
      <P>I repeat that we in the Fianna Fáil Party support the Government, but from today onwards there should be no contradictory statements by a member of or on behalf of the Government, or by sources close to the Government.  We want clear-cut statements on this issue, to let the people across the pond know that we are not going to take this lying down.</P>
      <P>John F. Kennedy said &ldquo;Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country&rdquo;.  We ask the Government to act on behalf of the people and do something for them.  This issue is more serious than many realise. A man told me the other day &ldquo;Farmers are always moaning&rdquo;.  I told him that there will be a lot more people moaning if this problem is not solved to the satisfaction of the Government and our people.  There will be unemployment across the board, in our meat factories, our building industry, and our machinery industry.  Our whole economy will grind to a halt and the dole queues, which are already too long, will be longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No other member state of the EEC has a stronger case than we have.  Perhaps there is enough time left for the Taoiseach to go on a tour to drum up support <Col N="2741" /> for our case from other Heads of State, as Fianna Fáil requested a few weeks ago. He did not think it was serious enough to do that, but I hope he will not regret it. I wish the Taoiseach and his Ministers every success in these negotiations and entreat them to remain firm on behalf of this little nation of ours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to add my sentiments to those of many of my colleagues on this issue.  It is very important from the point of view of our entire population, not alone the farming sector.  At the outset, we must recognise the magnitude of the task facing us and the reasons for this crisis in relation to the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy.  At a time like this we need the best possible team of negotiators to represent our farmers and our nation.  In the team of Ministers who are going to Europe, we have those very people.  It is at times of crisis like this that we must recognise their value and call on their wealth of experience, negotiating powers and determination to bring off for us the best possible deal.</P>
      <P>We should address ourselves briefly to the problems from the point of view of simplistic solutions.  I listened to a number of speakers and am somewhat worried that our EEC compatriots listening in &mdash; and I am sure they are &mdash; might think that we are a little parochial and are not assessing the whole situation, or not fully aware of the problems existing in Europe.  We are only too well aware and are also aware of the consequences of the failure to resolve this problem from the point of view also of the Europeans. There is no sense in anybody saying that Ireland will have to accept the super-levy or any kind of circumstances which are less beneficial than those prevailing at present.  We cannot do that.  If we do, it would be the first step in a total and absolute disintegration of what has become to be known as the European Economic Community.  It may be something which today militates against Ireland, but tomorrow it will be somebody else's turn.  I warn our EEC partners to take this into account at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said, and rightly so, that is <Col N="2742" /> is unacceptable that the surpluses of agricultural produce should be allowed to continue, with butter mountains and milk ponds and so forth year after year, at great cost to the EEC.  It must also be pointed out that Ireland's contribution to the creation of those surpluses is minimal in comparison with that of their colleagues. I ask that our negotiators forcefully point out during the forthcoming negotiations that our contribution to those surpluses is by comparison minimal and that our dairy industry should not be asked to remain at a full stop when we have not yet reached our full potential in that area and have not nearly reached the degree of production or efficiency of our EEC partners.</P>
    <P>Why should we be asked to pay the penalty at a time of financial stringency, economic uncertainty and recession? Why should we be asked to curtail our major industry?  We have many unemployed at present.  Why should we be asked to make further sacrifices and accept proposals from the EEC which would have no result other than further unemployment or rendering impossible the creation of employment in the future? We would be in serious dereliction of our duty if we do not put forward the strongest possible case and point out that if such a package were forced on us it might well be good sport now from the point of view of our EEC partners but might not be such good sport in two or three years' time when they themselves might be in a similar position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The five year special border areas programme which commenced in 1981 is part of the first series of ERDF non-quota measures. Commission proposals for a second series of measures under the non-quota section of the ERDF are at present being examined in the council.  The proposals originally put forward last November did not include any substantial measures for Ireland, but a commitment was given that proposals to finance new measures in Ireland and Northern Ireland would be developed.  Such proposals are currently under active consideration.  Given the present stage of these discussions, I am not in a position to make a definitive statement at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that having regard to the considerable benefits which have accrued to the Border counties from this particular scheme over the period of its operation there is a need at this stage for us to give the commitment to its retention and expansion by greater funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Deputy, I am convinced that we need to continue with measures of this kind for a further period. As I said, such measures are under discussion but given the nature of the discussions at the moment I would prefer not to make any more public statements about it than I have already made.  I accept the Deputy's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Deputy Kirk and what the Minister said in reply.  I was actually the Minister who proposed the inclusion of the Border regions in the non-quota scheme. The Irish Border regions are the only border regions in the Community included in such a scheme.  I take it that the Minister is conscious of the fact that the non-quota section is being applied to what are called the areas in sectoral decline throughout the Community, the major steel industry areas and others like that.  Would the Minister take that into account in the attitude he takes to the <Col N="2744" /> proposal to renew the non-quota section because, relatively speaking, we are getting much less from it than we are from the Regional Fund quota?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the point which the Deputy is basically making is more appropriate in a context other than that of the non-quota section on its own. It is a matter which is being touched on in the discussions which are the subject of the other debate here today.  The question of our position within the Regional Fund in general, the guarantees we have and the certainty we have in relation to the amount of funding to be made available to this country are matters which are uppermost in my mind in those discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The VAT rate on marine safety equipment is one of the issues which I shall examine in the course of my preparations for the 1984 budget.  I should remind the Deputies that relief from VAT is given at present on a number of items used in marine life-saving, as follows:</P>
      <P>Sea-going rescue vessels of more than 15 tons are zero-rated;</P>
      <P>Articles of clothing, for example life-jackets, are zero-rated;</P>
      <P>Refunds of VAT paid on the purchase or hire of life boats or rafts can generally be obtained by VAT unregistered sea-fishermen;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Royal National Lifeboat Institution's <Col N="2745" /> activities are zero-rated; consequently all VAT incurred, which is included in its returns, is repaid by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>VAT registered sea-fishermen can, of course, deduct VAT paid on any equipment used for their business activities.</P>
    <P>Other items used in marine life-saving are generally taxable at the 35 per cent rate.  The short-term hire of life rafts is, however, liable at the 23 per cent rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I can detect a note of readiness to re-examine the position from the Minister's opening reference that he would look at it in the context of his budget.  I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that VAT at the luxury rate of 35 per cent on things such as life rafts, fire fighting equipment, distress signals, flares and lifebuoys is a major disincentive against safety at sea.  Will the Minister acknowledge that only a very small minority of the fishing vessels are actually registered for VAT and can reclaim it?  In view of the need to encourage safety at sea or on our inland waterways whether in fishing vessels, pleasure cruisers or anything else, will the Minister in the course of his examination look at this very seriously to ensure that safety, which is obviously so urgent if one is to judge from recent events, will be promoted as a matter of policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points in what the Deputy has said.  The 35 per cent rate, as the Deputy knows, is the normal rate of VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the highest rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the highest rate, not a luxury rate.  The second point is that I would like to remind the Deputy that VAT unregistered sea fishermen can generally get a refund of VAT on the purchase or hire of lifeboats or rafts.  That is a specific provision which applies for the refund of VAT in the case of those unregistered people similar to the refund of VAT which can be obtained by farmers in certain cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the revenue from the 35 per cent VAT, which includes fire fighting equipment, distress signals, flares and lifebuoys, will have only marginal effect on the revenue to the Department?  Does he agree that if we had zero VAT rating on this equipment more people would be in a position to purchase this equipment and while we could never measure what we would save in monetary terms hopefully we could measure it in terms of life?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the total amount involved here is not very large. I have made the point that for those who use these items in the course of their business in the normal case they can get a refund of the VAT so there is no net burden on the people using these items in the course of their business.  The final part of Deputy Gallagher's question concerns people who are using these items in the course of their recreational activities, which is where the difficulty arises.  The VAT inclusive price is a part of the total cost of their recreational activities.  VAT, as Members know, is a tax on final consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the people involved in this for recreational activities are giving an excellent service, that most of the divers along the coast are unpaid and are doing this for recreation, nevertheless they are giving a service to the public and they are doing a job that possibly no Government Department could do or pay a person to do?  Would he give a commitment to the House that he will seriously consider removing this 35 per cent and leaving it at zero rating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to recreational activities I am sure the Minister is as concerned as anybody else that people who avail of our tourist facilitis on our inland waterways or at sea should also be encouraged to use life saving equipment? Would the Minister in fact distinguish between those who may be amateurs and those who are professionals in providing that equipment?</P>

      <P>I feel that Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Gallagher are pressing the argument past the point which is really appropriate for this kind of discussion.  I do not dispute what they have said.  I said it is one of the items I will consider in the preparation of the 1984 budget.  As both of the Deputies know, this is not an area which can safely and completely be sealed off from any other area that is now subject to VAT.</P>

      <P>With regard to the last part of the Deputy's question, I have already told the House that this is one of the matters I will be considering in the budget.  With regard to the earlier part of the Deputy's question, I have to tell him that I do not know how much VAT is collected on hurleys.  VAT is not collected and recorded on the basis of the type of products involved, it is collected and recorded on the basis of the rates at which it is applied.  We do not have separate statements from those selling hurleys to the effect that they collect £x of VAT on hurleys, £y on brush handles and £z on other sporting goods.  The amount is not separately identified in that way.</P>

Is the Minister aware that this is leading to a scarcity of hurleys and as a result hurleys are getting dearer?  Hurleys cost now between £7 and £8 each.  Will the Minister give us an indication that he will abolish VAT on hurleys in the forthcoming budget as a gesture to our people who cherish this national game?</P>

If it is not possible to remove VAT on hurleys, in view of the significance of what Deputy Treacy said about the centenary of the GAA, will the Minister consider making an appropriate grant to recognise the role of Cumann Lúthchleas Gael ansec in Éirinn and promote the type of healthy recreation Deputy Treacy spoke of?</P>

The information given to the Deputy when in office as Minister for Finance was based on a rough unofficial estimate of hurley sales.  It was not an estimate of the amount of VAT collected on the sale of hurleys.  The figure was built up from an unofficial estimate of hurley sales and what the resulting yield of VAT would have been at the then prevailing rate.

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a pensioner with no source of income other than his old age pension would not be liable for income tax.  Where, however, <Col N="2751" /> an inspector of taxes has reason to believe that a person has sources of income other than those already on record, it is a normal procedure to issue a questionnaire so as to obtain full details of the person's income from all sources to enable the exact tax liability to be established.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's reference to old age pensioners may arise from the issue of questionnaires some months ago from a particular tax district, in a limited number of cases, many of which went to old age pensioners.  As explained at the time, the particular questionnaires, in the form of stock letters designed many years ago, were addressed to persons who were known to have other sources of income and who had failed to respond to earlier inquiries from the inspector of taxes.  The issue of these questionnaires to old age pensioners was not in conformity with current practice and the addressees were then contacted and advised to disregard them.  If there is any particular instance causing concern, I should glad if the Deputy would let me have details of the case or cases concerned.</P>

Such a record should exist because most of these people worked with the local authorities. The questionnaires were being sent out up to this month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has investigated the impact on the Irish economy of the possible ending of the special interest rate subsidy arrangements for Ireland under the EMS system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the special support arrangements for the less prosperous member states participating in the European Monetary System took the form of guaranteed access to subsidised loans from the European Investment Bank and the New Community Instrument for Borrowing and Lending (NIC) for the five-year period 1979-1983. Ireland and Italy were the only two member states to benefit from this Council decision.  I am happy to tell the House that we have secured our full entitlement to these subsidised loans which have been concentrated mainly in helping to finance economic infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the Council decision which made these subsidised loans available applied to the five-year period 1979-83 only.  Since coming into office I have taken every opportunity in the course of my many contacts with the Commission and the European Investment Bank of stressing the importance of the subsidised loans to this country.  I was, therefore, gratified that the Commission last June made a proposal to the Council of Ministers to extend the support arrangements for a further two-year period.  The Council has examined the proposal on a number of occasions and <Col N="2754" /> negotiations are continuing.  No decision will, however, be taken until the European Parliament gives its opinion, probably at the end of the year or very early in the New Year.  The House should be aware, however, that no consensus to renew the arrangements has so far emerged at Council level.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will understand that because the issue is still under negotiation it would hardly be appropriate to concede the possibility of the subsidised loans coming to an end.  My own view is that if the EMS is to be maintained and strengthened and if progress is to be made generally in promoting integration in the Community, it is essential that Community action to help to strengthen our economic potential should be continued. It is on that basis I am continuing my contacts with other member states and with the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the capitalised value this year of the subsidies?  In view of the fact that the Irish economy is in a much more serious state than it was in 1978 when the interest subsidies were negotiated at a meeting of the European Council which I attended, will the Minister not agree that he has a strong case to make to his colleagues in the Council to adopt the Commission proposal for a further extension of two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual value of the subsidies is £45 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to continue to make progress towards a greater degree of economic convergence and integration in the Community this kind of assistance should continue to be made available to member states who are specifically in our position.  That has been, and will continue to be, the basis of the case I have been making to the Commission and to my colleagues, the Finance Ministers of the other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister <Col N="2755" /> point out to his colleagues in the Council that by comparison with 1978 when we had growth, falling inflation and falling unemployment, our situation is much different from what it was when these points were conceded at the Council?  Will he point out those facts to his colleagues in the Council when they come to consider the position?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The central thrust of the statement I made on the last occasion when this matter was discussed in the European Council was much along the lines outlined by the Deputy.  I made the case that, if anything, the justification for applying the subsidies is now even greater than it was when the system was instituted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the extra cost to the Exchequer in 1983 of (a) capital and (b) interest repayments of total Exchequer foreign borrowings arising from the Government's decision in March 1983 to devalue our currency within the EMS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The re-alignment of the exchange rates of the EMS currencies agreed last March had the effect of increasing the Irish pound value of capital repayments on Exchequer foreign debt by about £12 million in 1983 and, as I said in my statement to the Dáil on 22 March, the effect on interest payments on foreign debt in 1983 is approximately £17 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I wish to raise with the Minister.  First, how can he square what he has said with a statement he made a month ago pointing out that the interest payments arising from devaluation would be higher than anticipated?  Secondly, how does he square his statement with what was said by the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, <Col N="2756" /> in London where he indicated that this year our total external debt will amount to almost $8 billion, or approximately IR£6.9 billion?  On that basis looking at the adjustments on the exchange rate, the actual rise in our external debt over the year would be about £1.5 billion. How does the Minister reconcile the figure of £17 million with the statement, assuming that what the Minister of State said in London is true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should refer more closely to what I said.  In March I said the effect of the realignment on interest payments on foreign debt would be approximately £17 million and that continues to be the situation.  The Irish pound value of capital repayments on Exchequer foreign debt will increase by about £12 million this year as a result of the realignment.  There is no difficulty whatever in squaring those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the statement of the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, in London not long ago on behalf of the Government?  He indicated that our total external debt this year would be $8 billion?  Arising from the adjustments in the exchange rates this year, this would suggest that the increase in our external debt would be of the order of £1.5 billion. I am asking the Minister to square that figure with what he has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is arguing from the particular information I have given him about the change in the Irish pound value of capital repayments and the effect on interest repayments to the total of our foreign borrowing.  What we are talking about here is only one component of the total of our foreign borrowing programme during 1983.  There is no reason why there should be any particular convergence or divergence between the trends of the two amounts.  The subject matter of this question is one of many components of our total foreign borrowing this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister referring to borrowings we have taken out in 1983 and the adjustment on such borrowings? <Col N="2757" /> Is that what the Minister is referring to in the £17 million?  I am talking about our total borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the change in interest payments and the change in the value of capital repayments arising from the re-alignment in 1983&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would stop interrupting me he might hear what I am saying.  The change arises in respect of amounts of loans taken out before the date of the realignment.  There is no effect on loans taken out after that because obviously they were taken out at the interest rates and exchange rates that applied post-alignment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now getting into semantics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Deputy the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister dismissing from the calculation the cost of the borrowings post-devaluation?  Is he implying that we should not take into account the extra capital repayments and the extra interest that will arise simply because it was after a very bad devaluation decision by the Government?  If the Minister wishes to engage in such semantics he is entitled to do so but he is not recognising the very damaging impact of that decision on our budget deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there is nothing I can do to help the Deputy if he believes that a precise answer to a precise question is semantics because he does not happen to like the answer.  He asked what would be the extra cost to the Exchequer in 1983 of capital repayments and interest payments of total Exchequer foreign borrowings arising from the decision in March 1983 to devalue our currency within the EMS.  If I am being semantic I might quibble with the specific terms of that question.  I have given the Deputy <Col N="2758" /> the answer on what difference that action made to the amount of capital repayments and interest payments we have had to make during 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite clear from the manner in which the Minister has approached this question that he is excluding from the cost of interest and capital repayments any borrowings this year since the devaluation.  If he thinks that is not an extra cost to the Exchequer and that it will not strain the budget deficit, with which he is understandably concerned &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has spoken twice of what he considers to have been a bad devaluation decision.  I will not be drawn on that because it is an old song the Deputy has been singing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>And will sing again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>He will sing it again in spite of what we have seen over the years in terms of our very substantial performance in the growth of industrial exports, not a little of which must be attributed to the realignment, as anyone in the business of exporting will tell the Deputy if he cares to ask them with an open mind. The realignment does not incur cost of debt contracted since 21 March.  That debt is paid for at whatever market rates of interest are, at whatever the exchange rates are.  If we were to follow the Deputy's view we would have to go back over all our existing foreign debt and track back through all the changes in exchange rates since a given debt was incurred, to find out what now is the effect.  We would have to go back to unspecified dates and we could debate the matter for days, arguing about which point was the starting point in order to begin to calculate the effects on all borrowing. Frankly, I do not think it would be worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling us that calculating such things are so tedious and so time-consuming that they are not worth while undertaking?  Surely they are worth while in view of the cost <Col N="2759" /> to the Exchequer?  He spoke of the beneficial impact of that decision and of its assistance to our exports.  Does the Minister recall that in the House he indicated that the prospective inflation rate for 1983 as a whole should be no higher following the re-alignment than appeared likely at the beginning of the year?  Will he not acknowledge that the Central Bank in their latest report clearly indicate, as we said then, that this will have a very significant effect on inflation? Does the Minister not agree, accordingly, that it has been damaging from the inflation viewpoint and that the export boost he has spoken about is unfortunately limited to technology industries that were established under Fianna Fáil Government and not to native industries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not objecting to the kind of calculations implicit in the Deputy's question because they are long or tedious: I am simply saying that they are downright irrelevant.  As far as the second part of his question is concerned in relation to the rate of inflation, I said in March, and I have no reason to change my view, that the effect of the re-alignment of itself would not add anything to the prospective rate of inflation over the year.  Broadly speaking, it represents a balancing of the carry over effects of our relatively high value currency before the re-alignment against the effects of a rather low value currency since the re-alignment and the working out of these two effects in the time lag that applies.  I have no reason to change my view on that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather interesting to hear the Deputy trying to dismiss the very substantial growth in our industrial exports this year in the way he did.  If the Deputy would read not only the Central Bank Report but the latest ERSI Report and all the other information available about our industrial exports he would note that not only are we making substantial <Col N="2760" /> progress in regard to export volume but that the recovery of the growth in the level of exports would appear to be expanding outside the confined range of new technology industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The authority for the effects of this on indigenous industries is not mine but that of the Confederation of Irish Industry with whom we on this side had discussions recently &mdash; I presume the Minister had as well.  I would rely on their view as being representative. Is the Minister dismissing their view? They have said they are of the opinion that it is the technological industries established in the manner I have said which are the main element in the export growth rather than native Irish industries who, because of our non-competitive rate of inflation, are not even reaching the markets these days?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the principle, whereby the secretary of each Department is also the accounting officer for that Department, was inherited from British practice in 1922; if not, the date it was introduced; and if he considers that the principle is still appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.  The underlying reason for the practice is that only the highest ranking officer of a Department or Office is in a position to discharge the financial and administrative responsibilities of accounting officer.  I consider that that reason remains valid and that the practice is still correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be willing to look at this practice from the perspective of 1983 rather than 1922, when the Departments here were little more than Departments of technical instruction? Apart from all other considerations, would he consider whether it is appropriate that a very busy senior official, who has to take responsibility for the working of a very large Department dispensing millions of pounds in a wide variety of functions, should in addition be expected to ensure that no money is wasted and that every £100 is spent in the most cost-effective way?  Surely it is time to look at this system to see whether a different form of accounting control could be introduced.  In saying this I have no reflection whatever to make on the dedication and competence of any departmental secretary, but it is expecting too much of him to do this on top of all his other work.  It is no wonder that the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General should disclose so much ground for suspicion that the control of the expenditure of public money is too slack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly willing to look at the matter from a more recent perspective than that of 1922.  The appointing of accounting officers to these functions dates back to an Act of 1866. The matter was looked at as recently as 1976 and in that year, in commenting on the duties and responsibilities of accounting officers, the Public Accounts Committee expressed their concern to maintain structures built up over the previous 110 years and stated: &ldquo;There must be one person with whom we can deal&rdquo;.  I would take that as a fairly firm statement by the Public Accounts Committee that they <Col N="2764" /> would not like to see accounting officers nominating other people to answer on their behalf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the question of whom the Public Accounts Committee would find it most convenient to deal with, would the Minister consider the matter more from the point of view of the best method of ensuring that public money is not carelessly spent?  Would he consider, even as an experiment in only one Department, a system whereby expenditure would be controlled day by day by somebody doing absolutely nothing else, recruited by competition for two or three years for that purpose from the private sector, somebody whose job depends on making sure that the firm for which he is working wastes no money?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to go so far as to say that I would take the road the Deputy is suggesting.  I am very concerned to ensure that there is a far stricter and more reliable procedure for ensuring that the expenditure of public money takes place on the basis of the objectives set out and with the utmost economy and efficiency possible.  To that end there is an ongoing review and attempt in my Department to improve both the procedures in that Department and those which apply in other Departments.</P>

      <P>I understand that the commission will report shortly on indirect taxation and on tax incentives.  When I have considered their recommendations on these subjects, I expect to be in a better position to evaluate the findings of the commission and to advise the Government about them.

Meanwhile, I would like to remind the Deputy that a number of specific recommendations put forward by the commission are being implemented.</P>

How does the Minister reconcile the figures he is now giving us with the estimate provision he had in his budget for £10 million for this tax?

We will end up this year getting very close to the kind of targets we set out and that is a far better performance than the Deputy or his party ever managed to achieve.  As far as the tax itself is concerned, obviously the introduction of a new tax is very difficult and any forecast as to the revenue it will produce must, of necessity, be conjectural to some extent.  That is the case in relation to this tax which has one distinction in that it is the only tax in our code which is based on self-assessment.  Therefore, I am not surprised that the results of the first year of its application should turn out to be somewhat different than expected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>We joined the EEC on the basis not only of certain circumstances prevailing at the time but of certain expectations.  We all knew then that some of our industries would suffer as a result of the cold winds of competition from Europe but that as a compensatory factor we could expect a great degree of expansion of the agricultural sector by way of the support we would receive for that sector.  That was one of the main reasons <Col N="2796" /> for the Irish people voting overwhelmingly for accession to the Community.</P>
      <P>Ten years later it would be very wrong if the very benefits on which our accession was based were to be removed.  We cannot accept the imposition of this super-levy. If it were to be imposed on us we would be in the ridiculous situation not only of having suffered already the results of the competition in the industrial sector, but of suffering a very regressive penalty in the agricultural area, the result of which would be to seriously damage our agricultural economy.</P>
      <P>When we joined the EEC our industries were not sophisticated to the extent that those of our counterparts were sophisticated.  We did not have the experience of the industrial revolution that was experienced in places like Sheffield and the Ruhr.  We were dependent on agriculture and that is why we emphasised the benefits that membership would bestow on that sector.  In those circumstances I see no option now but for us to seek an exemption from the proposed super-levy at least until such time as the Irish dairy industry has achieved the same production levels as those enjoyed by our EEC partners.  The Germans and the British consider themselves to be subsidising agriculture to a very great extent but they now see as an easy remedy the curtailing of spending on agriculture. This would create a serious embargo in respect of our agricultural industry.  It may seem an easy resolution of their problems now but it could very well prove to be a very big problem for some other sectors in two to three years' time.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome this opportunity of expressing my abhorrence of <Col N="2797" /> and total opposition to the proposal to introduce a super-levy in respect of the dairy industry.  I deny categorically the allegations made before noon by my colleague from South Tipperary, Deputy Byrne, that the Government are not taking this matter seriously.  The Taoiseach has visited the Greek Premier and also the British Prime Minister.  He has met Mr. Thorn and also the acting Belgian Prime Minister and he will be meeting with the German Chancellor on his visit to Ireland.  In his meetings with these people the Taoiseach impressed on them the seriousness of the super-levy.</P>
      <P>This proposal would have a devastating effect on our economy which is almost totally dependent on agriculture.  Our dairying industry accounts for one in ten of those employed.  It accounts for approximately 10 per cent of our total exports and for about 9 per cent of our GNP.  The average yield per cow in Ireland is approximately 80 per cent of the EEC average.  It is 750 gallons compared with the Northern European figure of 1,100 gallons while the figure for the general area of the Community is 915 gallons.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise the impact that the imposition of the super-levy would have on the Golden Vale which is one of the most intensive dairying areas in the Community, excluding the factory-type farming that is common in some parts of Europe.  The super-levy would have a shattering effect in terms of the confidence our young farmers have in their future on the land.  On joining the EEC we brought about a situation in which at long last the stranglehold of the British market was being broken.  We were gaining access to the markets of the other EEC countries.  Unfortunately, we were understocked and under-capitalised but our progressive young farmers set about competing with their European rivals in the interest of availing of our new-found opportunities.  They built milking parlours, silage layouts, slurry tanks and so on.  They purchased machinery, fertilised their lands and generally increased and improved their holdings.  All of this work was done by way of mortgaging their farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2798" /> We have been hearing about the various proposals.  Some of these proposals we would support but we are opposed to others.  We must emphasise the social impact that the proposals would have on rural Ireland.  They would mean the disappearance of the family farm.  It is absolutely essential that we retain the family farm unit.  We must put a stop to any further exodus of the people from the countryside to the towns and cities.  We must not add to the unacceptable level of the 16 per cent unemployment rate.  The super-levy would result in the denuding of the countryside and in depriving young and progressive farmers of the means to continue on the land.  From that point of view I totally reject the super-levy.  I might compliment An Bord Bainne on their efforts to obtain alternative markets.</P>

      <P>In comparison with other member states they have carried out their work in a magnificent manner.  There is need for our dairying industry to face the changes in the dairy products centres. For example, in Denmark they produce 85,000 tonnes of special cheese for the Arabs and, in Scotland, 7,000 tonnes.  I would urge An Bord Bainne to take a further look at these centres so that we may produce products suitable to the new type of changing consumer states, especially in the newly-found markets of the Third World.</P>
      <P>I might re-emphasise my total opposition to the introduction of this super-levy.</P>

      <P>We in the Fianna Fáil Party welcome this debate on the EEC Commission's proposals to change the Common Agricultural Policy with particular <Col N="2799" /> reference to the super-levy and how this will affect our economy.</P>
      <P>Since returning here after the summer recess we fought on a daily basis to be given an opportunity to debate this issue. Following tremendous pressure by our party, later joined by all farming organisations, including the ICOS, Macra na Feirme, the ICMSA and the IFA, the Government eventually got the message and allowed the debate.  One must question seriously their reluctance to have this debate in the first instance.  Was it not the Taoiseach himself who said on 7 July 1983, on the occasion of the Adjournment Debate before the summer recess &mdash; speaking on the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; that this was of immense importance to all of us on this island whether we earned our living on a farm or in other walks of life?  The Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, at the National Co-operative Conference on Monday, 7 November 1983, said that even if there was no super-levy we should not delude ourselves that things will be easy.  I need not emphasise the importance of milk to our economy.  Mr. Brendan Halligan, Member of the European Parliament, at the same conference, on 8 November 1983 &mdash; when referring to the special problems in relation to the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; said he greatly feared, on the basis of personal experience, that these problems were not understood.  For that reason I am most pessimistic about the prospects of a special deal for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, speaking in the House on the Adjournment Debate on the Milk Super-Levy on 26 October 1983, at column 935 of the Official Report had this to say:</P>
      <P>This is a time when we must be completely responsible in Ireland, because we are facing up to a very important debate, probably the most important national issue facing us since our EEC accession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have leading members of the Coalition Parties declaring that the super-levy issue is vital to this country. Yet they were reluctant to have the issue <Col N="2800" /> debated here.  It is my opinion that their reluctance to have this debate was a grave error of judgment and every day that passed without that debate was a further demonstration of the Government's sheer hypocrisy and lack of appreciation of the extent of the problem.  Dáil Éireann is the highest forum in the land. We must ask ourselves: why were the Government anxious to keep the debate out of the House?  Was it a fear of exposing their inadequacies, of exposing differences between various Members of the Cabinet, was it a fear of exposing the different views expressed by individuals Cabinet colleagues and the Taoiseach, or was it merely an attitude &mdash; well, we hope the problem will go away?  Even at this stage &mdash; because of the muzzling of the debate &mdash; I am convinced our people are not yet fully aware of the implications of the change in the Common Agricultural Policy proposed.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the Common Agricultural Policy is now in severe difficulty. This is due to a combination of circumstances, mainly of continued increases in EEC farm production, in contrast with relatively static food consumption, with the long-term growth and volume of agricultural production rising from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent per annum.  Therefore, the Community has become more than self-sufficient for most of its major agricultural commodities, with consumption rising at 0.05 per cent.  Inevitably problems arise when the Commission feel that this can only become more acute in the future.  For instance, in the past year, 104 million tonnes of milk were produced, 88 million tonnes were consumed, leaving 16 million tonnes of a surplus. This year there is an over-supply on the American market, leaving little or no scope for exports from the EEC.  Thus the Commission decided that production will have to be controlled.  Of course, the other circumstances prevailing are, on the one hand, a steady and substantial erosion of the principle of Community preference which appears to have gone out the window and, on the other hand, the full utilisation of existing EEC financial resources with a possible delay until <Col N="2801" /> the year 1986 before new, own resources are implemented.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Commission had to take stock of that situation.  Part of their plan for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is the proposed introduction of a super-levy or tax on milk production. What that means is that milk producers will have to bear the full cost of disposing of milk surplus, this, mind you, in addition to a co-responsibility levy of 2 per cent on milk introduced in 1977.  The Commission decided that 1981 would be the base year and that any milk supplied in excess of that supplied in 1981 would be subjected to the super-levy.  The levy is so vicious that farmers certainly would not go beyond the 1981 levels.  In Ireland this would have disastrous consequences.</P>
    <P>With unemployment figures at their present level, with the amount of poverty that is around, we are all aware that we are in deep recession.  But that recession of today is as nothing in comparison with that felt if we allowed this proposed super-levy to be imposed.  Indeed it would recall the tortures and hardships of the bleakest days in our history, relatively speaking, those of the Famine years.  The real impact of its imposition has not been fully grasped by all our people.  The Government have failed to impress on them the devastation it would cause.  Their weak, unco-ordinated, haphazard approach gives the impression that this problem will never arise.</P>
    <P>I maintain that the battle is being lost, that farming will deteriorate and every provincial town will become a ghost town.  Our land is our greatest national asset, as we have heard so often yesterday and today.  It is under attack now as never before.  Yet the Clondalkin Paper Mills &mdash; a vital issue for West Dublin &mdash; and Údarás na Gaeltachta &mdash; a matter of the gravest concern for the Gaeltacht &mdash; pale into insignificance in comparison with the holocaust now confronting us.  But one can be sure that the Clondalkin Paper Mills and Údarás na Gaeltachta will steal all of the media attention.  I would contend that the media also have failed in their duty to the Irish people on this particular super-levy cause.</P>
    <P>In recent times farming organisations, <Col N="2802" /> particularly Macra na Feirme, have led the way with a new initiative in bringing home to our people the extent of the problem facing them.  The ICMSA, the IFA, the co-operative movement and the ICA play an important and effective role in this issue.  I ask them all to keep up the fight at home, especially through any contacts they may have in Europe.  I had hoped that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions would have come out more strongly and totally against these proposals. I know they are on our side, as is everybody in the House.  As they have said so, I would ask them again to consider the vast implications for their members and to act accordingly.</P>
    <P>It is well known that Ireland has one of the most under-developed dairy sectors in the Community and one of the most dependent on the milk sector.  Over half of Irish farm families are dependent on milk production.  The only hope for recovery in the economy today is from a fully developed agriculture, with dairying leading the way.  The beef industry is very dependent, 80 per cent dependent, on the dairy industry.  The super-levy, if it were to be introduced would put 14 to 15 per cent of Irish milk production out of existence, with serious consequences for unemployment.</P>
    <P>In County Wexford where milk production went up by 22 per cent since 1981, the reduction would be far greater and indeed all agri-related businesses are very worried about that possibility.  On a recent tour of County Wexford I discovered that the agri-business expressed deep disatisfaction at the possibility of the introduction of the milk levy.  Wexford cheese factory said that they would have to let off a large number of their work force; Albatros Fertilizer claim they would have to reduce staff; Clonroche Mills are completely dependent on the dairy farmers of Wexford, and the hinterland for sales.</P>
    <P>In 1960 there were 390,000 full-time farmers in Ireland, and in 1980, there were 220,000.  If the levy is imposed, I believe that this number will be halved within the next few years.  Where are all the jobs going to be found for all of these people, with unemployment levels at the <Col N="2803" /> 200,000 mark at present and with half the businesses in Ireland literally on the brink of bankruptcy?  To this we must add 100,000 farmers and their families.  Only by doing this can we begin to realise the extent of the problem now facing us.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has been the backbone of the Irish economy.  Farmers have always reacted to every challenge which ever faced them.  They have increased production against all the odds.  Whenever agriculture is doing well, so too is the rest of the economy.  The PAYE workers have on many occasion spoken out against the penal tax imposed upon them, and with the increase in unemployment, the number of PAYE people from whom tax can be collected is getting fewer, therefore the burden upon them will get greater.  I am saying that there will be a revolution amongst the PAYE taxpayers if the milk levy is imposed, because of the consequent unemployment amongst farmers and those working in related businesses.</P>
    <P>Ireland of course has a very special position in comparison to other member states.  For instance, agriculture accounts for 15 per cent of gross national product in Ireland which runs at about 2 per cent in the other European nations.  So it is vitally necessary that we totally reject any proposals for change in the Common Agricultural Policy, and particularly that we reject the proposal to introduce a milk super-levy.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at how the Irish Government have dealt with this problem to date.  Remembering that in 1980 Deputy MacSharry, the then Minister for Agriculture, stopped a similar proposal dead in its tracks with strong and firm negotiations.  The super-levy idea has been around for a while now and the Commission have been seeking an opportunity to introduce it for a few years.  Why I wonder did they pick 1983?  They were aware of course that the Coalition of Labour and Fine Gael had taken over Government in this country last November. They are also aware that the Government of the Coalition parties had dropped the farm modernisation scheme and had withdrawn £156 million pounds in the budget of 1983.  Could it be that <Col N="2804" /> they felt that there was not a commitment to Irish agriculture by the Government, and did they play on this weakness?  How did these proposals come to be on the table?  Is this not an indictment of our Government that these proposals were allowed develop?  The Taoiseach Deputy Garret FitzGerald, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry, attended the meeting in Stuttgart after which the Taoiseach told us that he was quite satisfied that he had protected Irish interests, even though at that stage these devastating proposals were about to be launched.  Is it possible that these proposals were formulated under the very nose of the Taoiseach and the Irish Government?</P>
    <P>In a flurry of excitement from Government Ministers following the announcement of the proposals, the Taoiseach promised us that he would engage in a tour of the European capitals in order to put Ireland's special case to all his counterparts. The veto would be used, and firmly to let it be seen that Ireland had a conviction about opposing this levy.  But as time wore on, no tour of the European capitals and in answer to a Dáil question by me the Taoiseach said that he would meet from time to time with the various Prime Ministers.  As I said then, and I still contend, this haphazard approach has led to the situation that we now find ourselves in, one of weakness on behalf of the Government, a weakness that the member states are playing upon.  I firmly believe, as do many organisations throughout this country, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, that a tour of the European capitals would serve a great purpose even at this stage.  Such a tour dealing specifically with the milk levy and the other changes in the Common Agricultural Policy, would attract an enormous amount of attention in Europe, and as such, would demonstrate Ireland's very special position.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us, Deputy O'Donnell, Member of the European Parliament, has told us, the Minister, Deputy Peter Barry, in his statement yesterday has told us, that other member states are well acquainted with the particular Irish problem.  Yet, Mr. Brendan <Col N="2805" /> Halligan, Labour Member of the European Parliament, said at the Irish Co-operative Conference on 8 November, 1983:</P>
    <P>too little, if anything, is known about it on the Continent.  The degree of ignorance about Ireland on the Continent is reciprocated by the extent of ignorance about the Continent in Ireland.  It is that ignorance about Ireland which poses the greatest threat to us within the Community as regards the super-levy.  Decisions are about to be made in Athens which will have devastating effects on our economy, but those who are about to inflict the damage will do so oblivious of what they are about to inflict upon us.  They are not adversely disposed towards Ireland, just ignorant of our real circumstances.</P>
    <P>Who, might I ask, is telling the truth, and again I will ask the Taoiseach to consider favourably doing a tour of the European capitals, even at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been asked in the Dáil on a number of occasions if he intends to use the veto as a last resort, but we have not yet got a definite answer from him.  I would like the Minister in his reply to comment on this point this evening.</P>
    <P>When we joined the EEC we knew we had the option open to us to use a veto in the event of our country not being satisfied with any particular proposals.  This was in order to give weaker countries a strong power. Why is the Taoiseach dithering on this issue now?  The Minister for Agriculture was interviewed before he left this country on one of his negotiating trips.  He admitted defeat before he went, and you can be certain that the news of that defeat had reached the ears of those with whom he was going to negotiate, before he reached the negotiating table. The defeatist attitude is one we cannot afforded and one on which we certainly will not win.</P>
    <P>Why are the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture not as one on the milk levy?  Unity is strength.  I appeal to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="2806" /> to put behind them whatever differences there are between them now and to get on with the job of maintaining total solidarity against any such proposal.  To date the Government's handling of the affair has been dismal; but the battle is not yet lost and, if I am critical of the activities of the members of the Government, the Fianna Fáil Party will support fully any move for the total rejection of the super-levy.  Our contribution to this debate is not to score political points but rather to be a support to the Government so that when they go abroad to do their negotiating they will be aware that they will have strong Opposition support and the member states will also be aware that Ireland is fully united in her opposition to any such proposal.</P>
    <P>Total rejection of such proposals must be supported by an alternative.  We in Fianna Fáil must agree that we cannot reject totally any proposals to clear up this financial mess of the CAP without putting forward some alternative.  The sum of £1,814 million must be saved within the EEC and this is the purpose of the proposal now before us.  If the super-levy were not imposed how would this £1,814 million be saved?  We say that it could be saved in two ways.  The first is complete blockage of New Zealand butter imports into the UK.  I was very pleased with the Minister's attitude to this issue and I encourage him to proceed along these lines.  Everybody in the House will be aware that Britain imports 80,000 tonnes of butter from New Zealand. Ireland is within the EEC and New Zealand is outside the EEC.  As the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, said yesterday in his opening statement in relation to the Treaty of Rome, the Treaty establishing the Community affirmed unambiguously that the essential objective of the member states must be the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of the people of Europe.  The text went on to underline the need to ensure the harmonious development of the economies of the member states by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2807" /> This is a fundamental Community philosophy.  Is Ireland less important than New Zealand?  How can New Zealand get this type of protection from the EEC?  Recently a New Zealand Government Minister expressed his confidence that the EEC could improve its butter quota for next year for his country.  Is it not ironic that New Zealand's transitional arrangements for butter to the EEC ran out in 1977?  Protocol 18 in the Treaty of Accession says on the import of butter and cheese that the UK are authorised as a transitional arrangement to import from New Zealand certain quantities of butter and cheese and that the transitional arrangement is to cease at the end of 1977.  Now not only have the transitional arrangements been continued but the number of tonnes of butter imported to Britain is far greater.  How can the EEC Ministers support New Zealand's case in the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the support in Europe?  What about Ireland's case? From the type of support they are receiving in Europe New Zealand can predict confidently that in five year's time they will be exporting not less than 80,000 tonnes of butter to the UK annually.  Can Irish farmers predict with such certainty for the future?  Again, New Zealand is not within the EEC; Ireland is.  Why is Ireland being penalised while New Zealand's interests are being protected?  Has the Taoiseach pointed out this viewpoint to the member states?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Ministers should remember that they have the right in the Council to a unanimous vote.  The EEC is a wonderful concept in theory but the manipulation of it by the bigger powers leaves one to ask if our continued membership of the EEC is desirable.  If the import of New Zealand butter were stopped the saving would be £76 million.  One might claim that that is not a great amount, but it would ease the burden &mdash; and, of course, the principle more than anything else matters.  In line with stopping New Zealand <Col N="2808" /> butter we must give strong consideration to the total banning of the import of cereal substitutes from outside the EEC.  This year 15 million tonnes of cereal substitutes have been imported into the EEC and this has jumped from 4.7 million tonnes in 1974.  It would take 75 per cent of all the land in Ireland to grow the amount of cereal substitutes being imported into the EEC.  Half of this 15 million tonnes is used in the production of milk.  Cereal substitutes are low in protein.  We must import five million tonnes of soya bean to supplement the mix or to create a proper balance.  Cereal substitutes add 20 million tonnes of milk to European production, and remember the surplus is 16 million tonnes.  The export cost of that 20 million tonnes of milk is £1,270 million and we will save £800 million if we do not have to subsidise our cereals that were displaced by the import of cereal substitutes.</P>
    <P>Cereal substitutes and New Zealand butter are real problems.  If both were eliminated there would be a surplus of finance within the CAP; but because of the strength of the Germans and British manipulation of the highest order, we, the underdeveloped Irish nation, are penalised.  We must adopt a strong line of action against the importation of cereal substitutes and New Zealand butter.  We must revert to the Treaty of Rome and to the principles on which the EEC was founded.  We must use every method at our disposal to achieve this aim.  We must not adopt a junior partner attitude. Above all, at the end of this debate this evening we must have a clear statement from the Minister for Agriculture to the effect that he and his Government totally reject any change in the CAP.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much obliged to the Minister.  The Treaty establishing the Community has a fundamental philosophy that the objective of every state must be the improvement of the <Col N="2809" /> living and working conditions of the people and it must decrease the differences that exist between the various regions in this regard.  These differences still exist today.  Article 5 of the Treaty points out that member states shall abstain from any measure which would jeopardise the objectives of the Treaty. We as a member country of the Community have a vital national interest to protect now and we will do just that.  If any limb of the Community is irreparably damaged, the body itself suffers the pain and the loss.  The super-levy issue is of vital national interest and would, if implemented here, have such disastrous consequences for the economic wellbeing of our country that nothing short of exemption for the first four years would be acceptable to us.</P>
      <P>The recognition of the vital national interest involved shown by the tremendous work of our Minister for Agriculture for months now on this issue is to be lauded by us all.  He has travelled all over Europe weekly and in him, together with the solidarity of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Finance and, indeed, our Taoiseach, we have a most talented and impressive team working on our behalf.  Make no mistake, we stand alone on this issue.  The other nine Members all accept the super-levy proposals. The British perhaps might opt for price cuts in preference, but that would be a disastrous option for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, and indeed when, we get an exemption, we will have other countries to contend with.  The French will want exemption for their poorer regions; the British for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; the Italians for Southern Italy. Their cases do not stand up to scrutiny. As to the French and Italians, the European average output is 915 gallons per cow per annum.  The Northern Ireland average is over 1,000 gallons per cow per annum.  Compare this with our very unfavourable average yield per annum of slightly in excess of 750 gallons per cow. Even COPA, the umbrella organisation of the farm organisations, did not support our case for an exemption and IFA delegates were very disappointed at their reaction.  Our ex-Minister for Agriculture <Col N="2810" /> and European MP, Mark Clinton, put down a motion recently on Ireland's special case which was defeated.  Only today, four MEPs are tabling amendments to try to get support for our case. Yes, we stand alone.</P>
    <P>We agree that there is a need for measures. The Commission must increase their own resources.  Over 50 per cent of financing comes from the 1 per cent proceeds of VAT from each country. Bluntly, the Community have run out of money.  There are proposals to increase the VAT contribution to 1.4 per cent from its present 1 per cent contribution level.  Britain and Germany have said that they will not pay that unless the agricultural spending is brought under control and surpluses got rid of.  It will cost the Community £3,000 million to rid themselves of dairy product surpluses this year.  Without the super-levy in Europe as a whole it would cost £4,000 million next year to be rid of the surpluses.  Without the super-levy in Europe which is being made a precondition of the increase in VAT contributions to 1.4 per cent by some members, export refunds on beef and cattle to the Middle East would be very badly hit &mdash; something which is of great interest to us here.</P>
    <P>One would imagine, listening to some of the intemperate outbursts during contributions of Members of the Opposition in this debate, that there was a difference of opinion in our position on this issue. Our grassland is our greatest indigenous resource for beef and dairy products.  We depend on our grass for the future of our economic growth.  In the Community production must be concentrated on areas of greatest natural advantage. Where in Europe is it more suitable for dairying than here in Ireland with our good soil, temperate climate and insular position, such an asset for disease control? Ireland contributes only 5 per cent of the total EEC milk production at the moment, compared with more than 23 per cent for the Germans and French and over 11 per cent for the Italians and the Netherlands.  However, our dependence on dairying here compared with other countries is very high.  Dairying and milk products comprise 32 per cent of our total <Col N="2811" /> agricultural output.  In Germany milk is only 24.5 per cent of the total agricultural output and in the Netherlands only 26.6 per cent.  Its importance to our economy, although our yields compare unfavourably with those of our European partners, being 20 per cent below the European average, cannot be overstated.  As 1 per cent of our GNP at 4.5 per cent it is away ahead of the other nine countries. Greece rates next to us, with its milk averaging 1.3 per cent of its gross national product.  Forty per cent of employment in this country depends directly or indirectly on the dairy and beef industries. My own county of Wexford is heavily dependent on the dairy industry at all levels, from the farmers and the farm families right down to the distribution to the creameries.  Milk, cheese, butter, baby foods, yogurt &mdash; all these are produced in Wexford.  I live directly opposite Wexford Creamery, one of our success stories.  Over 200 people work there on shift, in a town with 25 per cent unemployment.</P>

      <P>Think of the effect if there were to be any diminishing of the dairying industry in Wexford alone, and every Deputy could say that for his own county, I am sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no progress in Brussels recently, as expected.  However, the Greek Presidency have put forward a paper recognising that Ireland has a special case.  We cannot accept the terms of the Greek suggestion, but it is a major step in the right direction.  It recognises our vital national interest in this issue and underlines our stance for a complete derogation of the initial four-year period. Other EEC Agriculture Ministers do not like the Greek proposals, as they themselves are under pressure from their own farming organisations, which is very understandable.  It would be naive to think that agreement on our position would be forthcoming from them.  The Special Council of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and the Finance Ministers <Col N="2812" /> will have to come up with the answers.  It is likely that the Summit in Athens in December will decide the issue.  The Greeks would appear to be angling for a favourable conclusion of this issue during their term of Presidency.</P>
    <P>Finally, with milk output at 4.54 per cent of our gross national product, our yield 20 per cent lower than the EEC average and with the greatest natural advantages in Europe for dairy production, we will protect a vital national interest and there can be no question of accepting the super-levy proposals.</P>

I want to reiterate the point made by our Chief Whip, Minister of State, Deputy Barrett, that the duration of this debate was agreed between the two main parties. Some people have been complaining about the shortness of the debate.  There was total agreement, with no objection whatsoever.  I want to put that on the record.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I heard Deputy Byrne saying that since the Dáil reassembled a month ago there has been a day-by-day clamour for a debate on this subject.  The only clamour that I heard &mdash; or heard about, because I was away last week &mdash; was Deputy Sean Byrne of South Tipperary demanding such a debate.  I have been in this House most days since the resumption and have hardly heard a murmur.  I do not believe that I have heard a demand on one occasion.  I heard a few questions to the Taoiseach but other than that and the Adjournment Debate referred to, little or nothing.  I just want to clarify that position.</P>

      <P>That we are having this debate at all when we are currently engaged on perhaps the most difficult and far-reaching set of negotiations for this country since our accession to the Community is because the subjects of the negotiation touch on issues that are fundamental, both for the future of this country and the Community itself.</P>
      <P>The Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs have already referred to some of these issues, so I am confining my remarks primarily to the Commission's proposals as they affect the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is obvious, however, from the debate which we have had, that Deputies are generally familiar with the main provisions of the Commission's proposals to which I will be referring in more detail later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that there is an ignorance among the public, or a lack of knowledge about what is at stake.  People are very much aware, all sections of the community, of what is at stake.  It gives us great strength that that is so.  I would not agree with the suggestion that there is a lack of interest, or knowledge, or understanding.  I want to clarify the situation at the outset.  We are talking about two different sets of proposals.  Originally, on 28 July the Commission &mdash; that <Col N="2814" /> is the 14-man Commission in Brussels &mdash; put forward a series of proposals which would have had very disastrous effects on this country if fully implemented.</P>
    <P>We have had three special general meetings since those proposals were published, at the end of August, the middle of October and last week, the middle of November.  There was not a great deal of progress made in those discussions because countries, by and large, stated their positions, what they would accept and what they would not accept.  They were intransigent when it came to any movement in the direction of an agreed settlement.  We have been the most intransigent because the Greek Presidency, at the beginning of last week, put forward a fresh set of proposals.  They were not entirely different.  There were variations from the Commission's original proposals.  While we were not happy with the proposals put forward by the Presidency we got what is in my view a very significant foothold because we are the only country referred to specifically in the document.</P>
    <P>The reference to Ireland gives cause for considerable hope.  It says:</P>
    <P>Because of the special role of the dairy sector in its economy as a whole and developments which have taken place in recent years, Ireland will have a guaranteed threshold corresponding to its [1983] production.</P>
    <P>They have not accepted that the 1983 level is totally unacceptable but they recognise that we have a special difficulty. That in itself is significant.  We are the only country singled out.  The south of Italy and the mountainous regions of France were not singled out.  They all might have felt that they should have cause for inclusion but Ireland was the only country which got that special recognition.</P>
    <P>When at their meeting in Stuttgart on 18 June, the Heads of State and Government requested that an examination of the Common Agricultural Policy should be carried out, they made two very pertinent points.  Firstly, they stressed that the basic principle and aims of the CAP would be observed in keeping with the <Col N="2815" /> objectives set out in the Treaty and, secondly, that the adaptation of the policy should be done in such a way that it could fulfil these aims in a coherent manner. In response to that request the EEC Commission submitted a report on 28 July recommending a number of measures to rationalise the CAP.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the more specific aspects of the Commission's report I would like to make a few general comments. It is clear from the general thrust of the proposals, and indeed from the discussions thereon that have taken place in the Special Council of Ministers, that the main emphasis is to impose stricter controls on the CAP and especially its increasing cost.  I might state that the special Council which was set up as a result of that Stuttgart meeting of Heads of State consists of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and the Ministers for Finance from each of the ten member countries. The Ministers for Agriculture are not an integral part of that Council but they may be requested to attend while matters dealing with agriculture are being discussed. The overall decision at Stuttgart was to examine the future financing of the Community, which involves a much wider base than just the CAP.  I would like to make that point quite clear to Members of the House.</P>
    <P>The situation confronting the Community on the budget and its future financing is undoubtedly a very serious one, and it would be foolhardy for any of us to ignore that background in considering the future of the CAP.  This problem has been brought home to us strikingly in recent weeks.  Because of the precarious situation it is currently facing in financing agricultural expenditure the Commission has had to suspend advance payment of export refunds and make certain other financial changes.</P>
    <P>The outlook for financing agricultural expenditure in 1984 is even more serious. Clearly, therefore, the future financing of the Community is of vital importance in considering the future of the CAP.  As has already been pointed out by my colleagues, the general question of the future financing of the Community is one <Col N="2816" /> of the key issues in the current negotiations as well as such issues as new policies and the restructuring of the Community's social, regional and structural funds.  We are, of course, seeking to ensure that parallel progress is made in all those sectors simultaneously with any changes in the CAP.</P>
    <P>In its report the Commission recognises the importance of the CAP to the development of the Community and the special characteristics of agriculture which distinguish it from other economic sectors.  While acknowledging that adaptation of the policy cannot be made on exclusively budgetary criteria, the Commission stresses the need to adapt the policy to meet the conditions which now prevail and to ensure the most efficient use of the available financial resources. The problem of over-production of certain products is seen to be of critical concern given the limited market outlets and the burden which the disposal of surplus production places on the Community budget.</P>
    <P>While expenditure on agriculture remained stable in the period 1980-82 an abrupt change has occured in 1983 when expenditure is estimated to increase by over 30 per cent and its rate of growth will outstrip the rate of increase in the Community's own resources.  The Commission draws attention to the record growth in stocks of some products particularly dairy products, cereals and beef and emphasises that the present critical situation cannot be remedied by short-term action.  It maintains that only action to adapt the CAP in a rational long-term framework can place the policy on a sound economic and financial basis for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I think that none of us would quarrel greatly with the Commission's general diagnosis of the problems that confront the CAP.  It has to be acknowledged that some adaptations of the policy are inevitable and that some sacrifices will have to be made to ensure its survival.  Our main concern must be to ensure that the basic elements of the policy are preserved and that its principles and objectives are maintained.  However, we must oppose those proposals which would seriously <Col N="2817" /> damage Irish agriculture and the Irish economy and support those proposals such as greater price uniformity and Community preference, which would benefit us and ease the burden on the Community budget.  In short, our strategy must be to ensure that the Common Agricultural Policy continues to operate in a way which will provide the support and arrangements necessary to enable Irish agriculture to develop its potential in the years ahead and that the necessary funds to support the policy will be provided. In that connection it is clear that, even in the milk sector, the current market and budgetary problems must be solved if Ireland's long-term interests as well as those of the Community are to be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>It is certainly not in Ireland's interest that the future operation of the CAP should be jeopardised by the financial chaos that could develop if we fail now to take the necessary remedial measures to deal with the serious problems confronting it.  Failure to ensure that the Community is provided with the necessary resources to finance its policies could, for example, result in the Commission being unable to continue export refunds and market support measures at a level that would maintain farm prices at reasonable levels.  The consequences for us of such a development would be very grave indeed.  For example, total FEOGA guarantee transfers to Ireland last year amounted to £345 million and out of that huge sum nearly £260 million was in respect of export refunds and intervention support.  The House can see how serious it would be for Ireland if there were a financial crisis within the EEC.  As a country heavily dependent on agriculture for our economic survival, we could not contemplate such a situation and so we must approach these vital negotiations in a realistic and determined manner.  We are prepared to play our part in resolving the Community's problems but any solution must be fair and equitable both as between member states and producers in different regions.  This is where we take issue with some of the Commission's proposals and especially the proposed super-levy on milk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2818" /> Of course this is not the first time that a super-levy has been proposed for milk. It was put forward in 1980 &mdash; it was stated that Deputy MacSharry saved the day then &mdash; but it must be realised that the Community's circumstances at that time were very different from what they are today.  In particular the Community was not then faced with the financial crisis to which I have referred.  Also milk production has been increasing rapidly throughout the Community and this has resulted in a massive build-up of stocks of butter and skim milk powder.  At the same time there has been a marked deterioration in the world market for these products. Indeed, one could say that there is no commercial market available anywhere in the world for most of the 650,000 tonnes of butter at present in intervention stocks.  Commissioner Dalsager on Tuesday said even if we wanted to we could not give it away, we had such difficulty in disposing of it.  The Community is thus faced with major problems in the disposal of its dairy stocks and this against the background of an acute shortage of financial resources.  This is the framework within which the current negotiations are taking place.  As I have said, we must be realistic enough to recognise these factors. But we are also fully determined to defend our own vital national interests in arriving at a satisfactory Community solution.</P>
    <P>In 1980 when there was a threat of a milk super-levy the funds of the Community were in good shape.  There was no question of a financial crisis or the funds being exhausted.  It did not have the same degree of seriousness as it does today.  It might not have been such a bad idea if a super-levy of some description had been brought in in Europe and Britain because we might not be faced with the dreadful dilemma we have in front of us today.  Corrective action should have been taken years ago.  Speakers have referred to the import of cereal substitutes which were primarily responsible for the production of surpluses.  They have given rise to factory-type farming in the dairy sector and been the cause of the huge quantities of milk produced in Holland, North Germany and Britain.  The <Col N="2819" /> quantity of these substitutes has increased from six million tonnes in the mid-seventies to 16 million tonnes in the current year.  That is the main cause of the problem we have in relation to milk.  Corrective action should have been taken and it would not have been any harm had something been done in 1980.</P>
    <P>We have the additional problem now in that the United States are also producing huge surpluses of milk, a factor which did not arise four or five years ago.  They are competing with us in the same Third Country markets and undercutting is taking place.  Bord Bainne will tell any Member of the markets they had in Mexico, Venezuela, the Caribbean and Algeria last year and the year before.  Those markets are gone because the Americans took them by selling their produce at a cheaper price.  The competition from the United States and the increased competition from New Zealand, has considerably worsened the problem of the milk surplus in Europe.  Those factors must be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals fall under four broad headings: (1) Market management including measures to curb excess production and reduce the cost of surplus disposal; (2) Price policy and restoration of the unity of the market; (3) External trade policy, and (4) Financial guidelines governing agricultural expenditure.  In regard to market management and measures to curb surplus production, the principle of guarantee thresholds constitutes the centre piece of the proposals with methods of application varying for the different products.  This principle is based on the hypothesis that it is no longer reasonable or indeed financially feasible to provide unlimited support guarantees for products in serious surplus.  So there is a consequent pressure for greater participation by producers in the cost of disposing of surplus production.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, this system of guarantee thresholds has in fact already been introduced in the CAP over the past few years for a number of products, notably in the milk and cereals sectors.  However, the current proposals of the Commission envisage a fundamental change in the <Col N="2820" /> operation of the guarantee threshold system for milk by providing for the imposition of a super-levy on production exceeding the 1981 level plus 1 per cent at a rate of 75 per cent of the target price for milk.  While we accept that corrective action is needed to curb the growth in the Community's milk production and limit the cost of disposal of the surplus, the action to be taken must be fair and just and must take account of the level of development of the dairying industry in the different regions of the Community. The proposed super-levy does neither.  It discriminates against low-yield producers as well as against some member states, especially Ireland, and favours high-yield producers that are contributing most of the surpluses.  In Ireland's case it would freeze production, impede or stop development in dairying and have extremely serious effects on Irish farming and the general economy.  If applied to our milk deliveries in excess of 1981 production plus 1 per cent as proposed by the Commission the immediate cost would be of the order of £100 million a year.  This does not take account of the long-term effects of blocking further developments of our dairy sector and preventing it from realising its potential.  It would prevent us from increasing yields even up to the Community average and much less to that of other traditional milk producing countries in the Community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle in the course of her contribution gave some interesting statistics. She told the House that our average milk production is about 750 gallons per cow per annum.  The north European average &mdash; I am referring to countries that have a comparable climate to ours, Denmark, Germany, Holland and Britain &mdash; is well in excess of 1,000 gallons per cow per annum.  In fact, the Dutch average is as high as 1,300 gallons.  If we take the entire Community, including Greece, Italy and France, the average is 915 gallons per cow per annum which is considerably in excess of our 750 gallon average.</P>
    <P>The wider implications for the processing sector and the economy in general in terms of employment and trade have also to be considered bearing in mind that the dairy industry represents some 9 per cent <Col N="2821" /> of our GNP.  It is important for all interests in this country to realise the seriousness for us of the Commission's proposal and not simply assume that it is merely a problem for the milk farmer or creamery. It is far bigger and would have grave consequences for the future of our economy.  For all these reasons a super-levy is unacceptable to us and we have been vigorously opposing it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne, in his contribution, suggested that I had adopted a defeatist attitude.  That is not the case.  I like to think that I am a realist and when it comes to negotiations the tougher the going gets the better I like it.</P>

      <P>In our view, alternative measures for dealing with the Community's milk problem can and should be devised so as to meet the budgetary difficulties and distribute the burden more fairly between member states.  We have made it clear to our Community partners that, if the super-levy proposal is proceeded with, then it must not be applied to Ireland in view of the importance of milk to our economy and to our future economic development.</P>
      <P>The Commission has also proposed that a special levy should be imposed on intensive milk producers, that is, those delivering more than about 1,300 gallons per acre.  While this is a step in the right direction and one we could support, it is inadequate because it would apply to only to about 5 per cent of Community milk and thus raise a relatively small amount of money.  To be effective, the levy of 4 per cent proposed should be significantly increased and the trigger threshold of 1,300 gallons per acre significantly reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kitt today referred to the levy on intensive production.  He said it had disappeared and has now come back into the picture again.  He wanted to know the reason for this.  It came back into the picture because last week I demanded <Col N="2822" /> that it be re-introduced.  However, I am most unhappy with the rate of 4 per cent which is proposed.  In our estimation that tax would realise only about £25 million in a full year.  We think the intensive producers of milk should be subjected to a considerably greater penalty and we are asking that that level of taxation be increased significantly.  However, I must point out there is immense opposition to the tax on intensive production.  The countries creating the problem obviously do not want it and they are opposing it vigorously.  However, we are backing the Commission and the Presidency on that proposal.  In fact, we are asking them to increase the intensity of the levy.</P>
    <P>In the milk sector the Commission has proposed to suspend intervention for skim milk powder during the winter months.  We have considerable doubts about the wisdom of this proposal.  It could result in increased sales to intervention in the summer months and weaken the market in the winter and thus could be counter-productive from a cost-effectiveness point of view.</P>
    <P>With a view to redressing the imbalance between butter-fat and vegetable oils and fats, the Commission has proposed the introduction of a non-discriminatory tax on consumption of oils and fats.  This is a measure we can support.  It is long overdue.  It will help to raise revenue for the Community and relieve the pressure on the milk and olive oil markets, while the level of tax proposed will not have any significant impact on consumers.</P>
    <P>The tax is being vigorously opposed by a number of countries, primarily the British, the Germans and the Dutch.  These countries, for domestic reasons, use a lot of these vegetable oils and they do not want to impose extra costs on the consumer. However, there is significant support for this proposed tax on vegetable oils and fats and I hope there will be agreement on the matter at the end of the day.  Even the low level of taxation proposed by the Commission would bring in 600 million ECUs or £400 million, which is not an inconsiderable amount and could help to defray the cost of the milk surplus to a considerable extent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2823" /> In the case of cereals, the Commission quite rightly recognises the need for a rapid and effective limitation on the increasing level of imports of cereal substitutes. More than 16 million tonnes of these substitutes are imported into the Community, most of them at low rates of duty or even duty-free.  Community imports represent more than 85 per cent of world trade in cereal substitutes and, clearly, action is necessary to curtail the extent of these imports.</P>
    <P>It is totally illogical to allow these products virtually free access to Community markets while, at the same time, displaced Community cereals have to be sold to third countries at great cost to Community funds.  In addition, they are a major contributory factor to the milk problem and particularly to the encouragement of factory-type dairy farming in certain member states.  For these reasons we support fully the Commission's proposals to invoke its rights under the GATT to curb the importation of these substitute products.  We feel it is necessary not merely to stabilise the volume of imports but to reduce them.</P>
    <P>Last Tuesday we had what could be called a row in Brussels on this matter. We are demanding that the imports of cereal substitutes not only be stabilised but be reduced.  That will not be easy because of the intensity and the ferocity of the opposition we are meeting on this issue.  However, this matter is fundamental because these substances are primarily causing the problem of the milk surplus. I do not think the countries advocating the continuance of these imports are being fair because they are responsible for the huge surplus of milk.  They are adopting a contradictory and hypocritical attitude and we have said so.  I hope there will be some action on the part of the Community at least in stabilising, and I hope reducing, the level of these imports. It should have been done years ago.</P>
    <P>In this matter we have had significant support from the French.  They have very good reasons to support us, although they may not be the same reasons that we have.  The French produce a vast quantity of cereals and they have considerable <Col N="2824" /> difficulty in getting rid of them because of the substitutes coming in from abroad at very low prices.  When they find themselves competing with the Americans on markets such as the Egyptian market for cereals and flour they are in considerable difficulties.  They support us very much on this question but for different reasons.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Community it is extremely important that the imports be stopped or at least curtailed. Last year while the Community spent approximately 4,000 million ECUs in getting rid of milk products, it spent 2,000 million ECUs in getting rid of cereals. The cost of getting rid of the cereal surplus is 50 per cent of the cost of getting rid of the surplus of milk.  This matter is not being faced up to in the Community. All we hear about is milk but the cereals have to be disposed of abroad at giveaway prices purely because the Community is allowing the import of these substitutes. This problem should be attended to by the Community and I hope we will embarrass them into taking some action. However, we face a problem in that the British and the Dutch in particular want to maintain these imports and, if possible, increase them.  These countries are anxious to retain reciprocal trading arrangements with the USA and they also want to keep good relations with the USA for political reasons.  I have often said we should first put our own House in order before we worry about our reciprocal trading arrangements with the United States.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that there is no disagreement on that.  The Commission has also proposed that in fixing cereal prices in future the Community should speed up the narrowing of the gap between its prices and those of its main competitors.  While we see the reasoning behind the Commission's <Col N="2825" /> approach, our view is that in fixing farm prices the Community must retain its autonomy and freedom of action and take into account <i>inter alia</i> trends of farm income and production costs in the Community.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is not a practical proposition to tell Community farmers and particularly Irish farmers, that their cereal prices will be the same as the United States when one considers the rolling plains of the mid-west where a farmer may have 10,000 or 20,000 acres of cereal while a farmer in Ireland may have seven or eight acres.  It is not realistic to say we should have the same price structure as the United States because the factors involved are totally unequal.</P>
      <P>On beef, the Commission intends to restrict intervention to shorter and more specific periods each year for certain cuts. We consider that this proposal is too rigid and does not take adequate account of the needs of the market.  Neither will it do anything to correct the current imbalance in the market which derives largely from a decline in beef consumption.  For those reasons we feel that the present system whereby intervention is operated by the Commission in a flexible manner to cater for the needs of the market should be retained.  In the beef sector also the Commission is proposing to terminate the calf premium and the UK variable premium.  As regards the calf premium &mdash; which applies to Italy and Greece as well as Ireland &mdash; we have pointed out that it was extended to Ireland two years ago as a farm income measure and we are seeking its retention for us as the circumstances that gave rise to its introduction continue to apply.  It was not given to us an aid to increase production but because of the recognition by the Community that farm incomes here were well below the Community average.  It was given purely as an income supplement and we want it retained for that very purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UK variable premium has created distortion in our trade, especially in recent years, and we have been pressing for corrective measures to remove those anomalies from its operation.  If the premium is continued in the future those <Col N="2826" /> anomalies will have to be removed.  The main anomaly is generally referred to as the clawback.  We are demanding a clawback on the export of meat from Britain because it gives them a great trading advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> Irish meat factories.</P>

      <P>On general price policy, the Commission stresses the need to pursue in the future a restrictive line taking account not only of the farm income situation but also of the market and budget situation.  Indeed, it mentions that for certain productions, for example, milk and cereals it may propose fixing prices for two years in advance.  It will also aim, especially for cereals, to narrow the gap between the Community price level and the producer prices of its main competitors. Where the market situation is particularly serious, the possibility of freezing or even reducing prices is not excluded.  The Community have, of course, been pursuing a prudent price policy for some years past and, while acknowledging the need for prudence, it is my view that the income position of farmers and the escalating costs of production cannot be ignored when we come to consider prices in the years ahead. Neither can we ignore the income situation of small farmers in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years now the price unity of the Community has been seriously upset by the operation of the MCA system.  I welcome and fully endorse the Commission's proposals for the phased dismantlement of the MCAs.  Indeed, I would wish to see a quicker dismantlement than that proposed by the Commission but at least if we can get effective measures taken to that end, it will be a big step <Col N="2827" /> forward.  We are, therefore, pressing for this in the negotiations, although there is very vigorous opposition from the Germans who have a 10 per cent positive MCA.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Community's external trade policy we have made it clear that if the Community is to demand greater disciplines of its own producers, that burden must be shared by third countries supplying the Community with products that are already in surplus in the Community.  We have referred in particular to products such as New Zealand butter, concessionary imports of beef and cereal substitutes.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have referred to the problem of imports of New Zealand butter. We have adopted a very stiff attitude in Brussels in that regard.  Three weeks ago the New Zealand Minister for Foreign Affairs and External Trade lobbied every member state of the Community and Dublin was his final stop.  I told him it was a pity that Dublin was not his first stop because he could have done a canvass for us among the other member states since what is good for Ireland is good for New Zealand.  If we get a favourable settlement to the super-levy issue New Zealand might fare a little better at the end of the day.  If we do not get a good settlement, I do not fancy their chances.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Commission suggested in its report that certain financial guidelines on Community agricultural expenditure should be adopted.  This would be tantamount to imposing an arbitary ceiling on CAP expenditure.  It makes little sense given the nature of agriculture where conditions can vary considerably both in the short and medium term.  Some member states want these guidelines to be even more rigid than those proposed by the Commission as well as making them legally binding.  They would set a fixed financial target and if production was so large the targets were exceeded, all ten countries would have to pay for the extra production themselves.  That would be a serious matter for this country and we have strenuously opposed these proposals. While Britain has put in even tougher <Col N="2828" /> proposals, the Commission's proposals may well be acceptable at the end of the day since they are not quite so savage.</P>
    <P>Despite the fairly protracted discussions that have taken place in the special Council meetings over the past few months, the positions of delegations on some of the major issues are still far apart.  In particular, there is a considerable divergence of views on such questions as the dismantlement of the MCAs, the proposed tax on oils and fats, the importation of cereal substitutes and financial guidelines.  While the vast majority of the other delegations seem prepared to go along with the idea of the super-levy on milk, at least one delegation still favours the idea of curbing production through a reduction of the support prices.  There is also considerable opposition by a number of member states to the proposal for a special levy on intensive milk production.</P>
    <P>We have presented a special paper to the Council and all member states setting out our position.  I am satisfied that our representations have created the necessary awareness of the special nature of our position throughout the community, despite what some Labour Member of the European Parliament may have stated.  They all know what we are looking for.  It is ringing in their ears.  There is no lack of knowledge and neither is there a lack of lobbying.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that our representations have created the necessary awareness of the special nature of our position.  This has been acknowledged and is reflected in recent compromise suggestions by the Greek Presidency. These latter suggestions do not go at all far enough to meet our case, but they are a welcome recognition of Ireland's problem and an indication of movement in the right direction.  We will, of course, be continuing our efforts to secure a satisfactory outcome on this major issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2829" /> I am aware that our farmers' representatives have been active in bringing the special nature of Ireland's case to the attention of their colleagues in the Community farmers' organisation &mdash; COPA &mdash; and this has been most useful.</P>
    <P>The Irish Members of the European Parliament have also been most active and their efforts are greatly appreciated. None of us should falter in our resolve to get the right outcome for this country.</P>
    <P>I have not dealt with some of the more detailed proposals made by the Commission &mdash; indeed some of them may well fail to be dealt with in the context of the fixing of agricultural prices for 1984-85 &mdash; but does not in any way detract from the importance of some of them for us. I should also mention that work is currently going on in the normal Council framework on the revision of the Community's sheepmeat regime and agricultural structures directives.</P>
    <P>I have outlined our attitude on the main issues affecting us.  Our approach will continue to be directed along those lines with a view to getting the best possible outcome for Irish agriculture and I look forward to the assistance of Members of the House in that regard.</P>
    <P>I now refer to some of the points made. I reject Deputy Gerry Collins' scathing remarks about the effectiveness of our lobbying in Europe.  I have met each of the nine Ministers for Agriculture on numerous occasions and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance have also met their counterparts. As the Taoiseach told the House on 26 October, he has had discussions with the acting Belgian Prime Minister and other Belgian Ministers, with the President and Vice-President of the European Commission, the French Minister for Agriculture, the President of the European Parliament, the Greek Prime Minister and the Greek Minister chairing the Special Council.  He will also meet the German Chancellor, Herr Kohl, in the near future.  He will shortly meet the Dutch Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Luxembourg.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire na Gaeltachta (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is é an chéad rud is mian liom a rá faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta ná go bhfuil dul chun cinn maith déanta aige ó bunaíodh é i dtús na bliana 1980 agus go bhfuil suas le £60m <Col N="2831" /> d'airgead poiblí faighte aige ó shin.  Ina theannta sin tá súil agam nach mbeidh an Ghaeltacht féin ná an tÚdarás thíos leis an drochphoiblíocht atá ar siúl le tamall. Ach tá fadhbanna áirithe ag an Údarás agus aithnímse go bhfuil dualgas orm mar Aire féachaint chuige go réiteofar iad.  I dtús báire ba mhaith liom léargas a thabhairt don Teach ar chuid de na fadhbanna sin.</P>
      <P>I ndeireadh na bliana 1981 bhí géarchéim airgeadais ag cuideachta a chuaigh i mbun gnó ar an gCeathrú Rua le cúnamh an Údaráis &mdash; CPR Teo &mdash; agus bhí an tÚdarás ag iarraidh teacht i gcabhair uirthi ar bhealach éigin.  Níl aon chumhacht ag an Údarás iasacht a thabhairt, áfach, ach deirtear go raibh daoine príobháideacha sásta £170,000 a chur ar fáil ar mhaithe leis an gcuideachta cé nach raibh siad toilteanach an t-airgead a chur díreach isteach i CPR Teo.  Ina ionad sin deirtear gur osclaíodh cuntas i dTuaisceart na hÉireann do Chairpéid G T Teo, fochuideachta de chuid an Údaráis a bhí éirithe as trádáil, go raibh an cuntas sin faoina smacht ag Príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis amháin, gur íoc na daoine príobháideacha an t-airgead isteach sa chuntas sin agus gur fhan sé ansin ó mhí Eanáir go mí an Mheithimh 1982.  Ag an bpointe seo caithfidh mé a rá nach bhfuair mé ón Údarás cóip iomlán den chuntas sin ná ainmneacha na ndaoine a chuir an t-airgead ar fáil cé gur iarr mé eolas mar sin go foirmiúil faoi alt 20 den Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, breis agus trí mhí ó shin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mí Eanáir 1982 tugadh iasacht £170,000 do CPR Teo as gnáthchuntas Chairpéid G T Teo i gContae Dhún na nGall.  Socrú práinneach a bhí i gceist agus luaigh Príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis é le Cathaoirleach an Údaráis roimh ré ach, cé go raibh seisean ag glacadh leis go gcuirfí doiciméad ina thaobh timpeall gan mhoill, níor tugadh aon eolas do chomhaltaí eile an Údaráis go dtí mí Iúil 1983.  Ní miste a lua freisin gur thosaigh mo Roinnse i mí Lúnasa 1982 ag lorg eolais ón Údarás faoin iasacht ach nach bhfuarthas é.  Tamall ina dhiaidh cuireadh in iúl don Ard-Reachtaire Cuntas <Col N="2832" /> agus Ciste, atá ina iniúchóir don Údarás, nach raibh míniú faighte.</P>
    <P>Ba chuid de ghrúpa cuideachtaí CPR Teo agus, fad a bhí an iasacht i bhfeidhm, is cosúil gur cheap an grúpa cuntasóir le smacht a choimeád ar na cuntais uile agus le féachaint chuige go mbeadh an iasacht le fáil ar ais ag Cairpéid G T Teo mura mbeadh ag éirí go maith le CPR Teo.  Dá réir sin aisíocadh an iasacht le Cairpéid G T Teo i mí an Mheithimh 1982.  Is cosúil gur aisíocadh a gcuid airgid leis na daoine príobháideacha as cuntas Chairpéid G T Teo sa Tuaisceart an uair sin freisin.</P>
    <P>I mí Lúnasa 1982 ceapadh leachtaitheoirí don ghrúpa cuideachtaí atá luaite agam agus bhí tagairt don iasacht i dtuairisc ar nuachtán.  I mí Lúnasa 1983 fuair mé litir ó chreidiúnaí de chuid an ghrúpa á rá gur tugadh tosaíocht nár chóir d'aisíoc na hiasachta agus go raibh a ghnólacht féin thíos léi.  Ar ndóigh, tá spéis ag na leachtaitheoirí freisin sa rud a tharla.</P>
    <P>I will now give the outline of a letter which I got from a creditor of the company. The chief executive expressed horror last week that I was in correspondence with a creditor of this company. However, I cannot stop people from writing letters to me and this letter contained material which I felt was of such importance that it required deep consideration and scrutiny.  This letter was sent to me on 18 August last and I quote:</P>

      <P>I must be humble enough to say that I was in error about this very matter recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will read from rulings given by my predecessor.  I did not know that this was coming up in the House but I simply looked up the rules in connection with something I said here in the past three or four days.  The ruling is that a Member is entitled to quote from letters in support of argument but that the names of the persons concerned should not be mentioned. A private letter of a person from outside the House should not be quoted from without the permission of the writer.  The ruling goes on that a Member purported to quote from a document which he alleged was prepared in the Minister's office, that the Minister stated the document was a private one and he would not circulate it to members of the public.  The Chair ruled that the document came within the scope of rule which provides that private documents may not be quoted without the permission of the persons who issued them.  My interpretation of those rulings is that the Minister <Col N="2834" /> is in order in giving the contents of this letter without giving the names of the persons who wrote it.  I must apologise to Deputy Tunney because in ignorance of these very rulings I gave a different ruling to him yesterday.  I am prepared to admit that.</P>

When no payment was forthcoming the company began making inquiries.  Eventually the bills were returned marked, &ldquo;return to acceptor.&rdquo;  It so happened that during the time this company were seeking payment for those goods, by way of bills of exchange as signed by directors of the company and by this other person, on 3 June £90,000 was paid out of the account on the instructions of the third person who signed the bill.  This sum was paid into his personal account.  On 15 June, £44,000 was paid out in a similar fashion and on 17 June, £59,000 was paid out in the same way.  That made a total of £193,000 paid out of the account of the Express group of companies who at the time had sufficient money to meet the demand of this person who has owed money but that person is still twiddling his thumbs and waiting for his money. This letter was received by me and acknowledged by me, but I am charged with having committed horrible crimes in corresponding with creditors of this company. At least that is what the chief executive has charged me with.</P>
      <P>Níl aon airgead caillte go dtí seo ag an Údarás ná ag Cairpéid G T Teo de dheasca na hiasachta.  Mar sin féin tá cúpla gné den scéal nach dtaitníonn liomsa:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;baineadh feidhm as fochuideachta de chuid an Údaráis le haghaidh iasachta nach bhféadfadh an tUdarás féin a thabhairt, agus <Col N="2837" />&mdash;d'fhéadfadh airgead poiblí a bheith curtha i mbaol.</P>
    <P>In relation to the danger to public funds, in this letter the author has charged Údarás with fraudulent activity in not paying him moneys which were owed to him, which were signed for by people designated for that purpose and signed for without any form of pressure from him.  Then, one of these people came along and withdrew money and lodged it to his own account.  If that person proceeds, as indeed he will through the liquidator &mdash; I understand that is going on at present &mdash; the State is at risk. That is my information, despite the assertions of the chief executive to the contrary and despite the agreement of some members of the board with those assertions.</P>

      <P>Breis agus trí mhí ó shin tugadh an-phoiblíocht do ghlaoch teileafóin a rinneadh ó óstán ar an gCeathrú Rua go Baile Atha Cliath agus a raibh eolas ag Príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis ina thaobh.  Shocraigh mé leis an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa go ndéanfadh oifigigh de chuid a Roinne fiosrúcháin faoinar tharla.  Thug said cuairt ar an <Col N="2838" /> bPríomhfheidhmeannach ach dhiúltaigh sé comhoibriú leo.  Ní amháin sin ach thug sé treoir i scríbhinn do bhainisteoir an óstáin gan aon eolas a thabhairt ach oiread.  Dúirt sé go dtabharfadh sé eolas d'fhiosrúchán foirmiúil ach, cé go raibh dlíodóirí i dteannta leis, is cosúil nach raibh sé sásta go raibh fiosrúchán foirmiúil ar siúl ag na hoifigifgh.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an bpoiblíocht a tugadh don ghlaoch sin ba mhaith liom a rá gur chuir mé in iúl do Chathaoirleach an Údaráis i litir an 18 Lúnasa nach nglacaimse leis ar chor ar bith go bhfuil eolas faoi chúrsaí an Udaráis á sceitheadh as m'oifig féin. Mheabhraigh mé dó chomh maith gur mithid don Údarás socruithe a chur i bhfeidhm i gcaoi go mbeidh éifeacht chuí le halt 15 den Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, a bhaineann le nochtadh eolais gan chead.</P>
      <P>Tá anseo agam tuarascáil a chuir Cathaoirleach an bhoird ar fáil dom i rith na seachtaine ar chruinniú a bhí ag an mbord an Satharn seo caite.  Tá sé scríofa as Béarla agus tá fáth leis sin agus glacaim an chúis atá leis, nár dhúirt an Cathaoirleach &mdash; in relation to the P &amp; T Inquiry he, the chief executive, stated that the P &amp; T inspector who interviewed him stated that they required information regarding a private inquiry being carried out by the P &amp; T and he felt he should be legally protected in his answers and he denied that he did not co-operate with the inquiry being carried out by the P &amp; T.</P>
      <P>Now, an tuarascáil oifigiúil a chuir an P &amp; T ar fáil, cuireadh ocht gceist ar an bpríomhfheidhmeannach agus níor fhreagair sé ceann amháin acu.  Dúirt sé i dtosach nach raibh sé sásta iad a fhreagairt gan a bheith i láthair dlíodoirí.  Nuair a bhí sé i láthair dlíodóirí dúirt sé an rud céanna nach raibh sé sásta iad a fhreagairt agus níor chualathas go fóill freagra amháin ar na ceisteanna a cuireadh trí fhiosrú oifigiúil ó oifigigh na Roinne Poist agus Telegrafa.</P>

      <P>Mhínigh mé don Teachta go raibh cúis mhaith leis seo a scríobh as Béarla.  Ní mise a scríobh é agus níor scríobhadh i mo Roinnse é ar chor ar bith.</P>
      <P>Go luath an mhí seo caite fuair mé litir an-aisteach ó Príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis á chur i mo leith go raibh lámh agam féin agus ag daoine eile in iarracht eagraithe chun bonn a bhaint ón Údarás agus ó phost an phríomhfheidhmeannaigh. Ba mhaith liom a rá láithreach nach bhfuil bunús ar bith leis an líomhain sin.</P>
      <P>Rinne sé tagairt freisin do na fiosrúcháin a bhí ar siúl ag an Garda i gcásanna áirithe agus dúirt go raibh a fhios agamsa go maith go raibh fáighte amach acu nach raibh aon bhunús leis na líomhaintí a rinneadh.  Níl aon eolas mar sin agamsa ná ná ní thuigim cén fáth a mbeadh a leithéid ag an bpríomhfheidhmeannach. Mar fhreagra ar cheist anseo sa Dáil ar an 27 Deireadh Fómhair dúirt an tAire Dlí agus Cirt go raibh cinneadh le tabhairt ag an Stiúrthóir Ionchúiseamh Poiblí i ngach uile chás a bhí i gceist seachas ceann amháin.  Bhí fiosrúchán cothrom neamhspleách á lorg ag an bpríomhfheidhmeannach agus dúirt sé ina litir go dtabharfadh sé faoi agóid ocrais mura gcuirfí ar siúl é.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2840" /> In ainneoin a bhfuil ráite ag an bpríomhfheidhmeannach agus ag comhaltaí aonair den Údarás ó thráth go chéile ba mhaith liom go mbeadh sé lánsoiléir nach bhfuil fiosrúchán poiblí ná fiosrúchán breithiúnach iarrtha ag Bord an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>Ó mo thaobh féin de táim ag brath ar na Teachtaí agus na Seanadóirí ar an gComhchoiste ar Chomhlachtaí Stát-Tionscanta Tráchtála chun breithniú ciallmhar a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí an Údaráis.  Glacaim leis, áfach, go dtógfaidh sé tamall orthu an obair a chur i gcrích agus, idir an dá linn, beidh ormsa aghaidh a thabharrt ar aon fhadhb phráinneach a bheidh le réiteach.</P>
    <P>Ar an 17 Deireadh Fómhair foilsíodh tuarascáil a d'ullmhaigh comhairleoirí bainistíochta Trident i dtaobh an Údaráis.  Ní raibh a fhios agamsa, ná ag mo Roinn ná ag comhaltaí an Údaráis go raibh sé sin le déanamh ná níor tugadh cóip den tuarascáil dúinn roimh ré &mdash; gan trácht ar dheis a thabhairt dúinn í a léamh agus a phlé sula bhfoilseofaí í.  Thug mé freagra mar seo a leanas ar cheist anseo sa Dáil ar an 8 Samhain.</P>
    <P>I ndeireadh mí Eanáir seo caite chonaic mé tuairisc i nuachtán maidir le dréacht den tuarascáil atá i gceist agus, nuair a bhuail mé le comhaltaí agus lucht bainistíochta Údarás na Gaeltachta cúpla seachtain ina dhiaidh sin, ghlac mé leis an deis lena rá go raibh ionadh orm nach rabhthas i gcomhairle le mo Roinn faoina raibh ar siúl.  Tuigfear mar sin gurb amhlaidh a theastaigh uaim go bhfaighfí cúnamh ó mo Roinn i ndáil leis an tuarascáil. Ar an 8 Márta tháinig comhairleoir go dtí an Roinn chun an cheist a phlé ach, cé go rabhthas ag súil go dtiocfadh sé ar ais nó go gcuirfeadh sé dréacht leasaithe ar fáil, níor tharla sé sin.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairimse go léiríonn a bhfuil ráite agam &mdash; gan trácht ar na ráitis uaidh a bhíonn le léamh agus le cloisteáil go rialta againn &mdash; nach bhfuil príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis ag feidhmiú mar ba chóir d'aon phríomhfheidhmeannach in aon chomhlacht Stáit.  Is ar chomhaltaí an Údaráis atá an dualgas an scéal sin a leigheas. <Col N="2841" /> Ar an 20 Deireadh Fómhair bhuail mé le comhaltaí uile an Údaráis seachas duine amháin nach bhféadfadh bheith i láthair.  Thug mé eolas nach raibh acu roimhe sin dóibh agus mhínigh mé pointí mar atá luaite agam go dtí seo.  D'iarr mé orthu breithniú cúramach a dhéanamh ar na fadhbanna práinneacha a bhí le réiteach agus a gcinneadh faoin ngníomh cuí a chur in iúl dom.  Nuair nár léir dom go raibh dul chun cinn á dhéanamh d'iarr mé ar an seisear comhalta arna gceapadh ag an Aire bualadh liom ar an 15 Samhain. I dtús báire luaigh mé prionsabail ghinearálta mar seo a leanas leo:</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh dlí de is corparáid aonair le síorchomharbas Aire Rialtais: is é sin le rá go mbíonn leanúnachas ann i gcónaí agus nach gcuireann cúrsaí polaitíochta isteach air nuair a cheaptar Aire nua.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhunaítear comhlacht Stáit chuirtear an fhreagracht ar Aire áirithe ina leith agus is faoi scáth an Aire sin a bhíonn sé ag feidhmiú.</P>
    <P>Bíonn dualgas ar an Aire é féin a shásamh go mbíonn feidhmeanna an chomhlachta á gcomhlíonadh mar is cóir.</P>
    <P>Mar chabhair don Aire chun an dualgas sin a chomhlíonadh bíonn cumhacht aige de ghnáth ionadaithe a cheapadh ar bhord an chomhlachta.</P>
    <P>Bíonn an tAire agus na comhaltaí a cheaptar ag brath ar a chéile chun leas an chomhlachta a chur chun cinn agus bíonn gá le comhoibriú eatarthu &mdash; go háirithe chun sciar réasúnta den airgead poiblí &mdash; a bhíonn chomh gann sin na laethanta seo &mdash; a fháil don chomhlacht.</P>
    <P>Is den riachtanas é go leanfaidh na socruithe sin ar aghaidh nuair a athraítear Aire nó comhaltaí.</P>
    <P>Bíonn foireann ag teastáil ón gcomhlacht agus ba dheacair feidhmiú dá n-éagmais: dá réir sin is ceann de na cúraimí is tábhachtaí dá mbíonn ar na comhaltaí ná féachaint chuige go mbíonn foireann &mdash; agus go háirithe <Col N="2842" /> príomhfheidhmeannach &mdash; éifeachtach acu.</P>
    <P>Dúirt mé leis na comhaltaí go raibh cúrsaí an Údaráis ag cur as dom agus gur léir nárbh é leas an Údaráis ná leas na Gaeltachta go leanfadh na cúrsaí sin ar aghaidh mar a bhí siad.  Rinne mé tagairt do phointí a bhí luaite agam ag cruinniú an 20 Deireadh Fómhair agus dúirt mé gur in olcas a bhí cúrsaí imithe ó shin &mdash; go háirithe ó thaobh poiblíochta.  Chuir mé in iúl dóibh nár léir dom go raibh aon dul as ach aghaidh a thabhairt ar an bpríomhfhadhb, fiú amháin má bhí gá le gníomh míthaitneamhach chun í a réiteach.  Mhínigh mé dóibh nach bhféadfainnse glacadh leis go raibh an príomhfheidhmeannach ag feidhmiú mar ba chóir, gur ar na comhaltaí a bhí an dualgas an gníomh ba ghá a dhéanamh agus, mar chabhair chun mo chuid dualgas féin a chomhlíonadh, go mbeinnse ag súil le tacaíocht go háirithe ó na comhaltaí a bhí ceaptha ag an Aire. Phléamar an scéal ar feadh tamaill mhaith agus d'iarr mé orthu a ndearcadh a chur in iúl dom roimh lón inné.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar a tharla, is oth liom go raibh triúr de na comhaltaí nach bhféadfainnse glacadh leis an dearcadh a bhí acu agus, sna cúinsí uile, ní raibh dul as agam ach iad a chur as oifig.  Ag an am céanna ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuilim buíoch díobh as ucht a saothair ar mhaithe leis an Údarás.</P>

      <P>Is trua liom go bhfuil gá le díospóireacht den chineál seo sa Teach, agus is trua liom na fáthanna a thug ar aghaidh an díospóireacht.  Inné, d'iarramar ar an Taoiseach agus ar an Aire deis cainte a bheith againn sula mbeadh an rud seo pléite sna nuachtáin, sa telefís agus ar an radio, ach ní raibh an Rialtas sásta an deis sin a thabhairt dúinn. Rud eile, a Cheann Comhairle, ní raibh tusa sásta cead a thabhairt domsa fiú amháin ceist a chur faoin rud seo sa Dáil. Dá mba rud é an cead sin a bheith againn, bheadh an cheist faoi na cúrsai seo ar fad pléite againn anseo sa Dáil sula raibh sé sna nuachtáin agus sula raibh an méid cainte faoi'n rud seo déanta taobh amuigh den Teach.</P>
      <P>Bunaíodh an tÚdarás le ceart a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta dearcadh i ndiaidh chursaí sa Ghaeltacht. Sin rud a bhí á iarraidh ag muintir na Gaeltachta le fada an lá.  Cé go raibh Comhrialtas anseo ar feadh ceithre mbliana, níor éirigh leo Bille an Údaráis a thabhairt isteach.  Gheall siad go minic é, agus tá mé cinnte, mar atá ráite anseo cheana agam, go raibh Aire na Gaeltachta a bhí ann an t-am sin i ndáiríre faoi Bhille an Údaráis a thabhairt isteach, ach ní bfhuair sé an tacaíocht nó ní bhfuair sé an cead sin rud a chruthaoínn nach raibh siad riamh i ndáiríre faoin Údarás.  Tá sé sin le feiceáil go soiléir san méid a tharla ó tháinig an tAire seo isteach agus ó thárla na cúrsaí atá dá bplé againn le cúpla bliain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí an-bhród ormsa nuair a thug Rialtas Fhianna Fáil cead dom an Bille a thabhairt os cómhair na Dála, agus bhí an-bhród agus ríméad mar dhuine ón Ghaeltacht go raibh mé ag tabhairt deis do mhuintir na Gaeltachta daoine a thoghadh a bheith ag freastal ar chúrsaí na Gaeltachta, dul chun chinn na Gaeltachta <Col N="2844" /> agus saol eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta. Nuair a thogh muintir na Gaeltachta na baill don bhord sin bhí daoine ag muintir na Gaeltachta a thuig cúrsaí na Gaeltachta a chur os cómhair an bhoird, rud nár tharla go dtí sin.  Chomh maith, ní dhearna Fianna Fáil dearmad, nuair a thoghamar na baill a bhí le hainmniú ag an Aire nó ag an Rialas, mar chuireamar mar bhaill don bhord daoine a thuig cúrsaí na Gaeltachta, daoine a raibh suim acu i gcúrsaí na Gaeltachta, daoine a raibh cleachtú acu ar céard a bhí ag tarlú sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh é sin ar mhaithe leis an nGhaeilge.  Thuig an Rialtas san am sin an tábhacht a bhí ag baint leis an Udarás agus an chaoi ar cheart dúinn lántacaíocht a thabhairt dó.  Toghadh na baill go daonlathach.  Ba mhaith liom dul siar ar an méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire nuair a tugadh an Bille isteach &mdash; bhí sé sa taobh seo ag an am.  Ag colún 49 den Tuairisc Oifigiúil, 2 Samhain 1978, deir sé:</P>
    <P>Anois maidir leis an daonlathas &mdash; tá fhios agam go ndéarfaidh an tAire go bhfuil iarracht á dhéanamh a bheith chomh daonlathach agus is féidir agus tá an t-iarracht sin déanta, ach ní dóigh liom go dtéann sé fada go leor.  Tá seisear á thoghadh ag an Aire ar an údarás agus fágfar seachtar le toghadh ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Ní dóigh liom go mbaineann daonlathas leis sin sa chiall ina dtuigimse daonlathas agus, tá mé cinnte, sa chiall ina dtuigeann an tAire daonlathas agus mar gheall air sin ní dóigh liom go mbeidh pobal na Gaeltachta sásta ar an bpointe sin.  Deirim nach leor é sin agus chomh fada agus is eol dom deir pobal na Gaeltachta an rud céanna faoi láthair.  Mar sin níl a nguth láidir go leor taobh istigh den Údarás.  Ar ndóigh braitheann sé ar cé hiad na comhaltaí a thoghas an tAire é féin.  B'fhéidir, má thoghann sé daoine ó na Gaeltachtaí go mbeidh sé ag déanamh rud éigin leis an fhadhb a cheartú.</P>
    <P>Thogh mise daoine ón nGaeltacht; thogh mé cathaoirleach, fear as Chontae Mhaigh Eo agus bhí mé bródúil go raibh mé in ann a leithéid de dhuine a thoghadh, <Col N="2845" /> cé nach ó mo dháil cheantar féin é, ach duine a raibh taithí agus cleachtadh aige ar obair na Gaeltachta i dTír Chonaill mar innealtóir, áit a raibh baint aige le forbairt na Gaeltachta agus plean forbartha Chomhairle Chontae Thír Chonaill, agus thogh mé chomh maith leis sin Máire Bean Mhic Niallghuis duine a raibh baint mhór aici le cúrsaí na Gaeltachta san Ghaeltacht is mó atá againn i nGaoth Dobhair &mdash; thog an Rialtas, ba cheart dom a rá, na daoine sin.  Rialtas Fhianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Agus fhad agus a bhain sé liomsa bhí daoine den chéad scoth dhá dtoghadh mar bhaill den Bhord.  Thogh muid Maitiú Ó Néill mar dhuine a raibh páirt aige leis an Lucht Oibre, duine a bhí ar Bhord Ghaeltarra roimhe sin agus a raibh eolas aige ar chúrsaí na Gaeltachta agus a raibh an-suim aige sa Ghaeilge agus dul chun cinn na teanga.  Ní fhéadfaí a rá go raibh polaitíocht ar bith ann nuair a toghadh na daoine sin.  Toghadh iad de bharr an eolais a bhí acu, de bharr an chleachta a bhí acu ar chúrsaí na Gaeltachta agus ar shaol na Gaeltachta agus rinne siad a gcuid oibre go dian-dícheallach, dúthrachtach i ngcaitheamh na tréimhse a chaith siad ar Bhord an Údaráis.  Ní thiocfaidh le duine ar bith a mhéar a dhíriú ar rud ar bith casta ná cam a rinne ceachtar de na daoine sin, mar bhí siad ansin ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta agus chreid siad go dian dúthrachtach ins an obair a bhí ar siúl acu ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Leanfaimid ar aghaidh go dtí na cúrsaí a tharla le cúpla lá, an rud atá faoi chaibidil b'fhéidir le dhá bhliain, tig linn a rá. Tá an tAire ag caint ar dhaonlathas agus luaigh sé daonlathas anseo nuair a bhí Bille an Údaráis ós comhair na Dála.  Tá sé le feiceáil againn le cúpla lá cén chiall atá ag an Aire nuair atá sé ag caint faoi dhaonlathas.  Tá sé ag caint faoi dheachtóireacht, deachtóireacht den scoth is measa a thiocfadh le duine ar bith caint a dhéanamh air.  Nuair nach bhfuil sé sásta le céard atá ar siúl ag na baill ar an Údarás, nuair nach bhfuil seisean sásta níl tada le déanamh ach an bhróg a thabhairt dóibh.  Bhí Rúnaí Roinn na Gaeltachta mar bhall den Údarás agus sílim gur ceart go mbeadh duine éigin ón Roinn ina bhall <Col N="2846" /> den Údarás mar nuair atá an socrú sin ann tá dlúth-cheangal idir an Aire agus an Údarás féin agus is aisteach an rud é go gcaithfidh an Rúnaí anois a bheith ina mhaidrín lathaí ag an Aire, go gcaithfidh sé dul agus rudaí a theastaíonns ón Aire a dhéanamh chuile uair a bheas cruinniú ann.</P>

      <P>Níor chaith mé drochmheas ar bith ar Rúnaí an Aire.  Tá ardmheas agam air, d'oibrigh mé leis agus tá a fhios agam go rímhaith gur fear macánta é agus cén obair atá déanta aige ó tháinig sé isteach mar Rúnaí ar Roinn na Gaeltachta; agus ní hé amháin go n-aithnímse é sin ach aithníonn muintir na Gaeltachta é chomh maith.  Tá ardmheas air i chuile áit ar fud na Gaeltachta agus níl mise ag caitheamh drochmheasa air.  Tá mé ag caint faoin mbrú atá á chur ag an Aire seo air lena chuid oibre a dhéanamh mar bhall den Údarás.  Sin an rud atá i gceist agam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tugadh isteach an Cathaoirleach nuair nach raibh an tAire sásta leis an chaoi ar chaith sé vota ag cruinniú den Údarás agus ní raibh an Cathaoirleach sásta géilleadh do na tuairimí a bhí ag an Aire ná ní raibh sé sásta a intinn a athrú faoi rud a rinne sé.  Bhí fearúlacht ann.  Shíl sé go raibh an rud ceart á dhéanamh aige agus sheas sé le cinneadh a bhí déanta aige ag cruinniú den bhord.  Ansin cuireadh sreangscéal ag an seisear a bhí ainmnithe ag an Aire agus tugadh os comhair <Col N="2847" /> an Aire iad agus bhí díospóireacht fada &mdash; de réir mar a thuigtear dúinn ó na páipéir &mdash; rud nach bhfuaireamar aon eolas air anseo inniu sa ráiteas a thug an tAire dúinn.  Bhí díospóireacht fada, deirtear linn, agus níor thángthas ar aon réiteach maidir leis an cheist agus de réir mar atá ráite ag an Aire féin &mdash; agus dúirt sé go poiblí aréir é &mdash; d'iarr sé orthu an raibh siad sásta glacadh leis an rud a bhí á iarraidh aigesan, go gcaithfidh siad deireadh a chur leis an bhfreastal a bhí nó an bhallraíocht a bhí acu ar Bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Labhair sé ar dhaonlathas anseo.  An bhfuil daonlathas ar bith ag baint leis an rud a rinne an tAire.  An dtig le duine ar bith anseo a rá go fírinneach ná a ghlacadh leis go bhfuil daonlathas ar bith ag baint leis an rud a rinne an tAire maidir leis na baill seo.  Ní raibh éagóir ar bith déanta acu.  Ní raibh tada mícheart déanta acu.  Shíl siad an chaoi ar chaith siad a vótaí san Údarás nach bhféadfadh siad iad a chaitheamh ar bhealach ar bith eile agus ní raibh siad sásta a n-intinn a athrú ar an rud sin.  Níor theastaigh sin ón Aire.  Ní raibh sé sásta, agus an daonlathas a bhfuil sé ag caint air anseo, an daonlathas a thuigeann seisean agus an daonlathas a thuigeann a pháirtí thall ansin agus an Rialtas, chuir sé an daonlathas sin i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor cainte i láthair faoi chearta mná.  Chuir sinne bean ar bhord an Údaráis, duine de na chéad mná a cuireadh ar bhord Stáit ar bith &mdash; sílim an chéad uair ar cuireadh bean ar Bhord Stáit ar bith.  Cé hiad na cearta a fuair sí ón Aire; bean mhacánta; bean a bhfuil an-obair déanta aice in a Gaeltacht féin; bean í a dtiocfadh le comhluadar ar bith a bheith bródúil aisti.  Tá sé le feiceáil in a clann féin, san mhuirín atá tógtha aici, agus is náireach an rud é go gcaithfidh sí inniu agus go gcaithfidh na baill eile a fuair an bhróg ón Aire seo, go daonlathach mar a deir sé féin, go gcaithfidh siad an scanall seo atá tugtha, an náire atá tarraingthe orthu a sheasamh ós comhair ní hé amháin a muintir féin, ní hé amháin os comhair muintir na Gaeltachta ach os comhair na tíre ar fad.  Agus nílimid ag cur suas leis anseo.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2848" /> Cén fhaid eile a chaithfidh an tUdarás agus muintir na Gaeltachta cur suas leis na ráflai seo?  Nach dtig leis an Aire deireadh a chur leis an rud seo?  An bhfuil an tAire Dlí agus Cirt mar bhall den Rialtas in ann cuidiú nó tacaíocht a thabhairt don Aire leis an eolas atá ina Roinn no ag an DPP a chur os comhair an phobail? Ar iarr sé air an t-eolas sin a chur os comhair an phobail ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta agus ar mhaithe leis an Údarás?</P>
    <P>Bhí clár teilifíse ann, agus caithfidh mé a rá anseo, agus tá sé ráite cheana agam inniu ar an raidio, go raibh sé náireach ó thaobh an Údaráis agus ó thaobh muintir na Gaeltachta.  Nuair a bheadh clár dá leithéid sin a chur amach ar an staisiún náisiúnta shílfeadh duine go mbeadh cothromaíocht éigin ann agus nuair a bheadh taobh amháin den scéal á gcur go gcuirfí an taobh eile.  Ach céard a tharla? Nior chualamar ach an chaint atá cloiste againn le dhá bhliain anuas, go raibh sé seo ag tarlú ansin, go raibh sé siúd ag tarlú san áit eile, go raibh an oiread sin mhonarchana druidthe agus mar sin de. Ní hiad na monarchana atá faoi chúram an Údaráis atá druidthe, ach monarchana ar fud na tíre go léir, monarchana a fuair deontais mhóra ón IDA.  Nuair atá clár dá leithéid á chur amach ar an staisiún náisiúnta ba chóir, mar a dúirt mé, cothromaíocht a bheith ann.  Ach ni raibh sé ansin aréir.</P>
    <P>Tá obair mhaith déanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá os cionn 4,000 daoine fostaithe i láthair na huaire ag an Údarás nó faoi chúram an Údaráis, postanna atá sna Gaeltachtaí.  Agus thainig an tUdarás isteach, tá an-obair á déanamh acu ag iarraidh monarchana a bhí, b'fhéidir, ag ligean a maidí le sruth a chur chun cinn agus a fheabhsú.  Ni raibh creidiúint ar bith tugtha san chlár sin aréir ar an teilifís go raibh maitheas ar bith déanta ag an Udarás nó go raibh buntáiste ar bith san méid a rinne siad ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta ó cuireadh ar bun an tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>Céard iad na ceisteanna atá á gcur ag pobal na tíre agus ag muintir Bhaile Átha Cliath agus daoine ar fud na tíre i ngeall ar an rud seo go léir?  Tá a fhios againn céard iad: Cén mhaith ata san Údarás? <Col N="2849" /> An bhfuil gadaíocht ar siúl?  An bhfuil airgead an Údaráis a chaitheamh go fánach?  An bhfuil baill an Údaráis ag cuidiú leo?  Na daoine atá ag obair don Údarás, an gadaithe iad go leir?  Sin iad na ceisteanna atá a gcur i láthair na huaire.  Tá a fhios againn uilig cén dochar atá sé sin á dhéanamh agus céard a tharlós dá bharr.  Má tá lucht bainc, tionsclaí a bhfuil fonn orthu bunú sa Ghaeltacht, nó fonn orthu tionscal a chur ar bun sa Ghaeltacht, tá mé cinnte de go gcoinneoidh siad glan air de bharr an drochphoiblíocht atá tugtha don Udarás agus do bhaill an Údaráis agus don phríomhfheidhmeannach le dhá bhliain anuas. Tharla sé seo sa Teach seo.  Is dócha go dtig linn a rá ar bhealach amháin go mb'fhéidir gur anseo a thosaigh sé don chéad uair.  Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil an-dochar agus díobháil déanta de bharr na ráflaí seo agus de bharr na cúl cainte atá ar siúl maidir le cúrsaí an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an tAire ag tabhairt a ráitis, léigh sé nó thug sé dréacht dúinn as litir a bhí aige.  Leis an fhírinne ghlan a rá, níl a fhios agam céard a bhi ar siúl aige. Luaigh sé suimeanna áirithe airgid.  Níl a fhios agam cad chuige a chuir sé an litir seo os ár gcomhair &mdash; this person, that person and the other person.  Seo é an cineál cainte a bhí aige faoi shuimeanna airgid a bhí ag dul ó dhuine go duine.  Tá sé díreach cosúil leis an rud atá ar siúl, an chúlchaint; an bhfuil rud éigin mícheart, an bhfuil rud éigin bun os cionn, an bhfuil airgead á chur amú?  Agus maidir leis an cheist a chuir mé ar an Aire anseo nuair a bhi an díospóireacht ar siúl againn, an bhfuil gadaíocht i gceist?</P>

Agus bíodh a fhios againn anois, laithreach, chomh luath agus is féidir, cén bun atá leis na cúrsaí seo nó cén toradh atá le teacht ar na cúrsaí seo.  Ná bíodh an chúlchaint atá ar siúl, ata ag déanamh an-dochar do chúrsaí an Údarás agus go mór mhór do chúrsaí na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Caithfimid uilig ag an bpointe seo ceist a chur céard atá in ann don Údarás? <Col N="2850" /> Céard atá le tarlú anois?  Is é an trua é nach raibh an tAire sásta ainmneacha na mball a bheas á dtoghadh aige a chur os comhair na Dála.  B'fhéidir go n-inseodh se dúinn é seo nuair atá sé réidh. Ach bheadh sé nios fearr, sílim, agus bheadh chuile dhuine sásta leis, dá n-inseodh sé dúinne anseo cé hiad na baill úra atá dúil aige a chur ar an Údarás. Bheadh sé níos fearr dá n-inseodh sé dúinne é ná go mbeadh sinne mar bhaill den Teach seo ag fáil na n-ainmneacha níos moille, ó tharla go bhfuil an díospóireacht ar siúl agus ó tharla go bhfuil an oiread seo cainte anseo faoin Údarás.  An rud a fheicimse, maidir leis an Údarás, cuireadh ar bun é mar bhord neamhspleách.  Bhí daoine tofa ag muintir na Gaeltachta go daonlathach agus bheadh siad sa tromlach ar an mbord, mórsheisear acu.  Bheadh baill eile ainmnithe ag an Rialtas.  Ach feasta an mbeidh na daoine seo saor, an mbeidh siad neamhspleách?  An mbeidh siad in ann a gcuid tuairimí nó a gcuid moltai nó tada atá ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht a chur chun tosaigh?  Is é mo bharúil nach mbeidh.  Beidh srian orthu, beidh ceangal orthu, beidh lámh an Aire go trom ar a mullach agus ní bheidh siad in ann tada a dhéanamh gan cead a fháil ón Aire faoi na cúrsaí a bhéas á bplé acu.  Tá cruthú air sin againn cheana, nuair a d'oibrigh an tAire an lámh láidir ar Rúnaí na Roinne mar bhall den Údarás.</P>
    <P>Tá sé le feiceáil go soiléir freisin sa rud atá déanta aige le cúpla lá.  Gach ball a bhéas ainmnithe ag an Aire caithfidh sé cloí le tuairimí an Aire.  Céard a thárlós ag gnáth-chruinnithe an Údaráis?  An mbeidh clár na gcruinnithe leagtha amach ag an Aire?  An mbeidh an tÚdarás saor cúrsaí dá gcuid féin a chur ar an gclár, nó an mbeidh siad in ann tada a phlé nach mbeidh an tAire sásta leis? Sílimse gurb é sin an chaoí a mbeidh sé. Ní bheidh siad in ann dul isteach ansin go neamhspleách, agus aon ní a theastaíonn uathu a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht.  Ní bheidh siad in ann é a dhéanamh feasta.</P>
    <P>Tá chuile Teachta anseo sásta a gcion féin a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht.  Sílim gurb é an rud is fearr <Col N="2851" /> a thig linn a dhéanamh anseo, in ainm Dé, deireadh a chur leis an gconspóid seo, deireadh a chur leis an gcúlchaint atá ar siúl maidir leis an Údarás, le príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis agus baill an Údaráis.  Má tá rud as bealach, mar adúirt mé cheana, is féidir linn na daoine atá ciontach a thabhairt os comhair na gcúirteanna &mdash; má tá gadaíocht nó rudaí mí-chearta ag tarlú.  Chuirfeadh sé sin deireadh leis agus bheimís ag tabhairt cead don Údarás dul ar aghaidh leis an deá-obair atá ar siúl acu chun fostaíocht a chur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí agus chun saol mhuintir na nGaeltachtaí a fheabhsú.  Sin an méid a theastaíonn uainn, agus tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire anseo anocht an méid sin a dhéanamh. Beimid buíoch dó má dhéanann sé é chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>

Ba mhaith liom a rá ar dtús nach bhfuilim ag déanamh ionsaí ar an Údarás mar údarás, ach ar an slí ina bhfuil an tÚdarás, an Ghaeltacht agus cúis mhuintir na Gaeltachta mar liathróid peile &mdash; a political football.  Tá dáinséar ann go gcaillfimid an tÚdarás má leanann an chúlchaint agus na ráflaí.  Tá géar-ghá le scrúdú poiblí chun an dáinséar sin a sheachaint. Is buachan do dhaoine na Gaeltachta. Ní cóir an buachan sin a chailliúint.  Bhuaigh na rudaí sin in aghaidh toil Fhianna Fáil agus Fhine Gael.  Ní raibh aon fhonn ar Fhianna Fáil ná Fhine Gael an tÚdarás a chur ar bun go dtí go raibh feachtas as siúl i dtaobh ceartas síbhialta mhuintir na Gaeltachta&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to accept that the only thing which will cure the present problem of Údarás is a full scale public inquiry into the business of Údarás and how they have conducted themselves since they were established.  Last July this House unanimously <Col N="2852" /> agreed that there would be an inquiry into Údarás and the Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies were given the task of carrying out that inquiry.  That inquiry has not yet begun.  That is the fault of this House, not the fault of anybody outside the House.  It is the fault of all the Members of this House.  I am fairly certain if that inquiry had got under way when this was supposed to happen none of the affairs which have since occurred would have happened and a stop would have been put to whatever kind of mismanagement is going on.</P>
    <P>It is also significant to note that a number of the elected members of Údarás have called for an inquiry into Údarás in order to clear the air and to ensure that Údarás can continue.  I believe one of the most effective ways of making Údarás more useful and more in tune with the people of the Gaeltacht is that it be a totally democratically elected Údarás and not be in the position where at the whim of the Minister, for whatever political reason, he can remove three members from that board because they refuse to carry out what he dictates they ought to do.</P>
    <P>I feel the manner in which the Minister dismissed the three members of Údarás is totally inappropriate and casts a shadow on the characters of the three people he has dismissed.  It is totally unfair to do that kind of thing to people who were loyally serving the people of the Gaeltacht and who, under no circumstances, should have been treated in the way the Minister has treated them.</P>
    <P>There is a need not only to look at Údarás and the way they have worked but also to look at the way this House and the people of this country have in years past and even today attempted to save the Gaeltacht and save the language. All of the efforts to date have failed.  The language is declining and the Gaeltachtaí are declining.  It is foolish for anybody in this House to believe, simply by establishing Údarás na Gaeltachta, giving them some money to build some factories, that that will save the Gaeltacht or save the language.  There needs to be a complete review of how that has to be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2853" /> There seems to be a lot of play-acting going on in relation to this whole matter. At one stage last year we had the Fianna Fáil Party agreeing that there was a need for an inquiry.  Now they are in full agreement that Údarás are doing a great job and should be congratulated for the job they are doing.  Last year Fine Gael were urging a judicial inquiry into Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Minister is saying now that he is quite happy to wait until the Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies carry out their inquiry.  That committee, in the course of a report to the House, stated that they could not proceed with the inquiry until the House gave privilege to witnesses who go before them.  That arose because there was a danger that people who offered themselves as witnesses to the committee conducting the inquiry into Údarás might have a fear that they might be intimidated or abused in some way.  That is a serious matter and the House should address itself to it.  We are either serious about solving the problems relating to Údarás or we are not.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about this matter the Government, within the next few days, should introduce legislation to ensure that at the least the Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies can continue with the inquiry they were asked to carry out in July of last year.  There have been a number of serious allegations made in relation to the affairs of Údarás.  Allegations have been made of phone tapping, of irregular loans, exorbitant prices being paid for land, of huge land banks being built up for which there is absolutely no need and of factories being built or having been built when large numbers of factories were lying idle.  The Fraud Squad have been asked to investigate certain companies under the auspices of Údarás and I understand that the report is with the DPP in relation to those investigations.</P>
    <P>It is fairly clear that the problems the Minister is speaking about are only the tip of the iceberg in relation to Údarás. It is pointless for us not to insist that a full, frank and open inquiry be carried out to cover all the operations of Údarás. The Minister, when replying, should give some idea of the steps he proposes to <Col N="2854" /> take to ensure that takes place without further delay.  Will the Minister indicate if he intends to broaden the powers of Údarás?  After all, the demands of the people of the Gaeltacht when they were seeking the establishment of Údarás were that they should be given the same powers as local authorities.  It was never intended that Údarás would be solely a poor relation of the IDA in establishing factories on some type of a purely commercial operation.  It was intended to broaden and develop other aspects of Gaeltacht life and that Údarás would have control and some say in the development taking place in the Gaeltacht, such as planning and so on.  Part of the problem in relation to Údarás is that they have been dealing almost exclusively with commercial matters to the exclusion of other things they ought to be doing for the people of the Gaeltacht.  It is essential that whatever is done over the next day or two that the Minister should take every means available to him to clear the names of the three people he dismissed and ensure there is no shadow hanging over them.  He should immediately set about ensuring that the inquiry which was agreed unanimously by the House, by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Workers' Party, be got under way without further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to reply to the grave allegations made by Deputy Molloy both inside this House and on RTE radio last week. He alleged that Mr. Eamonn Delaney, an Údarás accountant, was unwittingly duped into becoming involved in a vindictive and unscrupulous conspiracy against Údarás na Gaeltachta orchestrated by me.  He went on to imply that Mr. Delaney was so distressed by my activities in pursuing Mr. Delaney's written complaints about the administration of Údarás na Gaeltachta that he suffered a fatal heart attack as a result.  In other words, Deputy Molloy claimed I played a major part in Mr. Delaney's death, that I effectively killed him.  It is a long time since anyone in Dáil Éireann has been accused of murder.  I now feel duty bound <Col N="2855" /> to give the House my account of the events referred to by Deputy Molloy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy's slanderous statements in this House and on the national broadcasting service, were a clever and malicious collection of half-truths, inaccuracies and fabrications.  However, it is true that I have egged on, as he said, the Government and their predecessors, to deal with the running scandal that is going on in Údarás na Galetachta.  It is true that I received and handed to the Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy O'Toole, when he was in office, a letter from Mr. Delaney outlining in detail a disturbing litany of malpractices in several Údarás companies which the current management had declined to investigate let alone take action on.  I should like to place on the record of the House some critical passages from Mr. Delaney's correspondence:</P>
      <P>In this letter I am not going to make any references to rumours regarding to what is happening or has happened in the Údarás generally, but I will deal only with companies in which I worked on accounts and on which there is documentary proof of unethical practices. These practices included the obtaining of loans illegally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The main companies are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not reading from the letter.  Following advice from the Attorney General, the Government sent in the Fraud Squad to investigate the alleged irregularities in the companies mentioned in the letter.  In the past three months I have tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister for Justice concerning the six companies.  The six companies are: Hydromarine Teoranta, Westcon Teoranta, Westsea Teoranta, Ostan Ceathru Rua, C.P. Teoranta, Ostan Dún an Ór.  In his reply the Minister for Justice said he had no function in the matter but he volunteered the information that there was no prosecution taking place in one company.  In other words, the other five companies are in the DPP's office under active consideration.  I respectfully suggest to the DPP that he issue a statement immediately regarding the companies. We do not want another MacArthur affair as far as this is concerned.</P>
      <P>It is true that I spoke to <i>The Cork Examiner</i> in January 1982 but it was to demand an inquiry into the affairs of the Údarás.  Deputy Molloy will have to look inside his own party to trace the chain of events that led to the fingering of the late Mr. Delaney, his suspension and the publication of newspaper stories concerning the affair only days before the tragic death of Mr. Delaney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1982 Deputy Padraic Flynn, as Minister <Col N="2859" /> for the Gaeltacht, announced there would be no inquiry into the affairs of the Údarás.  Within a month Mr. Delaney was suspended and a story by Cian O'hÉigeartaigh appeared in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> which was carried later by the other newspapers.  That was very sympathetic to the predicament of Mr. Frank Flynn who had suspended Mr. Delaney under section 15 of the Act for unauthorised disclosure of information.  The article quoted Mr. Flynn as stating that, &ldquo;Mr. Delaney's position would be reviewed pending the completion of the Garda investigations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is also true to state that Mr. Delaney was an honourable man.  As long ago as May 1982, only weeks after his death, I called for the clearing of his name and both myself and the Minister, Deputy O'Toole, acknowledged that Mr. Delaney had acted at all times in the national interest.  Only last July I reiterated the demand.  How honourable is Deputy Molloy in this situation?  It has taken him nearly 18 months to break his silence on matters concerning Údarás na Gaeltachta. Mr. Delaney and an Údarás accountant came to him about a matter of great concern.  Deputy Molloy never addressed himself to the &ldquo;uncomplimentary&rdquo; thing as he put it in what Mr. Delaney had written about the Údarás. Deputy Molloy never publicised his astonishment at the conspiracy and intrigue involving myself and the Minister until last week, 18 months after Mr. Delaney's death.  Deputy Molloy declined to intercede on Mr. Delaney's behalf when he was victimised, intimidated and suspended by the chief executive of the Údarás, Mr. Frank Flynn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, when the Ceann Comhairle was in charge of this debate he stated that apart from it being improper to read without permission from letters that were sent to an individual it was also improper to refer to individuals by name.  We have had a continuous breaking of that regulation by the speaker in possession.  I think the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should call him to <Col N="2860" /> order.  He is abusing the privileges of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy's concern now rings very hollow.  Deputy Molloy is the latest recruit to the great Údarás cover-up campaign.  Fianna Fáil in their attempt to congratulate the work of the Údarás are denigrating the memory of their founding fathers, de Valera, Lemass, Ryan and MacEntee.  These people would have meted out rough justice to those who have been fooling the people of the Gaeltacht for the past few years.  However, the major Opposition party are no longer a credible organisation in Irish politics.  In the case of Deputy Molloy, he has bent facts, disregarded the truth and blatantly rewritten history to protect wrongdoers in the process.  The illegal bugging by Mr. Flynn of Mr. John Devine's telephone conversation with a Government official was described by Deputy Molloy as &ldquo;overheard in conversation&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>However, I do not expect Deputy Molloy to apologise.  I will not even demand an apology.  The Deputy is not the only Fianna Fáil representative <Col N="2861" /> who has suddenly discovered great merit in the development performance of Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Speaker after speaker on Radio na Gaeltachta for the past few weeks have been recent converts to the view that Údarás na Gaeltachta are doing a good job by encouraging prosperity and social stability in the Gaeltacht areas.  One wonders what is behind this dramatic change of hearts and minds?  For instance, as far back as 1977 the former Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Chairman of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, Deputy Tunney, said there was a cover-up going on.  On 31 March 1977 he put six questions to Deputy O'Donnell, the then Minister for the Gaeltacht.  I will not go into details on the matter but Deputy Tunney knows what I am talking about.</P>

Is í fírinne an scéal ár ndóigh gur Aire de chuid Fine Gael, Aire na Gaeltachta agus an tAire Airgeadais a d'fhéach chuige go bhfágfaí an tÚdarás ar an ngannchuid ó thaobh airgid sa bhliain 1982, le laghdú 27 faoin gcéad an bhliain sin i soláthar caipitil, i gcaoi nach bhféadfadh an tUdarás leanúint ar aghaidh lena gcuid oibre ar mhaithe leis an Ghaeltacht &mdash; £4,500,000 breise a fuair mise do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus caithfidh mé a rá leis an Aire nach raibh sé ar intinn aige leanúint ar aghaidh ar chor ar bith leis an Údarás ag an am sin.  Bhí sé ar intinn aige deireadh a chur leis an Údarás agus tá sé ag déanamh an iarracht céanna anois inniu.</P>
    <P>I carry no brief for Frank Flynn.  He is tough, resourceful and articulate and I had my differences of opinion with him. I doubt very much if he would regard me as his favourite person but in any of the dealings I had with the Údarás I found no illegality which required me to do what the Minister is now attempting.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to say that I was not prepared to have an inquiry into the affairs of the Údarás.  It was my amendment to the motion of Deputies Kenny and O'Toole last July which brought about the unanimous decision here which would have allowed the Údarás to be investigated by the Members of this House.  Let it be said that if I had found any misdeed, malpractice or whatever, I would have dealt with it much more quickly than the Minister.</P>
    <P>Let us get to the basics of the matter. We have seen an unprecedented Government action demanding that a State board should do their political dirty work.  What evidence had the Minister <Col N="2866" /> against the three people whom he unceremoniously sacked last evening?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated in his opening speech:</P>
      <P>Faoi mar a tharla, is oth liom go raibh tríur de na comhaltaí nach bhféadfainnse glacadh leis an dearcadh a bhí acu ....</P>
      <P>He could not accept the dearcadh and I take it that &ldquo;dearcadh&rdquo; means the outlook of the three individuals.  For that they have been sacked.  He had not the courtesy or decency to exonerate them from any suggestion of malpractice or wrongdoing that might be levied against them outside this House.  One would have thought that even if he found it necessary to sack them he could at least have said in their defence that they did nothing wrong while performing their duties on behalf of the people in the Gaeltacht.  What is the evidence against those three people?  What evidence is there against an príomhfheidhmeannach? An méid atá leagtha síos sa ráiteas atá romhainn inniu, an ea?  It is a collection of suppositions and the Minister is perpetrating a scandalous travesty of the justice that is accepted and respected as normal practice in this country.</P>
      <P>It is not true for the Minister to say that it is up to the board to decide on Mr. Frank Flynn's fate.  The Minister is deciding it himself in two ways.  He is manipulating the democratic process and bypassing the will of the elected representatives on the board.  It was for that reason that the board was set up originally by Fianna Fáil and promoted in this House by Deputy Denis Gallagher, to give the people of the Gaeltacht an opportunity to develop themselves and to have a say in their own destiny.  The Minister by manipulating the process is bringing about a situation where he will gain the majority vote on that board, and that is an indecent abuse of political power.</P>

      <P>The second method being used by the Minister &mdash; perhaps the most damning of his actions in the last two days &mdash; is that he is setting preconditions for acceptance for nomination to any board in the State.  He is telling those whom he wishes to appoint to a board that they can only serve if they follow his dictate and, if not, they will be sacked. That is a brazen, blatant and political abuse of power and the Minister stands indicted for it.  He is not suggesting by his attitude or actions that he is just going to replace Fianna Fáil members on the board.  He is saying that anyone who dares to disagree with his dictate will suffer the same penalty.  We might as well clear up the matter because that is precisely what the Minister said when interviewed last evening and reiterated and confirmed by the chairman of the board today.  He said they were given the ultimatum that, unless they carried out the Minister's wishes and did his bidding, they would be sacked.  I do not know what kind of fair play or common natural justice is being practised by the Minister, but it is a long way from the traditions of this House.</P>
      <P>It goes further.  It is a vote of no confidence in the total board and tantamount to suggesting that they are acting <i>ultra vires</i>.  It is an insult, not just to the remaining members of the board or to the elected members of the board, but to the electorate.  That is the insult that is felt most bitterly and keenly by the people of the Gaeltacht area following the ministerial action.  The Minister cannot act as judge and jury in all matters. His attitude goes beyond the norms of natural justice in that he says they are guilty even though they are not proven guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most despicable aspects of all this business in the last two days is the use and the abuse of the accounting officer of Roinn na Gaeltachta.  He has been used to throw the Minister's snowballs which were made behind closed doors and flung on various occasions, particularly last Saturday, in dealing with respected and respectable members of the board.  It raises the whole question of <Col N="2868" /> appointing civil servants as members of boards and semi-State companies.  It is not fair to utilise a person in such a way. I must put it to the Minister that when he was asked last evening if in fact he had used one of his officials in this way he declined to answer and moved away from the question.  That casts aspersions on people who should be above that kind of thing, because in my time with the same accounting officer I found him to be a man of the highest integrity and principles in dealing with all matters that came before him.  Indeed, I wish to say that about the total staff of Roinn na Gaeltachta. The Minister has done a disservice to the reputation of that staff.</P>
    <P>The fraud squad were involved last year in matters concerning the Údarás.  I was aware of investigations they were carrying out even though I did not know the names of the companies and, to the credit of the accounting officer, he would not under any circumstances break confidence and give any information that was not proper.  I was aware that the investigations were carried on for a long period because I continually sought information as to when they would bring in their findings so that we could clear up once and for all an droch-chaint, an chúlchaint agus na ráflái a bhí ag dul thart ar feadh an tsamhraidh ar fad maidir le himeachtaí a bhí ar siúl in Udarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>They did not bring it in and I understand the Minister has no evidence of any action they might be taking through the DPP.  Was that not the whole basis for the Deputies seeking their so-called judicial inquiry last year?  If the Minister was so anxious to have a judicial inquiry when he was putting us all through the agonies last year, why did he not do the job on his first day in office?  He did not do it because when he took up the reins of power again he discovered there was nothing to investigate.  I asked for that information to be placed before me and I could not find any single item where I could say that the Príomhfheidhmeannach or any member of the board of Údarás lined their pockets or did anything illegal.  I challenge the Minister this evening to state unambiguously and unequivocally he is sure that nobody has <Col N="2869" /> done anything illegal in so far as the activities of Udarás na Gaeltachta are concerned.  It was unreasonable for the Minister not to see the Príomh-fheidhmeannach and the chairman of the board when they requested a meeting with him.</P>
    <P>This raises the whole question of the Coalition's attitude to Government appointees.  Is this the tactic that is to be used in respect of the appointees to any board under the control of the Coalition: that they would set out the ground rules for them before appointing them and that if they are not prepared to play ducks and drakes for the Minister they will not serve?  The Minister goes to great pains to say that this is not personal and political. The Minister protests his innocence too much in this regard.  What crime has O'Malley of Castlebar committed that so necessitates his immediate dismissal?  He sought the information for the Minister. He gave the Minister all the information he had.  He promised to seek the information and said that if he could get it he would give it to the Minister.  The auditor accepted that there was no Government money at risk so far as the board were concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Did Mr. O'Malley do any less than the three whom the Minister has chosen to allow stay?  They could not have given the information either because they did not have it.  Did the Minister ask the secretary of his Department to seek the dismissal of Mr. Flynn? The Minister has said that appointees are there to carry out the Minister's orders, that that is their specific function.  If the Minister applies that to Aer Lingus, CIE, Board Fáilte, RTE or any of the 200 companies where there are Government appointees, there will be no democracy left.  What we will have is Government by <i>diktat</i> and that is only one step away from Government by dictatorship.  According to the Minister, boards are to be loaded with Ministers' appointees, given their instructions and told that it is their specific function to carry out the will of the Minister of the day.  That thinking never <Col N="2870" /> applied in Ireland until the Minister came to office.  It was always understood that these people would use their good offices and their experience in the best interest of the board on which they were placed irrespective of political affiliations or appointments.</P>
      <P>How did the three survivors carry out their responsibility in a way that was any different from the three who were sacked by the Minister and who gave him all the information they had?  Have these people who are left bent the knee and agreed to be the Minister's stool pigeons?  Is that what is meant by the ominous silence so far as they are concerned?  What vestige of reputation, integrity or impartiality is the Minister leaving them?  What hope have we of confidentiality for industrialists or investors who might be dealing with members of the board?  What hope have we of cohesion at board level when there is open conflict generated and perpetrated by the Minister as between the elected members and the nominated members who are carrying out his directions? What hope have we of an effective administration at executive level?  Who is next to go?  One needs to have a scaffold before hanging someone but that is what is being done by the Minister and the Government in the past two days.  This is not common justice and we ask the Minister to withdraw his decision to remove those people from the board.</P>

Nuair a chuaigh an Bille go dtí an Seanad labhair Páirtí Fhine Gael ins an tSeanad ar son Bille Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Ní raibh aon vóta anseo ins an Teach.  Ní raibh daoine ag rá Tá, agus ní raibh daoine ag rá Níl.  Bhí Fine Gael agus gach páirtí eile i bhfábhar an Bille a chur tríd an Teach agus tá a fhios sin ag an Teachta Donncha O Gallchóir mar is é a bhí ina Aire ag an am sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fiú amháin nuair a bhí an Bille ag dul tríd an Seanad labhair mo chara féin a bhí ina urlabhraí ar chúrsaí Gaeltachta ag Fine Gael ag an am sa Seanad agus atá &mdash; buíochas do Dhia &mdash; ann go fóill agus gur féidir leis labhairt amach ar a shon féin, labhair sé agus thug sé tacaíocht an-láidir don Bhille &mdash; agus is é an duine a bhfuil mé ag déanamh tagairt dó ná an Seanadóir Andy O'Brien as chontae an Chabháin.  Nuair a bhí an Bille ag dul tríd an Seanad ar an 28 Feabhra 1979 agus tá mé ag léamh as an Tuairisc Oifigiúil, Colún 273, dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Briain &ldquo;cuirim fáilte roimh prionsabal an Bhille <Col N="2872" /> agus guím rath ar an obair atá i lámha an Aire chun an Bille a stiúrú agus chun an tÚdarás a chur ar bun.  Guím freisin rath ar obair an Údaráis nuair a bheidh sé i réim&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Chuaigh sé ar aghaidh mar sin agus fad is a bhí sé ag caint rinne sé tagairt eile do óráid an Aire.  Ar an gcéad leathanach deir sé: &ldquo;Mar is léir ón mBille seo tá fonn ar an Rialtas seasamh i bhfad níos láidre a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeltachta ná mar a bhí i gceist cheana&rdquo; agus dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Briain an lá sin san Seanad: Aontaím go mór leis an cuspóir sin.  Mar adúirt mé cheana, tá súil agam go n-eireoidh leis&rdquo;, agus téann sé ar aghaidh mar sin.  Thug na Baill go léir a labhair tacaíocht don Aire nuair a bhí an Bille ag dul tríd an Dáil agus tríd an Seanad.  Ba mhaith liom é seo a rá; nuair a bhí toghchán ann ar fud na Gaeltachtaí fá choinne daoine a thoghadh le bheith ar Údarás na Gaeltachta ghlac Páirtí Fhine Gael páirt an-ghníomhach ins an toghchán sin. Chuaigh siad amach agus bhuaigh siad an suíochán agus d'éirigh leo cúpla ionadaí a fháil ar Bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, ní shílim go bhfuil an fhírinne acu nuair adeir siad go bhfuilimidne anseo i gcoinne an Údaráis agus go bhfuil fonn orainn é a scrios.  Mar Theachta Dála as an nGaeltacht tuigim cé chomh tábhachtach agus atá sé go mbeadh eagraíocht cosúil le Údarás na Gaeltachta ag breathnú i ndiaidh fhorbairt agus fostaíocht a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht agus tá súil agam gur mar sin a bheidh an scéal as seo amach nuair a bheidh an cheist seo réitithe mar is ceart a bheith.</P>
    <P>Nuair a cuireadh an tÚdarás ar bun ghlac siad cúram orthu féin ó Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Cuireadh Gaeltarra Éireann ar bun sna caogadaí agus d'éirigh leo forbairt áirithe a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht. Sna seascadaí agus sna seachtóidí, go spesialta ó 1973 go dtí 1977 nuair a bhí Tomás Ó Domhnaill ina Aire Gaeltachta, rinneadh forbairt an-mhór sa Ghaeltacht.  Ní shílim gur féidir le héinne a shéanadh nuair a ghlac sé cúram na Gaeltachta air féin i 1973 go raibh 1,700 no 1,800 duine ag obair agus nuair a chuaigh sé as oifig in 1977 go raibh breis <Col N="2873" /> agus 3,000 fostaithe ag Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>

Bhí gach rud ag dul ar aghaidh go breá agus taréis bliain nó bliain go leith nó mar sin chualamar ráflaí.  Ní chuirimid suim i ráflaí.  Daoine atá sa saol poiblí cloiseann siad ráflaí i gcónaí ach mar sin féin chualamar go bhfuair duine éigin deontas agus ba mhaith an rud é fá choinne fostaíochta a chur ar fáil ins an Ghaeltacht agus tamall ina dhiaidh sin chualamar go bhfuair duine éigin eile deontas fá choinne rud éigin a cheannach agus obair a chur ar fáil ins an Ghaeltacht.  Ansin taréis tamaill bhí an scéal ag dul i dtreise agus chuir daoine isteach fá choinne deontas den chineál céanna agus go minic ar chúis éigin ní raibh siad le fáil acu agus ó mo thaobh féin de, cé gur thug mé tacaíocht iomlán don Údarás agus gur seo an chéad uair a labhair mé anseo ins an Teach mar gheall ar an Údarás, cé go raibh deis agam é a dhéanamh dhá uair anuraidh choinnigh mé mbhéal dúnta, ach caithfidh mé a rá go raibh na ráflaí ag dul i dtreise agus i dtreise i n-aghaidh an lae go dtí go <Col N="2874" /> bhfuilimid ins an áit a bhfuilimid inniu, go bhfuil creidiúint iomlán i measc muintir na hÉireann beagnach caillte ins an Údarás agus níl éinne is mó ins an Teach seo a gcuireann sé sin isteach air ná a chuireann sé ormsa nuair a chaithfidh mé labhairt le mo cháirde agus le daoine eile agus cuireann siad ceist &ldquo;i n-ainm Dé cad atá ag dul ar aghaidh ins an Ghaeltacht.

Ins an am i láthair is beag creidiúint atá fágtha ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus is mór an trua é sin mar níl sé sin chun maitheas ar bith a dhéanamh don Ghaeltacht agus níl sé ar chumas an Údaráis an obair a dhéanamh a cuireadh ina leith a dhéanamh nuair a bunaíodh iad, is é sin an teanga a chaomhnú agus cúrsaí fostaíochta a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Seo an áit ar bunaíodh Údarás na Gaeltachta istigh sa Teach seo, an áit a bhfuil croí-lár daonlathais na tíre.  An tAire Donncha Ó Gallchóir, le tacaíocht an Tí seo, a bhunaigh Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá trí duine déag ar an bhord agus bhí sé de dhualgas orthu sin príomhfheidhmeannach a cheapadh agus polasaí a dhéanamh amach, agus seo an áit a bhfuil an fhreagarthacht ón Údarás; an fhreagarthacht deiridh tá sé anseo ins an Dáil, agus caithfidh sé bheith in oifig Aire na Gaeltachta, mar ag deireadh ama air sin atá an fhreagarthacht airgead a chur ar fáil fá choinne an fhorbairt a chur ar aghaidh ins an Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Le bliain amháin tá an tAire anseo &mdash; Pádraig Ó Tuathail &mdash; ag cuartú eolais ón Údarás.  D'iarr sé go minic le bliain eolas mar gheall ar an £170,000 seo agus níl sé in ann an t-eolas sin a fháil.  Bhí mise ag féachaint ar an teilifís aréir nuair a bhí an tAire agus an Teachta Donncha Ó Gallchóir ansin agus chuir sé ionadh agus alltacht orm.  Ní raibh an t-eolas ag an Aire anseo.  Ní raibh an t-eolas a bhí á lorg ag an Aire ag cathaoirleach an bhoird.  De réir cosúlachta ní raibh an t-eolas ag aon bhall den bhord ach bhí an t-eolas ag an phríomhfheidhmeannach agus ní raibh sé sásta é a thabhairt don <Col N="2875" /> bhord ná don Aire a bhfuil freagarthacht air an t-airgead a chur ar fáil.  Caithfidh an Rialtas dul amach agus an t-airgead a thabhairt isteach mar cánacha agus é a thabhairt don Údarás ina dhiaidh sin, agus an fear a bhfuil an fhreagarthacht air ní raibh sé sásta ná ní raibh sé in ann an t-eolas sin a fháil cé go raibh sé ag an príomhfheidhmeannach.  Is é an t-aon slí go bhféadfadh an tAire é a fháil ná agairt ar an bhord an t-eolas a fháil ón bpríomhfheidhmeannach agus níor éirigh leo sin é sin a dhéanamh ach an oiread.

Na daoine atá ainmnithe ag an mbord ón Aire, tá freagarthacht orthu sin freisin agus is é an fhreagarthacht atá orthu sin ná go ndéanfaidh siad cinnte go bhfuil dearcadh agus toil an Aire agus an Rialtais a chuir ansin iad le cur os comhair an bhoird.  Sílimse chomh fada agus is féidir liomsa a dhéanamh amach nach raibh siad ag glacadh leis an fhreagarthacht sin, nach raibh dearcadh an Rialtais, nach raibh toil an Rialtais ná toil an Aire á dhéanamh acu.  B'fhéidir go raibh cúiseanna acu chuige sin.  Daoine iad a bhfuil aithne agam féin orthu; daoine onóracha iad agus caithfidh mé a rá nuair a rinne an tAire an socrú tráthnóna inné go raibh triúr le himeacht ón bhord go dtug sé buíochas dóibh as an tseirbhís a thug siad le ceithre bliana ar an bhord. Tháinig sé go dtí pointe go raibh rogha le déanamh an mbeadh an príomh-fheidhmeannach i gceannas nó an mbeadh an fear seo agus an Rialtas agus an tAire a bhfuil an fhreagarthacht orthu i gceannas.  Sílim go raibh foighid ag an Aire le bliain agus i ndeireadh ama gurb éigean dó an beart a rinne sé inné a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá dóchas agamsa go mairfidh Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Sílim go bhfuil fadhbanna ar leith ag an nGaeltacht nach bhfuil in aon pháirt eile den tír, fadhbanna a <Col N="2876" /> bhainneann le teanga, fadhbanna a bhaineann le cultúr.  Táimid go léir ar gach taobh den Teach seo i bhfábhar an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht a choinneáil slán.  Níl a fhios agamsa cé mar atá ag eirí linn.  Admhaímid uiling go bhfuil sé andeacair é sin a dhéanamh.  B'fhéidir go minic go bhfuil an cath ag dul inár gcoinne, ach mar sin féin sílim go bhfuil géarghá le Údarás nó le bord den chineál sin faoi choinne forbairt agus fostaíocht agus obair a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus sílim go bhfuil an commitment céanna agus an dearcadh céanna ar an taobh seo den Teach agus ag an Rialtas seo agus a bhí ar an taobh eile den Teach nuair a cuireadh Údarás na Gaeltachta ar bun.</P>

      <P>Ceapaim gur cúis náire go n-éireodh Teachta Dála de aon Pháirtí sa Teach seo agus iad ag caint faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta go háirithe agus iad ag caint go speisialta ar dhaoine a briseadh as a bpost aréir agus duine de na baill sin ina Dháilcheantar féin, an Teachta McGinley agus már bhfiú leis í a ainmniú nó buíochas a ghlacadh léithe thar a ceann féin de bharr an méid oibre atá déanta aice in a Dháilcheantarsa agus ar fud na tíre agus ar Bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta do chúrsaí na Gaeilge agus do cúrsaí na Gaeltachta.

Tá an-aiféala orm go mbeadh air a theacht go dtí an Teach seo ar ócáid den tsórt seo, fear a bhfuil a shaol caite aige ag obair ar leas oibrithe ar fud na tíre seo, síos agus soir agus thuas agus theas ag plé le ceardchumannachas sa tír seo.

      <Col N="2877" /> Is údar mór imní dúinn ar fad an chaoi ina láimhseáileadh cúrsaí Údarás na Gaeltachta ó 20 Iúil 1981 i leith. Fógraíodh go hoifigiúil &mdash; mar atá fhois agat a Cheann Comhairle &mdash; i Mí Eanáir 1982 go raibh fiosrúchán, mar adúirt an fógra Rialtais ag an am, &ldquo;into the constitution and operation of Údarás na Gaeltachta&rdquo; le cur ar bun ag an Rialtas, dar le hAire na Gaeltachta ag an am.  'Sé an scéal atá anseo anocht nach raibh aon bhaint aige féin leis an gcinneadh Rialtais sin ach cuimhnimís, a Cheann Comhairle, gur ball den Rialtas a bhí ann ag an am agus dá bharr sin nach bhféadfaí cinneadh den tsórt sin a dhéanamh gan treoir agus comhairle a ghlacadh ón Aire a bhfuil príomh-fhreagracht an Údaráis air.  Ní fhéadfaí a shoiléiriú ag an am cén cineál fiosrúcháin a bheadh ann nó cé bheadh ina bhun nó cé na téarmaí tagartha a leagfaí síos dó.  Tá fhios againn céard atá ar bun ó shin.  Ceist mhór í ceist seo na polaitíochta.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ráite go minic sa Teach seo ag Teachta amháin áirithe a labhair anseo anocht, an Teachta Begley, gur Údarás de chuid Fhianna Fáil a bhí san Údarás. Cuimhnímís freisin nach mbeadh Údarás ar bith againn murach Rialtas Fhianna Fáil.  Caithimís súil anois ar bhord an Údaráis.  Tá 13 bhall ar an mBord sin, nó bhí aréir.  Thogh pobal na Gaeltachta mórsheisear.  Ní raibh sé de chead ag aon duine de na hiarrthóirí sin ainm a bpáirtí polaitíochta fiú a bheith i ndiaidh a n-ainm ar an bpáipéar toghcháin agus rinne an Teachta Gallagher agus Rialtas Fhianna Fáil é sin d'aonghnó sa gcaoi nach bhféadfadh aon duine a rá go raibh cúrsaí polaitíochta i gceist.  Creidimse, a Cheann Comhairle, go láidir go raibh a gcúrsaí gnó déanta ag Bord an Údaráis ar bhonn neamh-pholaitiúil go dtí 1981 &mdash; go dtí gur tháinig beirt bhall tofa de chuid Fhine Gael a chuir a gcosa uathu.  B'shin athrú bunúsach ar fheidhmiú Bhord an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>Tá seachtar ball tofa, mar adúirt mé, beirt acu sin is baill iad de chuid Pháirtí Fhianna Fáil.  Ainmníodh seisear ball eile.  Breathnaimís anois orthu siúd go bhfeicimíd cé acu gur baill iad de Pháirtí Fhianna Fáil.  Duine amháin acu &mdash; a cheap an tAire féin &mdash; is ball é de Pháirtí <Col N="2878" /> Fhine Gael sa deisceart é.  Fear eile, ainmníodh é thar cheann an Údaráis. Mise a d'ainmnigh é agus caithfidh mé a rá go fírinneach nár chuir mise aon cheist ar an bhfear uasal sin cén páirtí polaitíochta lenar bhain sé nuair a cheap mé é mar bhall den Bhord.</P>
    <P>Tá Rúnaí Roinn na Gaeltachta mar bhall &mdash; tá sé i láthair anseo anocht.  Ní fhéadfadh aon duine a rá gur fear é an Rúnaí a chaithfeadh am ar bith ag plé le polaitíocht de chineál ar bith.  Agus anois tá triúr fágtha, an triúr a sheas ar a bprionsabal, mar atá de bheart acu a dhéanamh, agus a briseadh as a bpost dá bharr.  Fear amháin a ainmníodh thar ceann an ITGWU &mdash; ní fhéadfadh aon duine a rá gur ball de Pháirtí Fhianna Fáil é an tUasal Ó Néill.  Bean as Tír Chonaill nach bhfuil, gurb eol domsa ná do éinne den taobh seo nó den taobh eile den Teach, aon bhaint aici ariamh le Fianna Fáil agus an tríú duine an t-iar-Chathaoirleach, Bainisteoir Chontae Mhaigh Eó, an tUasal Mícheál Ó Máille.  Tá mé cinnte go n-aontódh an tAire liom nach dtéann an tUasal Ó Máille i mbun a chuid cúrsaí bainistíochta contae ar bhun pholaitíochta ar bith.</P>
    <P>Níl i mbriseadh na ndaoine seo as a bpostanna ach sampla eile de na Boird Stáit ar fad a bhfuil sceannairt déanta orthu ag an gComhrialtas &mdash; An Bord Pleanála agus Bord na gCapall, mar shampla.</P>
    <P>Sa gceist seo ar fad cé tá cúisithe?  Ar dtús tá comhaltaí Bhord an Údaráis cúisithe &mdash; tá pobal na Gaeltachta féin cúisithe mar gur thogh siad san mórsheisear don Bhord.  Tá príomh-fheidhmeannach na heagraíochta cúisithe, a bhfuil freagracht air polasaí an Bhoird a chur chun cinn taobh istigh den eagraíocht féin.  Ar deireadh tá siad siúd ar fad atá ag obair istigh san Údarás i gCeannaras na bhForbacha cúisithe.  Go hindíreach a Cheann Comhairle tá tionsclóirí a bhfuil 4,000 curtha ar fáil acu sna Gaeltachtaí cúisithe ag an Aire agus ag an Rialtas.</P>
    <P>Cén toradh atá leis an útamáil seo uilig?  Tá lagmhisneach orthu siúd atá ag obair san Udarás.  Tá baill den Bhord briste as a bpostanna ó aréir.  Seans &mdash; más fíor na ráflaí &mdash; go mbrisfear an <Col N="2879" /> príomh-fheidhmeannach ag an gcéad chruinniú eile.  Ansin cá stopfaidh an Rialtas: feidhmeannaigh, an mbrisfear iad sin?  Cléirigh, tionsclóirí, gnáthoibrithe, fiú amháin?  B'fhéidir go bhféadfaí a chreidiúint go dtriailfí Bainisteoir Chontae Maigh Eó a bhriseadh as a phost mar Bhainisteoir Contae. B'fhéidir go dtriailfí muintir na Gaeltachta féin a bhriseadh.  Triaileadh é cheana agus ní mholfainn d'aon duine é a thriail arís.</P>
    <P>Tá sé suimiúil go bhfuil iar-Aire Gaeltachta amháin nach bhfuil i láthair anocht.  D'fhan sé, mar a dúirt an Teachta Gallagher, ceithre bliana agus é ag impí ar an Rialtas Údarás daonlathach Gaeltachta a thabhairt isteach agus dhiúltaigh siad cead a thabhairt dó.  Tháinig Fianna Fáil &mdash; mar adúirt mé &mdash; agus tugadh isteach an tÚdarás taobh istigh de bhliain.  Tá fhios agamsa agus tá fhios ag na Teachtaí ar an taobh eile den Teach nach n-aontaíonn an t-iar-Aire sin leis an rud atá ar siúl anseo anocht nó leis an rud a tharla aréir agus gurb shin é an fáth nach bhfuil sé anseo linn anocht.  Ar dtús creidimse, agus creidim go gcreideann an tAire freisin é, go bhfuil an t-uafás dochair déanta don chomhoibriú agus don bhá atá idir Údarás na Gaeltachta agus pobal na Gaeltachta go ginearálta ag an gcineál seafóide atá ar siúl le dhá bhliain.  Tá dochar déanta aige do na tograí fiúntacha a bhfuil ag éirí leo agus a bhfuil beagnach 4,000 duine fostaithe iontu ar fud na nGaeltachtaí.  Níos measa ná sin tá amhras cothaithe in intinn na dtionsclóirí atá faoi láthair i mbun comhráití nó atá ag plé leis an Údarás faoi láthair le tionscail a bhunú sa nGaeltacht amach anseo agus fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá amhras freisin cothaithe i measc an lucht airgeadais a chuireann ar fáil airgead i bhfoirm iasachtaí ó na bainc mhóra nó aon fhoinse airgeadais eile sa tír seo. Nuair a bhí mise mar Aire Gaeltachta shocraigh an Bord ag an am go ndéanfadh muid athbhreithiniú ar an gcomórtas forbartha pobail.  Labhair mise agus príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis le tionsclóirí móra na tíre seo agus d'iarr muid orthu ag an am tacú le hUdarás na <Col N="2880" /> Gaeltachta; tacú le dul chun cinn pobail bheaga Gaeltachta anseo agus ansiúd ar fud Gaeltachtaí na tíre agus níl dabht ná iad siúd atá ag cur airgid ar fáil don chomórtas forbartha pobail sin, ná gurb iad sin tionsclóirí móra na tíre.  An bhfuil an tAire in ann a rá linn anois go leanfaidh siad den chineál céanna airgeadú an chéad bhliain eile nó amach anseo?  Ní chreidimse go bhféadfadh aon tionsclóir mór geallúint a thabhairt anois go bhféadfaidh seisean leanúint ar aghaidh nuair atá amhras cothaithe ag an Rialtas ins an eagraíocht lena bhfuil sé ag tabhairt tacú.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ráite ag polaiteoirí ar an dtaobh thall den Teach gur cuireadh airgead an Údaráis amú i mblianta a chuaigh thart. Tá sé ráite gur cuireadh airgead isteach i bpoll.  Aontódh chuile dhuine gur cuireadh airgead i dtionscail nár éirigh leo ar chúis amháin nó ar chúis eile.  Ach creidimse má rinne an tÚdarás tada ó tháinig siad i gcumhacht gur thógadar cinneadh láidir, cinneadh misniúil dhá bhliain go leith ó shin nó mar sin nuair a shocraíodar deireadh a chur leis an gcineál sin tionscal, tionscail nach raibh aon tsúil go deo go n-éireodh leo amach anseo.  Is dóigh liom go mba cinneadh misniúil é sin go háirithe do dhaoine a bhí tofa go daonlathach ag pobal Gaeltachta agus cinneadh a chuir isteach go mór orthu féin go pearsanta b'fhéidir ina gceantair féin.  Nuair a thógadar cinneadh misniúil den tsórt sin sílimse gur cheart go dtabharfadh an Rialtas seans dóibh dul i mbun gnótha agus má bhí tuilleadh de na tionscail seo ar fud na Gaeltachta anseo is ansúd go mbeadh deis ag an Údarás deileáil ar an gcaoi céanna leis na tionscail siúd.</P>
    <P>Ach tá damáiste i bhfad níos measa ná sin déanta ag an gcaint ar fad le dhá bhliain.  Tá an damáiste seo déanta, go bhfuil lámha an Údaráis, feidhmeannaigh an Udaráis agus baill bhord an Udaráis ceangailte nach féidir leo aon obair a bhéanamh, nach féidir aon fhorbairt tionsclaíochta a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht, go bhfuil an infheistíocht a bheadh ann imithe beagnach ar fad mar nach bhfuil comhlachtaí nó tionsclóirí taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, taobh amuigh den tír nó fiú amháin sa tír féin sásta airgead a <Col N="2881" /> infheistiú san Údarás nó i gcomhlachtaí leis an Údarás mar go gcreideann siad go bhfuil airgead curtha i bpócaí ag feidhmeannaigh taobh istigh den Údarás. Nílimid i bhFianna Fáil ag cur an t-amhrais sin i gcroíthe nó i gcloign na dtionsclóirí ach na páirtithe ar an dtaobh thall, Fine Gael agus an Lucht Oibre, an Comhrialtas.</P>
    <P>Creidimse go bhfuil rud i bhfad níos measa fós déanta ag an gcaint seo ar fad. Tá deireadh curtha le postanna nua nó a bheadh le cur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí ar fad.  Tá amhras cothaithe i gcloigne na bhfear airgid sa tír seo, na bainc, comhlachtaí árachais agus an comhlachtaí a mbeadh airgead acu le cur isteach mar infheistíocht sa Ghaeltacht le postanna a chothú.  Creideann chuile dhuine go bhfuil an scamall seo os cionn an Údaráis le dhá bhliain agus go bhfuil bunús de shaghas éigin leis.  Cuireann sé iontas agus alltacht orm nach bhfeicim duine ar bith de Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre istigh sa Teach seo anocht.  Creidim gur scanall den chéad scoth é, an Páirtí a deireann go bhfuil siad ar thaobh oibrithe na tíre seo, go gcuireann siad postanna ar fáil dóibh agus go seasann siad dóibh agus go labhraíonn siad dóibh sa Teach seo, nár bhfiú le duine amháin acu a bheith istigh anseo anocht le tacaíocht a thabhairt do oibrithe na Gaeltachta a bhfuil a gcuid postanna i mbaol.  Labhair an Teachta McGinley faoi vóta muiníne a bheith curtha ag Bord an Údaráis sa phriómhfheidhmeannach, an tUasal Flynn, agus dúirt sé gur cuireadh an vóta muiníne sin ann agus gan an príomh-fheidhmeannach sásta eolas a thabhairt.  Chreid mise ón méid a léigh mé sná páipéir agus on méid a chuala mé iar-chathaoirleach an bhoird ag rá ar an raidio tamall ó shin ann gur thug príomhfheidhmeannach an bhoird an t-eolas ar fad dó taobh amuigh cé is moite den bheirt tionsclóir sa Tuaisceart agus gur mhínigh sé go láidir an chúis a bhí aige le nach dtabharfaí ainm na beirte sin.  Cén fáth nach bhféadfadh Bord an Údaráis vóta muiníne a chur ann agus é taréis an t-eolas a bhí aige a thabhairt agus a mhíniú cén fáth nach bhféadfadh sé an chuid eile a thabhairt.  An n-inseoidh an tAire duinn fáth na moille ar fad sna chúrsaí seo thuas.  Caithfidh sé go <Col N="2882" /> raibh eolas faighte le go mbeadh sé anois in ann triúr bhall den bhord a bhriseadh as a bpostanna.</P>

      <P>Tá an fhírinne searbh.  Caitheadh an tAire a intinn siar go dtí an uair gur briseadh Údarás RTE, tá roinnt blianta ann ó shin.  Dúirt a pháirtí féin, Pháirtí Fhine Gael, sa Fhreasúra ag an am go mba mhór an scanall an rud a bhí ag tarlú agus nach cóir go mbrisfí aon bhord Stáit nó cuid de bhord Stáit go deo arís gan díospóireacht faoi a bheith sa Dáil ar dtús.  Cá bhfuil an daonlathas sin anois? Tá sé imithe le fána, cosúil le go leor rudaí eile.</P>
      <P>Inseodh an tAire dúinn cé hiad an triúr atá le ceapadh aige anois mar chomhaltaí den bhord.  Cá bhfaighidh sé triúr daoine níos ionraice, níos stuama, níos eolasaí ar chúrsaí Gaeltachta ná Micheál Ó Máille, Máire Mhic Niallais agus Maitiú Ó Néill?  I bPáirtí Fhine Gaeil b'fhéidir? Rinneadar a gcion do phobal na Gaeltachta agus ní rabhadar sásta lúbadh do bhrú polaitíochta.  Fair play dóibh agus nár laga Dia iad.  Cuirfear isteach anois triúr puipéid de chuid an Aire, triúr, mar a deirim, b'fhéidir as Pháirtí Fhine Gael. Agus an cheist is mó b'fhéidir atá ag cur as dúinn sna Gaeltachtaí faoi láthair cé a bheas mar phríomhfheidhmeannach nua má éiríonn leis an Aire san méid atá curtha roimhe le dhá bhliain anuas?  An bhfuil aon seans go bhfuil fírinne sa ráfla atá sa timpeallacht i mo ceantar agus i go leor ceantair eile ón bhliain 1981 gurb é an tUasal Ó Foighil, comhairleoir chontae de chuid Fhine Gael i nGaillimh Thiar a gheobhas an post?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to take a few minutes to intervene in this debate which is not directly involved with Údarás na Gaeltachta at all.  It is a debate on a transition in this country from democracy to dictatorship and the Minister, Deputy O'Toole, stands indicated as a result of his actions yesterday.  I ask him what guarantee he got from the three members who were not dismissed.  I have had and will have respect for those three members until I see what their actions are in the near future.  Of the three people who were dismissed Máire Bean Mhic Niallais, who is from my constituency, had absolutely no political affiliations. Mr. Michael O'Malley worked in Donegal for many years and we were wrong to allow him to leave Donegal. Mr. O'Neill was not affiliated to Fianna Fáil, although he was appointed by them, but he works closely with the ITGWU.</P>
      <P>At all times when anything to do with the Gaeltacht or institutions of the Gaeltacht are undermined by the public, Ministers and Deputies should defend those institutions in the Gaeltacht, but the Minister of today and particularly his colleague, Deputy Begley, have aided and abetted in ensuring that there would be leakages to the papers that were damaging to the Gaeltacht, and these leakages have no substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Board members should be nominated by Ministers and the nominations should be ratified by the Government, but it appears that it is not the Minister or the Government who decide on members of boards.  I am ashamed to believe that it is in the Fine Gael offices in Upper Mount Street that the future of boards is decided, and it was pointed out by my colleagues on this side of the House that the Minister was setting a precedent despite the fact that some years ago that party were most critical of Fianna Fáil when that party did not get rid of part of <Col N="2884" /> the board of RTE but dismissed them all. The Fraud Squad went into Údarás na Gaeltachta and we have yet to hear if anything dishonest was found then.  The House should also know that when the members were voting to appoint Frank Flynn on a full time basis the Secretary of the Department of the Gaeltacht then had full confidence in him.  I believe that the Secretary will still have confidence in him.  There is absolutely no reason for recommending three other members to the board who will act as puppets.  The Minister will have difficulty in finding three people to displace those dismissed as nobody with the same principles as those three would act as puppets for the Minister and Fine Gael.  The only people he could possibly find to act in this manner would be people from his own party.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister completely. He is being dictated to.  For a long time he was a Minister who stood on his own feet, but as a result of his action yesterday he is no longer held in high esteem by me or members of my party or, more so, by the people of the Gaeltacht who had some trust in him up until now.</P>

      <P>This debate has brought to light many startling facts.  We are really only seeing the tip of the iceberg.  The claims of playing politics made from the far side of the House are nothing short of a sheer disgrace to those who made them. Any Cabinet position carries responsibility with it.  If the present Minister is the first Minister of the Gaeltacht to act in accordance with his beliefs and principles and the advice which he is given in sorting out these matters, he is a man to be admired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussions which have taken place here this evening are typical of what has gone on in connection with Údarás na <Col N="2885" /> Gaeltachta and Gaeltarra Éireann for many years.  Údarás, a semi-State body, have been on a disastrous course since they were set up in 1979.  The appointment of the chairman of that board, my own county manager Mr. O'Malley, should not have taken place in the manner in which it did.  In fairness to the man, he is county manager of our third largest county.  He was given to understand that he would be chairman of a board which would meet approximately twice a month to discuss matters relevant to the Gaeltacht. It turned out, with innuendoes, scares and rumours about this, that and the other&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the chairman should have been a full-time appointee and the Minister who was, again, from my own constituency, should have known that fact from the beginning.  It was unfair on anybody to appoint him on the assumption that it was purely on a part-time basis when it was a position which carried much weight and responsibility and had the national interest at heart at that level.  Appointing a person on a purely part-time basis was not doing him justice.</P>

    <P>The appointment of Mr. Flynn as chief executive officer should not have been carried out in the way in which it was. That means no disrespect to Mr. Flynn. He was not the chosen appointee of the then Minister for the Gaeltacht.  The carry-on in relation to his appointment left much to be desired also, because there were many votes and many interviews. It would have been far better and <Col N="2886" /> would have resulted in far less discord and rancour had that person been appointed by the Local Appointments Commission at the beginning.</P>

      <P>That led to a lack of confidence in the chief executive officer from within his own organisation.  It is quite obvious that since 1979 stories have been leaked to certain newspapers and various people which are no credit to anybody. If the present Minister has taken the bull by the horns he is doing a good job for the country.  His Cabinet responsibility carries financial responsibility with it in the national interest.  It is time that some Minister stood up and was prepared to be counted.  The Minister has not taken this decision lightly.  He has already said that he is proud of the work of the people who have had to be dismissed.  It is fair to say that perhaps they stood by their principles and perhaps the other three who voted for the dismissal of the chief executive officer also stood by their principles. The Minister has possibly taken into account that these dismissals might lead to court action on the principles of natural <Col N="2887" /> justice.  I am sure that he has taken proper and due advice in that regard.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gallagher, former Minister for the Gaeltacht, from my own constituency, said on television last night that he could understand the putting up of this money and condone it in the interest of saving jobs.  That matter was very badly handled by the chairman of the board and its chief executive officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that he would not condone embezzlement and I do not doubt that.  However, he did say that he could understand the putting up of the money.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that if Minister O'Toole had said that while on the Opposition benches his party would have called for his resignation in a very short time.  People on that side of the House called for the resignation of the Minister for Justice quite recently when he was doing justice to his office and had the <Col N="2889" /> backing of the people for his action in that regard.</P>
      <P>The fact that a judicial inquiry has not been called for by Údarás na Gaeltachta themselves or by the board has been clarified by the Minister.  When we were on the Opposition side last year, we agreed with Deputy Flynn that a judicial inquiry at that time would lead to a further loss of jobs in the Gaeltacht areas and a further lack of investment in those areas because of all these rumours.  We agreed that a judicial inquiry at that point was not necessary.  No call for a judicial inquiry has come yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If the present Minister <Col N="2890" /> sorts all this out he will do a good job for his country and his Ministry.  People on the Opposition benches would put down a motion calling for the resignation of the Minister for the Gaeltacht if he were not in a position to produce information which was relevant to his Department. That side of the House would have parliamentary questions down for oral answer asking why he could not produce the documentation &mdash; was he Minister or was he not?  He has taken this course of action.  In a personal sense, he finds it regrettable to have to dismiss from the board his former county manager under whom he served admirably as a county councillor for a long number of years. They had a very good working relationship. I am not acquainted with either of the other two people who have now been dismissed but I am sure the Minister has taken advice in relation to this matter. Those dismissals in the interests of finding out for the public where this money came from, how the company laws were manipulated to favour one company against another are certainly justified.</P>
      <P>The Minister's discussions with the chief executive officer in public and in private have not helped the case of the Gaeltacht either from the Fine Gael side or from the Fianna Fáil side, but the Minister is the Minister of the day and he is appointed with Cabinet responsibility. He has the right under section 20 to information and that information must and should be given to him.  His actions in this regard have to be backed up from that point of view.  If the board have refused to answer the questions, they have recourse through their legal advisers and so on by saying that they gave whatever information was available to them at that time.  That is a matter for decision in another forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to money being put up by Unionists, who are nameless and are not in a position to come forward, either for security reasons or any other reason, this is something which baffles me.  As a person serving at present on the New Ireland Forum I am aware of the Unionist point of view and I understand their interpretation of what is going on down here.  It would certainly seem very strange that <Col N="2891" /> two private people of the Unionist tradition would come along with this offer of money for a company with specific conditions attached who were not prepared to let their names be known in public.  I find that very strange.  If the Minister was not in a position to get that information the people opposite would be the very people who would be calling for this resignation time after time.  They would say he was not fit to be Minister and was not fit to fulfil his Cabinet responsibilities.  From that point of view his action has to be followed through on this.</P>

      <P>The Minister's action in this is regrettable from a personal point of view.  I am sure he finds it a strain to dismiss people from a board but if an inquiry is to be held into this matter I am certain it is only the tip of the iceberg because working officials of Údarás na Gaeltachta have told me that they are ashamed to say in public that they work for the Údarás.  Deputy Begley is perfectly correct when he says that the DPP should now issue a clarifying statement as to whether there is something wrong in relation to the investigations carried out by the Fraud Squad in relation to these companies over the last few years. We are all entitled to that information.  It will ease the Minister's problem and make it more acceptable to everybody if the air is cleared on that matter.  There will be many more stories before this saga is ended.  It is regrettable that it happened in the first instance but the Minister is charged by the Government with Cabinet responsibility for the Gaeltacht.  He is charged with responsibility to the people of the nation, in particular to the people of the Gaeltacht.  His action in finding out this information has to be condoned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gerard Brady has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the matter of the <Col N="2898" /> Windscale project arising from a recent report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>At the start of this debate I should like to point out some facts that may not be realised in relation to Down's Syndrome in this country. Ireland has the highest incidence of Down's Syndrome in Europe and perhaps this can be explained by virtue of the fact that many babies are born to older women.  The incidence of Down's Syndrome occurring is in the order of one in 650.  That statistic is high enough but where there is Down's Syndrome in a family that incidence increases to one in 100.</P>
      <P>In itself that is bad enough.  The recent well-researched report by Dr. Sheehan and Professor Hillery mentions that there can be some connection with the radioactive fallout from Windscale.  In the Irish context we have to make a very close examination of the entire project that is going on beside us.  The Minister represents a maritime constituency and I am sure he realises that the sir in Dublin city and county has a very bad level of pollution from high levels of sulphur dioxide, lead in the atmosphere and now the insidious, silent, creeping high level of radioactivity.</P>
      <P>On 7 July last, when I first raised this matter in a midnight debate in this House, I was accused of being alarmist. I was told that in Ireland there was no real cause for concern and that there was nothing to be bothered about because effluent emissions into the air and sea were within the levels of EEC strictures. I do not accept that and in view of the fact that more attention is being given to this most serious problem &mdash; I know the Minister is sympathetic &mdash; we have an opportunity now of doing something practical about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put to the Minister some practical suggestions that he can take in his Department.  In order to maintain the momentum of public attention that has been focused on this matter, I should like him immediately to organise a delegation to go to Windscale.  I should like to see that an all-party mission and also consisting of experts from the Department.  In <Col N="2899" /> this way there could be an on-the-spot, fact-finding mission, where people could see with their own eyes what was happening instead of just reading about it or listening to reports about it.  For far too long we have blandly accepted British assurances &mdash; I might add vested interests &mdash; on that awful cesspit across the water. I make no apology for my unambiguous fellings on the matter: I think the plant should be closed down.  However, if that cannot be done, at least we should exert the maximum pressure.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion would be that within the Department the Minister should set up a research unit to monitor, examine and study the long-term effects of low-level radiation.  This is a matter that is being put to one side, without realising the awful long-term effects it could have, either in the matter of genetic defects, mutations, or mongoloid chidren. Just to speak about Down's Syndrome alone is only a part of the problem. We can also think of other blood diseases such as leukaemia which have been chronicled in other countries that are in close proximity to plants emitting radioactivity. There is the case of the Hebrides off Scotland where a great increase in leukaemia was attributed to a flow of tide from the proximity of the Windscale project. We also have reports of many nuclear submarines going through the Irish Sea.  There is a constant build-up of radioactivity in that area.</P>
    <P>As the Minister realises, plutonium is absorbed directly into the bone, another aspect of a disease that can come from radioactivity levels.  The brief reference that the Minister realised the Windscale project was discussed at the summit meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister will not do.  We have to highlight the whole question by getting down to practical action.  I put those suggestions to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that there is very little preparedness for any type of major calamity which might occur as a result of another fire at Windscale or some kind of major nuclear accident or explosion.  I do not know how the Irish nation would perform in such an event.  The most <Col N="2900" /> recent example of panic occurred during the big freeze-up two years ago when people literally fought one another for food.  There is no psychological awareness of how we would cope with any type of accident which would involve an increase in radiation levels.  The nation is not addressing itself in a practical way to this problem.  People ask what could be done about it if a major accident occurred.  The Minister's Department could engage in a campaign to alert people as to what they could do to help themselves in such a situation.</P>
    <P>The authorities at Windscale have given assurances that there has been a reduction in levels of radioactivity since 1974.  The main emphasis of my contribution relates to the long-term effect of the emission of radiation.  Any doctors to whom I have spoken about this matter during the past week have told me that this is a major worry.  There is no knowing what the long-term effect will be and very little research is being done in this area. It is true that monitoring is taking place and there are strictures within the EEC but this is not enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a difficult portfolio and I realise he has the best interests of our citizens at heart.  We see how people in England are reacting to the arrival of Cruise missiles.  People are arriving at the House of Commons with samples of mud from Windscale.  They are becoming more aware of the enormity of the problem. They may feel helpless and feel there is nothing they can do, but Parliaments can take some firm action on these matters.  The public will not allow us simply to talk about the problem.  Reactive politics will no longer do.  There must be a positive approach involving action now.</P>
    <P>The Minister may admit in his reply that he could be faced next week or next month with reports of the incidence of Down's Syndrome or some type of cancer attributable to radioactive pollution coming directly from England to this island by tidal flow or wind change.  Perhaps the Minister will say whether he intends to organise in his Department a delegation which could go to England to study these matters at first hand.  How many officials of his Department have travelled to <Col N="2901" /> Windscale and are familiar with the emissions from that area?  I know this has been the province of the Nuclear Energy Board but I am speaking purely in regard to health matters, not in regard to the establishment of a nuclear reactor or a service to register radioactivity.  There should be a research unit within the Department to look into the whole question of associated diseases caused by radioactive fallout or contamination of any kind.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of increasing public awareness of the lack of preparedness. I do not want to involve this nation in any major cost but the immense cost of a lack of preparedness would be too awful to measure in terms of money. It would cost very little to give effect to the suggestions I have made.  Many of us who are interested in this matter would be quite prepared to pay our own expenses in going to Windscale to see exactly what is going on there.  I am far from satisfied about it.  The problem will only get worse as years go on.  The initiative now lies with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred in my written reply today to the recent edition of the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of 12 November, 1983, Volume 287.  It contains a report on a cluster of births of Down's Syndrome babies and I indicated that a link between the births and a fire which occurred at Windscale in 1957 had not been established.  The possibility that there was such a link was suggested by the authors of the report, one of whom I have met.  The report stated:</P>
      <P>We are left with a nagging doubt that possible exposure to radiation associated with some infection had an adverse influence on the subsequent non-disjunction of chromosome 21 in their six babies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a possibility that the cluster of births was influenced by some other unknown indirect factor such as a virus infection.  As the authors of the report stated, we are dealing with a hypothesis at this stage and it will require further research and investigation.  In order to <Col N="2902" /> examine the matter further, I have asked the Radiation Advisory Committee of the Nuclear Energy Board, a specialist sub-committee which advises me on medical aspects of radiation, to consider the report and to let me have their views as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>My Department have also requested the directors of Community Care in the health board areas on the east coast to review the situation in their areas and to establish whether or not similar incidents have occurred.  As the Deputy is aware, the Nuclear Energy Board have also been asked by the Minister for Industry and Energy to make a further report on the current emissions from Windscale.  Having regard to the forthcoming review by the UK authorities of authorised discharges from Windscale, it is intended to make specific points to the British, based on this report.  In my contacts with my counterpart in the UK, I will raise a number of issues, including this report.  Meanwhile, I am waiting for the two reports which I sought, namely, that of the Radiation Advisory Committee of the Nuclear Energy Board and the directors of Community Care.  In the light of these reports any further necessary research will be undertaken to establish the validity of the hypothesis and whether a public health risk exists which could be associated with radiation or virus infection or a combination of both.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that these matters will be examined with expediency &mdash; I make the point that the report was published on 12 November &mdash; and that relevant research bodies here will be involved, where appropriate, to establish the factual situation relevant to this hypothesis.  As I have already mentioned, I have been in touch with the directors of Community Care in relation to this report.  Through the system which they operate I can assure the House that from an epidemiological point of view facilities exist to further investigate any possible similar circumstances which may come to light.</P>
    <P>In so far as the general monitoring of radiation is concerned, I have shared the Deputy's concern for many, many years. The House will be aware that this is the <Col N="2903" /> responsibility of the Nuclear Energy Board and they have made arrangements for regular monitoring of levels of radiation within the country and in the surrounding seas.  There is also a Radiation Advisory Committee within the Nuclear Energy Board which advises on the medical aspects of levels of radiation and of any possible consequences of these levels. To date, based on the information available, it is clear that the levels of radiation reported do not constitute a hazard to the health of the people of this country.  They are well within the limits which have been set out by the International Commission on Radiological Protection and in a directive of the European Economic Community.  The board will be continuing their constant monitoring of the situation and I shall be keeping in close touch with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to ensure that the position continues to be examined.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the point which the Deputy raised this evening.  My colleagues in Government and I are very concerned about the possible effects of dumping of nuclear waste and of discharge of nuclear waste into the Irish Sea. It is imperative that we keep in touch on a regular basis with the authorities in the UK and with international authorities generally so that we can contribute, in so far as we can, to any agreements which may be reached to reduce to the maximum possible extent the levels of radioactivity occuring in our environment, especially in the seas which surround us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2904" /> I assure the House that the capacity exists within the health services to fully investigate the validity of the hypothesis which has been put forward.  I am assured that in my efforts to fully investigate the situation I will have the advice and assistance of the research workers and the various Government bodies which are concerned with the possible effects of radiation on the general public health.</P>
    <P>Regarding the possibility of a deputation from within the particular area referred to, the report relates extensively to the North Eastern Health Board area and if that health board wishes to organise a deputation to review the situation they are free to do so.  However, I intend, in the normal inter-governmental exchange of contact, to seek further information on the current position regarding Windscale.  The Deputy will be made aware of any information of consequence which we receive.  My colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister or Industry and Energy and I will co-ordinate our activities, as we now do, to ensure that the issues correctly raised by the Deputy will have full Government attention.</P>

    <P>It is my intention to make known Ireland's continuing concern in these matters to the British authorities through bilateral communication following further consultation with other Government Departments concerned and this matter is being pursued at the highest level.  As the question of control of radioactive wastes is being discussed already in several international fora as referred to above I do not see that concentration of efforts in getting another international <Col N="2773" /> body established would be the most productive course.</P>

The taxpayer indicated last August that she has taken up new employment and, therefore, the making of any further tax refund to her in respect of the current year is a matter for the present employer.</P>

      <P>I have seen the report in question.  It must be stressed that a link between the births and the nuclear accident at Windscale has not been established.  The possibility that there was such a link has been suggested; so also was the possibility that the cluster of births was influenced by some other unknown interacting factor such as a virus infection.  I understand that the authors of the report are continuing their investigations.</P>
      <P>I am also keeping in touch with my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Energy, about the general question of radiation hazards arising from the operations at Windscale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if a person (details supplied) in County Roscommon is eligible under his social insurance contributions for dental services including the provision of dentures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to qualify for dental benefit claimants must satisfy certain statutory contribution conditions one of which requires persons over 21 years of age to have not less than 26 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  The person concerned claimed dental benefit on 30 May 1983 and again on 19 September 1983.</P>
      <P>The governing contribution year for claims in respect of treatment in 1983 is 1981-82 (6 April 1981 to 5 April 1982). According to the records of the Department the person concerned had only 21 weeks of insurable employment in that period and therefore his claims could not be approved.  Both the claimant and his dentist were notified of the position on 16 June 1983 and again on 3 October 1983.</P>
      <P>The governing contribution year will change to 1982-83 (6 April 1982 to 5 April 1983) with effect from 2 January 1984. According to the records of the Department the claimant had 52 weeks of insurable employment in that year.  He will, therefore, be entitled to benefit, including the relevant contribution in the case of dentures, in respect of any dental treatment obtained on and after 2 January 1984.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned is a landholder and an applicant for unemployment benefit from 6 October 1983. He did not satisfy the contribution condition of having 78 paid contributions in a 3-year period and his case was referred to a social welfare officer to investigate <Col N="2790" /> his income from his holding.  His income was subsequently assessed as being in excess of £2.00 a day and accordingly his unemployment benefit claim was disallowed.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance and arrangements have been made for an oral hearing of his case by an appeals officer.  His entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the appeals officer's decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The old age pension claim of the person concerned has been investigated and referred to the local pension committee for decision.  Payment of pension at the weekly rate of £32.60 plus £3.00 living alone allowance from 15 August 1983 has been recommended by the social welfare officer.  This is the rate of pension appropriate to the assessment of his means consisting of the weekly value of a holding and capital.</P>
      <P>Pension books payable from 25 November 1983 have been issued to the pensioner and the arrears due in respect of the period 15 August 1983-18 November 1983 are being issued separately.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the estimated cost in 1984 of each improvement to bring women's social security into line with the EEC Directive of December 1978 as outlined in Parliamentary Question No. 423 of Wednesday, 2 November 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost during 1984 of granting equal treatment to men and women in matters of social security in accordance with the EEC Directive would depend on the nature of the proposals for granting equality and the date in 1984 from which they were introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to personal rates of benefit the matter is relatively straightforward and the cost of giving married women the same entitlements as other categories <Col N="2791" /> would be in the region of £15 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>In relation to increases in respect of dependants, however, the issue is more complex and there are a number of possibilities for dealing with the problem. Proposals in the matter are at present before the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was awarded disability benefit from 22 October 1983, the fourth day of certified incapacity, and has been paid benefit at the rate of £30.60 a week to the date of the latest medical certificate received.</P>
      <P>It was indicated in a completed claim form received on 28 October that the incapacity resulted from an injury sustained at work.  Further inquiries regarding details of the injury are being made in order to determine whether occupational injury benefit is payable in respect of the claim.

      <P>The person concerned was disallowed payment of disability benefit from 9 December 1982 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work. He appealed against the disallowance and in this connection he was examined on 8 March 1983 by a different medical referee who also decided that he was capable of work.  His case was then referred to an appeals officer who upheld the decision to disallow payment of benefit from 9 December 1982.</P>
      <P>Following the receipt of new medical evidence the appeals officer reviewed the case on 25 October 1983 and revised his earlier decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the claimant's case was under review however he was in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Accordingly a cheque for the arrears of disability benefit payable to 15 March 1983, when he was certified fit for work by his own doctor, less the amount of unemployment <Col N="2794" /> assistance already paid for the period, was issued on 15 November 1983.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means, derived from profits from his holding, exceeded the statutory limit with effect from 1 June 1983.</P>
      <P>However he applied for a re-investigation of his means and his case was referred to a social welfare officer for inquiries.
