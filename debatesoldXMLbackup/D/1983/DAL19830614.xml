    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will introduce legislation to assign exclusive and over-all responsibility for all aspects of the food industry to a Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hegarty, Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, has had assigned to him as a major part of his duties a general oversight of the food processing industry in-so-far as that forms part of the functional responsibility of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, if one were to ask any Deputy in this House to name the person responsible for the over-all food industry, I do not think the Deputy would be able to give the answer.  The Taoiseach's reply is very unsatisfactory.  Does he accept that there is a serious crisis in the food industry in general and that there is involved much more than the food processing industry?  What action is the Taoiseach taking in order to resolve the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1228" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there are many problems facing our food processing industry and that during a period of 30 years, despite many suggestions, proposals and reports, inadequate action has been taken to organise this industry properly. We are talking about an important area and one to which this Government will direct their attention during their period in office.  Regarding the other aspect of the question raised, there are problems of co-ordination between the Department of Industry and Energy on the one side and the Department of Agriculture on the other.  We will be directing our attention to these problems also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>By this reply the Taoiseach has indicated the real problem, which is lack of leadership.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that the ineptitude on the part of his Government in regard to recognising the two main factors concerning the food industry &mdash; the vast potential for job creation in a good strong and well-developed food industry and the great potential for reducing our balance of payments deficit by way of reducing the vast amounts of food imports to our country each week &mdash; has led to the crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Taoiseach intend doing in regard to exploiting this potential?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the substantive points made by the Deputy. They are points that I made yesterday during a speech in County Wexford. However, the charge of ineptitude is one that can hardly be levied against our Government since the present state of the food industry obviously owes a lot to the way in which the affairs of the country <Col N="1229" /> generally were handled during the period after 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to the appointment of a Minister of State responsible for all aspects of the food industry, not just the processing side.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the crisis facing the horticultural sector and would he consider giving specific responsibility for that sector?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Chair sees it, the question suggests that a Minister be given responsibility for the entire food industry but the Deputy is now breaking that down to mean a Minister responsible for a separate section.  We could go on <i>ad infinitum.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from previous replies by the Taoiseach that the problem between him and the Leader of Fianna Fáil concerned the terms of reference. Am I to take it that the terms of reference which were supplied to me in recent weeks are now to be changed and are open to negotiation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that it should be asked because a specific promise has been made by the Government which has not been fulfilled.  To my way of looking at it, they are allowing the main Opposition party to veto the setting up of a committee on marital breakdown.</P>

      <P>I have replied.  The Deputy asked the same question some time ago and I pointed out that in view of the delay it may be necessary to look again at the deadline for the end of the year.  That is a matter I am also prepared to discuss with the Leader of the Opposition.</P>

    <P>Note:</P>
    <P>(1)  A new series, commencing with 1975, was introduced in 1980.  The series derived basically from the 1975, 1977 and 1979 Labour Force Surveys and trend indicators were used to interpolate the 1976 and 1978 figures.  The results of an analysis of a five per cent sample of 1981 Census of Population returns were adjusted to allow as far as possible for differences between Census and Labour Force Survey methodology and used in conjunction with available indicators to prepare comparable 1981 estimates.  Trend indicators were then used to interpolate the 1980 figures and provide estimates for 1982.</P>
    <P>(2)  The 1980-82 estimates are provisional pending the final results of the 1981 Census of Population and the results of the 1983 Labour Force Survey which is presently being undertaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will introduce a system whereby antibiotics are only available to farmers to be administered to farm animals upon the use of such antibiotics first being sanctioned and prescribed by a veterinary practitioner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 13, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Antibiotics are used in animal husbandary for therapeutic purposes and properly administered can be an effective means of controlling disease.  Their misuse may, however, result in residues in food which could have implications from a human health point of view.  These residues could arise particularly from failure to observe the correct periods for non-marketing of milk after treatment of cows for mastitis or from failure to observe <Col N="1241" /> correct withdrawal periods before the slaughter of animals to which antibiotics have been administered.  This is an area where legislative controls are lacking at present and my Department have already initiated discussions with the interests involved about the possible regulation of the use, application, distribution and monitoring of antibiotic substances.  The question of making antibiotics available only on veterinary prescription will also be examined in this context.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health recently introduced regulations under the Poisons Act, 1961, which have the effect of confining the retail sale of antibiotics to pharmacies and to other licensed outlets that have available the services of pharmacists or veterinary surgeons.  In addition, the EEC has adopted two directives laying down conditions and standards for the manufacture of veterinary medicines, including antibiotics, and requiring member states to introduce before November next a system of assessing such products. The EEC Commission has also put forward a proposal for a directive relating to antibiotic residues in fresh meat.  This would lay down a uniform system for the examination for residues of antibiotics, the frequency of sampling, permissible tolerances and measures to be taken if the tolerances are exceeded.  My Department are actively involved in the examination of this proposal in Brussels.</P>
    <P>In relation to milk and milk products, penalties, varying from price reductions to the withdrawal of supply contracts, are applied by the co-operative creameries to milk found to contain antibiotic residues. As a result there is no recent evidence of residues in butter and cheese whilst any levels found in milk powder are so low as not to constitute a public health hazard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his statement that it is intended to legislate in this area.  Will he confirm that in the context of any legislation there will be a uniform system of testing meat slaughtered and available for domestic consumption?  Does he agree that all meat slaughtered for domestic consumption in not subject to the same stringent <Col N="1242" /> testing as meat slaughtered for export? Does he agree that that is unsatisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not altogether agree. There are what I consider reasonably adequate controls.  There is the Animal Remedies Act which provides for the proper labelling of animal remedies and antibiotics and there is the 1974 Animal Remedies Act which prohibits the sale of certain chemicals except under licence by the Minister for Agriculture.  Under national and EEC provisions only certain antibiotics may be incorporated in animal feeding stuffs.  Indeed, in Ireland we are much more stringent than in other EEC countries.  In the North of Ireland antibiotics may be used in poultry rearing whereas we do not allow such antibiotics to be used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister. These are inflamatory type questions and they only do us harm as an agricultural nation.  We export fresh food but we are confronted with statements in daily newspapers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate when he anticipates the directive will be finalised which will introduce uniformity into the testing of meat for domestic consumption and for export?  When does he anticipate legislation will be introduced in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that as a result of the public alarm created by the Galway city analyst which indicated that 75 per cent of bulk milk intended for consumption in that area was found to have antibiotic residue, there is a need to introduce urgently stringent control in relation to the testing of milk for consumption? Will the Minister communicate with his colleague, the Minister for Health, in this regard?  Such controls should be the same as those available for milk in use as a dairy product where there is no similar difficulty.  Will the Minister confirm that under investigations conducted by his Department in October of last year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is wise to communicate with the agricultural industry and those involved in farming but I urge him to get Deputy Shatter off his back and off the backs of farmers. After the speech by the Taoiseach yesterday the Minister of State should see to it that Deputy Shatter gets an invitation to the Taoiseach's office to be briefed on agriculture.  Last week he was concerned about hares and I wonder what it will be next week.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West)</i>, <b>Mr. Kitt</b> and <b>Mr. H. Byrne</b> asked the Minister for Agriculture his plans on the question of controls on the use of non-pure bred bulls for breeding purposes as a result of the discontinuation of the licensing <Col N="1246" /> scheme as operated under the Livestock Breeding Act, 1925.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> In view of the Minister's reply I should like to know if there has been a rethink in the Department with regard to the licensing of bulls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to discontinue licensing was taken by the previous administration.  That decision was endorsed by the Government.  The cost of bull licensing was more than £106,000 last year and receipts from licences amounted to only £4,000.  Apart from the cost consideration an existing EEC directive on pure-bred cattle is expected to come into full operation in January 1986. This directive will lay down criteria for registration of animals in herd books thus controlling the standards of pure-bred bulls and ensuring that standards are maintained.  The directive does not, however, cover the use of cross-bred bulls, or, as they are called, scrub bulls.  The question of control on the use of such bulls for breeding purposes is being examined at present.  The prohibition on the use of cross-bred bulls for breeding purposes would entail the enactment of new legislation and its enforcement would involve considerable cost to the Exchequer.  It may be that a programme of education and publicity to encourage the use of good quality bulls would be more effective than such legislation.  I should like to inform the Deputy that this is the only country in the world that has this problem.</P>

      <P>We are having meetings <Col N="1247" /> with representatives of pedigree breeders who have put forward some suggestions. I should like to tell the Deputy that they are in favour of the reintroduction of licensing.  I am concerned, looking at the quality of our animals for export, about this matter.  Apparently, it is difficult, even with licensing, to deal with this matter. The use of the hybrid bull for mopping-up operations where AI is used has been a problem.  One suggestion that has been made &mdash; it would be difficult to implement &mdash; is the linking of the identification of the sire with calf premium payments and that is being looked at.</P>

      <P>All cattle identification ear tags used in connection with State schemes in 1982 were imported.  Suitable ear tags have been sought from Irish manufacturers over the years but up to 1982 none proved satisfactory.  In that year a home-produced tag was approved for use under the bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication schemes but production difficulties encountered by the manufacturer have delayed the introduction of this tag.</P>

      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the form of a tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As regards the disease eradication programme brucellosis eradication has been progressing very satisfactorily with incidence now down to 0.10 per cent of animals. Over the past few years the situation with bovine tuberculosis eradication has been disappointing with TB incidence levels showing an increase at the end of the last round.  Corrective action was taken in June 1982 with an intensive programme of special check tests on herds in high TB incidence areas.  Early results from the present round indicate that this approach was very effective and it has led to a reduction of some 30 per cent in the number of herds locked-up with TB. Alongside the annual round of tests I propose to continue these special check tests in problem areas and I am satisfied that the present strategies on bovine TB and brucellosis eradication will prove effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Admittedly there has been a drop in numbers but in some areas where people have not purchased stock there is a very serious incidence and they cannot get any information from the Department why there is this high incidence in certain areas, particularly in the north Monaghan region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The spread from one farm to another seems to be the main reason, and this has been accepted by the people involved in trying to cure the disease. The transport of animals by people involved in the jobbing trade has caused a great deal of concern because of the lack of care of vehicles going into farmyards and the fact that many of these vehicles carry disease.  A project has been started in Bandon and they have decided through the co-operative and the AI stations to collect all diseased animals in the area.  In my view, the fact that animals were not delivered quickly and that vehicles were not properly washed and cleaned was a cause for the increase in the spread of these diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that getting rid of doubtful animals may have spread the disease?  In many areas where animals were moved from farm to farm we have this incidence of the spread of disease and this has not been satisfactorily explained so far. Badgers or dogs may be involved.  It is time the Department did an in-depth study in those areas where there is a very high incidence of the disease and where it is spreading from farm to farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assured by our veterinary people that an in-depth study is progressing and is having good results. They achieved a great deal in my own area.  In east Cork because of intensive work carried out by the Department, tests and so on, we have the disease under control.</P>

The Department should see to it that they are.  The farming community are told repeatedly that the scheme is costing too much.  A good deal of legislation was introduced years ago in connection with cattle marts.  Many of our trucks are going around like slurry pits and that is how the disease is spreading.</P>

      <P>Yes.  At the moment fairly intensive research is being carried out in parts of the north western counties where the disease is particularly severe.

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will establish who is responsible for the outbreak of tuberculosis infection in the herd of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he is aware that complaints were made on the matter and that now an outbreak has taken place from mixing which is not controlled by a 30-day test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the history of the case to which the Deputy refers.  It is a matter of concern to me that it has not been possible to deal effectively with the disease outbreak in the herd in question because of the herdowner's refusal to allow the necessary retest of his herd to be carried out.  Persistence in this refusal is liable to endanger his entire herd and may also lead to court proceedings.</P>
      <P>Investigations by my Department indicate that the most likely source of bovine TB infection is lateral spread from neighbouring herds.  There are, in fact, a few infected herds in the particular neighbourhood, and it is not possible, therefore, to say precisely where the infection in any of the herds involved originated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Land Commission were devising the scheme which brought about this outbreak through mixing, did they consider livestock health? Are they satisfied that they took the necessary steps to reduce the risk to the neighbouring herd?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The landowner claimed that by increasing the volume of use and the traffic on the right of way, the Land Commission contributed to the problem. The right of way was investigated thoroughly by the Land Commission and they found that the complaint had no merit. They informed him that they had no <Col N="1256" /> responsibility in the matter and that they were not prepared to fence the right of way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether there was an existing right of way prior to the introduction of this scheme?  Was the information supplied by the Land Commission accurate?  In this case I believe the information supplied was inaccurate, and that a mixing which resulted in an outbreak of TB&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an old-established right of way which was the only means of access to both dwelling houses. I want to try to avoid mentioning names. The landowner in question wished the Land Commission to fence the right of way which was already in existence before the allotment scheme was prepared. Having investigated it, the Land Commission said it was not their job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the large number of suck calves being sold from reactor herds in the south of Ireland; and if he will take adequate steps to control this serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The illegal movement of animals out of reactor herds constitutes a serious risk of spreading disease and I would be very concerned if such movement was widespread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, difficult to control the movement of untagged young calves. However, the need to have calves ear-tagged for purposes of the calf premium scheme has served to reduce the problem. My Department seek to maintain close supervision of reactor herds and the position in this regard has been helped <Col N="1257" /> considerably by a reduction of nearly 30 per cent in the number of TB restricted herds in recent months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that he stated earlier that the transport of animals has led to the spread of the disease?  Would he further agree that dairy farmers usually try to sell suck calves as quickly as possible and, therefore, their interest in the £22 calf subsidy scheme would not be very great?  I suggest that the Department should take steps to ensure that all suck calves born in a diseased herd are monitored and are tagged immediately rather than being allowed into the sales yards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, in the past controlled movement of calves from reactor herds was wellnigh impossible, because calves were not tagged until they had their first test.  It was not possible to identify how many calves had been born in any particular herd.  The calf premium scheme has changed that position.  Calves must now be ear-tagged to qualify for the premium. If they move, they must be accompanied by a birth certificate.  consequently, illegal movement of calves is now much less likely.  The possibility of detecting illegal movement is greater, and suspect calves can be traced back to the herd of origin. I agree it is a very real problem.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the facsimile of the letter issued by the officer in charge of housing allocations in Dublin Corporation to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, which appeared in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Press</i>, the officer in charge of housing allocations, Dublin Corporation, specifically states that the name Dillon has been altered to that of Higgins in the certificate and that the alternations appeared to be in the Minister's handwriting?  That is a letter signed by the officer in charge of housing allocations in Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>I suggest it is now incumbent on the Taoiseach to direct the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate this matter fully, to secure statements from the allocations officer in Dublin Corporation, statements from the two doctors who were concerned in the certificate and whose names also appear on the facsimile copy in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Press</i>&mdash; Dr. J. McMahon and Dr. D. O'Sullivan &mdash; and that it is now incumbent on the Taoiseach to have statements taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions from the medical personnel whose certificate was altered and from the housing officer in charge of allocations in Dublin Corporation who issued this letter to his Minister, that that is the minimum duty incumbent on the Taoiseach if he is to preserve a sense of decency and regard for the members of the Government that surround him?</P>

      <P>I want to ask one specific question: both at common law and statute law it is a criminal offence to falsify a document in order to gain a benefit from the public purse.  There is certainly a <i>prima facie</i> case here to justify the case and I would suggest to the Taoiseach that he consider an elementary investigation through his Director of Public Prosecutions to consider the <i>prima facie</i> case that has been made.  I would ask the Taoiseach if he now intends, in view of what I have said here in the House and what has been disclosed, to direct the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate the falsification of a document, that is, a medical certificate furnished in order to gain a definite benefit from the public purse, that is a house from Dublin Corporation?  Is the Taoiseach aware of the seriousness of the falsification and the alterations relating to medical certificates, not just in this sphere but in relation to the falsification of medical certificates in any sphere.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the serious import of what I am now stating to be at least <i>prima facie</i> the case?</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach willing, on foot of a serious consideration of this matter, to ask, as I have advocated, the Director of Public Prosecutions to examine the matter, so clearing the air and establishing what decency and regard there should be with the Irish public for members of his Government?</P>

The change in name at the top of the letter obviously was not intended to falsify anything, as the Deputy can see if he looks at it.</P>

I want to ask the Taoiseach: does he not propose to pursue the investigation further along the lines I have suggested on the basis that a senior officer of Dublin Corporation, in a sensitive post relating to housing allocations, has said that a medical certificate was altered by a Minister of his Government and that the alteration would appear to be in his &mdash; the Minister's &mdash; handwriting?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to extend, for a period of 12 months and subject to an increase in the fees, the special ground rent purchase scheme that is provided by Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, and that would otherwise expire on 31 July next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme was introduced for the benefit of ground rent tenants of dwelling houses who wish to buy out their ground rents.  The declared purpose of the scheme was to bring about the abolition by purchase of existing ground rents on dwelling houses following the enactment <Col N="1368" /> of legislation, earlier in the same year, which in effect prevented the creation of any new ground rents of that kind.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme the Land Registry does the legal work involved &mdash; up to the present for merely nominal fees.  The scheme was given a life of five years from its introduction on 1 August 1978 and this was written into the Act.  That period of five years is now almost spent and up to the present purchases under the scheme total approximately 22,000.  While no one knows just how many ground rents on dwelling houses existed at the time the creation of new rents was stopped, a tentative estimate at that time suggested that there might have been as many as ten times that number of purchases under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Why a bigger proportion of houseowners did not avail themselves of the scheme is largely a matter for conjecture.  The surge of applications which the Land Registry are getting in recent weeks suggests that many people just put the matter on the long finger.  I am also aware that many householders are perfectly happy to hold their homes under long leases and see no advantage in purchasing the fee simple.  Nevertheless, there may be a third and still more important reason.  I think it is beyond doubt that one of the main reasons why the response to the 1978 No. 2 Act purchase scheme was not greater has been the public campaign to induce ground rent tenants of dwelling houses neither to pay their ground rents nor to buy out the ground landlord.  One effect of that campaign seems to have been to create a not-too-clearly formulated expectation, or hope, that houseowners would have their ground rents abolished for them without their having to buy out.  At least this has had the effect of encouraging people to delay their applications.  Some months ago I drew attention to the pending termination of the special purchase scheme and I was careful to say nothing to encourage belief that any such hope or expectation could be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Let me again make plain what has been made plain many times already: if existing ground rents on dwelling houses are to be abolished, either the ground landlord's <Col N="1369" /> property must be confiscated, or he must be bought out.  The Government will not initiate any move towards confiscation: I will deal later on with the reason.  Accordingly, abolition implies purchase and, unless public funds are to foot the bill, the purchaser must be the ground rent tenant himself.  I do not think that it can seriously be suggested that the purchase money should come from public funds and this point, I should add, is not simply a reflection of current efforts to curtail public expenditure.  It would be equally valid in more normal times and equally difficult to justify spending taxpayers' money on such a service rather than on other more pressing social needs. This leaves it up to the ground rent tenant. Nevertheless, these plain issues have been obfuscated and it seems to me that this must be partly to blame for the fact that up to now, at almost the last moment, we have intending purchasers queueing up in the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>What I have said is one of the reasons for introducing this Bill: that is, to give a further opportunity and encouragement to those who genuinely intend to abolish ground rent on their dwelling houses but who for one reason or another have so far failed to take effective action.  The following consideration also has a bearing. It was reasonable to foresee, when some time ago I drew the public's attention to the pending termination of the present Land Registry scheme, that a rush of purchase applications would ensue, as indeed it has.  Properly made applications received before 31 July will of course be dealt with and one consequence of this is that the Land Registry staff must continue to be employed in processing the inevitable arrears after the termination date.  If the arrears turn out to be substantial, that employment may have to continue for a matter of months so that there might be little enough actual saving if the scheme were to be allowed to end on 31 July, as against proposing some extension.  This brings up consideration of the financial aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>The fees that are payable under the scheme are set out both in the 1978 No. <Col N="1370" /> 2 Act itself and also in Regulations made under the Act.  The Act itself prescribes in section 23 the fees that are payable by a purchaser who is in occupation of the relevant dwellinghouse, that is by an owner-occupier.  The regulations prescribe the fees for non-owner-occupiers. The fees were purposely fixed at what, even in the year 1978, were little more than nominal levels.  For an owner-occupier the fee is £5 in a &ldquo;consent&rdquo; case, with an additional fee of £12 if the case has to go to arbitration.  For non-owner-occupiers the corresponding fees are £10 and £20.  These fees do not cover the cost of providing the scheme.  They cover just about one-third of that cost.  Accordingly, the fees had to be looked at when the question arose of providing for some extension of the 1978 purchase scheme. Any extension of the scheme at the present level of fees must clearly be ruled out, if only because changes in money values since 1978 would call for an updating.</P>
    <P>It was never the intention that the subsidy involved in this scheme should continue for longer than five years.  Indeed, there was originally no intention that the purchase scheme itself should be continued in any form for longer than five years.  If the scheme is to be continued at all, the fees must be pitched at a level that, at least in regard to new applications, matches costs.  This implies revised fees for owner-occupiers of £15 on consent and £36 on arbitration as section 2 of the Bill proposes.  Other fees under the scheme, such as for non-owner-occupiers will, it is proposed, be increased correspondingly in regulations.  However, because of the anticipated carry-over in the Land Registry beyond 31 July next of purchase applications made at the present nominal fees, it appears to be inevitable that public funds must continue to bear a part of the cost involved, despite these new fees, perhaps until near the end of 1983 or even later.</P>
    <P>The circumstance that purchase applications made after 31 July will be substantially self-financing may perhaps be taken to raise the inference that the scheme will be continued indefinitely on that basis and that the present proposals <Col N="1371" /> are to be either the first among successive extensions or the forerunner of a permanent extension.  Any such inference would not be correct.  While I do not rule out consideration of changes in the future, I should point out that other factors have a bearing.  In the first place the 1978 scheme was explicitly introduced to bring about the abolition by purchase of ground rents on dwellinghouses.  It may or may not substantially bring about that abolition during the period of extension that is proposed.  Whether it does or does not, however, the very origin of the scheme would argue against its permanence rather than for it.</P>
    <P>In the second place the size of the public sector is already a matter for national concern and the need to control and where possible reduce numbers in the public service again argues against a further permanent purchase scheme beyond the 1967 Act scheme even if it is self-financing.  In the third place, any proposal for a permanent Land Registry scheme would involve re-examination of the 1978 scheme on a fundamental basis: its strengths, its weaknesses if any, the changes that might be made.  Indeed, I am aware of calls for specific changes in the scheme which would have to be considered if there were any question of having an indefinite scheme.  All in all, those who have any serious intention of buying out the ground rent on their dwellinghouses would be well advised not to count on further legislation beyond the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>It may be well for me to mention that the right to buy out ground rent is something quite distinct from the operation of the purchase scheme we are discussing. That right was originally given by the 1967 Ground Rents Act and, while it has since been extended to cover various new classes of ground rent tenants that were identified from time to time, the purchase scheme provided by the 1967 Act stands and survives the expiration both of the present Land Registry scheme and also of its extension that this Bill proposes.  Of course, under the 1967 Act scheme the purchaser is liable for all the legal costs, provided they are reasonable and necessary, <Col N="1372" /> including the ground landlord's legal costs.  Viewed against that option, the proposals in the Bill might still be taken to represent a bargain for houseowners who wish to abolish their ground rents.</P>
    <P>I have already said that the Government will not initiate confiscation.  In fairly recent times the organisers of the ground rents campaign appear to have come round to admitting that what they were seeking &mdash; that is, abolition of ground rent without compensation to the ground landlord &mdash; did indeed amount to confiscation and would indeed be unconstitutional. They now call for a referendum on a proposal for a constitutional amendment to enable that kind of abolition to be secured by legislation.  This brings me to the final matter I wish to mention: that demand cannot be conceded. The Government cannot concede it, the previous Government could not concede it.  It would be wrong in principle to concede it.  It is not simply a question of a constitutional obstacle to be overcome. It would raise a question of the security of houseowners themselves in the possession of their own properties, were it once conceded that the law could deprive one class of citizens &mdash; ground landlords &mdash; of their property and hand it over to others.  It would be wrong in principle, and I leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  I ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the special purchase scheme which Fianna Fáil introduced in 1978 for dwelling houses for a further year and to increase the charges three-fold, as the Minister has told us here this afternoon. Indeed, I was taken by the whole orientation of the Minister's speech and I was somewhat disappointed in it in that a great deal of what he said was about the onus on the householders and the responsibility of the householders.  There is also an onus and responsibility on the landowner and those who exercise rights under land ownership.  Indeed, it was to facilitate the householders that a scheme was introduced in the first instance.  Let us be quite clear about that.  It was introduced <Col N="1373" /> to facilitate householders and for this reason this would have a bearing on some of the other steps which might be taken at this stage.  The vesting of the fee simple in dwelling houses is provided for in Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978.  All the Minister is doing here is extending this section of the Act for just one further year.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given us all sorts of reasons why he should not allow tenants and householders to be led astray by thinking that the scheme might be there for little longer than a year.  Why should we say that to householders?  The Minister has said that he tried to press people into taking advantage of the scheme up to this date, now up to the expiry of the first five years.  I appreciate that he wanted to encourage as many as possible, as all of us would, to purchase under the existing scheme if they can get reasonable agreements from the landlords.  Part of the difficulty that has arisen is in relation to landlords who will not make reasonable agreements.  You may say that we have arbitration to sort out what is a reasonable agreement, but that is a different situation.  Landlords have come forward and made settlements of three, four, five and six times the value of the ground rent.  There are also landlords who say that they want the ultimate pound of flesh and are not prepared to move unless the matter goes to arbitration. It is not quite as simple as it may have sounded in the Minister's speech. Co-operation from landlords in a practicable commercial way was not always forthcoming.  I know of cases where people have appealed to the landlords who are fairly well at a distance from the situation.  The people who ultimately control the ground rent are not really interested in even responding to correspondence from individuals.  Therefore, it is not all on the side of the householder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1967 Act gave the right to purchase freehold.  This was a very important development.  The 1978 Act then abolished all future ground rents on dwelling houses.  This was a major step, a major improvement.  Mind you, the sky did not fall in since then.  We have had the full <Col N="1374" /> term since 1978 up to this time.  Before that happened all sorts of dire consequences would follow.  Houses would escalate in price and people would not be able to buy them.  All sorts of things were suggested.  They are gone because people wanted them to go, quite rightly, and, of course, house prices settled down to the market price, which is the price that even the Minister himself and his Government use when they come to determine the residential property tax.  Therefore, first and foremost, in 1978 all future ground rents on dwelling houses were abolished and they are gone.</P>
    <P>Another important step taken at that time was the removal of the right of the landlord to evict for non-payment and take possession of the house.  There was great argument about that before it went also, but that went in the 1978 Act and again the sky did not fall.  That major step had very important consequences for the householders.  The third major development in that Act was the introduction of a simple non-expensive purchase scheme to facilitate the buying out without the very heavy legal fees which were current at the time.  The Minister has made quite clear that the charge which was introduced at that time as part of that Act was a nominal charge for merely nominal fees.  The scheme was purposely based on a nominal fee and we contend it should still be based on a nominal fee. That was the principle under which the scheme was introduced.</P>
    <P>We now have the experience of the original scheme and we know a good deal more about it.  We have advanced considerably.  I was aware of the situation in 1976 and 1977 and the arguments which took place at that time.  These arguments have all been passed by because this House was prepared to take action in a case which it believed was genuine.  We now have an opportunity to revise the 1978 Act, but what is the Minister doing?  He is discouraging householders from purchasing by trebling the legal fees.  I know in the short term he will be giving some encouragement by saying there could be a higher fee from 1 July on the expiry of this scheme.  However, <Col N="1375" /> trebling legal fees is a positive discouragement to purchase.  That is totally against the principle on which the 1978 Act was introduced and against the principle for which we stand in relation to ground rents.  We should be encouraging the buying out of ground rents.  There is no constitutional problem in relation to trebling the fees.  That is something which will affect everyone immediately when the Bill goes through and the new scheme is introduced.  I am afraid it will have a very serious impact on the purchase of ground rents.  The Minister cannot claim that the Constitution is pushing him in that direction.  He should be committed to the principle of removing as early as possible the ground rents which exist at present.  We are talking about people who have been paying ground rent for 20 or 30 years and perhaps whose families have been paying it for 100 years.  These people should be encouraged and assisted to purchase their ground rent outright.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also indicating his displeasure and lack of support for the scheme, which admittedly was introduced by Fianna Fáil, by extending it for only one year.  It may well be that he wants to encourage people to avail of the opportunity to purchase within the next year, but when a new scheme like this is introduced it takes time to get off the ground.  For that reason I am not too discouraged by the numbers of people who applied to purchase their ground rent.  I asked a parliamentary question on 23 March 1983 about the number of people who wished to purchase ground rent.  In the year ended 31 July 1979, there were 3,090 applications lodged from people who wished to take the opportunity to gain freehold; in the year ended 31 July 1980 there were 5,181 applications; in 1981 there were 5,838 applications and in 1982 there were 6,128 applications.  In the seven months to 28 February 1983 there were 4,174 applications. If we judged that on an equivalent of 12 months there would be 7,158 applications.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, that figure will increase because of the scheme coming to an end. <Col N="1376" /> However, even taking it as running at the same rate and without any increase, a total of 27,395 householders have lodged applications to purchase under the scheme.  The Minister said that approximately 22,000 people have purchased under this scheme and, obviously, in any of these cases the time to complete the purchase is a little after the time of the application.  In that sense it is satisfactory progress.  There has been a campaign to seek the total abolition of ground rent but some of the landlords have held out for the last penny.  In quite a number of cases this has delayed householders coming forward to make use of the Minister's scheme.  Therefore, those householders should be facilitated rather than discouraged and this scheme should be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>We should also be looking at other aspects of the scheme.  I am slightly concerned at the haste with which it is proposed to end this scheme in one year. The Minister has said, fairly strongly, that there will be no further extension. He said it was never the intention that the subsidy involved in this scheme should continue for longer than five years.  I do not know how the Minister can say that because it was originally a Fianna Fáil Bill and, naturally, anyone introducing such a scheme has to set an initial time limit.  The Minister is now in a position to revise that time limit if he wants to.  We have seen how the five year scheme has worked.  I notice that the Minister is smiling wryly, but I know what Fianna Fáil thought about it in 1978 and there is no point in going back over the arguments.</P>
    <P>We have now seen the operation of the scheme for five years and revision should take into consideration what has happened in between.  That is what we should be basing our policy on now.  Why has the Minister not come forward with any new proposals in relation to the revision of this Act?  He has introduced very limited proposals and it makes one wonder in whose interest he is operating.  Is he operating in the interest of householders?</P>
    <P>If we stick to what the Minister suggests and there is a very strict finishing time after a further year, what is the <Col N="1377" /> position then?  There will be the old situation where there will be a bonanza for the legal profession.  If we take legal fees of about £100 on, say, 300,000 houses that is £30 million for a start.  This was one of the considerations in the first instance and one of the main inhibiting factors when the scheme was introduced initially.  This makes it prohibitive for many people to purchase.  If we extend the scheme for just one year, it will help to perpetuate this feudal system.</P>
    <P>Work has been done by our predecessors in this contentious and difficult constitutional area.  Let us continue that work.  I have mentioned some of the steps taken.  Great fear and trepidation were experienced in taking those steps, not the least of which related to this special scheme which would leave the legal profession, by and large, out of the arrangements.  Let us put an end to ground rents on dwellings as soon as possible. This House of Parliament has already had the courage to prevent the introduction of new ground rents on dwellings since 1978 and that stands now as part of our social order.  We took this stand because ground rents are repugnant to the majority of our people.  The Minister has said that some people are quite happy to continue paying these rents indefinitely and that is true.  However, many who have been paying ground rents for 20 and 30 years believe that they should not have to pay them in the future. They question the right of the ground landlord to exact this payment each year.</P>
    <P>We should see how much further we can go in relation to ground rents at this stage.  The Minister should be positively encouraging householders to purchase and in this connection he should continue the present nominal fees.  The question of reducing the size of the public sector is not at issue.  It was a rather heavy topic to bring into this debate, because very little would be involved and this is a very important matter.  The Minister states:</P>
    <P>In the second place, the size of the public sector is already a matter for national concern and the need to control and, where possible, reduce numbers in the public service again argues <Col N="1378" /> against a further permanent purchase scheme beyond the 1967 Act scheme even if it is self-financing.</P>
    <P>I am sure that reference should be to the 1978 Act scheme.  The burdens falling on the public sector will not be affected very much.  If the Minister, while now giving a further year's extension, is open to extending the scheme for a further year or two, I would agree with that.  However if his intention is to give only one year in which people can avail of the scheme, I would not agree and hope that the Minister will bear that in mind.  While encouraging householders to purchase, the Minister should also be discouraging ground landlords from seeking to exact the ultimate pound of flesh from the householders by demanding the maximum settlement and not being prepared to enter into a reasonable agreement as many landlords have been prepared to do.</P>
    <P>I would prefer the scheme to be extended for at least a further three years but if the Minister will consider this in the years ahead that would be satisfactory. The Minister should get a termination date for all remaining local authority ground rents, preferably within three years.  This would very clearly show the Government's will and the will of this House to bring ground rents to an end. There may be some minor legal complications, in that some controls are built into some local authority tenant purchase houses and some arrangement might be necessary there.  For Dublin County Council, the figures for 1980 show the annual rent payable as £11,000.  There is a lot of collecting on that, apart from anything else.  There is a great burden on the public purse but those figures give the rentals payable and it would be interesting to know the amount actually collected.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation give an estimate of £120,000.  This, of course, concerns householders and does not refer to the very considerable income from the commercial side.  I made some inquiries but have not yet received information on the amount collected last year with regard to householders.  It is unlikely to vary very greatly from the £120,000.  The Dublin <Col N="1379" /> Corporation figure covers 34,400 residential privately built homes.  This includes areas like Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Donaghmede, Priorswood, the Tonlegee area and various other areas around the city where schemes were built by private builders on land owned by Dublin Corporation.  Added to the 34,400, there are 20,380 under the sales scheme for which there is a charge of something like 5p per annum and 6,700 on tenant purchase schemes, giving a total of approximately 63,480 houses involved in that relatively small annual income which, if collected, must constitute a very considerable administrative expense.  I am sure that the situation is somewhat similar for all local authorities around the country.  We should be prepared to set a termination date for all remaining local authority ground rents within three years.  That would mean that a further three years ground rents would be payable and that, after that period, payment would be terminated.</P>
    <P>Anyone who had not paid at that time would owe the ground rent.  That kind of action would indicate the Government's clear commitment to the termination of ground rents.  It does not involve any constitutional question.  The Minister made a great deal of the constitutional issue in his speech, and that is one of the problems which has had to be tackled over the years.  However, such an approach would indicate the Government's concern that ground rents be terminated in the near future and that they would do what they could to ensure the termination of the system which has operated for existing ones which go back before 1978.  The Government should also indicate that it is their intention to examine the termination of existing ground rents on dwellings after a further period even if this necessitates a review of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>If the Government wished they could introduce a special tax on ground rents after a certain period.  After all they introduced a residential property tax.  We should consider the options which are open to us to bring about a termination of the old ground rents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> The Minister mentioned the constitutional question and this needs to be examined in a special way.  Those in receipt of ground rents over the years have, in most instances, been well rewarded for whatever interest they originally had in the property and whatever notional interest they may have retained.  In these circumstances, it must be contrary to social justice and the common good that such people and their successors in title should continue to exact a benefit from the true owners of the property for 99 or 999 years, when nothing further is given in return.  Many of the things which had to be given have been taken away from this right.  The right has been circumscribed in many other ways by the actions of this House.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider providing for the total abolition of ground rents at some specified date, whether five years or whatever, people being liable for the period in between.  It is said such a proposal might be unconstitutional but it could be considered in the context of reconciling rights over property with the principles of social justice and the common good.  If the article in the Constitution which guarantees property rights was to be interpreted so as to prevent the abolition of ground rents without wholesale compensation we should examine that article with a view to amending it. The purpose of such an amendment would be to provide the Oireachtas with a greater degree of discreation and flexibility in controlling property rights in the interest of social justice and the common good.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons for looking at this.  The question of land, its development and use is one in which the absolute right and the way this right is interpreted will have to be looked at.  I know the parties to the Government have made it clear that they plan in the near future to examine this question.  In the context of that examination the exercise of this right could be looked at.  I know the Minister made it clear that the question of compensation should not arise and I agree with him.  I would like to see practical commercial agreement to terminate.  The ground landlord as well as the householder <Col N="1381" /> has had that opportunity for the past five years.  I know of many instances where the ground landlord has refused to make any kind of reasonable agreement. There is also that side as well as the case of householders who are holding out.</P>
    <P>There is general concern about this question of what is happening in relation to it.  The failure of some landlords to make reasonable agreements has led to the appearance in court of 4,500 to 5,000 people.  Of that number 31 have received jail sentences ranging from three to 14 days.  These included sentences imposed on three housewives.  It is not possible for ground landlords to evict people and we did away with that obnoxious situation without all the upsets which were suggested in relation to the Constitution. Now we have the position where landlords can have people committed to jail. At least 31 people have received jail sentences. The ground landlord can exercise these orders at will when he so desires. A number of these cases are in my constituency.</P>
    <P>If we do not have a reasonable approach to this problem we could end up with people refusing to pay anything and the system falling into disrepute.  This would be regrettable.  It would be preferable to have a scheme which would encourage people to purchase and ground landlords to come to reasonable agreements with their tenants.</P>
    <P>There is a loophole which has appeared since the 1978 Act.  A problem has arisen following a Supreme Court decision in settling new ground rents payable if a lease has expired.  The problem relates to determining a new lease or the purchase of the fee simple.  Some landlords have become avaricious in their demands in such circumstances.  This loophole must be closed and it must be done in the context of the present revision.  The Minister must bring forward a suitable amendment at an early date.  I would have preferred to see the Minister put down amendments rather than just have a simple one-year extension and a three-fold increase in the nominal fees.  These nominal fees were intended to encourage all and sundry to purchase the land which is under their own house and so do away <Col N="1382" /> with the system, the termination of which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister is extending the scheme for a further year but I am opposed to the trebling of these fees. They were nominal and consequently these arguments about the burden on the public purse are not tenable.  They should continue to be nominal fees and on that basis people should be encouraged in so far as possible to buy out their ground rents.  I am disappointed also that the Minister has not taken the opportunity of dealing with the important and urgent matter of new ground rents being settled after leases expire.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to direct his attention immediately to the question of the termination of local authority ground rents and to bring forward an appropriate amendment to the Bill.  That is a clear cut situation which does not involve the Constitution. It is a matter that could have been dealt with today without any difficulty but with our full support.  In this respect the homework has not been done.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general question of ground rents in the private sector, the Minister should make it known clearly that we in this House wish to see an end to the ground rent system in respect of domestic dwellings.  In that regard the people concerned should be brought to the table for the purpose of negotiating and agreeing reasonable terms.  The Minister should consider also as a matter of urgency the requirements for terminating the overall ground rent system within a reasonable period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the Government cannot concede and that the previous Government could not concede on this question because to do so would be wrong in principle.  He says that the matter is not simply one of the overcoming of a constitutional obstacle but that it would raise the question of the security of home owners in respect of the position of their properties.  In saying that the Minister does not seem to realise the extraordinary nature of ground rents.  A householder having bought a home is asked for a rent for the duration of the lease on the property and on the expiration <Col N="1383" /> of the lease is asked to hand up the piece of ground together with anything that may have been built on it in the meantime.</P>
      <P>The ground rent system is described as feudal.  It is a rent that has been in existence for centuries, from the time of the Norman conquest and during times when private property rights were absolute and held by a small number of people.  The Minister misrepresents the aims of the combined residents' associations when he says that they are seeking abolition but without compensation being paid.  From the beginning of that campaign it was made clear that the associations were seeking the abolition of ground rents with compensation being paid to agreed parties. There may well be situations in which people who innocently purchased ground rents on the open market would be at risk of loss in the event of ground rents being abolished.  There may be people who invested pension funds and so on in ground rents, but equally there is a clear case to be made that people who for generations have been paying ground rent to landlords are just as likely to be aggrieved and to be entitled to compensation from the landlords as are these other people.  Therefore, the question of the residents' associations seeking abolition without compensation does not arise.</P>
      <P>With perhaps one or two exceptions I am not aware of anybody here who defends ground rents publicly.  Most Deputies in Fianna Fáil as well as most of those who form the Coalition have attacked the ground rents system as being unfair and a relic of the past.  However, the parties in Government have been slow in relation to terminating ground rents.  They have not been as committed to the principle as they seemed to be while in Opposition.</P>
      <P>Various statements have been made by party representatives on this issue.  On 10 November 1982 &mdash; that was just before the general election &mdash; the then General Secretary of Fine Gael, Mr. Finbarr Fitzpatrick, wrote to the Chairman of the Ground Rents Sub Committee as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> ...In the June 81 Programme Fine Gael undertook to see if action could be taken to end ground rents.  Our Minister for Justice began such a review but it was not completed by the time we left office.  We will immediately continue this review on our return to office.</P>
    <P>It is our intention that the Pro-Life Amendment to the Constitution will not be delayed beyond 31st March and I doubt if an amendment on ground rents could be developed and cleared by that time.  However we do intend to proceed urgently with our overall review of the Constitution and we will include the problem of ground rents as an urgent item in this review.</P>
    <P>On the same date Mr. Tony Browne, writing on behalf of Deputy Spring, leader of the Labour Party, wrote to the Chairman of the Ground Rents Sub Committee as follows:</P>
    <P>In response to your letter of the 5th November I can state that the position of the Labour Party on the question of the termination of existing residential Ground Rents is unchanged.  Labour's commitment to termination is reaffirmed in our Election Programme &ldquo;Where Labour Stands&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to indicate a precise timetable for the achievement of this particular policy.  It is clear that the drafting and passage through the Oireachtas of a relevant Constitutional Amendment could occupy some time.</P>
    <P>However, the Labour Party is in full sympathy with your view that the protracted argument about Ground Rents must be brought to a speedy close. What is needed is the clear political will to act and Labour does possess that.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicates clearly that Fine Gael do not have the will to act and whatever will Labour may have in that regard they have not been able to impress it on the Minister for Justice.  The payment of ground rent does not entitle one to any services.  There was a time when there was a right to restrict developments <Col N="1385" /> of one kind or another but all of that has been taken over by way of the Planning Acts.  No service is provided by landlords for the rent they collect.</P>
    <P>The landlord is entitled to recover everything that stands on the grounds for which he is collecting rent once the lease ends, and some examples of that have come to light recently.  An old age pensioner with £40 per week has been asked for £4,000 to renew the lease on a two-bedroomed detached house in which he is living with his wife.  Another person has been asked for £30,000 to buy back the house he has already bought on a mortgage.  A Dublin house owner who bought his home 48 years ago and paid off his mortgage was shocked when his ground landlord, the Earl of Pembroke, offered him a second opportunity to purchase the house and the land on which it stood for £30,000.  These are the kinds of anomalies which exist under the ground rent system.  There is nothing in what the Minister said today to justify such a feudal system.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that to interfere with ground rents and the rights of ground landlords could bring into question the security of houseowners in the possession of their properties.  One would imagine that the law had never made any attempt to restrict the right to private property but this is far from being the case.  The Land Commission have powers in relation to taking over property, as have local authorities.  Even if the Minister is correct in saying that interference with the ground rents system could bring into question the security of houseowners the Constitution should be examined to see where exactly the right to private property begins and ends.  We are told that the section of the Constitution which prevents the abolition of ground rents also prevents us from dealing with land speculation. This is the section which resulted in the rent restriction legislation being struck down by the courts.  People who live in houses which were formerly rent restricted are now facing court cases because landlords are looking for huge increases in rent, the result being that the State is subsidising the landlords because the unfortunate tenants cannot afford the <Col N="1386" /> rents.  This section of the Constitution results in the waste of the State's resources and the misuse of taxpayers' money because millions of pounds are being paid to landlords of private property by way of subsidy.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to argue that because the Constitution is likely to be interpreted in a certain way we should retain the system as it stands. It is high time that the Constitution in relation to private property was examined to eliminate the grave anomalies that exist whereby social justice and the rights of the community are subjected to the rights of the private landlord, the speculator and the ground landlord.</P>
    <P>The campaign on this issue has had a number of notable successes.  It has succeeded in preventing the creation of new ground rents and this is to the credit of the Fianna Fáil Government who introduced this legislation.  The situation whereby people who refused or failed to pay ground rent could be evicted by the ground landlord has also been abolished. It was only through long years of struggle by various people who opposed the system that this was achieved.</P>
    <P>The Minister estimated that there are at least ten times the number of lease holders as there are people who have bought out their ground rents to date and I have no doubt that a sizeable proportion of them will continue to oppose this form of feudal rent.  The fact that people who have recently appeared in court are prepared to go to prison is an indication of the opposition felt by most people to this imposition.</P>
    <P>The only substantial issue remaining is the question of the termination or abolition of existing ground rents, apart from the various anomalies to which I have referred.  People with leases of less than 50 years to run have no right to buy out, even under existing legislation.  It has also been brought to my notice that under the existing Act a person whose fee simple is less than the rateable valuation has no right to buy out.  In one case the fee simple was £8 and the rateable valuation was also £8; the rateable valuation was reduced by 50p to £7.50, the result being that the person concerned was not <Col N="1387" /> allowed under the Act to buy out the fee simple of his property.</P>
    <P>The proposal to extend the scheme for the purchase of ground rents by another 12 months will give some relief but it plays into the hands of the ground landlord. They depend on the worries of householders and the pressures they feel in order to get the best possible price. The failure of the Minister to extend the registration period for at least another five years will enable landlords to put greater pressure on those who up to now have refused to buy out.  As an example, I received a letter from my own ground landlord a few days ago.  The name of the firm is Clonmel Securities Limited.  The letter stated:</P>
    <P>This is the last notice to advise of the opportunity to avail of the special purchase scheme in the present three-year purchase term to buy out your ground rent.  After 31st July, 1983, the cost of buying out your ground rent will be substantially higher &mdash; see attached Government notice.  Also, after 31st July, 1983, the three-year purchase term will not be available.</P>
    <P>Here is a landlord using the situation to put pressure on householders, including me, to buy out their ground rents.  This company are threatening that they will transfer their interest to another company. The letter continues:</P>
    <P>Immediately after 31st July, 1983, all ground rent contracts which have not been bought out will be assigned to a separate limited company.  This new owner will be entitled to enforce payment of the rent assigned to it, including arrears, in the same manner as the present landlord.  Enforcement will be the subject of court proceedings, if necessary.</P>
    <P>That does not have very much effect on me because on a number of times on this issue I have had eviction notices and eviction orders made against me but I still refuse to buy out a ground rent.</P>
    <P>That situation is being allowed to develop because first of all the Minister refused to announce that he would <Col N="1388" /> extend the scheme and when he announced that he would extend it he said he would do so for only one year at treble the registration fee.  In my view the Minister is interfering with the free play of the market which is so beloved of our landlords and which is guaranteed by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>For that reason we have put down two amendments, one to oppose the section increasing the registration fee and the other to extend the availability of registration for a further five years rather than 12 months.  It might be of interest to note who are the ground landlords.  It may be there may be a number of institutions or individuals involved in these rents.  There is a Landowners' Convention.  The directors of the Irish Landowners Convention are the Earl of Meath, the Earl of Ross, the Viscount de Vesci, Lord Fingal, Lord Inchiquin, Lord Powerscourt, one of the Saint Lawrences, Sir Cecil Stafford King-Harman, Major J.W.R. Madden, Colonel J.E.D. Silcox, Captain P.H. Coyle.  They are people who own vast areas of the country.  The Government are paying ground rent to some of them. They are the people the Minister is protecting under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister would do well if he decided to ignore the vast vested interests involved.  We are talking about something in the region of £10 million per year in ground rents.  The Government should ignore those interests and accept the right of the common people of the country and abolish these ground rents.  If the Government introduced a Bill terminating ground rents within 24 months or some such time they would get the unanimous support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion since his appointment that I have had an opportunity to speak in the House on a Bill promoted by the Minister for Justice. I extend my good wishes to him in his onerous and important task.  Because of the dedication he has shown up to now I wish him a happy and rewarding term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the first of these Bills came before the House five or six years ago I spoke on it and forecast that the five years <Col N="1389" /> period was insufficient because many people, for one reason or another, would delay their applications to purchase their ground rents.  This Bill will extend the period by one year and although I welcome the extension I think it would have been much wiser in the circumstances to extend the period by five years, making the entire period one of ten years.  I do not know if the Minister has a firm view on that question but I suggest that he and his advisers should consider what I have been saying.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that there has been a vast number of applications for the purchase of ground rents.  Up to the present, purchases under the scheme have totalled approximately 22,000.  We are all aware that that is only the tip of the iceberg.  I suggest there are many more thousands, possibly between three and four times that number, who want to purchase.  I do not have statistics on the matter and perhaps if the Minister has such statistics in his Department he might let us know.</P>
    <P>I welcome this move but I am suggesting that the period be extended.  I suppose that next year we will have to extend the period once more.  I hope this item will not just be covered in tomorrow morning's newspapers.  I hope the media avail of the opportunity of highlighting the fact that this offer expires on 31 July 1984.  It is desirable that there should be extensive media coverage about the extension of time.  I accept that when the original legislation was introduced in 1978 there was extensive media coverage given to it but although many had good intentions about buying out their ground rent they left it on the long finger.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I was not present for all of Deputy De Rossa's contribution but I noted some of the points he made. Before planning laws were introduced the ground rent system proved advantageous because of the covenants inserted in leases.  It was always desirable that in housing estates people should be prevented from creating nuisances such as starting a forge, a garage or a factory and under covenants in leases ground landlords had the power to stop tenants carrying <Col N="1390" /> on any business in their houses. This meant that residential areas were protected and that the occupants of houses were confined in the use they could make of their premises.  If any lessee was in breach of that covenant the ground landlord could take action against him.  However, now that we have our planning laws the only valid reason for the retention of ground rents has gone. Local authorities and An Bord Pleanála now deal with planning matters and as a result the necessity for covenants in ground rent leases does not arise.  In fact, our planning laws ensure that residents do not ruin their localities by establishing a business.</P>
    <P>The view has been expressed that ground leases should be compulsorily acquired without the owners being compensated. It has been said that the Minister should introduce legislation under which he could by the stroke of a pen eliminate ground rents totally.  It may be unpopular for me to say that most of the ground rents were lawfully established and that it would be unfair in many instances for the Government to compulsorily acquire them.  In some cases ground rents were purchased lawfully for investment purposes with the intention of getting a fixed income for a family. Legally binding contracts were made and for that reason an interference by the State would not be justified.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of one's view about ground rents the State must be seen to be fair and it would not be justified in acting in an arbitrary fashion in regard to the abolition of them.  I exhort those who have not bought out their ground rents to do so as soon as possible.  People now have a reasonable way of purchasing their ground rent.  The cost is not excessive and we should encourage everybody concerned to avail of the extension of time. The method of purchasing the ground rent is relatively simple involving the submission of an application to the Land Registry.  As I said, some people may not read tomorrow's paper, listen to the radio or watch television tonight and they may not realise that this further time extension has been granted.  The Minister should circulate this information to all <Col N="1391" /> the local authorities so that public representatives will have the opportunity of bringing it to everybody's attention, and if it is discussed at local meetings it will be highlighted in provincial papers.  The Minister might also consider placing advertisements in some local provincial papers.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for proving the title is in order rests with the landlord and the tenant obtains the certificate.  The scheme as drafted has been well prepared and is working well.  The Minister mentioned the numbers employed in the Land Registry.  How many staff are in that office?  How are they coping?  Have they sufficient staff to administer this scheme?  I imagine some titles could be very complicated.  Deputy De Rossa mentioned a number of people and I am sure some large estates are involved and there may be some problems about the titles to these very old estates.</P>

      <P>I can well believe it, and it is very interesting to read through those titles if one has the time.  Some of those titles are very tricky and complicated.  I can visualise some senior officials in the Land Registry spending weeks trying to clear titles, get in touch with the solicitors who lodged the applications and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very worth while and desirable scheme which I heartily endorse and I am pleased the Minister is taking the opportunity to extend it.  The number of cases being dealt with by the Land Registry are immense and the staff have coped very well.  I want to put on the record that as a public representative and a solicitor I have received every courtesy from these officials.  All members of the public who call at this office have always been treated with the highest courtesy.  I would not like to see the Land Registry having to deal with so many cases that they could not deal with them efficiently.  I would not like to see a senior official being transferred from very important matters to deal with this scheme.  Such a move <Col N="1392" /> would be very undesirable.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with these matters in his reply.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the extension of this scheme.  If he had not done so, many thousands &mdash; in the region of 100,000 &mdash; of people would have been very disappointed next August or September when they realised the scheme had expired.  This Bill was originally introduced by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins.  I remember recommending that the scheme should be for ten years, but he went for five, and this Minister is going for six.  I still think my figure of ten years is more realistic. Perhaps the Minister would consider that suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> It is important with the wide-ranging contributions made today to point out what the Bill is doing: it is extending the terms of the 1978 Act for 12 months and increasing the fees.  It is not purporting to deal with a substantive issue.  Only those two aspects of the 1978 Act are being amended.  As Deputy Woods pointed out it was my predecessor in the Fianna Fáil Administration, Deputy Collins, who introduced this legislation. In 1978 there was a commitment by the Fianna Fáil Party in the previous general election to abolish ground rents. On foot of that, this Bill was introduced which does not abolish ground rents <i>per se</i> but enables people to abolish ground rents by purchasing the ground rents.  It does not interfere with the terms of the 1967 Act in so far as one already had the right to purchase ground rents, but what it did was to give more beneficial legal fees to people who were purchasing ground rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1967 Act somebody could purchase a building lease by using a formula which applied a certain amount of capital to the most recent national loan. The amount of money which accrued from that was the formula which gave rise to the purchase of ground rent.  At that time the multiplier was something over 13 times the ground rent, but at present the multiplier is about seven-and-a-half times the ground rent.  As Deputy De <Col N="1393" /> Rossa and others pointed out, the actual arrangements were made between landlords and those seeking to purchase their ground rent.  The 1978 No.2 Act arrangements were far more beneficial than that. Deputy De Rossa is to be congratulated. He got a very good offer to purchase his ground rent for a multiplier of three, if I understood him correctly.  I take it he could purchase his ground rent for something like £60 of £65 on an asset of I do not know what amount.  I presume a private house is worth a certain amount even in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The net issue arises from what Deputy De Rossa said, that if we are to compensate landlords &mdash; and he said the intention of any campaign for the abolition of ground rent would involve compensation &mdash; surely he does not expect the taxpayer to contribute the £60 to £70 to allow him the fee simple of a private asset when the scheme is available to himself to purchase?</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods talked about the initial period of five years and said it was some kind of trial period to see what would happen during the five years of the scheme.  Of course it was not.  The idea was that if one were to abolish ground rent by purchase, it had to be a temporary period rather than a permanent period. A permanent special purchase scheme to secure the abolition of ground rent would be a contradiction if it was permanent. Probably one of the reasons why so many people did not avail of the terms of the 1978 scheme was that the period was too long.  Out of an estimated 300,000 tenants who were in a position to avail of this scheme, to date only 22,000 have availed of it.</P>
    <P>Since my announcement that the scheme was terminating on 31 July of this year there has been a large influx of applications to the Land Registry.  I presume that will continue now that the Bill is before the House.  Any application properly made out and received by the Land Registry before 31 July can benefit from the scheme under the old fees. Anybody who applies after 31 July will have to pay the new fees.  That situation will pertain until 31 July 1984.</P>
    <P>As to the fees themselves, Deputy <Col N="1394" /> Woods made great play of the fact that the fees introduced in 1978 were nominal. The pertinent fee for most purchasers is the £5 fee with consent.  That fee is being increased to £15.  I suggest that £15 in 1983 is as nominal as £5 was in 1978.  It is an attempt to cover the administrative costs of the purchase of the ground rent. There is no great leap in the real value of the fees.  In real terms &mdash; after various Governments in office in between and particularly Fianna Fáil &mdash; £15 is now as nominal as £5 was in 1978.</P>
    <P>Great play was made about the tripling of the fees but we are talking about £15 for the purchase of the ground rent. There is no change whatever in the actual terms of purchase in the 1967 Act.  It is only the Land Registry legal fee which is being changed.  As I pointed out already, the terms of the 1967 Act still apply.  It is also true that landlords are offering terms which are far better than the 1967 Act. The multiplier is now 7½ times the ground rent, whereas Deputy De Rossa is able to purchase his ground rent for a multiplier of three which I suggest is a rather good bargain.</P>
    <P>That brings me to my next point.  This Bill does not favour the householder or the landlord.  Obviously it is a further benefit to the householder to purchase, but it certainly does not favour the landlord. Any ground landlord if he has the asset of a ground rent is only too anxious to sell it as quickly as possible.  They are selling at far below the statutory rate.</P>
    <P>Up to 31 July householders can purchase the ground rent and pay the £5 fee only.  For 12 months after that, they will have to pay a fee of £15 with consent and larger fees where there is no consent. There is equal pressure on the landlord who now wants to sell, especially if he is the holder of the right to collect ground rents which he is unable to collect, which is quite common now in housing estates all over the country, where there is resistance to the payment of ground rent.  Consequently the ground landlord has a notional income from ground rent and in almost all cases he is anxious to sell and get rid of this notional asset which he cannot translate into liquidity.  If he could <Col N="1395" /> sell it, it would become a desirable liquid asset.</P>
    <P>I do not see the balance of advantage lying with the landlord by extending a scheme which favours householders.  It continues the balance of advantage in favour of the householder.  The vast majority of Deputies want to have the balance of advantage in favour of the householder.  In statements inside and outside the House very few people have defended ground rent on private dwelling houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods and Deputy De Rossa talked about constitutional changes. Deputy Woods raised the question of whether the social order and the common good required that some changes might be made in the constitutional right to private property.  I do not know what the Fianna Fáil attitude is on that.  Recently my namesake, Deputy Noonan, who is the spokesman on agriculture, objected to the leasing of land and the Minister for Agriculture debated the issue with him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan did not talk about the social order and the common good when it came to the leasing of land.  There was a rather heated debate on the point. Deputy Woods talked about regulating the ground landlord's income by taxation or by taxing ground rent.  If ground rent accrues to a private individual obviously it is taxed as income.  If it accrues to a company I am sure the company's tax takes care of that.  I do not see what specific taxation measure the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    <P>He also expressed disappointment that issues raised in recent court cases were not dealt with here.  What is being dealt with here is simply a 12 months extension of the existing scheme and an increase in fees.  We will have a separate Bill to deal with the specific points raised in those court cases and some other points as well. The Government have sanctioned proposals and the Bill is being drafted.  It will be introduced when it is drafted.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to the desirability of changing the Constitution.  The net issue, as I understand it, is whether we can confiscate property without taking away rights which people would like to <Col N="1396" /> retain in connection with their own private property and private residences.  If we abolish ground rent and compensate the landlords for the abolition of ground rent, the charge goes on to the taxpayer rather than the householder who is benefiting from the purchase.  It is fairer that this scheme should be extended for a further 12 months and that the householder who will benefit by holding his residence in fee simple should pay the cost himself rather than making it a common charge on the taxpayer.  If it is a common charge on the taxpayer many people who work and pay income tax and all sorts of other taxes and who have no property, no private residences, will be subsidising people who are buying out the ground rent on a private residence. That does not seem fair or equitable to me.  I do not think it is a line the Government will follow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods also asked about the situation of the local authorities.  Section 26 of the 1978 Act which is being amended here deals with the position of the local authorities.  I am not proposing any change whatsoever in that.  While it was interesting to hear the rather philosophical points made by many Deputies, and while the debate was interesting, it ranged outside the simple proposals in this amending Bill.  There is an extension of 12 months and the fees are being increased.  That is all that is involved here.</P>
    <P>I would hope that people would avail of the 12-months extension to purchase out their ground rents, to abolish ground rents by purchase.  If they have a properly completed application form with the Land Registry by 31 July, then their applications will be processed and the old fees only will apply.  However, if they apply after 31 July this year, right up to 31 July next year, the increased fees will apply.</P>
    <P>I might make one final point in reply to Deputy Enright.  He asked how the Land Registry were coping with the situation at present.  Since the announcement that the scheme was terminating there has been an influx of applications. There are some arrears now &mdash; I have not actual figures for the arrears to hand &mdash;<Col N="1397" /> but I understand the time lag is not very significant, that they would be cleared in a number of months even if there were no further applications at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on his approach to this question.  A question has been brought to my attention by a member of the legal profession in my city of Limerick.  I might pose the question this way: what is the position of somebody who is asked by an estate agency to pay ground rent or indeed rent on a property in respect of which no legal entitlement to establishment of title has been made?  For example, if there was a situation in which an estate was so old there was no clear evidence of whether an estate agency was entitled to look for rent or ground rent, what is the position there?  I understand that in a sizeable number of cases such estate agencies might not be legally entitled to exact that. In one particular case in Limerick recently it emerged that an estate went back to 1650.  Could the Minister explain to me what is the situation in that regard? There will be people who will try to avail of the position obtaining between now and the extended period the Minister has brought in and who might like to be satisfied on that score.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 16, to delete &ldquo;six years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;ten years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Our amendment seeks to extend the period over which the £5 land registration fee would apply from five years to ten years.  The Minister seeks to extend it for six years &mdash; in other words, an additional year.</P>
      <P>I have already made the point &mdash; and the Minister sought to refute it in replying to Second Stage &mdash; that by extending it for a mere 12 months the pressure will then be on householders to purchase. The Minister made the point that most landlords are anxious to sell.  The facts are that most landlords are not anxious to sell and those who do try to get the best possible price.  While the maximum amount applicable, when one applies under the Act, is seven-and-a-half times there is a record of landlords who have sought greater amounts than seven-and-a-half times the annual ground rent and they are legally entitled to do so.  It is a question of whether or not the tenant wants to pay it.  The fact that I or any other tenant has managed to get or been offered, as a result of the ACRA campaign, a much lower figure is to the credit of ACRA and not to the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The reason we are seeking to have this fee extended for a further five years is to enable the situation to develop in which ground rents become virtually worthless, which is what they ought to be.  For that reason I am pressing the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The amendment is not acceptable.  It would extend the 1978 purchase scheme, not for 12 months, but for five years.  The 12-month extension of the 1978 purchase <Col N="1399" /> scheme that section 1 proposes is being proposed for two main reasons.  One is to afford another opportunity to buy out under the scheme to those houseowners who genuinely want to terminate their liability to pay ground rent but who have so far failed to act, whether influenced by the ground rents abolition campaign or perhaps some other reason.  The 12-month extension should be quite enough to cater for such persons.  The other reason is that the Land Registry staff concerned with the operation of the purchase scheme are likely to be kept busy for a matter of months in any event dealing with the relatively large and increasing number of purchase applications being made at present.  Since the staff concerned must continue to be employed on that work for some considerable time in any event after 31 July next, there was also a case for postponing the termination date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, these arguments afford no support for an extension of the scheme for a further five years.  If a further five year extension were to be regarded as acceptable there would be no evident ground for refusing an indefinite extension, that is for refusing to make the scheme permanent.  Yet at its very origin this scheme was deemed to be a temporary measure.  It was introduced so as to bring about the abolition by purchase of existing ground rents on dwelling houses and its five-year life was set accordingly. It would now be pointless to say in effect: well, the first five years did not work so let us try another five years.  I would like people to be quite clear about it &mdash; termination of the 1978 purchase scheme does not terminate the right to buy out ground rent.  So that there be no misunderstanding, I shall repeat what I have already explained: the right to buy out ground rent is something quite distinct from the operation of the 1978 scheme. Even if the scheme were to be terminated next month, as it would so terminate apart from the proposals we are now discussing, the right to buy out would remain unaffected.  Ground rent tenants would retain their full entitlement to buy out under the 1967 Ground Rents Act, <Col N="1400" /> although of course they might have to pay more in legal fees under the 1967 Act arrangements.  There is no question of any discontinuation of the right to purchase in 12 months' time.  That right derives from the 1967 Act.  It is just the benefit of the reduced fee which is all that would be affected if and when the scheme terminates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on Second Stage, by and large I would favour an extension for a further three years in line with the general principle on which the five years was given in the first instance.  I accept that by extending it at this stage for one year the Minister is affording people the opportunity to go ahead with purchase and encouraging all concerned to do so at this time or within the next year and a month approximately.  I should like to do anything we could to facilitate that.  I would not like it to be felt that we were trying to discourage householders rather than encouraging them to purchase as soon as possible and, at the same time, to encourage ground landlords to engage in reasonable deals.  I have a good deal of experience of groups who have been involved and I know that a lot of landlords are not prepared to be helpful in this respect.</P>
      <P>I was amused to hear Deputy De Rossa mention the three times because I would regard that as very reasonable and, with the scheme in operation, that is the kind of scale we would be looking for.  I knew immediately that the Minister would latch on to that and bring it back, which he did subsequently.</P>
      <P>For those reasons we are supporting the Minister in extending the period for a further year and we shall see how it goes within that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might take up one or two points with the Minister.  The question of the number of times I have been offered by my benevolent ground landlord arises directly from the fact that over the years I have refused to purchase, as have a number of other <Col N="1401" /> people on the estate on which I live, and have gone to the bother of going to court, being threatened with eviction, prison and so on.  It is not through any great love for us that the landlord offered us the three-year purchase.  Another landlord has pleaded with his ground rent tenants to take them off his hands for nothing.  It is because landlords recognise there is no market for ground rents that these offers are being made.  Because this section is being extended for only one year the value of ground rents will increase. Ground rent landlords see clearly that once this scheme ends or is extended for only one further year the value of their rents will rise on the market.  In the letter I read out the landlord made it quite clear that the offer of three years will end.  He realises that the market value of the rents will rise if this scheme is terminated or is extended for only a further 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the right to buy out arises from the 1967 Act.  I recognise that but I think he should explain that to some ground rent landlords who have sent circulars to people trying to confuse them by saying their right to buy out will end on 31 July.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has said here that is not the case.  By extending this £5 land registration fee for a further five years, landlords will terminate the ground rents themselves because it will not be worth the bother of trying to sell them.</P>
    <P>Question: &ldquo;That the words proposed be deleted stand&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated our position on the section.  We are in favour of anything that will facilitate the purchase of ground rents.  We are supporting the Minister on this section on the ground that he is extending the provision for a further 12 months.  We hope that more sales can be arranged during that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the rate was 13 times the annual ground rent in 1978 and that <Col N="1402" /> this was in the formula of the 1967 Act. He said that the amount is now down to 7½ times.  However, the same income is going to the ground landlord.  The principle of the 1967 Act was that the income would remain the same.  The change does not represent any concession on the part of the ground landlord.  We are maintaining the same position.</P>

With regard to the question of the trial period, the Minister mentioned that 22,000 people had purchased.  From information from his own Department it appears the number is in the region of 27,000 and if one excludes the last few months it is about 24,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposed to this because of the nature of the fee charged. We think that the fee of £5 should remain.  We are very anxious to see householders buying out ground rents and we want to facilitate them in every way possible.  The Minister has made the <Col N="1403" /> point that the fee is as nominal as it was in 1978, presumably applying the rate of inflation to bring it to £15.  My understanding of the inflation rates is that it would bring it to £9 and one might consider that going to £10 and doubling the amount might maintain that relationship. However, trebling the amount is going beyond that.  Initially I thought we should consider doubling the amount.  My party are anxious to facilitate the arrangements and we wish to keep the matter as simple as possible.  We think the amount should remain the same as the existing nominal fee.</P>
      <P>The Minister kept talking about £5. Between 800 and 900 cases come to arbitration each year.  The fee was £5 plus £12.  It will become three times the £5 which makes £15 plus three times £12 which makes £36, giving a total of £51. In terms of any arbitration on the rent to be agreed the amount is increased from £17 to £51 which is much more than the rate of inflation.  That would be a substantial increase in relation to the purchase price of the ground rent.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa has covered the point of ground landlords being anxious to sell at keen prices.  So far that approach has not been too widespread.  Following this debate on these measures and the intentions which we would disclose in relation to them, we want to see an end to these ground rents.  We want to facilitate their purchase in every way possible. We want to keep this nominal fee at £5 and £12 and correspondingly £17 if the two are involved.  We want to see people coming to agreement while this scheme is available.  I will not comment about what may be happening otherwise. Increasing numbers of people are completely disenchanted with the whole situation and are not prepared to pay at all. The numbers who are going to court and are prepared to go to court are increasing. I would like the Minister to keep it at a very simple, nominal fee.  That is why our party are opposed to this section.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla and I have also put down an amendment to the effect that we oppose this section <Col N="1404" /> primarily because we feel it is a breach of a commitment given by a previous administration to the Association of Combined Residents' Associations that the fee would be kept at an nominal level. ACRA and I have always held that those householders who choose to buy out are entitled to do so.  I have never advised anyone that he ought not to buy out.  That is purely a personal decision to be made by every individual householder taking into account his own personal situation. I have not bought out, nor do I intend to do so, but because it is the right of everybody who chooses to do so and because of the commitment given by a previous administration that the registration fee that would be charged would be very nominal, we oppose this section which is seeking to increase that nominal fee.</P>
      <P>I accept that my party are not on the same wavelength as the Minister for Justice in relation to this question of ground rent.  We see it as an anomaly in modern Ireland and a relic of feudal times while the Minister sees it as the right of those who have to hold, regardless of injustice to the common people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A number of issues arise here.  Anybody who wants to avail of the lower fee as in the 1978 Act can do so over the next six weeks.  When the purchase scheme was introduced in 1978 it had a duration of five years and those who availed of it were to benefit from nominal fees. Obviously the express purpose of the nominal fee was to encourage people to purchase within the five years.  That five years will be up on 31 July and anybody who wants to avail of the nominal fees has until 31 July to do so.  After that when this Bill goes through the fees will increase.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Woods pointed out, if we were simply to allow for the consumer price index we would be approximately doubling the fees from £5 to £10 and £17 to £34.  Instead of that we are bringing it up to try to cover the administrative costs involved and that brings it up to three times, £51 and £15, whether it is by consent or by arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second point arises.  It must be one <Col N="1405" /> of the great phenomena of this House and our time to see a coalition between The Workers' Party and the Fianna Fáil Party trying here to make a public charge on administrative fees so that the poor would subsidise the relatively well off. People who own their houses are relatively well off in this society.  People who owned their own houses before 1978 &mdash; who must have done so to be availing of this because there have been no new ground rents since 1978 &mdash; certainly are relatively well off, generally speaking, because their mortgage repayments are low if they are on mortgages at all. Deputy Woods and Deputy De Rossa are proposing here that people in local authority houses who pay tax, people who are unemployed and who pay tax, whether in VAT or in any other form, would subsidise people who want the fee simple on an asset which at a minimum ranges between £30,000 and £40,000 in any of our cities.</P>
    <P>I remember in 1975, 1976 and 1977 in my city ground landlords were offering purchase schemes at four, four-and-a-half and five times the ground rent, depending on how long somebody owned a house.  I am glad that Deputy De Rossa has now an offer to purchase at three times.  The normal ground rent is £15 or £20.  Taken at even five times that amount, five times £15 is £75 plus a fiver which brings it up to £80.  Five times £15 plus £15 which is the new fee equals £90. When somebody who wants the fee simple of an asset worth between £30,000 and £40,000 and can get it at a rate like £90, why should that be a charge on the less well off?  Why should that be a charge on local authority tenants?  Why should that be a charge on the unemployed and on people with large families?  It is ludicrous on the part of the two Deputies and the parties they represent that they are opposing what is a correct administrative charge on this Bill so that the less well off, the poor, should subsidise the relatively wealthy.  I am not accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>I was afraid that after the British general election we would have a rash of this kind of Thatcherism and <Col N="1406" /> right-wing approach to charges.  When the Minister says that an increase in line with inflation would be roughly slightly under £10 in the case of this and that he would recommend trebling instead of leaving it as a nominal charge as it was, he is departing entirely from the principle which he stated at the beginning of his Second Stage speech that under the scheme the Land Registry have done the legal work involved up to the present for merely nominal fees.  This was introduced as a nominal fee for very good reasons. The Minister says that we are talking about the relatively well off.  I ask him to come out with me to Donaghmede, Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Tonlegee and all these estates around the suburbs of Dublin to see the people who he says are relatively well off, who cannot at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I will take the Minister out to part of that area and show him that 26 per cent of these people are unemployed and the Taoiseach and the Minister's colleagues in Cabinet are telling them that not only is it bad, it is going to get worse over the next year.

      <P>We are talking about people's homes.  The building societies are having increasing problems with people who cannot maintain the mortgage repayments on their homes.  These people did not take homes out of the sky. They are paying off substantial mortgages in very difficult circumstances to maintain these homes, and that will be the case particularly over the next year. In these circumstances the continuation of a nominal charge is very reasonable. I would exclude this kind of charge from all the others that we are talking about because it was not introduced as a charge for work done.  It has not existed on that basis up to this time and the Minister in principle is changing the basis on which the charge is made.  That is what we are talking about.  In the event of arbitration he has gone up from £17 to £51, which in the circumstances is a very substantial increase.  The Minister, therefore, is not encouraging people to purchase ground rents.  In that event, as Deputy De Rossa said, people will not bother paying ever again and the Minister will not need to argue then whether there are 250,000, 300,000 or 400,000 people involved.  He does not have room in his jails at present even for serious criminals who should be there and he has made that quite clear. He said that 1,200 prisoners had to be let out last year.

Of course I respect the right of Deputy De Rossa to make his own decision. <Col N="1408" /> We are opposed to the proposed increase by the Minister.  I am also concerned that the Minister is trying to suggest that there will be a substantial charge on the community as a whole as a result of leaving a nominal fee in this case.  The Minister also suggests that we are only dealing with the relatively well off but many of the people we are talking about are not rich and even the combined cost of purchasing at the sort of prices offered would be difficult for many of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to take the Minister for Justice seriously when he talks about taxing the poor in relation to ground rents because ground rent is a tax by the rich on the poor.  I also find it difficult to take that from a member of a Government who have imposed a 1 per cent levy on all incomes, which will be paid largely by those in the PAYE net. The Government have also failed to provide social welfare increases in line with inflation and have taken medical cards from old age pensioners and yet the Minister says we are trying to tax the poor. The vast majority of people who are liable for ground rent are poor and have to earn their living if they are fortunate enough to have a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point earlier that I do not expect the Minister to be on the same wavelength as The Workers' Party on this issue but it misrepresents the position when he talks about getting the fee simple of an asset worth £60,000 for £48.  Most of us who are liable for ground rent are already paying mortgages for the houses we are buying and it is an additional surcharge by a person or group of persons who provide no service for that rent.  If the lease is not bought out or terminated, at the end of the term of the lease the land reverts to the landlord, plus the house on it.  That is the kind of property we are talking about and it is nonsense for the Minister to be talking about the fee simple of an asset worth £60,000.  My house is worth about £25,000 or £30,000. It is a three-bedroomed semi-detached house and the ground rent is £16 per year which is buttons.  Have ground landlords the right to impose a rent on thousands like me for no service, on ground for <Col N="1409" /> which they have already been paid and to which they have no right?  That is the basic principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I am proposing that these fees will cover the administrative costs.  That is the change I am making and to make it a charge on the public purse is simply a euphemism for saying that the taxpayer will pay for it.  People who live in three and four bedroomed detached and semi-detached houses are better off than those who have no houses or people in local authority houses.  Since everybody pays tax, I cannot see how anyone can justify the taxpayers at large subsidising a particular group of taxpayers who at least have their own houses.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): We have <Col N="1410" /> many schemes which organise transfer payments where we are not transferring from the better off to the less well off. Quite frequently we are transferring in straight lines and sometimes transferring upwards rather than downwards.  I cannot see, from an ideological point of view, why Deputy De Rossa's party are adopting their present line when what I am suggesting is reasonable by any standards and involves a very small increase in fees which will be paid by the people to whom the major benefit accrues, that they will have the fee simple of their own property when they purchase.  I cannot see the argument for saying that that should be a charge on the taxpayer, the unemployed, on the person who has no house or the person in a local authority house rather than on the person who is purchasing.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is twofold. Firstly it provides for the setting up of a new appeal court &mdash; to be styled the Courts-Martial Appeal Court &mdash; which will hear appeals against conviction by courts-martial.  It also provides for the introduction of a scheme of free legal aid for accused person in court-martial cases and on appeal.  It is a major reforming Bill insofar as the administration of military law is concerned and I trust that the House will give it its full support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain for the benefit of those who may be unfamiliar with the system of military law in this country that provision does not at present exist in law for an appeal to a higher tribunal by persons <Col N="1414" /> convicted by court-martial.  Such persons may, however, petition the Minister against the findings or against the findings and sentence.  The Minister, where it appears to him that the proceedings of the court-martial were illegal, must quash the findings and may at the same time direct that the accused be tried again. Where it appears to the Minister that the accused was wrongfully convicted he may quash the finding of guilty.  Provision also exists whereby the Minister or the Adjutant-General may mitigate or remit, in whole or in part, punishments awarded by a court-martial.</P>
    <P>Where a petition to the Minister raised a point of law it has been the practice to refer the proceedings of the court-martial and the petition to the Attorney General for his advice as to any action which it might be proper for the Minister to take under the powers vested in him in relation to the quashing of findings and mitigation or remission of sentences.</P>
    <P>The petition procedure stemmed from the deliberations of a committee of legal experts set up by the then Minister for Defence in 1951 in the context of the passage through the Dáil of the Bill which became the Defence Act, 1954.  The terms of reference of the committee were as follows:</P>
    <P>to consider the question whether it is necessary or desirable that a system of appeal from conviction by court-martial should be introduced for the Defence Forces and to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>The committee, having considered various options, were against conferring a right of appeal.  They recommended instead that the rules of procedure to be made under the Defence Act should provide for petitions against any of the findings of a court-martial or against the sentence or against both findings and sentence.  They also recommended the referral of certain petitions to the Attorney General in the circumstances which I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the committee were accepted and were implemented after the Bill became law.</P>
    <P>While I am bound to say that these <Col N="1415" /> arrangements have worked well, and I believe fairly in so far as the petitioner was concerned, developments in constitutional and international law over the years since they were introduced have made it increasingly clear that it would be both prudent and opportune at this point to establish a judicial appeal for persons convicted by courts-martial.</P>
    <P>The proposed Courts-Martial Appeal Court will be constituted in the same way as, and have powers similar to, the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The new court will thus be in a position to avail of the services of the judges who, under existing arrangements, may constitute the Court of Criminal Appeal and also to use the machinery of that court.  The petition arrangements are being phased out and the appeal procedure will be introduced as soon as practicable.  I should, however, mention that the powers of mitigation and remission to which I referred earlier will remain in force.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the appeal arrangements being provided for in the Bill should be made as meaningful as possible.  For this reason I also propose to introduce a scheme of free legal aid for accused persons in court-martial cases and for appeals to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court.  The scheme of legal aid outlined in the Bill is similar to that in operation for accused persons on trial on criminal charges in the civil courts.  It is proposed to apply the same criteria as the civil courts both as regards the type of case in which legal aid would be granted and the assessment of means of the applicant for such aid.  Under the proposed arrangements, therefore, the soldier accused before a court-martial will no longer be at a disadvantage by comparison with persons being tried by the civil courts.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that both the Courts-Martial Appeal Court and, where appropriate, the Supreme Court will have power to grant legal aid.  It is not considered practicable to bestow this power on a court-martial as each court-martial is an <i>ad hoc</i> body composed of military officers which is convened specially to try specific charges and dissolves <Col N="1416" /> after the trial.  Instead provision is being made for the grant of legal aid at courts-martial and, where applicable, at preliminary proceedings, by a prescribed authority who will be a senior military officer with legal qualifications.  The question of legal aid will, therefore, be decided before the commencement of the court-martial, thus avoiding delay or adjournment on this question.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill relating to legal aid are largely self-explanatory and it is unnecessary for me to dwell further on them.  One small point, however, that I should like to mention is that any soldier charged with an offence before court-martial may elect to be represented by an officer subject to military law.  This time-honoured practice is completely free to the soldier and I propose to continue it.</P>
    <P>As many years have elapsed since the House last debated the disciplinary provisions of military law as applied to the Defence Forces it may be helpful if, at this stage, I said something about courts-martial and how they function.</P>
    <P>Courts-martial are the military tribunals provided by law for the trial, by officers of the Defence Forces, of persons accused of offences against military law committed by such persons while subject to military law.  The detail in relation to such offences and in relation to the constitution and procedures of courts-martial is provided in defence legislation, notably the Defence Act, 1954, and rules of procedure made thereunder.</P>
    <P>Courts-martial are of two classes &mdash; limited and general &mdash; the essential difference in the classes being one of jurisdiction. A general court-martial, as the title implies, has jurisdiction to try a person subject to military law for any offence against military law.  The jurisdiction of a limited court-martial is restricted to the trial of non-commissioned personnel and some major offences such as murder are excluded from the jurisdiction.  In this connection I should mention that a court-martial may, in certain circumstances, try a person subject to military law for an offence which is punishable by the ordinary criminal law of the State.  However, no court-martial can try a person <Col N="1417" /> for treason, murder, genocide, manslaughter or rape unless the offence was committed while the person was on active service.</P>
    <P>As to the constitution of courts-martial, they are convened as required by convening authorities &mdash; in practice senior military officers authorised by warrant of the Minister so to act.  For example each general officer commanding a command is so empowered.  The officers who make up the court are appointed by the convening authority.  Each general court-martial consists of not less than five officers &mdash; the president being of the Army rank of colonel or higher, or naval equivalent.  A limited court-martial consists of not less than three officers &mdash; the president being of the Army rank of commandant, or naval equivalent of lieutenant-commander, or higher.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the attendance at each court-martial of a judge-advocate, normally an officer holding the legal qualification of barrister-at-law, whose functions include advice to the court-martial on matters of law, summing up of evidence, the recording of the proceedings of the court-martial and ensuring that the accused is given a fair trial.</P>
    <P>The prosecutor and the person being tried by the court-martial may be represented by counsel, meaning either a barrister-at-law or a solicitor.  Provision is made for evidence to be given on oath and it is also provided that the rules of evidence to be adopted in proceedings before courts-martial shall be the same as those which are followed in civil courts.</P>
    <P>The finding and sentence of a court-martial are not valid unless confirmed by a confirming authority &mdash; an officer authorised by warrant of the Minister so to act.</P>
    <P>A confirming authority may send back the finding and sentence of a court-martial for revision but, in such an event, the authority may not recommend nor shall the court-martial have power to increase the sentence originally awarded.  The confirming authority may confirm or refuse confirmation either in whole or in part of the original or revised finding or sentence.  The confirming authority may <Col N="1418" /> also, when confirming the sentence, mitigate the punishment, remit the punishment in whole or in part or substitute a sentence of any less punishment awardable by a court-martial.</P>
    <P>In arriving at his decision the confirming authority is fortified by the advice of the Judge Advocate-General, a practising barrister-at-law of at least ten years' standing who is not a member of the Defence Forces, whose duties include the furnishing of advice and recommendations on proceedings of courts-martial before the findings and sentence are confirmed by a confirming authority.</P>
    <P>Our system of military law has remained unaltered since the passage of the parent Act in 1954 nearly 30 years ago and while this Bill is proposing major substantive changes, the general <i>corpus</i> of military law needs to be reviewed.  I have commenced this review and look forward to coming to the House in due course to propose whatever amendments are necessary to bring our military law up to date.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the military authorities who have so ably and impartially administered the system of military law down through the years.  I should also say that the military authorities fully support and welcome the present proposals.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the more noteworthy provisions of the Bill.  Sections 5 and 6 amend sections 202 and 203 of the Defence Act, 1954, dealing with findings by courts-martial of unfitness to stand trial by reason of insanity or of guilty but insane.  The arrangements currently provided in those sections are no longer regarded as satisfactory and this opportunity is being taken to revise them.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill provides for the establishment of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, for its constitution, registrar, sittings and procedure and for the right of appeal to it.  Section 14 provides for the right of the convicted person to appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law.  It also provides that where, on a question of law, an appeal is decided in favour of the appellant, the respondent to the appeal may, without prejudice to the decision in favour of the appellant, <Col N="1419" /> refer the question of law to the Supreme Court for determination.  Section 21 provides for the postponement of execution of a sentence of death in the case of an appeal to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court.  Section 22 provides that the authority convening the court-martial shall be empowered to defend the appeal.</P>
    <P>Part III contains the provisions for the granting of legal aid certificates and which are analogous to those pertaining to criminal charges on the civil side.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> I welcome the Bill which as the Minister has said is a reforming measure.  Reforms similar to those proposed have taken place down through the years in respect of the military in most European countries so it is good that we are introducing these reforms now.</P>
      <P>The appeal to the new court will put a soldier on a par with civilians who can appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. It has occurred to me that a more simple way of providing for this appeal procedure would have been to apply the provisions of the existing Court of Criminal Appeal to courts-martial thus avoiding the setting up of a new court.  No doubt this aspect was considered by the Minister so he might let the House know the reason for the proposals before us now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the new court is being modelled on the Court of Criminal Appeal and that the judges and the facilities of that court will be available in the operation of the new establishment. Apart from the obvious advantages of using a well established arrangement as a model, it is clear that the new court will have the effect of giving to a soldier appeals machinery similar to that available to citizens who are not under military law.  It is right for the Minister to refer to the petitions procedure which will be replaced by the new appeal court. It is no harm to recall that as Ministers for Defence, the late General Seán Mac Eoin and the late Oscar Traynor were the architects of the defence legislation we have today.  It could be said also that few if any Bills received such detailed consideration <Col N="1420" /> in this House as the Defence Act of 1954.  This was due largely to the agreement of the House to set up a special committee of the House on the measure. That was a committee which included as members many Deputies who had military service either in the Old IRA or in the emergency forces and who consequently had a particular interest in the legislation.  The establishment of that special committee might be of interest to modern reformers.  In the past year much has been written about the absence of an appeal court in respect of persons convicted by courts-martial.  Some people may fail to appreciate that the subject was considered in detail by this House at meetings of the special committee I have mentioned.  During those deliberations the Minister of the day, the late Mr. Oscar Traynor, presented to the committee the advice of a group of legal experts set up to examine the question of appeals.  That group were against conferring a right of appeal.  It is odd that in view of the other proposal in the present Bill one of the reasons for their so advising was the absence of a system of free legal aid.  In any event, instead of a right of appeal system, the group examined the question of the right of petition to the Minister against the findings and sentencing of courts-martial.  That recommendation was accepted.  The fact that it is regarded now as necessary to change these arrangements should not take from the effectiveness of the petition system as administered by successive Ministers since 1954.</P>
    <P>On that point I am pleased to note that the Minister will retain the powers of mitigation or remission of sentence vested in him under current legislation. Although a soldier has always had the right to be defended at a court-martial by an officer, the lack of legal aid could well have caused distress or hardship.  Therefore, I am pleased that it is proposed to introduce a scheme of free legal aid comparable to that available to persons on trial before the criminal courts.  I urge the Minister to bring in this scheme as soon as possible after the Bill becomes law. The reforms proposed here are very necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Barrett for his acceptance of the Bill and for his co-operation in arranging to have it taken this evening.  He raised a pertinent point when he asked why we should set up a separate appellate system for court-martial appeals instead of using the existing appeal courts system available on the civil side in criminal law.  This matter was considered when the problem was presented to me and when the legislation was being contemplated.  The Government reached the conclusion that the separate <i>corpus</i> of military law and the separate system for the enforcement of military law should be preserved and carried into the appeals system.  It was considered that to merge the two at appeal level could be detrimental to both, This will not lead to difficulties so far as the Judiciary are concerned in terms of finding the personnel or in terms of imposing extra demands on their services because the appeals will be separate and the number of trials by court-martial are comparatively few.  It means also that when an appeal arises from a court-martial there will be possibly a certain element of extra speed about it because it will have a separate and distinct court in which to be heard.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point with regard to the special committee of 1951.  Having read the proceedings of that committee one can appreciate the depth of their work, It was a most comprehensive and analytic debate and it is a great pity that the valuable legislation that emanated from it did not give rise to a committee system on a continuing basis.  It has taken 30 years to realise that greater use has not been made of the committee system.</P>
      <P>I join the Deputy in paying tribute to the late Oscar Traynor and the late Seán Mac Eoin because of the Defence Act, 1954, an Act on which the whole law relating to the Defence Forces is based. The fact that it has stood for so long without any inherent need for change is a tribute to the work they put into its construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for this change arises because there have been changes in constitutional law thinking and in international law with <Col N="1422" /> regard to rights of representation which are part and parcel of the human rights now being protected in an enhanced way both by international tribunals and domestic courts.  It is to keep on a level with that part of international jurisprudence that this Bill has arisen.  I agree with Deputy Barrett that there should not be any delay in implementing the provisions on legal aid and I am glad to be able to tell the Deputy that the regulations to implement legal aid are in draft form and will be considered at the appropriate official level.  It is expected that these regulations will be made formally very shortly after the Bill has become law.</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> I should have made a point on Second Stage.  The Minister said, and the Title implies, that a general court-martial has juisdiction to try persons subject to military law for any offence against military law.  I trust this will not necessarily mean that less important or smaller offences for which there may be a court-martial and a conviction will not be subjects of appeals to the courts.  As I understand it, a court-martial is not called on for trivial offences, only for certain offences.  I am thinking of the courts having to deal with appeals against convictions for minor offences if such offences were sent before a court-martial. We welcome this Bill which means that nobody can regard a soldier as a second class citizen before the law as was the case heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of any offence that comes to be tried before a court-martial the defendant will be entitled to avail of the new appeals machinery whether those offences are offences which are regarded <Col N="1423" /> as part of the ordinary criminal law or offences that might be regarded as being military discipline.  Any offence tried before a court-martial will be appealable to the new Courts-Martial Appeals Court.  There will be a certain number of minor military offences which will be tried now, as before, in a summary fashion by a commanding officer.  They will not be subject to appeals because they will not be court-martial offences.</P>
      <P>In deciding to abolish the present procedure of petitions I was conscious that the petition procedure as it is could act to take out of the system perhaps unworthy or trivial appeals against minor matters. On reflection I thought that when the appeals situation was being introduced it should be unimpeded.</P>

Chuirim fáilte leis an Aire atá tar éis teacht isteach agus beimid ag súil le freagraí nach raibh le fáil ón Aire Stáit nuair a labhair sé i gcoinne na Bille seo seachtain ó shin.</P>
      <P>I welcome the presence of the Minister for this debate and I look forward to getting information from him which was not forthcoming from his Minister of State last week when we addressed questions about this Bill to him.</P>
      <P>My final note last week was to try to tease out the implications of recent Government action, abortive and shortlived though it may have been, to shut down the pirate radio stations.  I suggest that that attempt must be viewed more closely in the context of the statement by the Minister of State here last week.  The main thrust of his criticism, as addressed to the Bill, related to a facility for commercial interest or involvement.  I have read over his statement and analysed it and I am convinced that it was motivated solely on the basis of exposing the Bill as a bad piece of legislation not to be promoted in the House because of what he interpreted to be a slant towards commercial interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> I hope to illustrate that that is not the case.  The degree to which it facilitates an opportunity for commercial interests to apply for or participate in a national network of local radio stations is an element to be commended in the interests of efficiency and the public purse.  The Government are currently preoccupied about the latter.  People must be asking why the Minister has such an obvious fixation with the commercial venture.  It raises a number of questions not least of which relates to the Minister of State's understanding or, perhaps, more correctly, his deliberate misunderstanding of the implications of launching this nationwide network of local radio stations.</P>
    <P>In defence of the action taken by his Department against the pirates the Minister of State cited a number of cases of interference with emergency services, security services and radio and television services throughout the country.  I would be one of the first to agree with him that if such interference exists action should be taken to eliminate it.  The freedom and rights of our people should be preserved and due concern must be shown by the State for the lives of any individual, or group of individuals, that are put at risk.  I do not believe any Member on this side of the House would condone interference where it clearly interferes with the public welfare, if it occurred in this instance.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister of State to an alleged interference by Sunshine Radio with TV reception which prompted a remarkably swift response from RTE in blotting out such interference.  About six weeks ago seven householders in the Donaghies area, Dublin 13, which is in my constituency reported to RTE an interference with the TV signal being supplied by RTE Relays.  RTE is reported to have stated that this was being caused by Sunshine Radio.  One day later I was approached by those householders and asked to make representations on their behalf.  I did not have an opportunity to do so because within hours those people contacted me again to inform me that the RTE services division had assured them that they had <Col N="1426" /> blotted out such interference and all was well.  I did not have an opportunity to pick up a phone to make a complaint before I received the good news which I welcomed.  I was delighted to hear that RTE Relays moved so swiftly.</P>
    <P>The point I am anxious to make is that if the RTE services division were capable of moving with such promptness and efficiency &mdash; I commend them for that &mdash; irrespective of the source of the interference it proves that the facility is available to clear the airwaves.  I am reliably informed by experts who have long experience in radio transmission that such technology and expertise is readily available and is inexpensive.  As recently as last Saturday I was informed that there are small and inexpensive pieces of equipment that can be used to ensure that the airwaves are clear.  They are referred to as measures to ensure purity of the airwaves.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with the technical parlance that goes with this but I am assured by those who have been working on this over the years that the equipment is readily available.  I am suggesting to the Minister that if his actions were motivated in the main in the interests of safety and welfare of the public the departmental technical expertise could just as easily be directed and channelled in that direction.</P>
    <P>I must commend RTE Relays because they give the best service to the public in this city and throughout the country.  Any friends and relations I have spoken to who are fortunate to avail of the services of RTE Relays hold the same view and that is more than can be said for a lot of other relay services.  The Minister of State seemed to have a fixation about the commercial aspect.  I cannot see why he should be preoccupied with the element of commercial involvement.  RTE have some of the finest presenters and broadcasters in the world and their long experience and training has proved invaluable in projecting a good image for the country internationally.  Indeed, it has proved invaluable in maintaining a high standard of broadcasting, something I have appreciated down the years.  The people I spoke to since last Wednesday were not apprehensive about the commercial <Col N="1427" /> involvement or healthy competition that may arise under the proper legislation.  In that regard the Minister's attitude is rather strange.</P>
    <P>A more important aspect is that if there is a total lack of commercial involvement or if there is a facility provided whereby any commercial interest, no matter how large or small, is ineligible to apply then I suggest to the Minister that he will be depending entirely on the energies and resources of communities.  In such instances I suggest that it would be almost inevitable, arising out of the drain that has been imposed on them in recent times, that the Minister will end up with a series of white elephants being propped up by the State.</P>
    <P>In view of the concern this Government have been expressing for non-commercially viable enterprises &mdash; in many cases industrial structures &mdash; and in view of the rapidity with which they saw fit to allow them to fade into oblivion, it strikes me as very strange in this instance that the Minister should rely for the main thrust of his criticism on the commercial aspect.</P>
    <P>In any community project, no matter how small, that a local authority or Government provide, there is always a very definite line of thinking adopted by them to ensure that there is a bit of commercial enterprise about the community. That must be seen to be there before sanction is given for grants or for the allocation of any money.  To say it is wrong to have a commercial element is short-sighted.  I am sorry the Minister of State has not seen fit &mdash; and I hope the Minister in his contribution will see fit &mdash; to tell the House the implications of the Bill he intends to bring forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my apologies for being a little late this evening. I was interested to hear Deputy Fitzgerald's contribution for which I must congratulate him, and I will deal with some of the points he raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When presented with a Bill of this sort it is reasonable to ask whether the Bill is intended as a positive and creative measure <Col N="1428" /> for the future or as a reaction to some existing circumstances.  There is clearly a public interest in, and wish for, local or community broadcasting, and that wish has been evident for many years.  There is also an evident demand for a choice of radio services.  The presentation of this Bill raises a number of questions about the manner in which these demands should be met.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, has already made clear why the Government are opposing this Bill.  It is, quite simply, an unsatisfactory basis for the development of local radio services.  It is brought forward here at this stage only as an act of political opportunism on the part of the opposition.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of this Bill is such that commercial interests would inevitably get an upper hand in the development of local radio services, and there would be little scope for the provision of such services either by non-commercial interests or in areas where the economic viability of services might be in any way marginal or doubtful.</P>
    <P>This point was referred to by Deputy L. Fitzgerald.  I agree that there has to be room for commercial interest in this area, but surely he will not argue, and Deputy Leyden will not continue to argue, that we should ignore the less densely populated and more remote areas because by their nature those areas will be neglected by commercial interests.  It is a very fair and valid point to consider how these areas could be catered for in the context of a Bill providing for the setting-up of local radio.</P>
    <P>There would have to be serious doubt as to whether under the provisions of this Bill local radio services could be provided in the foreseeable future anywhere outside of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and possibly Waterford and Galway.  These main centres of population are the only ones likely to be able to support local radio services which would have to be economically viable under the provisions of this Bill.  Local radio services restricted in this way would not be a reasonable answer to the demands which are evident for such services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We intend to proceed quickly with the <Col N="1429" /> Government's legislation to enable legal local radio services to be set up on an acceptable basis for communities throughout the country.  The Government's Bill will not have the defects of the Bill now before us and will allow the flexibility necessary for the development of services which will meet a very wide range of community needs and interests.</P>
    <P>It is worth repeating that the reason I requested a Minister of State with special responsibility for broadcasting be appointed was to quickly bring forward proper proposals in this regard.  We all remember the infamous attack on that appointment by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Government have now made major policy decisions which will require changes in the approach which was set out in this Bill drafted three years ago. While the Government do envisage a new Authority it is now envisaged that that Authority will not provide and operate the broadcasting transmitters.  There will be room for minority RTE involvement in local radio and I will be consulting the RTE Authority shortly as to the form which this involvement might take.  The structure now proposed is intended to be more flexible and less costly to the State than that set out in the 1981 Bill, which is what is basically before us tonight.  The Government's particular concern is that the local radio services which will be established under their proposals will be community based and will be available throughout the country as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The drafting of this Bill will now proceed as a matter of urgency and we look forward to the co-operation of the Opposition in processing it quickly through the Oireachtas.  I would be hopeful that the Bill can be submitted for consideration to a joint committee on legislation for which the Government have already made separate proposals.  This committee could receive submissions from the many interested persons and bodies who, I am sure, have much to offer on legislation of this type.  I am looking forward therefore also to the co-operation of the Opposition on this committee.</P>
    <P>As further evidence of the Government's determination to provide for the <Col N="1430" /> orderly development of community radio services at the earliest possible date and pending the enactment of the necessary legislation, I will be setting up in the immediate future a Local Broadcasting Committee.  This committee will consider submissions from various interested parties especially youth organisations on their concepts of local radio services and will make such plans of an administrative and technical nature as are feasible.  I see these steps as facilitating the speediest possible introduction of legal local radio after the enactment of legislation.  I intend that this committee will do all the preliminary work so that the authority ultimately charged with the establishment and regulation of local radio services will be able to reach early decisions on the development of those services.</P>
    <P>The committee will also take any practical steps which can be taken to facilitate the orderly development of services within the new legislative framework as soon as that is available.  This will involve essential preliminary arrangements of an administrative and technical nature.  By undertaking these steps immediately much time will be saved later when the legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>The contributions of the Opposition so far to the debate on their own Bill have been remarkable.  They have laid great stress on the obvious demand for local radio services, a demand which first manifested itself over six years ago.  In the intervening years what did the Opposition do to meet this demand?  In one word &mdash; nothing.  In fact, by their masterly inactivity and tacit encouragement they allowed the situation to get virtually out of control.  Now, very suddenly, Deputy Leyden says:</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey requested me to give priority to independent local broadcasting.  Because of the urgency of the matter, we devoted our back-up committee meetings to preparing legislation... We worked on the legislation at every meeting for the last few months of the Committee.</P>
    <P>The result of all this effort is the Independent Local Radio Authority Bill, <Col N="1431" /> 1981, with minor changes which, as has been stated earlier, was drafted and ready as far back as June 1980 &mdash; three years ago.  I have a list of the minor differences.</P>

In fact, the Opposition merely engaged in a piece of deplorable flag waving when they suggested that I was acting under instructions from London. They talk about a serious infringement of our democracy, our own freedom of movement and freedom of action. They conveniently choose to ignore the much more serious cases of interference to Irish safety of life services.</P>
      <P>If, in the course of the interference to ambulance services last April a serious emergency arose involving loss of life and damage to property, or if the interference at Dublin Airport had given rise to a serious accident, I am certain Deputy Leyden would be the first Deputy on his feet in this House demanding a public inquiry into my Department's control and management of the radio frequency spectrum.  He might have greater cause to call for my resignation than he had of late.</P>
      <P>I will refer later to further instances of serious interference that have arisen caused by illegal broadcasting stations but, at this stage, may I take it that, if I did not take appropriate action and a serious emergency arose as a result, Deputy Leyden would persist in his call that illegal stations should be allowed to continue in operation and that no action should be taken before the end of the year?  Unfortunately, I cannot be assured that an emergency will not arise before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed for a number of <Col N="1432" /> reasons with the Opposition's contribution introducing the Bill.  The first reason is one which relates to something I have already mentioned &mdash; it confirmed for me my suspicion that the introduction of this Bill at this time was purely an act of political opportunism.  The second aspect which disappointed me was the failure to discuss in any way the philosophy behind the development of local radio services as envisaged in the Bill.  A further notable omission was any consideration of the effects of the Bill on the existing national broadcasting services provided by RTE, including Radio na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Any Bill which sets the framework for local broadcasting services, as this Bill is intended to do, has to be considered from many angles.  It is not sufficient merely to take off a shelf a Bill which was prepared three or four years ago.  What is the philosophy that guided the drafting of that Bill in the first place?  What social and cultural factors were considered in deciding on the framework which is set out to establish?  What sort of mould did it seek to create for local broadcasting services?  These are all basic questions which should be dealt with on the introduction of a Bill such as this.</P>
    <P>Simplistic notions of competition being good for its own sake can be avoided. There are circumstances in which competition has bad rather than good effects. Where the pattern of demand is geographically uneven, as it would be for radio services, free and uncontrolled competition can simply lead to services being provided by a number of competing bodies where demand is heavy, when none at all is provided in other areas. This factor is particularly important outside the main centres of population.  The quality and variety of programmes can suffer through uncontrolled competition which, in the case of radio, could lead to a number of stations catering for the most popular taste but not providing a balanced public service of news, features, drama, Irish cultural programmes, and programming of special interest.</P>
    <P>I find the failure to refer at all to the place of RTE in these developments inexplicable.  Are RTE to be totally excluded, their obvious expertise and <Col N="1433" /> their resources not to be made available to the community?  Clearly RTE have a role to play in the development of local radio, and the Government recognise this.  As I said earlier, I will be in touch with the Authority shortly.</P>
    <P>It is also reasonable to ask what effects the promoters of this Bill expect it to have.  How extensively do they believe local broadcasting services can be provided under it?  What will be the consequences of requiring the Authority to be satisfied that the establishment of each local broadcasting service would be in accordance with good economic principles? Would it not restrict local broadcasting services to the main cities only? Why is there no provision in the Bill to facilitate local broadcasting services in areas of marginal economic viability? The Opposition have not addressed these questions in putting forward the Bill.</P>
    <P>In my view, local radio services should be genuinely local in character.  They should reflect local life, achievements, and aspirations.  This suggests that they should be organised and run on a local community basis with as widespread community involvement as is possible. Commercial considerations should not be allowed to dominate or unduly influence the developments of services.</P>
    <P>In the course of his contribution on Wednesday last to this debate, Deputy Leyden said that his Bill would give an opportunity for existing broadcasters to apply for licences in the proper manner. He said there would be a right to provide transmitters, to license transmitters or to approve of existing transmitters which would comply with international standards and that this would ensure that existing stations would be enabled to apply for approval of their facilities.  I am afraid this shows not only that Deputy Leyden did not consider this Bill in Committee for several months as he said, but that he did not even read his own Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of his Bill provides that the Authority will provide local broadcasting services and will have power to establish, maintain and operate broadcasting stations. The programmes broadcast by the Authority shall be provided by programme contractors who have the right <Col N="1434" /> and duty to provide programmes to be broadcast by the Authority.  That is what Deputy Leyden's Bill says.  In his own speech on his own Bill, he showed clearly that he did not read his own Bill.  Under this section of Deputy Leyden's Bill only the Authority may be licensed to operate broadcasting transmitters.  No other transmitters can be licensed under the Bill.  Perhaps when Deputy Leyden is replying to this debate he would like to explain this product of months of consideration. Will he admit that there were no such months of consideration?  Will he admit that this is blatant evidence of political opportunism?  There is no provision for the Authority to issue licences.</P>

Maybe when Deputy Leyden gets a chance to read the Bill, perhaps for the first time, he might like to explain the contradictions in his opening speech.  This highlights the stark opportunism of the Bill.  Not only did Deputy Leyden not study the Bill, it appears that he hardly read it.  As further evidence of this, Deputy Leyden also said that his Bill would not be costly to implement. Why then is he providing for Exchequer advances of up to £10 million under section 27 of the Bill and for borrowing by the Authority under two further sections, sections 31 and 32?  Is this the product of months of careful consideration? Enough of Deputy Leyden for now.</P>

      <P>Some of the media have been making great play about my actions in this case.  There have been references to my not having consulted the Government and to my having scored an &ldquo;own goal&rdquo;.  All of this is, of course, not correct.  Maybe Deputy Leyden might want to reflect on this also.  The fact is that 30 times since 1977, similar action to this has been taken and for very good reasons.  From 1977 to date, apart from an eight months interlude Fianna Fáil were in power so the great bulk of them took place in their time.  The same action was taken 30 times by the Fianna Fáil Government, yet Deputy Leyden and Deputy Gene Fitzgerald attacked what we did when we are only following well set precedent in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

The Minister's job is to uphold the law and, in this case, consultation with the Government is not necessary.  It is an unfortunate fact that because Ministers did not uphold the law enough we are in the present mess.</P>

      <P>Roscommon does not have a station and if Deputy Leyden's Bill was passed it still would not have one.  The pirate stations have on this occasion, of course, made the most of their discomfort.  They have created a great hullabaloo and fair play to them for that.  I must say, however, that I have a certain contempt for the hysteria which has been whipped up on this occasion.  I am sure that a comparable hysteria would have arisen in the event of some major emergency arising in circumstances where essential radio frequencies were interfered with.</P>
      <P>The reasons for the action recently taken by my Department have already been adequately explained.  The seizure of equipment was done on foot of court warrants issued under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.  The stations in question were operating in breach of that Act and were causing serious harmful interference to licensed and authorised services in this country and overseas.  It is precisely because unregulated use of the radio spectrum can cause serious problems of this sort that the legislation to regulate its use exists.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leyden in the course of his contribution to this debate, suggested that illegal stations should be allowed to continue until the end of the year; indeed he said that he would support that policy. The Deputy referred, in support of this line, to a recent statement of mine in which I spoke of phasing out the illegal stations at the same time as the introduction of the new licensed stations.  I should not like Deputy Leyden or anyone else to be under any misapprehension on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Illegal broadcasting stations have no immunity whatsoever from any legal action which my Department may take against them.  It will inevitably take some time for all the illegal stations to close down.  A phased close down would have some benefits and it would be unrealistic to think in terms of an immediate cessation of activities of all the illegal stations, but I wish one point to be clear beyond <Col N="1437" /> any shadow of doubt.  Illegal stations are always at risk of action against them. Those who operate illegal stations should be under no illusions as regards that.  No Minister could offer an immunity from prosecution particularly in circumstances where the illegal stations have caused serious interference to important radio services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden suggested that recently reported remarks of mine suggested that I was having second thoughts on the action taken by my Department.  That is not the case.  The action was taken because of the accumulation of serious problems which the illegal stations were causing.  I referred quite clearly to those problems in the interview to which the Deputy referred.  I also made quite clear that any further interference would cause similar action to be taken against other illegal stations.  I wish there to be no doubt about my intentions in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is particularly important that there should be no misunderstanding regarding the status of illegal radio stations in view of the terms of the High Court judgment last week in the case brought by two illegal radio stations.  The High Court considered that it was not surprising that the owners of these stations should assume that they had an immunity from the law or that the law would not be enforced against them without reasonable warning.</P>
    <P>In view of this, it is important to be clear, as the High Court was, on the effect of the law.  The judgments said that the law was not affected by lack of use and it could not be waived or abandoned even by express decision or agreement.  In view of this, illegal stations should be quite clear as to where they stand.  They are liable to have action taken against them at any time.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that even since my Department's actions in recent weeks there have been further serious reports of interference.  An illegal radio station in Cork has been causing persistent interference to an important shipping frequency which is used exclusively by Irish vessels.  This interference has made the frequency unusable for a lengthy period <Col N="1438" /> of time with serious safety implications. The same station has caused similar interference to a frequency used by the Defence Forces for mobile security duties.</P>
    <P>Another illegal station in Louth has caused persistent interference to Garda radio communications and has failed to comply with the request by the Garda to resolve the problem.  Another station has been causing interference to mobile radio communications including those of the fire services in the midlands.  My Department will be pursuing these serious interference problems and will take whatever action is necessary to resolve them.</P>
    <P>Any other problems of this nature caused by illegal broadcasting stations will be dealt with in the same way.  It has to be understood that illegal stations are likely to cause interference problems of this type almost of their nature because they do not submit themselves to regulation of any type.  Illegal stations appropriate any frequencies which suit themselves and then broadcast at whatever power they themselves decide.  It has been repeatedly found that such stations take grossly inadequate steps to safeguard against interference at other frequencies by unwanted signals of various types.  All licensed transmitting services are required to exercise proper care and take reasonable precautions against causing interference of this type.  Unlicensed services of their nature failed to do so.</P>
    <P>I might add that the High Court, in giving judgment last week in the case brought by two illegal radio stations, stated that interference by unlicensed stations to licensed and authorised services was a reality and not a mere technical possibility.</P>
    <P>The action that was taken by officials of my Department in recent weeks was unpopular in some quarters, but it had to be taken.  I am glad to note that the necessity for the action has been recognised. An <i>Irish Press</i> editorial on Thursday, 19 May 1983 said:</P>
    <P>The closing of the illegal broadcasting station, Radio Nova, by officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, will not bring tears to the eye <Col N="1439" /> of anyone who believes that the airways should be subject to traffic laws as binding as those that apply to the road.  It has been firmly and repeatedly established that illegal broadcasting has caused disruption of public service communications channels, some of them vital to the welfare of the sick...</P>
    <P>The same editorial went on to say:</P>
    <P>The Opposition spokesman on broadcasting, Mr. Terry Leyden, sounded off on RTE yesterday about the lack of Government action on this matter, and about the participation of members of the Government, at election time, in illegal broadcasts.  Mr. Leyden's stand on this matter is somewhat smug and provocative.  Several Governments have turned a blind eye on the pirates, and several political parties including Mr. Leyden's own, have used illegal radio when it suited them at election time.  In this, all Governments have been equally guilty in allowing the pirates to take root and to grow.</P>
    <P>The case for commercial broadcasting may be sustainable, but only within the law of the land, and the law has been flouted for so long now that it requires quite courageous Government action to clean up the mess.</P>
    <P>I cannot quibble with anything in that editorial comment.  There is now an urgent need for order to be restored to the radio spectrum which is a very valuable natural resource.</P>
    <P>In the course of his contribution Deputy Leyden referred to a formal complaint from Britain about the activities of Radio Nova.  The Deputy used this as an opportunity to indulge in some unnecessary flag-waving.  I am sure the Deputy is aware, as a former Minister of State in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, of the International Telecommunications Convention which governs the use of radio services internationally.</P>
    <P>His colleague, Deputy Wilson, will in any event be able to explain the position to him as he did to this House on 11 May 1982.  On that date Deputy Wilson, who <Col N="1440" /> was then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, said at Volume 334, col. 906-907 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to comment on and indeed to deplore the general trend towards lawlessness in relation to wireless telegraphy matters in recent years.  This is reflected particularly in the proliferation of illegal radio stations throughout the country...</P>
    <P>The operators of all these systems appropriate any frequencies and operate at any powers that suit themselves, in total disregard for national and international law and of other users of the frequency spectrum...</P>
    <P>Ireland is bound by the International Telecommunications Convention with lays down that all stations must be established and operated in such a manner as not to cause harmful interference to the radio services of other countries which are members of the International Telecommunications Union.</P>
    <P>Where such interference occurs there are set procedures for bringing it to notice and every country has undertaken to deal with the cause of complaint.  Ireland would be entitled to inform the British authorities if unauthorised services in Britain were causing interference to RTE services in this country.  Similarly Britain can refer to problems caused by illegal stations in this country and did so in this case.  The complaint was made in the normal course of contacts between the radio regulatory administrations, which is my Department in this country and the Home Office in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to move to the achievement of an orderly system of local radio services quickly.</P>

      <P>I am on the last paragraph. The speed at which the Government's proposals have been developed is a credit to the work of Deputy Ted Nealon who was appointed a Minister of State in my Department only three months ago.  That appointment was at my specific request, to give all aspects of broadcasting the priority they had not got in recent years and which they sorely needed.  I am confident that, under the guidance of the Minister of State, the legislation will proceed quickly and I will be asking the Opposition for their co-operation in that.  I am convinced that this is the proper way in which to approach this task.  I hope that the Opposition will now withdraw their draft.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I welcome the opportunity of making a contribution to this debate.  We are grateful to the Minister and his Minister of State for coming in here this evening.  I must thank my colleague, Deputy Leyden, for the very prompt action he has taken in bringing this Bill before the House.  That being said, I am very disappointed at the reaction of the Minister and the Government.  I am sorely disappointed at the response of the Minister and Minister of State.  It appears in the speeches they made they used most of their time criticising Fianna Fáil and, in particular, Deputy Leyden.  I am sure nobody would agree that those pirate radio stations were interfering with the airways at Dublin Airport, with those of the Garda patrol cars, ambulances or the fire brigade.  We must remember the amount of employment they provided. Both Ministers have been very critical of these pirate radio stations.  If it is now decided that it was an offence to use pirate radio stations, there is no doubt but that the people on the opposite side of the House were the biggest offenders. Indeed, the Minister himself, his brother and many other Fine Gael Deputies used those pirate radio stations.  If it was all right to do so then why should it be wrong now?  That is my argument.  I attended a <Col N="1442" /> meeting last evening in my constituency at which this matter was raised.  People there told me that Radio 2 was interfering with telephones in the area, even with microphones in the church.  If we are concerned about interference what are we or RTE doing about it?  Apparently it has been reported to them but it appears that nothing has been done.</P>
      <P>I believe the decision the Government have taken was utterly wrong because it gives RTE the monopoly in broadcasting and we have seen the results of that in other semi-State bodies.  One only has to look at CIE with their monopoly in public transport and see the situation obtaining in relation to that.  CIE themselves can decide where they will or will not go.  I should have thought we would have learned our lesson from them and not give a monopoly to another semi-State body.</P>
      <P>I and a number of my colleagues received an invitation to visit the RTE studios in Donnybrook when we were fortunate to be accompanied by our spokesman, Deputy Leyden.  We were impressed by their expertise and technology on that occasion.  Indeed I doubt that any other broadcasting station has any better expertise or technology.  In passing I might say that we were very grateful to the people in RTE who showed us such courtesy and hospitality. I have no doubt whatever that if the Government agreed to this Fianna Fáil Bill, which would enable pirate ratio stations to compete with RTE, that RTE, with their expertise and technology, would have no difficulty in competing.  I believe all RTE is short of is the will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone do these pirate radio stations give entertainment, especially to young people, but they do and have promoted many Irish artistes.  Immediately one thinks of Foster and Allen who were very rarely heard on RTE but were given plently of time on these pirate radio stations. Many artistes, people like Val Doonican, have had to emigrate.  He was not successful here but has been in England.  Since the Government have taken this decision with regard to pirate radio stations I have had many young people and their parents in my constituency <Col N="1443" /> inform me how they had entertained them.  They have drawn my attention to what might be called the social service they provided, helping many people to find employment and alleviate many other problems.  I could not imagine RTE providing the same service.</P>
    <P>Why do pirate radio stations have such a wide audience?  It is because they provide the entertainment that people want, not only the young people who enjoy pop music but others who like other forms of music.  I understand RTE have been approached on a number of occasions by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann to have more Irish traditional music on radio and television but they have been up against a stone wall.  According to RTE, people who listen to this kind of music will have to get up at 6.30 a.m. on Saturday mornings when one hour of traditional music is provided.  RTE appear to be anti-Irish. For the past ten years RTE have put out a programme on Sunday mornings called &ldquo;Sunday Miscellany&rdquo;.  To my mind that is the most diabolical programme.  I do not know the extent of its listening audience but on a number of occasions I have been in hotels on a Sunday morning and I have heard people wonder why this programme has been left on the air for so long.  Despite this Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann got no satisfaction in their request for more time on the air.</P>
    <P>There is a pirate station called Treble TR which provides a 24-hour listening service.  It provides a wide range of music, including Irish traditional music.  This Bill before the House will allow RTE and the pirate radio stations to compete and give the best entertainment available to which the people are entitled.  It will give a chance to many young people to use their skill and technology.  They have provided a very good service under extremely unsatisfactory conditions.  The Bill offers a challenge to RTE to provide a broad selection of music and song.  It will allow for competition which is the life of trade. I do not agree with the Minister's remarks that competition can be dangerous.  It is the life of trade.  CIE have a monopoly in transport.  Broadcasting has been dead because of the lack of competition.  If <Col N="1444" /> pirate radios were given a chance to operate side by side with RTE, the public would have the benefit of that competition.</P>
    <P>Recently I was listening to a programme on RTE and I was appalled by the remarks of Donncha Ó Dulaing when he said he would spit on pirate radio stations.  Is that the kind of attitude we can expect from people in RTE?  When one spits on pirate radio stations one is spitting on the people who listen to them. That seems to be the attitude of many in RTE and of the Government towards young people.  The Government have come to the aid of RTE in the position they have taken with regard to pirate radio stations.  It appears RTE are not prepared to take up the challenge.  Last week in his speech the Minister did not indicate he would give pirate radios the opportunity to compete.  Fianna Fáil have taken the lead by introducing this Bill but the Government are not prepared to accept it.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House provides for the licensing of all pirate radio stations. It makes it possible to have legal independent radio stations under an authority that would be under the jurisdiction of the Minister.  Many young people are disappointed at the attitude of the Government and they are disappointed at the attitude of many Deputies on the Government side who used pirate radio stations frequently in the past.  It appears those Deputies only use the stations when it suits them.  Participating in the shows on pirate stations helped to elect many Deputies to this House.  Some weeks ago thousands of young people showed their concern about pirate radio stations outside the gates of this House.  They showed their attitude to the actions of the Government.  Pulling the plug on pirate radio stations came as a great shock to them because it took from them the music and the entertainment they enjoyed. Many of these well-educated young people cannot find employment and their only consolation was to listen to pirate radio stations.  It helped to ease the depression many of them were experiencing because of their failure to find employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> The attitude of the Government has annoyed young people but the action of Fianna Fáil in introducing this Bill was a consolation to them.  However, their hopes were dashed because of the attitude of the Government towards our Bill. The Minister referred to delay by Fianna Fáil in bringing the Bill before the House but that can be explained quite easily.  In the past three years we have had a number of elections.  The Minister is aware of the excellent legislative record of many of the Deputies on this side of the House when they were in Government.  If he is half as successful as was Deputy Reynolds he will be very lucky.  The work of Deputy Reynolds in the Department to which he was assigned and the work of Deputy Wilson and Deputy Leyden has been excellent.  The Minister will have to do a lot to come anywhere near the record of Deputies on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I call on Deputies who used the facilities of pirate radio stations to support this Bill.  The young people are looking to them for that support.  Their voices were loud and clear outside this House a few weeks ago.  The new generation of radio listeners will not take what is offered to them.  They know what they want.  They say RTE does not cater for them but that the pirate radio stations do cater for them.  There is an obligation on all Members to listen to these young people. Fianna Fáil by the introduction of this Bill have shown they are aware of their needs.  This Bill was prepared because of the action of the Government in pulling the plug on radio stations.  If Fianna Fáil had remained in Government we would have implemented our policy.  We would not have pulled the plug on the pirate radio stations but we would have given them an opportunity to operate legally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to put on record my views on this topic.  The reason we are discussing this issue was because the Government felt obliged to take action on the increasing problems caused by the multiplicity of illegally operating radio stations of one type or another in our <Col N="1446" /> cities, particularly Dublin.  I do not have to reiterate here the problems caused by the serious interference with emergency services and air traffic control by these local radio stations operating illegally and in breach of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.  However, I will be honest and say that I was almost shocked, certainly I was upset, at the idea that we had to go in and close them down.  My first question to my colleagues, my peers in Government was, &ldquo;Why did we do it before we had legislation ready?  Why could we not move with legislation in one hand and something to replace the vacuum that would be created?&rdquo;  I recognise the need for these services and the pleasure they provide for many, not just the young but older people also.</P>
      <P>Having listened to my colleagues, particularly the Minister and the Minister of State who are involved in this, I understand now why this Government had to move.  Like many people, I did not realise the avalanche of complaints coming in from the various authorities and services involved, health services, fire brigades, airport authorities and airport controllers. If we had had one serious accident, one major catastrophe because of interference on the frequencies, the doors of this House would have been hammered down by the public as they nearly hammered them down complaining about our action.  If we explain why we had to do what we did, if we spell out to the public why it had to be done before our legislation was ready, reasonable people will accept what we say.  I am delighted that this Government will not dally too long before they bring in their own legislation to fill this vacuum, this need for people to have this broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With some amusement I listened to the rantings of the Opposition on this topic. God knows, they had long enough to sort the matter out themselves and straighten out the legal mess and the problems in this area.  I hardly need to repeat what has been said here several times, that their Bill was sitting around on the Order Paper for a long time and little they did about it.  This Bill before us is an example of political opportunism, of this famed concern for the public, for law and order, <Col N="1447" /> this concern to regularise a matter that they were happy to live with for many years.  Even with a 20-seat majority they chose to do nothing about this problem. They chose to ignore the dozens of representations they received when in Government of interference from the emergency service, air traffic control etc.  Thank God there has not been a disaster.  It is time we all woke up and took these representations seriously.</P>
    <P>That is why this Government had to act when they did and that is why we had to move before our legislation was ready. We took over just before Christmas last year and within six short months we have shown our concern and commitment to this case by getting legislation under way by providing, as the Minister said, this local broadcasting committee so that he could receive submissions from interested parties young and old, those in the business and those interested in the business, so that he could get his thoughts together and frame the legislation to suit everybody and to be the most satisfactory outcome of this problem in the end.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have long shown their commitment as have indeed all the Government parties here.  In the seventies Fine Gael brought out a policy on local broadcasting. It has been in print for many years.  There is no need to question this Government's commitment to resolving the problem on hand.  I refer the Opposition, particularly Deputy Leyden, to what has been included in our policy over the years.  I ask him to accept it as our good faith, the good faith of this Government, in resolving in an orderly fashion, not being politically opportune, an issue which is of immediate interest to thousands of the electorate.  As has been pointed out, it is essential that we regularise the use of the radio spectrum.  It is a limited national resource of tremendous value to various services.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest failings, as I see it, in the Bill before us is that television broadcasting is not considered in it.  As far as I can make out they have excluded that.  When we are ready we intend to proceed with legislation along the lines of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy <Col N="1448" /> Bill produced in 1979 as well as providing for the orderly development of community radio services.  By that time the Government will have considered the various submissions that will have come before the local broadcasting committee and will have put their heads together, put to use the best wisdom available here, and will come before the House and I hope that we will get unanimous agreement in the House on what I am very confident will be an extremely good, worthwhile Bill.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed initially that we had to act so promptly in the manner of closing down so many of the radio stations, particularly here in Dublin, over the last few months.  I also understand why we had to do so.  We all realise why these stations are so necessary and what a service they perform in a community.  It is not just the commercial ones that I am interested in, it is particularly those functioning in areas which commercially alone possibly would not be viable.  In my area, and indeed in many other rural areas, during the bad snow of February 12 months ago, local radio, even though not properly licensed, performed an immeasurable function in helping to coordinate the snow clearance services. When telephone lines and various other forms of communication could no longer operate because of the disaster on hand, people could listen in and find out what was happening and when help would be on hand in their area.</P>
    <P>Another example of what a service local radio can provide in sparsely populated rural Ireland is shown in a wonderful personal commitment from some local radio stations to their listeners who cannot because of illness, age or whatsoever, get to their local church services. I know that RTE radio broadcast religious services, but I have in mind a station that during the Masses mentions the various people who are listening in and who cannot be in the church for one reason or another.  Those people feel personally involved in the community on Sunday.  We all know how important it is, particularly for the elderly, to feel that they are in touch with their various religious services on Sundays.  The benefit of <Col N="1449" /> this personal religious service is immeasurable and for obvious reasons a national radio network cannot undertake it.</P>
    <P>Many other aspects of why we all recognise the tremendous need for these broadcasting services do not need underlining by me.  I ask the Opposition to consider again this Bill we have before us tonight and its dreadful inadequacies and to ask themselves whether it is worth rushing a Bill such as this through the House.  Their intentions may have been good, although I am inclined to think that it is political opportunism and I agree with my colleagues who have said so.  I ask them to reconsider the Bill, to withdraw it and wait until the Government put forward their properly considered legislation which we all want regardless of whichever side of the House we are on.  We all want some sort of regulation, some proper control, in an area of tremendous interest to us.  This Bill before us does not go far enough nor is it adequate in many points.  There is no point in trying to push this through the House and trying to divide the House on a topic on which basically we are all in agreement. We should be able to get an agreement. We should wait for the Government's Bill to come before us and support it unanimously and so tell and show those thousands of youngsters and not so young people who were outside the gates of Leinster House not so long ago that they have our support and that we understand why they felt a need to demonstrate.  I hope they understand now why the Government had to act as they did, why we had to be responsible and why, after so many years of inactivity and lethargy on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party when they were in Government with a majority of 20, the matter was let slip until it came to a crisis point and all the services we depend on for life were threatened.  I ask for the support of the Opposition in withdrawing this Bill and waiting for the better considered and better thought out Government Bill which should be introduced very shortly.</P>
    <P>The new local radio authority which will be set up by the Government will provide a much more comprehensive <Col N="1450" /> range of services and conditions.  They will consider submissions on the basis of various criteria from all interested parties who may be seeking a licence to operate such a broadcasting service.  They will not just look after those who may be commercially viable; they will consider the greater good of the whole country, much of which is sparsely populated.  If we were to use commercial viability as a criterion for any service, much of rural Ireland would be without many services.  We berate CIE when they consider cutting rural rail and bus links and say they cannot be measured commercially, that they must be social services.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil cannot ask this House to support a Bill which is only considering the commercial viability of such a vital service.  We must wait for this properly considered Government Bill which will be introduced shortly.  We must not be fooled by the nonsense talked by Deputy Leyden that their Bill will pass through both Houses, that various authorities will be set up and goodness knows what else done before the end of June.  That illconsidered statement shows the lack of judgment there is in the formulation of the Bill before us.  I request him to withdraw it and to wait for the Government Bill.  We will have what the Opposition wants, and an awful lot more, when it comes to solving this problem.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;pirate radio&rdquo; goes back to the days the Minister remembers, to Radio Caroline and stations like that which operated with considerable effect in the dim distant fifties. Pirate stations have been leaders in the field of popular radio and anyone who does not recognise that fact is burying his head in the sand.  These stations have a huge audience who listen day-in day-out and they are leading the field.  Our Bill has been called opportunistic.  What is wrong with that?  It is better to be an effective leader and to involve the spirit of private enterprise and also the profit motive.  The Minister spearheaded some excellent publications in relation to the rapidly occuring recent elections.  He had the good sense to have them published by private enterprise to make sure they were successful and full marks to him for that &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have another one coming out in a week's time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was not prepared to leave the effort to the Government Publications Office to sell <Col N="1452" /> all those books.  He got into the commercial field every time.  That is a healthy exercise and there is nothing wrong with it.  There seems to be a prevailing attitude that the Government would be better to inaugurate a Radio No Hope because no consideration is shown to people who have initiative and enterprise.  We all know that RTE are doing a first-class job. Radio 2 came on the air as a result of pressure and loss of listeners as a direct result of alternative first-class entertainment being provided.  Anyone in RTE will openly admit that.  There is nothing wrong with that as competition improves standards, protects jobs and gives greater opportunities to those who work in RTE.</P>
      <P>I would welcome a second television station because there would be interaction between a new station and RTE. There would not be an introverted attitude all the time and a second channel would help those working in RTE.  We must consider our radio audience and our television viewers.  It might surprise the Minister to know that many thousands watch Breakfast TV and are being subjected to commercial pressures from overseas.  Why should we not have our own commercial pressures which would be excellent for boosting trade and industry and would give more life to the community? We must not stifle initiative. This was evident when we discussed the Finance Bill which clamped down on private initiative.</P>
      <P>Some of the quality of Radio Nova has been superb and has improved RTE also, but their leaders, unfortunately, were unlicensed.  I do not know if the Minister ever listens to Radio Nova or other stations like it, but I do and I enjoy them very much.  They are superb stations and give very good entertainment.  So does Radio 2 because it has improved as a direct result of pirate stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, the Taoiseach opened the Sandymount Community Week and the community radio people were given a stay of execution for that week and provided a very excellent service during that time.  There is no doubt that a national service and also a highly competitive commercial network can run hand in hand.  The Minister has been an excellent <Col N="1453" /> contributor to RTE television and radio and he would agree that the present situation in Britain of open competition between the national radio and television service on the one hand and the commercial ITN network on the other gives a very good mix.  That is the way we should be moving, towards a much healthier situation.</P>
    <P>Some Member mentioned, facetiously in a sense, that no tears were shed when Radio Nova was closed down.  That statement is not true; it is out of touch with reality.  Many thousands of listeners in Dublin and, indeed, over the country &mdash; because these stations are received way beyond the province of Leinster &mdash; were very disappointed at the closure and were left stranded with a feeling of hopelessness. It may be a communications problem and it may be difficult to put the case across that firm action of that sort has to be taken.  I am not condoning any illegality and no Member could point a finger at me in that respect.  There is no point whatsoever in contributors looking back at past inaction.  We are living in the eighties and in a very short space of time it will be possible to receive many multiple international television channels and radio stations.  I contend that also is a good and very healthy thing.  One must think of the ultimate effects of being able to openly broadcast into countries where freedom of speech is restricted.  That will come only through private initiative and from the ideal which has always been part of our national tradition &mdash; an openness and frankness.  To confine and restrict would be very detrimental.  The framework of our Bill gives the opportunity to have commercialisation along with the national network.</P>
    <P>Another important point with which the Minister may agree is that radio has again become popular.  It has returned as a fashionable means of communication, whereas five or six years ago the reverse was the case, television programmes flooded into every homestead and people watched them moronically, night after night.  Radio as a means of communication was then very greatly neglected. Present day radio programmes offer <Col N="1454" /> great choice and very good quality and should be encouraged rather than suppressed. Apart from its entertainment value, as an education tool radio has immense ramifications.  Radio has again become popular because of the inroads made by very active and high quality reception from pirate stations.</P>
    <P>It is inarguable that many services which some of our pirate stations have produced have been tremendous for society.  However, that cannot be used as an argument for keeping them open.  The argument for keeping them open is that their quality is good and that they should be given a chance to develop, while at the same time increasing employment, in a legal framework.  If the Minister accepts our Bill it will enable a situation to evolve in which, in tandem, one could keep these stations on the airways and yet introduce legislation and then allow them to apply for licences.  Nobody wants to see the law broken and the Minister obviously is a man for law and order.  I raised an issue a couple of weeks ago in this House about the law being broken every other day of the week by illegal picketing outside the gates of Leinster House and Deputies being prevented from coming in.  The law is also being broken by people not wearing seat belts in their cars.  The law is being broken continuously.  However, at the moment Ireland has a huge, young population and that voice should be heard, otherwise we will be sowing the seeds of frustration because it is not spelt out or clearly defined why these young people are being deprived of services which they enjoy.</P>
    <P>To get back to my opening comments about the reality of the prevailing situation, from a practical point of view if the Minister tomorrow morning were to call to homes in Dublin, to factories &mdash; the few that we now have left &mdash; or to hairdressers, he would find that the station being listened to, whether we like it or not, is the pirate station.  That does not mean that RTE Radio 2 is not a good station.  I have listened very carefully to it and my children, from whom one can get a very good assessment of the listening choice of young people, agree with me that it is a good station, directly in <Col N="1455" /> competition with the pirate stations or the other way round, whichever one likes.  The Minister will have to take an open decision tonight in the realisation of the prevailing situation.  The voice of the huge young population cannot be muzzled in the manner intended.  That would be like swimming against the tide. This little island is crying out for private enterprise to be given a chance and the Minister has that opportunity tonight. Tomorrow it will be the plea of the builders and last week it was somebody else. The Minister would be giving an opportunity for employment.  There are many people employed in the radio stations.  I appeal to the Minister to let that happen before the position is forced upon him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there are many speakers who wish to contribute to the debate so I shall make my points as quickly as I can.  At the end of the last debate Deputy Brady spoke about swimming against the tide and that is more or less the note on which I concluded my contribution the last day.  I spoke about various Government Departments and agencies who enjoy a monopoly increasing charges for services without any regard for the hardship they cause to industry.  They put up prices willy-nilly and expect private industry, which is the bread and butter of the nation, to pay. The truth is that we live by exports and yet we have the ridiculous situation where Government Departments and agencies put up prices and expect industry to pick up the tab.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the need for efficient management in the public sector and, together with the Minister of State, he had an opportunity to talk to some of them last Saturday.  He saw efficient management and the need for competitiveness as a priority if we are to get our house in order.  However, we need this in both the public and private sector.  Trying to achieve it in one area without the other is crazy.  I suggested the last day to the Minister that he would find himself swimming against the tide.  He is devising a new industrial strategy which will be brought forward in a White Paper in July and at the same time the basic requirements for a developing economy such as ours are lacking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the disincentives in the budget.  That is a case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing. The Minister will be compared at the end of the day to Canute trying to hold back the tide which will engulf him.  We have seen the beginning of this tide in closure after closure because of lack of competitiveness on the export market and poor management.  When I was Minister for Industry and Energy bad management was responsible for 50 per cent of the failures I came across.  The closures we <Col N="1457" /> have had are a monument to bad management. We need efficient management in the public sector as well as in the private sector.  Unless we put the two in order and unless the Government bring out a co-ordinated plan to bring all the strands together and make sure no Government Department takes decisions to increase costs on industrial production, the Minister will find himself swimming against the tide.</P>
    <P>There are many omissions from the Minister's speech which were difficult to understand.  There was no mention of inflation.  Does inflation not count in industrial development?  Is it not one of the biggest handicaps industry is trying to work under?  Perhaps it is because the Coalition have such a bad record in relation to inflation that they have ignored it. During 1973-1977 it reached an all-time high of 24 per cent.  In March 1982 when we came to office the inflation rate was 23 per cent.  After prudent management and tough decisions we got it down to 12 per cent on leaving office and it would have been down to what our competitors enjoy in the international markets, 4 per cent or 5 per cent, had not the Coalition added 5 per cent by additional indirect taxation.  They are only fooling themselves when they talk about industrial strategy and development when by their own actions they increase inflation, which makes us more uncompetitive on international markets.  It is incredible to believe that the Minister when speaking about competitiveness never mentioned inflation.</P>
    <P>There were many other omissions as well.  There was no mention of major semi-State bodies in his own area of responsibility which would deserve mention. Possibly he took the view that because there was a major debate on Verolme he did not feel it necessary to say what the Government will do.  However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs let it be known to the people in Cork and to the management and workers in Verolme that there was little consolation for them in the years ahead.  We know from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that no more Government ships will be built for <Col N="1458" /> Departments or for semi-State bodies in Verolme and that the future is very gloomy.</P>
    <P>There was no mention made of Irish Steel.  Perhaps the Minister took the view that as we had a separate debate on it we were well up to date.  We would have been better informed if the Minister was prepared to give us the information I asked for in that debate.  We can only assume that the Government are undecided and that one party is pulling one way and the other the other way.  I am sure before the end of the year we will hear more about it.  NET are a body directly under the Minister's control which have borrowings in the region of £180 million and yet there was no mention made of them.  I know there is a commitment at management level to turn around a very difficult situation.  There was no word from the Minister as to how he sees their role in the future.  Will they receive Government equity?  What corporate plans has the Minister for them?</P>
    <P>I asked the last day about Clondalkin Paper Mills and I hope the Minister of State will take the opportunity to tell us what is happening to that mill which was bought over six months ago with £1,760,000 of taxpayers' money.  Is it to lie idle?  What are the plans for it?  Will it be sold?  Will it be kept going?  What will happen to Min Fhéir Teoranta where a liquidator was appointed last September? I hope the Minister of State will give us the up to date position.  I know when I left office there were offers made for it which would have cleared their existing liabilities and would perhaps have enabled them to show a profit in the final analysis.  What is the position?  Is the tug-of-war still going on with Bord na Móna in regard to taking over that other company despite Bord na Móna having declined the opportunity of doing so earlier? They came into the reckoning later in the day when private enterprise were prepared to pay the price for the company. The offer from Bord na Móna was more than generous in terms of what they would be prepared to pay for bogland in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>What is the position regarding Ardmore Studios?  Are they to be sold or are <Col N="1459" /> they to re-open?  We heard enough from the people opposite when they were in Opposition about how they would use State money to put the studios back in operation.  We should like information, too, concerning many other companies for which the Minister has direct responsibility. Has he any views, for instance, on the future of Ceimicí Teoranta?  Surely this company are in grave need of development and of a new approach in terms of products for which there is a brighter future.  The National Board for Science and Technology could contribute by way of devising the production of new products and bringing about a situation of renewed entrepreneurial spirit into Ceimicí Teoranta.  Before leaving office I appointed two excellent directors to the board of that company.</P>
    <P>Those are the kind of questions that have not been answered in the Minister's long statement.  There is little mention, too, of the IDA.  One wonders if some of the leaks of recent months are now coming to fruition.  Has the Minister confidence in the IDA or what is his view in regard to the company?  I recall headlines in various newspapers and journals to the effect that the Minister does not believe in the IDA, that he would be prepared to dismantle the Authority.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that the IDA command the greatest amount of money in terms of the total Estimate, one would have expected the Minister to have enlightened us a little more as to his plans for the job targets of the Authority.  In this very difficult year is their job target 30,000 or will it be down by 5,000?  What are the targets in the various areas in which they operate?  I understand that the Minister of State is taking a special interest in the IDA.  What is the position regarding the review that I set up on the Authority's building operations?  The IDA have approximately two million square feet in terms of factory space.  This is a sign of the times but perhaps there are ways of getting better value for the money spent.  The review committee to which I have referred were to have reported by the end of December.  I should like to hear from the Minister <Col N="1460" /> what the position is in that regard and also whether a new approach is to be taken by the Authority.  At this time of a depressed building and construction industry, surely better value for money could have been had by way of wide-range open tendering instead of selective tendering which would make some sense in a buoyant construction industry but not in a depressed area in which there are many contractors who are either barely holding on or who have gone under.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked of bringing within the ambit of his responsibility the National Board for Science and Technology. I agree with that.  Another company that I mentioned earlier this year in this context are Fóir Teoranta.  Surely the Minister who is responsible for industrial development should bring this rescue agency within his ambit instead of having the sort of duplication that has been taking place between the IDA and Fóir Teoranta in the area of rescue.  I know that both agencies meet each week within the terms of the early warning system but the situation should be reviewed in depth with a view to eliminating any duplication there may be in terms of moneys or of executive time.</P>
    <P>Having brought the National Board for Science and Technology under his wing the Minister has the opportunity of considering the operations both of the Irish Productivity Centre and the IIRS.  There is divided responsibility across that area and there is an overlapping of executive time and energy.  In the context of getting better value for money spent in the public sector the Minister should consider this whole area of co-ordination and possibly of doing with one or two fewer semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>A few ideas occurred to me while the Minister was discussing his approach to the White Paper.  He asked for an indication of the views of the House on the education system and of how it is serving industrial development.  I do not believe that our educational system encourages enterprise in any way.  Instead, it misdirects personal ambition by way of turning out people who want to be something but who do not want to do anything.  Our very fine vocational education system is <Col N="1461" /> the first step on the ladder towards acquiring the right skills and the right approach to industry.  For far too long our education system has been orientated towards the academic, but it has taken a turn in recent years.  However, we must start at the lower level.  Irish parents have contributed to the situation in the sense that they wished their sons or daughters to be somebody without having to do anything.  Our education system needs to be redirected towards the needs of the new work force.  We should endeavour to have students think in terms of employers rather than employees because there will not be jobs for them in the areas in which they want jobs.</P>
    <P>Recently while addressing a leaving certificate class of 85 in a vocational school I asked those who wished to join the civil service or to have office jobs elsewhere to raise their hands.  82 per cent of the class did so.  I told them bluntly that 82 per cent of them would not find jobs in those areas.  Those people did not have a hope of gaining the jobs for which they considered themselves suitable.  I told them that students would have to think in future more in terms of employers than of employees.  In this sense the Government have a role to play.  For instance, when children come to Dublin on educational tours why must they always be taken to the National Library or to Leinster House?  Is it not time that we had had a national exhibition hall where the Irish Goods Council could exhibit a list of the goods that are being imported to this country and also of the opportunities that are being missed by those goods not being produced at home. We must try to focus the minds of our young people on those areas.  We must draw their attention to this matter, as well as the attention of their teachers. There should be a permanent exhibition hall with contributions from the Irish Productivity Centre, the IIRS, the NBST and the IDA.  There should be videos about people who started business in a small way and became successful.  That is the sort of thinking we must encourage in our young people in order to convince them that this is still the land of opportunity, urging them to think in terms of <Col N="1462" /> becoming employers rather than employees. Many of our industries had small beginnings and I have always believed in the philosophy that the small man of today can be the big man of tomorrow. There is a need for re-orientation.</P>
    <P>In recent years the universities have been adopting a more outward-looking approach to the needs of industry.  International companies setting up here have commented on this and in the Hyster negotiations a significant factor was the change in our educational structures. Four years earlier they had decided to go to Coleraine in Northern Ireland.  The professors are beginning to realise that industry has a major part to play and that there is no need for so much academic education.  We were spending scarce resources in educating people in professional areas whom the economy did not need and exporting them to other countries who benefited thereby from our investment.  It is time to consider getting value for our money.</P>
    <P>I recall writing a note on some suggestions for the White Paper on Industry.  If the drawing up of such a document is confined to the IDA, the Minister's advisers and civil servants the opportunity is lost for industrialists to make an input.  It is most important that their views be taken into account.  I had in mind sessions once or twice a week where industrialists would give their ideas about the requirements for industrial development.  These are the people we must rely on to deliver.</P>
    <P>All this will be an absolute waste of time if we have not a national economic plan covering all areas.  The best strategy in the world will be set at naught if the environment is not right.  It is no wonder that successful Irish industrialists are asking why they should continue to invest here when we are taking away the incentive. They are looking to the United States and other places where they can get a better return and the recent Finance Act will hurry them along that road.</P>
    <P>While I was Minister I had a particular interest in import substitution.  We set up import substitution units in the Department of Industry and Energy and the Department of the Environment.  Are those units working effectively or do the <Col N="1463" /> Government place any emphasis on import substitution?  Have the Government introduced a system of monthly reporting whereby every State and semi-State purchasing section would have to make a monthly return of their purchases, giving the reasons for buying any goods outside the State?  Sometimes when we query the purchasing of goods abroad we are told that those responsible were not aware that the goods were available here.  There is no need for that excuse because both the IIRS and the Irish Goods Council have data banks on the products available here.  The IDA also have a product identification unit.  Is this information being used and taken into account by the State purchasing agencies?  The Taoiseach has finally come round to the view that it is opportune to mention at the Stuttgart conference the move towards protectionism within the EEC.  We all know what happens in France.  There are many goods being purchased outside the State which could be manufactured here.  Are the units I mentioned operating effectively?  Is the monthly reporting system in operation and, if not, why not?</P>
    <P>We talk about the need to improve management and competitiveness in the public and private sectors, as well as the need to establish venture capital companies. Despite the comments on this subject, the system of small business investment companies which has been developed quite successfully in the United States is not clearly understood here.  A new layer of investment companies &mdash; not the banks, I would emphasise &mdash; is needed in Irish business.  This involves another creative part of our strategy for industrial development.  The type of investment companies known as SBICs in the United States have made a startling impact.  The published venture capital index for SBICs went from 100 in 1973 to 760 in 1981.  This contrasts with the ten best Fortune companies which showed returns of 29 per cent from 1971 to 1981.  If we look at the UK we will see that there were only six such companies operating in 1979 and today there are 25. There is a great deal of advantage in this <Col N="1464" /> idea because of the motivation in small investment companies.  They stand to lose if they back ventures that fail but they can make huge gains if they back winners.  When you contrast this with the role and function of bankers and other finance institutions and estate agencies with paid executives, failure affects real prospects in that area of personal capital and it does not offer the high monetary rewards.  The SBICs should be considered as a new layer of investment companies between the banks and other such institutions and on-the-ground operating firms.  By investing in SBICs, banks and other such institutions can spread the risk.  It should also be realised that 35 per cent of the SBICs in the US are high technology investors.</P>
    <P>In the short time I have left I will not go into the details of that.  The Minister is well aware from his advisers about what I am getting at.  Clearly, before you can travel down that road, taxation incentives are necessary to promote such highly deserving commercial activity.  Small investment business companies should be taxed at the capital gains rate with their losses set off against current income. Such a system would facilitate large-scale investment in the industrial rather than the speculative property market.  If you want risk capital put into the economy you must be prepared to reward risks because risks that are not rewarded will not be taken.</P>
    <P>We can look at the success rate of the IDA and SFADCo and we will see that job approval in small companies rocketed from 1,800 in 1975 to 10,000 last year. Anybody who begrudges such concessions to people who are prepared to take risks are not thinking in the interests of our economy.  I appreciate this is only one approach but I suggest it is an approach that should be looked at.  I regard it as a critical strategy in the field of employment creation.  If you look at the ten top Fortune companies, they have not contributed one new job in ten years in the United States, whereas ten to 20 of the SBICs have contributed almost 35 per cent of new jobs in the US.  I am giving an idea of the situation that would <Col N="1465" /> be created if the proper tax incentives were offered.  That money would otherwise be going into speculative investment. We are all only too well aware that in the private investment area there is something like £350 million to £400 million available, not counting pension funds and others.  None of that money is being invested in industrial development, for the very obvious reason that the risks being taken in industrial development are not being rewarded.  Until we recognise that, we will have a very poor success rate in attracting the proper venture capital so badly needed in this area.</P>
    <P>We heard a story at the weekend which was disturbing to every Member of the House and to those interested in the problems of industrial development.  The story was about the involvement of the ICC in underwriting a shares issue by Atlantic Resources.  Here is a Government development bank that was set up to help Irish industry and surely this is not the proper role for that company at this time.  There was a rights issue of 14 million shares in May 1982.  Thirty per cent, or £4.1 million of the shareholding of Atlantic Resources are in the hands of ICC at a cost of approximately 78p which cost the ICC £3.19 million.  If one checks, as I did today, on the stock market one will find those shares are now worth about 47p.  In other words, the ICC have lost £1.26 million in that short period.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister for Finance took a coffee morning with the semi-State bodies under his jurisdiction and asked them is that the role the ICC were set up for. Why should they be in the high risk sector? How many industries are crying out for working capital?  How many industries have their backs bent from the high interest rates operating today?  What would £1.2 million, the ICC loss, not counting investments, do to reduce interest rates on the heavily pressed industrialists in Ireland today?  It is a scandalous operation for those people to get into and the House should question the role of the ICC who were set up to do a special job but who have wandered so far away that they are now in the highly speculative investment business.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the make-up of Atlantic <Col N="1466" /> Resources and ask how were they able to convince the ICC to float shares.  One can easily see what has been happening to oil shares in Ireland in the past several months.  Who are the people who will benefit from this investment?  Fitzwilton have 13.2 per cent of the shares and we all know who the chairman of Fitzwilton is.  We know he is chairman of the fund raising business for Fine Gael.  We all know another man who, apart from being a shareholder of Fitzwilton, is also a very big shareholder in Atlantic Resources. We know of his activities in raising finance.  However, it begs the question of whether this is the worst political patronage in Ireland.  I do not think anyone can convince me or the public that the money the ICC should have available for our industry is being put into this highly speculative area.  Anybody who has been watching the Irish stock market in the past six months should know how Irish oil exploration shares have been going. It is time questions were asked and I put it to the Minister and the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, to call in that corporation and ask them if that is the role we expect them to play.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to ask what is Government strategy in relation to the whole area of industrial development and job creation?  Six months ago the National Development Corporation were a priority.  Now we do not hear a word about them apart from the odd bit of loose talk here, that we have to wait for this little child to grow, the child that was stillborn in the Labour Party in the seventies.  It was not alone in the Coalition's programme then but it was there in the seven months they were in Government, but we hear no more talk about the National Development Corporation. Will it be stillborn even at the end of this Government's term or will we see something done about it?</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister of State opposite me or the Minister have any appetite for this operation.  Now I ask what has happened to the National Enterprise Agency which should be more in line with the philosophy of Fine Gael than the National Development Corporation. The Minister could put it into <Col N="1467" /> operation straight away with two shareholders, civil servants, but all we hear is that it will be developed in time.  We also have heard about a task force of Ministers on unemployment.  All we are getting are three or four more layers of bureaucracy but nothing being done for the 188,000 unemployed who are out there, 70,000 of them young people and 19,000 more young people who are not included.  It is time for some action, fewer boards, fewer committees, less talk.  We have plenty of agencies to do the job.  All we need is action from the Government.</P>

The House will recall that the Minister, Deputy John Bruton, said I would be making a contribution in respect of the area of responsibility which falls to me. I will not, therefore, be replying at any great length to the contribution of Deputy Reynolds.  It would be more appropriate that his contribution be responded to at the conclusion of the debate.  However, I am duty bound to refer to Deputy Reynolds' criticism of the Industrial Credit Corporation and his suggestion that that semi-State agency, who are under the control of the Minister for Finance and have a fine record of contribution to Irish industry, acted in a manner other than within their statutory function. It was wrong of Deputy Reynolds, a former Minister, to impute that the ICC acted under political pressure to any degree.  That is doing less than justice to the chairman, directors and executives of that State agency.  It was a very small-minded <Col N="1468" /> act on the part of Deputy Reynolds. It was unnecessary and, certainly, was incorrect of him to impute any degree of politicisation to the ICC board.  It is only right that I should state that the ICC are one of the most successful semi-State bodies under the Department of Finance. I was saddened to hear Deputy Reynolds' allegation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the cavalier remarks of Deputy Reynolds with regard to the part private enterprise has to play in the economy.  I was interested in his <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude to the subject and he appeared to be suggesting adventurism on the part of the Government in the area of industrial progress.  In that context it might be refreshing if the ICC took a small shareholding in the petroleum exploration area.  That body may be lucky and end up wealthy.  I would not like to judge the issue.  Deputy Reynolds is as <i>au fait</i> with the prospects of finding oil or gas off our coast as I am.  He should not have expressed the pessimism he did about the exploration programme.  Is it the case that the Deputy does not have confidence in that programme?  I find his attitude disturbing in view of the activities in the seas around our coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds criticised the Minister for not referring to certain matters and insinuated that factories were closing <Col N="1469" /> weekly.  He expressed concern about the environment for industry, the role of the IDA and its effectiveness.  The Deputy gave the impression that we had been in Government for ten years, that his party had not been in Government for a long time and would not know what to do if they were.  There is some truth in the latter statement.  The Deputy gave the impression that Fianna Fáil did not have any part to play in Government and were not responsible for industry or the day-to-day management of the economy.  The Deputy is well aware that the environment for industry was destroyed in the four years when Fianna Fáil were in Government between 1977 and 1981. During that term of office great damage was done to the environment for industry and the rate of inflation and interest rates went sky high.  Grave damage was done to the fabric and structure of industry. All the mealy-mouthing, pious hopes and criticisms which now fall easily from Members of the Opposition do not strike me as sincere.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on the record of the House the inflation record of that Fianna Fáil Government.  I am conscious about inflation, as are the Government.  The Government are tackling inflation, unlike the drift that was allowed to occur from 1977 to 1981.  Deputy Reynolds may choose to forget that term of office or conveniently omit to refer to it in his speech but the record is available for all to see.  The consumer price index increased by 7.6 per cent between 1977 and 1978 and that figure can be taken as a base line to judge the efforts of Fianna Fáil to control inflation.  The inflation rate was 7.6 per cent for the year April 1977 to April 1978, which included the end of the term of office of the National Coalition in 1977.  Fianna Fáil succeeded very well in pushing the inflation rate to 13 per cent between April 1978 and April 1979 but they did not finish there.  They were more interested in who would be in charge &mdash; would it be Jack or Charlie? &mdash; than paying attention to the rate of inflation, the industrial fabric of the State or the employment prospects of the young people.</P>

That was a fine record.  Having gone out of office, the best they chould do was 17.1 per cent in 1981-82.  That was a marvellous exercise in doubling the level of consumer prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He cannot put a halo around his head because he was part of Charlie's Army which led this country into a severe economic crisis.</P>
      <P>I would like to concentrate my comments on the development of mining and petroleum exploration, the oil market, conservation and alternative energy and the maintenance of jobs and enterprises in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the development of mining and mineral exploration, the present economic recession has led to a fall-off in demand for many minerals, with adverse consequences for mining concerns worldwide. Throughout the world metal processors and smelters are operating well below capacity, many mines have closed down and there have been severe cutbacks in exploration expenditure.  In Ireland, 1982 saw the closure of the Avoca Copper Mines, the lead/zinc mine at Silvermines and the barytes mine at Clonakilty, County Cork.  Mining operations now consist of the Tara lead/zinc <Col N="1472" /> mine at Navan, the barytes mine at Ballynoe, County Tipperary, the gypsum mine at Kingscourt, County Cavan and the coal mines at Arigna, Ballingarry, County Tipperary and in the Leinster coalfield.</P>
    <P>A major expansion programme is being carried out by the operators of the Ballingarry coalfield in County Tipperary.  The programme will involve an investment package of £3.3 million and the IDA will make a substantial grant contribution to the project.  Reserves are estimated at three million tonnes of top quality anthracite, and the company plan to produce over 100,000 tonnes a year at full production, building up to that level of output over the next four years.</P>
    <P>Several operations are now under way in the Leinster coalfield.  A small open-cast mining operation is being carried out at Ballinakill, County Laois, and a small underground mine is being developed near Castlecomer.  The Rossmore Colliery in County Laois, which was closed since November 1980, has recently been purchased by a company formed by prominent local interests who are at present developing a new coal mine at nearby Slatt Upper.  The re-opening of the colliery will provide welcome employment opportunities in the area which has a long tradition of coal-mining and which was badly hit when the Rossmore colliery closed.</P>
    <P>The company intend to operate initially on the basis of a modest programme of coal extraction and to gradually build up to a level of production which would give employment to some 30 to 35 men.</P>
    <P>A consultancy on Irish coal resources was commissioned by my Department in 1980 in order to obtain an updated assessment of their exploitation.  The end purpose of the consultancy was to provide a body of data to prospective operators sufficient to attract them to seek facilities from my Department for the development of coal resources.  The report concluded that there are some 19 million tonnes of recoverable semi-bituminous high-ash coal in the Connaught coalfield and about 12 million tonnes of recoverable anthracite in the Leinster coalfield. The report has been studied in my Department and it has been decided to <Col N="1473" /> carry out further studies of sulphur and ash content of certain of the coal reserves.</P>
    <P>There are signs of growing interest in our potential for non-metallic mineral deposits.  A number of small marble mines are in operation in Connemara; studies are in progress to determine whether talc magnesite deposits at Westport and Inishboffin can provide the basis for a viable talc mining operation and a new operator has taken over the barytes mine at Clonakilty.</P>
    <P>The recession has also made itself felt in the minerals exploration sphere, world-wide.  In Ireland also there has been curtailment of activity over the last 12 months.  The number of prospecting licences has dropped by 150 compared to the position at 31 December 1981.  However, the continued confidence of so many companies in Ireland's potential to produce further commercial base metals discoveries is heartening.</P>
    <P>There are still some 25 companies operating here, about ten of which are major companies.  It is also encouraging to note that besides copper, lead and zinc other minerals such as barytes, gold and tungsten are also being sought.  There are some 2,200 people employed in mining and prospecting at present.  The value of export of ores and concentrates is about £68 million per annum.</P>
    <P>I come now to petroleum exploration. This will be a very active year for Irish offshore exploration.  Six exploration wells will be drilled in the Celtic Sea Basin this year while another will be drilled in the Porcupine Basin.  Gulf have just completed the first Celtic Sea well and they have an obligation to drill a further two wells this year.  The other wells to be drilled this year will be by Burmah, Total and Elf Aquitaine.  Naturally, we are hopeful that some of these wells will yield good results.  The bulk of this activity and of expected exploration activity in the coming two years stems from licences which were granted under the second licensing round and illustrates to some degree the success of that round. A great attraction of discovery in the Celtic Sea is that a commercial find there <Col N="1474" /> could be produced, using existing conventional technology, and brought on-stream in a relatively short time.  New production techniques would not be necessary because this basin has relatively shallow water depths and a clement environment by comparison with other areas.</P>
    <P>It cannot be assumed, of course, that hydrocarbons on a commercial scale will be automatically established solely by drilling a large number of wells.  There is no shortcut to finding hydrocarbons.  It requires sustained effort, a degree of patience and, I think, a modicum of luck. The more exploration drilling that takes place, however, the greater are the chances of identifying the location of commercial reserves.  That is why the level of this year's drilling activity is so important to us and why every effort must be made to encourage further exploration. In this regard it is worth recording that in 1981 a report on the Celtic Sea Basin was produced and published by my Department.  This report contained information not previously available to the oil industry and I believe that it contributed greatly to encouraging a number of companies to bid for acreage in the Celtic Sea under the second licensing round.  A number of other reports are being prepared and these will be published in due course in the hope of stimulating further interest.</P>
    <P>In the Irish offshore to date, a total of 71 wells have been drilled &mdash; 32 in the Marathon-Esso leased areas and 39 under exclusive licences issued under the 1975 licensing terms.  Arising from this we have at present one producing field &mdash; the Kinsale Head Gas Field and while no commercial discoveries of oil have yet been made we have had a number of significant flows and shows.  As regards this year's exploration, I understand that data from seismic which has been recently shot in the Celtic Sea area is, due to advances in technology, of a much higher quality than data previously available and that it is assisting the companies greatly in their selection of exploration targets.</P>
    <P>As far as the Porcupine Basin is concerned the BP Group's fifth well on their <Col N="1475" /> discovery block 26/28 will be of particular significance.  Two previous wells drilled by the consortium on this block in 1979 and 1980 flowed oil at rates of 5,589 and 1,490 barrels per day respectively.  Last year the group carried out a detailed and sophisticated &ldquo;three dimensional&rdquo; seismic survey over the block.  The data which emerged provided a better understanding of the complex fault patterns of the block.  BP are currently interpreting the results of the survey prior to selection of the best drilling location for this year's well.</P>
    <P>On shore, exploration is continuing in the area known as the North West Carboniferous Basin.  In this area gas in non-commercial quantities was discovered in 1962 in two wells in County Cavan.  The most recent licence in the area was granted in 1980 and in 1981 the licensees re-entered the gas-discovery well at Dowra.  Using modern fracturing techniques they succeeded in increasing substantially the gas flow rate at the Dowra well.  Since then, the licensees have carried out extensive geological field mapping and have shot 400 km. of seismic.  They are, at present, finalising a decision on the location of two wells, drilling of which is expected to commence in the late summer.</P>
    <P>Concerning financial provisions, there have been some considerable changes in the amounts in the Estimates this year. The closure of Avoca Mines has reduced expenditure provided for in subhead L by over £4 million compared with last year when the bulk of the closure costs were incurred.  On the income side receipts from royalties payable by Marathon Oil on production of Kinsale gas are now paid direct to the Exchequer instead of credited to the Vote as in former years. The amount is £4.275 million.  In addition surplus income and corporation tax payments by Bord Gáis Éireann will bring the total income accruing to the Exchequer from Kinsale gas production to over £82 million.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn my attention to the oil market.  Central to any debate on economic recovery and increased job creation is the question of energy costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> It is not too far off the mark to say that the present recession in world trade was brought about by the increasing energy costs of the seventies.  Conversely, the recent significant real drop in oil prices following the OPEC discussions in London must lead to international recovery and positive signs of such recovery are clear in such countries as the USA, Germany and Japan.  Investment is once more respectable and in Ireland there is no reason to doubt that wise investment at present could prove extremely profitable in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>To engender such investment we must show that the benefits of cheaper energy are passed on to the consumer.  It is oil that has and will continue to have the lion's share of the energy market for the foreseeable future and lowest economic costs consistent with an acceptable degree of security of supply must be the policy of the Government on all energy products but in particular oil.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, all our oil is at present imported and not only are we subject to the vagaries of the relationship between the dollar and the punt but we are also price takers in both crude oil and oil products.  The least we should expect is that the Irish energy costs if higher than our competitor countries are based on identifiable and acceptable factors.  I am not sure that this is the case at present.</P>
    <P>This immediately raises the question of Whitegate.  The operation of the refinery, a much-discussed topic, has received disproportionate blame for our high oil costs.  Since re-opening, the Whitegate diseconomy as compared with imported product prices has lessened due to increased operating efficiency and the realignment of spot prices to term prices. That is not to suggest that any particular level of diseconomy at Whitegate is acceptable.  The role of the refinery in providing significant stocks of petroleum product on Irish soil, the monitoring role which Whitegate plays on the Irish oil scene, and the flexibility which refining capacity confers are all elements which must be taken into account when trying to balance the diseconomies of refining there against the security value of an operational refinery.  The fluctuating <Col N="1477" /> nature of the oil market tends to produce very variable results depending on when calculations are made, but the balance of advantages and disadvantages must be kept under review.</P>
    <P>Following actions in the High Court and Supreme Court the mandatory off-take regime is operating satisfactorily and all companies are well up on their lifting obligations.  The audit function provided for in the relevant order is now established. Further price reductions to take effect from 1 July, of $20 a tonne in petrol ex-Whitegate are being processed by the Prices Commission at present.  It will be interesting to see in July if, leaving aside currency matters, the relative position of Whitegate has improved.</P>
    <P>If we could achieve very substantial and long-term reductions in the difference between ex-Whitegate prices and the lowest prices at which these products could be imported, there would be a basis for proposing to the marketers that there be realistic discussion of offtake from Whitegate without the mandatory regime.  It is this intrusion on commercial activity &mdash; but which was essential to enable the refinery to re-open &mdash; that is being challenged in the High Court and being examined by the European Commission. It is not something that can continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>There are, therefore, the two major issues in relation to Whitegate, that is, the net level of diseconomies, after allowance for stock-holding, which falls on the economy, and the possibility of an alternative off-take regime.  While recognising the considerations which successive Governments took into account in deciding to acquire the refinery, I would not wish to brush aside the importance of these two major, and as yet unresolved, issues.  Indeed, these will be critical issues in the Government's consideration of future policy on the refinery.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned with the low level of oil product stocks in the country.  With less than 65 days of stocks actually on Irish soil I consider the position extremely vulnerable and one which must be addressed even if it means further cost.  As in the case of Whitegate, the security value must be weighed against <Col N="1478" /> the increased cost, but I know of no other country which has such a major dependence on stocks held abroad to meet its international stock obligations.</P>
    <P>I would like to make the point that there is nothing in these estimates for the capitalisation of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.  This issue would have to be the subject of legislation when the corporate structure and role of INPC is being reviewed.</P>
    <P>In summary, the oil market both internationally and at home has gone through an unprecedented period in the last 12 months.  The full implications of the OPEC price drop are still not clear.  We can, however, have reasonable hope that the present international prices will hold for about 12 months and rising real value of oil can be expected thereafter.  Much of the uncertainty and unpredictability in regard to world oil costs has been removed and this will help national and corporate planning.  However, it must be accepted that the oil scene has an infinite capacity for proving the wisest forecasters hopelessly wrong.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to the problems of energy conservation.  In today's energy market with ample supplies and prices tending to soften there may be a relaxation of our efforts on energy conservation. I think this would be a mistake and that we should not wait for the next sharp price increase to restimulate our interest in energy saving.  Complaints about energy costs would have a great deal more validity if industrialists and other consumers had taken all measures open to them to reduce energy consumption.</P>
    <P>The measures taken under the conservation programme to date have certainly proved their worth.  For instance, the potential saving from the boiler testing service is estimated at over £6.2 million a year, based on a sample survey.  The savings from the attic insulation scheme are put at about £1 million a year, even allowing for one third of the saving to be taken up in increased comfort levels.  The attic scheme was discontinued at the end of 1982.  The announcement of the termination resulted in a substantial increase in the number of applications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> There is, at present, a back-log of cases to be dealt with and this is being done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The main emphasis this year will be laid on energy saving in the public and industrial sectors.  A detailed examination has already been made of energy efficiency in one Department and a number of recommendations have been adopted and put into practice.  A composite report on energy use in six other Government offices is being finalised and this will further highlight areas where savings can be made.  In addition, energy conservation officers have been nominated in most government offices.  They are starting by monitoring fuel and electricity consumption with a view to identifying and then eliminating where possible, wasteful uses of energy.  Guidelines for good energy management are being prepared for issue to local authorities, health boards, primary and post primary schools.</P>
    <P>In the industrial sphere, the Department's funding for the Energy Management Association is being withdrawn as from June 1983.  The boiler testing service has fulfilled its function, that is, to show industry the significant savings available through good practice in the boilerhouse. The service is being replaced by a steam audit service.  Under this new service the performance of steam traps will be tested, boilers will be tested for combustion efficiency and insulation of steam pipe lines will be evaluated.  A report will be issued to each company.  It is estimated that energy savings to the value of about £4½ million will accrue to the users of steam in industry, numbering about 600 to 800.  Also, in this sector grants already committed to energy-saving demonstration projects will remain payable where the proposals have been initiated before the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>As regards alternative energy the Government are continuing to provide funds in my Department's Vote for new and renewable energy sources to supplement programmes in this area carried out by other State agencies.  Since the alternative energy programme was launched <Col N="1480" /> in 1981 work has been progressing on a number of fronts to investigate the potential of new and renewable sources in an Irish context.  My Department's direct involvement in alternative energy resources and development has focussed primarily on wind energy and small hydro as two of the sources with the best prospects for economic exploitation in the near future.</P>
    <P>The wind energy programme has two main elements &mdash; a wind resource study and an extensive demonstration scheme. The purpose of the wind resource study, which is being undertaken by the Meterological Service in conjunction with Trinity College, is to analyse the energy available from any wind and to determine how existing data can be used to select suitable sites for windmills.  Eleven machines of the wind energy demonstration scheme are now in place, four under the direction of the ESB and seven sponsored by my Department.  Over the last two years approximately £1.25 million has been expended on this programme. These machines, of different sizes and designs, are intended to test the performance of wind generators in various applications, including the supply of electricity to the island community on Innis Oirr, electricity generation linked to the national grid, direct water heating and water pumping.</P>
    <P>Experience in the construction and commissioning of the machines has underlined the developing nature of the technology, but it is hoped by the introduction of appropriate maintenance and repair procedures to optimise the operation of these machines over the coming year.</P>
    <P>As in the case of windpower, activity in the field of small hydro has centred on evaluating the existing resources and determining the potential for economic exploitation.  A survey of potential small hydro resources is being carried out and a number of demonstration schemes have been grant aided and are now producing results and are being monitored.  An advisory manual for developers has recently been published.</P>
    <P>Biomass has been regarded as one of the more promising alternative energies, <Col N="1481" /> and considerable funds have been channelled into this area.  Research and development on biomass is co-ordinated by the NBST.  An extensive demonstration project, part funded by the EEC, is currently in train under the board's direction with the participation of Bord na Móna, the Forest and Wildlife Service and the ESB.  This programme spread over many years is now about half way through its development and is currently being reviewed to improve its performance.  In addition, contact is being maintained with research and development work on other renewable sources such as geothermal, solar and wave energy.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn my attention to the sectoral industrial activities in the Department.  I am sure Deputies will agree that this activity within the Department now forms a very important part of the Department's responsibilities.  As the Minister has said, the present recession has proved to be longer and deeper than commentators, and most people generally, had anticipated.  It is also fair, I think, to say that we &mdash; and by that I mean the developed world generally &mdash; are at present not only recovering from two successive oil crises, but are also having to cope with the impact of what many people regard as a new industrial revolution brought about by the microprocessor and growing developments in information technology.  Thus conventional manufacturing has been forced by increased energy costs on the one hand, and by rapidly advancing technology on the other, drastically to review its production methods; its processes and, above all, its manning levels.</P>
    <P>The result is that we have had all over the Western world an end to comfortable assumptions about continuous economic growth and a drastic and regrettable reversal in employment trends to the point where unemployment levels have been at their highest in 50 years.  This grim reality is something that was quite undreamt of ten years ago.  Though there are now many signs that the worst of the recession is over and that recovery is on the way, in Ireland's circumstances it will be some time before recovery in production is accompanied by increases in <Col N="1482" /> employment.  Past experience suggests that the turn-around will take nine months after the start of the recovery in output, and we cannot be sure that the period will not be longer this time.</P>
    <P>Employment in manufacturing industry decreased further in 1982.  Estimates made by the IDA suggest that in 1982 the net decline in manufacturing was some 9,000.  The corresponding figure for 1981 is estimated at 4,000.  Employment in manufacturing industries is thus now at a level of about 195,000.  One of our first objectives in the Department of Industry and Energy must be to halt this decline in the numbers employed in manufacturing industry and to get the numbers growing again.  In present circumstances, this is a daunting task, but not an insuperable one, if we all lend our best endeavours to it.</P>
    <P>To this end, the IDA are working harder than ever, in the teeth of increasing difficulties, to get new industry established both by overseas promoters and by native entrepreneurs for whom there are considerable opportunities, particularly as suppliers to the new growing sectors of Irish industry.  At the same time, the IDA, in conjunction with my Department and with other State agencies, particularly Fóir Teoranta, have been concentrating to an increased extent on trying to stabilise the position of existing industries.  While I take Deputy Reynolds' point about the desirability of bringing Fóir Teoranta under the auspices of the Department of Industry and Energy, I can assure the House that their activities and the co-operation existing between them, the IDA and other State agencies involved in the rescue area, are very successful.  There is full co-operation between the various bodies especially in relation to their early warning functions. I know that cynics will say we do not seem to be making much progress, with announcements of factory closures being daily features.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Very many firms are surviving because of the financial and other aid being given by the State agencies concerned.  By way of example, I would point to the fact that, in the four months ended 30 April, 1983, through the rescue <Col N="1483" /> activities of the relevant State agencies, 2,480 jobs have been saved that would otherwise have disappeared.</P>
    <P>Manufacturing firms get into difficulties for a variety of reasons: these include depression in home and/or export markets, severe competition from imports on the home market, and on export markets, weak management, heavy losses due to poor trading results, liquidity problems, heavy borrowing coupled with high interest charges, resistance by workers to innovation by management, rationalisation measures leading to decisions by parent United Kingdom or other foreign companies to close Irish subsidiaries and to supply the Irish market from abroad, and increased production costs.</P>
    <P>What lessons can we learn from the statistics surrounding the firms who come to the IDA and Fóir Teoranta for rescue assistance?  It is clear that what we classify as &ldquo;rescue cases&rdquo; arise under two broad headings &mdash;&ldquo;External Factors&rdquo; and &ldquo;Internal Factors&rdquo;.  By &ldquo;External Factors&rdquo; we mean the recession, at home and abroad, which causes a major drop in consumer demand; significant symptoms of the recession would be very high interest rates and rising inflation.  This recession and attendant lowering of consumer demand results in a fierce competitive scramble for the reduced markets. The major international firms can afford to cut margins to almost nothing and, by dipping into their reserves, can hope to ride out the storm.  This obviously poses problems for most Irish firms which, even in good times, would find it difficult to compete on international markets.</P>
    <P>There is a danger, of course, that we may fail to face reality and, instead, attribute many of our problems and closures to &ldquo;the recession&rdquo;.  Such an attitude would be very much a head-in-sand approach and would not help anybody. What must be accepted is that our problems can be attributable to &ldquo;Internal Factors&rdquo; as much as anything else.</P>
    <P>Far too many industrial firms are over-borrowed.  This is dangerous enough at the best of times, but, in a recession &mdash; when interest rates go through the roof &mdash; it is a recipe for <Col N="1484" /> disaster.  Indeed, this deficient financial structure very often leads to the all-too-prevalent phenomenon nowadays of companies retaining VAT, PAYE and PRSI payments for use as working capital.</P>
    <P>A feature of very many rescue cases which come to the attention of the IDA and Fóir Teoranta is that the companies see the danger signs far too late.  They can be so busy turning out top-quality products that their lack of concentration on the financial end of the business causes disaster.  Many of these firms will protest that they cannot afford financial/management systems.  The short answer is that they cannot afford to be without them.  The aim of low overheads is laudable.  But, if you have not a good system for watching the purse strings every day, you could end up with low overheads at a very high cost.</P>
    <P>Some of the companies in trouble may have quite superb information and financial systems but are manufacturing obsolete and poor quality goods, with no thought at all being given to the possibility of product development.  By the time they realise it, it is too late.  Other firms manufacture quality products and then go looking for a market instead of defining the market and producing to meet the demand.</P>
    <P>Other factors which contribute to the downfall of many companies include over-manning, low productivity, restrictive practices, and wage costs which have risen so much faster than those in Britain and indeed other European countries in labour-intensive industry.  Indeed, a very significant factor is that, not only have we kept up with the international &ldquo;Joneses&rdquo; in terms of pay, but we have far outstripped many of them.</P>
    <P>While it is perhaps only natural to feel that, in an era of increased taxes and prices, we should be looking for compensation by way of high wage increases, we are only contributing to the dizzy spiral and any apparent increase in pay may be largely illusory in the long run.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should all pay more heed to the three Rs.  In times of good industrial output and relative prosperity, it may be legitimate for workers to talk of <Col N="1485" /> their rights in demanding a good slice of the cake they helped to bake.  However, in depressed times, such as we have now, rights should not precede responsibility and restraint should be the keynote.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the Minister is in the process of finalising a White Paper on industry, a very important document which will charter the way forward for industrial policy in this decade.  It is vitally important that a favourable environment for industry is seen to be restored and that the incentive for investment is returned to its proper pedestal in our economy.</P>
    <P>There is great need for restraint in incomes, in expenditure, and that applies to Government as well as to private individuals.  The Government have to take hard decisions.  They must bring our economy under control, must bring down our interest rates to a competitive level and ensure that the environment for industry existing here is such as to be attractive to investors.  It is only proper to point out that the floating fund of international investment has not seemed to be coming our way in the past couple of years.  The reasons for that are well known.  It is the task of this Government to re-establish a suitable environment for investment and to ensure that our industries are competitive.  It is only by taking necessary Government action to bring about that environment that we can hope to begin to re-expand our economy and attract investment so badly needed to go once again on the road to full employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal principally with the energy matters that arise under this Estimate.  I am not certain that this is a very fruitful way to debate them because there are many questions I should like to ask but I have no guarantee I will get replies.  My colleague, Deputy Reynolds, asked many pertinent questions which demanded replies but he got none from the rather pathetic contribution we have just heard.  The Minister made an interesting opening speech and I should like to hear him reply to this debate but I am not sure if he will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> I should like him to avail of the opportunity to answer some of the questions put by Deputy Reynolds and which I shall put in the course of my contribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was interesting in several respects.  It expressed an economic philosophy with which I would find myself in broad agreement.  I am sure the Minister expressed it as his philosophy and that of many members of the Government.  However, the speech was never read by the Minister for Finance. The Minister spoke about the necessity for engendering a climate favourable to business and industry.  We have had difficult budgets during the years, sometimes budget with mistakes in them, but never have we seen anything like the amalgamation of horrendous errors that we saw in the 1983 budget and in the Finance Bill which was pushed through this House recently with very little debate.</P>
    <P>If there was anything that totally undermined the opening speech in this debate of the Minister for Industry and Energy it was the budget.  The Minister can talk from now until doomsday about creating an economic climate but he had at least part of the solution in the budget of this year.  Unfortunately, the Government chose to do more this year to destroy confidence in business than has ever been the case by conscious or deliberate Government action in the 60 years of our independence.  I am sure the Minister for Industry and Energy must know that.  How he can go along with the financial and general economic strategy that is being put into practice with the obvious damage it is doing is quite beyond me.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with energy matters particularly.  At a time like this it is necessary to deal first of all with the ESB because there has been a fair amount of public discussion recently in regard to them.  The chief executive of the ESB made a speech in the middle of last month which was interesting.  Then there was the decision of the Minister for Industry and Energy to set up some form of inquiry by civil servants into the causes of high ESB prices but, of course, they were to take six months to do it and were precluded from looking at Government policy.  I have expressed already some of <Col N="1487" /> my views about that.  No doubt it will serve some purpose but I do not think it should take six months.  The men concerned are capable of coming up with the answers much more rapidly.  I do not see much point in holding an inquiry of that kind if one of the root causes of the problem &mdash; Government policy, particularly as demonstrated in the recent budget &mdash; is to be excluded.  In any event, it is not fair to ask a group of civil servants to examine critically Government policy. That is not their function.  It does not seem to me to serve any great purpose.</P>
    <P>However, I am less sceptical about this inquiry than I was a few weeks ago when I commented about it first.  Since then there have been two developments of interest which are of some importance in relation to this matter.  There was an article written by Mr. Seán Barrett and Mr. Declan Sheehan of the Department of Economics, Trinity College, Dublin, in <i>Business and Finance</i>, dated 2 June 1983.  I will come back to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>More significantly there was a response to it by the chief executive of the ESB on radio last Sunday at lunch time.  That was quite a performance and I am glad I did not miss it.  Rarely have I heard a public servant in this country react with more aggression and in such an intemperate fashion to the questions, arguments and figures put to him.  Where figures did not agree with the ESB figures we were told the ESB figures had to be taken.  When it was put to him by the interviewer and by Mr. Barrett that the figures with which he did not agree were supplied by the Department of Finance he all but called the Department of Finance liars.  He insisted on bullying his way through, that the ESB point of view was the right one and was the only one that was to be allowed.</P>
    <P>In a statement I made on 30 May I referred to a speech made earlier by the chief executive of the ESB.  I said one would have to make allowance for the special pleading and for the intolerance which the ESB sometimes show for points of view other than their own.  I gently understated the situation when I <Col N="1488" /> said that.  After what I heard last Sunday, if I were writing that statement again I would feel justified in using slightly stronger language.</P>
    <P>For a senior public servant of long experience and a former chairman of the RTE Authority and, therefore, skilled in matters in regard to the media to react in the way in which Mr. Moriarty reacted last Sunday betokened something deeper.  It betokened something more than just a disagreement about figures between himself and an economist.  To my mind it betokened an anxiety to hide something that is rather disturbing.  It betokened not just an intolerance of points of view other than his own but an aggressive refusal to contemplate any other point of view.  For that reason the article by Messrs.  Barrett and Sheehan deserves a certain amount of examination in this debate.  It certainly deserves examination by the six people forming this inquiry and, in particular by the Minister and by the Department of Industry and Energy.  They should look at it in the light of the intemperate reaction to it with even greater care than they might have given to it previously.</P>
    <P>I would not regard the article as being a prime example of economic writing. Certain aspects give all the impression of being dashed off in a hurry and some of the facts brought out are then dragged out into conclusions that do not necessarily follow.  If you leave out some of the dubious conclusions that are dragged out in some of the facts and confine your examination to the facts, what Messrs. Barrett and Sheehan have to say is very interesting.  For example, they find that the ESB employed 18 per cent more staff in 1982 than in 1979 to produce 1 per cent less electricity.  If you take into account the question of productivity in Irish industry in the meantime, they come to the conclusion that since 1979 decisions taken by the ESB have resulted in overmanning of some 25 per cent.  The present numbers employed by the ESB are 13,301 and 25 per cent of that is approximately 3,400.  On the admission of the chief executive of the ESB there is overmanning of 1,000.  Perhaps Dr. Barrett overstates the figure <Col N="1489" /> when he talks about 25 per cent.  It may not be as much as 3,400, but the true figure, therefore, lies somewhere in between.  It lies somewhere above 1,000 and below 3,400.  Whatever that figure is, obviously it is substantial and it needs some explanation in the circumstances in which it has arisen since 1979.  If it had arisen, say, in the three years up to 1979 it would be a different matter.  At the time there was huge annual growth of 12.5 per cent in each of the two years in electricity demand.  In these years we have had a cumulative decline over the period of 1 per cent and, as far as I am aware, no year of positive growth.</P>
    <P>Messrs. Barrett and Sheehan go into the level of wages question in the ESB. There is no need for me to quote all these figures again.  They have been quoted and they are not denied.  Obviously the figures are correct and accurate, but we have had no explanation from either the ESB themselves or anybody else as to why (a) the absolute level and (b) the level of increase in the last three years has in each case been what it is and why both of these are so considerably higher than the comparable national average, not just marginally or somewhat higher but very substantially higher in each case. Messrs. Barrett and Sheehan go on to quantify what the cost of this is annually. They cost overmanning at £40 million in 1982 and the abnormal or over average increase in earnings conceded by the company in the three-year period at a further £20 million in 1982.  They sum it up in a different way by saying that the same quantity of electricity was sold in 1979 for £223 million and in 1982 for £518 million.  The price of electricity rose by 132 per cent and all prices rose in that period by 89 per cent.</P>
    <P>The question of the overcapacity in generating is dealt with, not in great detail, but the essential figures are given and they come to the conclusion &mdash; perhaps a little too rapidly or too glibly &mdash; that there is very serious overcapacity for all of which the ESB are blamed.  I do not think that that conclusion is entirely fair because the lead times are long, although they may not be as long as the ESB make them out to be.  Undoubtedly, much of <Col N="1490" /> the planning and initial decisions were made, for example, in 1979 when, I recall, I was in constant weekly &mdash; often two and three times weekly &mdash; contact with the chief executive of the ESB and their chairman about the board's under capacity, which was quite serious, and their inability to supply the market.  I am rather loath to criticise decisions that the ESB came to when they were under that sort of pressure at the only time in their history when there was shortage of capacity and they were unable to supply the demand.</P>
    <P>The situation changed very rapidly and now, according to the speech of the chief executive of 17 May, the ESB are totally committed to three sets or units of 300 MW each at Moneypoint.  I do not recall having agreed at the time that I was in the Department of Energy to the building of more than two of those.  I am not aware that any of my successors agreed formally to the third one.  Indeed, I believe that Deputy Reynolds when he was in the Department of Energy queried the building of a second set because at that time it had become obvious that the whole demand curve had completely flattened out and that growth was zero.  I understand that he was told at the time that there was very heavy contractual commitment to the second set or unit of 300 MW and they would have to go on with it.  In the meantime, for some reason the third set or unit of 300 MW seems to have appeared on the scene, and whether it was formally agreed to or not by some Minister for Energy, whoever he was, at some time is immaterial.  The indications are and have been for the past two-and-a-half or three years that there is clearly no need in the foreseeable future for that third set.  It is not as if one was acquiring some magic new technology that if you did not take up you might never get again.  A straightforward coal-burning electricity generating station is not of any great technological significance.  There are hundreds, probably thousands of them dotted around the world and the main materials going into them are steel and cement, both of which are at a considerable surplus at present.  However, apparently there is this commitment to <Col N="1491" /> bring the third unit on stream in 1988.  I wonder if it is necessary to press ahead at considerable expense with it at the speed at which is now being done and whether it would be possible to review that and perhaps postpone the building of it for some time.  My understanding was that the first two units would be built together and the position would then be reviewed in regard to the third.  The costs of this overcapacity are pretty considerable.  We see them in this year's Estimate, because much of the ESB's capital requirements this year, as last year, and the year before and for some years to come, will be at that particular station which it is now acknowledged may not be required for quite some time.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the ESB, there are a great many more matters that one could go into and I have only touched on some of the major aspects to which attention has been drawn in this article.  It requires deeper study, especially in the Department, and I hope that answers to the questions that have been raised, not just those to which I referred here, will be forthcoming at the end of this debate. Much was made by the chief executive of the ESB of the prices being charged for indigenous energy resources to the ESB. That is a matter the House should think about for some time because we have never really debated that fully in public. I have heard it debated in a private place which I cannot mention.  We should try to see what its consequences would be. Unhappily, this country is deficient in energy resources.  We are significant net importers of energy and, unfortunately, we are likely to continue in that position for the foreseeable future.  Our energy costs therefore, to industry and commerce are much higher than most of our competitors and certainly are higher than any of our European competitors.</P>
    <P>Because our industry is situated on an island which is not the most advantageous place from which to distribute and sell, should we not consider making available to industry particularly and commerce generally, energy at the lowest cost that is feasible in this country?  Should we not pitch our energy prices, in particular the <Col N="1492" /> price of indigenous energy such as natural gas and peat, at the lowest feasible cost in order to counteract, in part at least, the major disadvantage which our manufacturers have in terms of energy costs? Many people think that we should do that but we have chosen not to.  We tend nowadays to feel that the proper level at which to price our indigenous energy is at an oil-related and, therefore, world-related energy price.  This has been very expensive for our industry and we must ask ourselves what is the balance of advantages either way.  Those of us who have been in Government know the intractable view of the Department of Finance on this matter, that the highest level of charges should at all times be extracted.  What is the consequence of doing that?  Is the same Exchequer which is benefiting from relatively high prices for natural gas not handing out the same money with its other hand in terms, for example, of grants to industry, that it might otherwise not have to do?</P>
    <P>Is the country any better off if the income side of the Exchequer account is increased by £82 million in profits from BGE if that money is going out again on the other side of the accounts?  Would the country, the economy as a whole, as opposed simply to the Exchequer accounts not be at least equally better off if the economy's energy costs were that £82 million less?  Why should a source of income to the Exchequer be the very commodity which is a major problem in terms of Irish manufacturing competitiveness? There is no easy answer to this dilemma.  Strong arguments can obviously be made on either side but all the arguments are not necessarily in favour of the conclusion that we appear, generally speaking, to have come to over the last five or ten years in relation to this.  If you take peat, for example, which is the only other significant indigenous source of energy, is it not more useful for our economy to have access to that at the lowest feasible figure rather than to have access to it at an oil-related price?</P>
    <P>When nature was not particularly generous to us in terms of natural indigenous energy resources, should we not seek to utilise to the maximum national advantage <Col N="1493" /> what we do have?  Is our economy, broadly speaking, not more important than how the Exchequer looks at the balance sheet or the profit and loss account of a State-sponsored body which is only there anyway to serve the people and the economy?  This might not matter so much if we were not at such a disadvantage in terms of energy costs and in so many other ways.  However, we are and it is arguable that we should seek to try to overcome those disadvantages to the greatest extent that we can.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal very briefly with the Nuclear Energy Board which for some years fulfilled a function but I am not so sure that it is fulfilling any now.  I think it costs £345,000 per annum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I wish to apportion that time so as to allow my colleague, Deputy S. Walsh, to participate also in the debate for five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to raise what I consider to be one of the most pressing social problems in our midst at present.  At this late stage in the evening, I tender my best <Col N="1494" /> wishes to the Minister of State on her appointment to this portfolio.</P>
    <P>The increasing incidence of vicious and savage attacks on elderly folk in Dublin city is alarming and something must be done about it.  It is perhaps the most awful of crimes.  Vulnerable, elderly, frail people are picked out knowingly by vicious criminals and in many cases robbed of what could be termed their burial money.  The lamentable statistic is that close on 40 per cent of crimes of this kind are not reported, but the awful reality is that these people cannot defend themselves.  It is very difficult to defend oneself in an attack of that kind unless one is an artful exponent of karate or some such art of defence.</P>
    <P>That the elderly are harassed and attacked in this manner will be deplored by the entire House.  Much of this is caused by the upsurge in drug taking and drug addiction.  The young and not so young, vicious in their need created by this terrible, addictive habit, attack the most vulnerable.  Regretfully, there is no organised system of keeping watch on our elderly folk.  We must now put statistics aside and realise that we are dealing with a very urgent human problem, dramatically on the increase in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I shall not list a litany of such happenings, because I am quite sure that the Minister is well aware of incidents.  However, I shall give two recent examples. An old lady of 93 years was brutally attacked in Rathmines and robbed of a very small sum of money.  It was known that she had this small sum of money &mdash; many like to put away £100 or £200 under their beds or elsewhere for security, so as to leave planet earth without owing any debts.  That is the type of upbringing which these people had.</P>
    <P>In Clontarf, two elderly sisters were recently attacked, both well into their eighties.  I also know of cases where the elderly have been threatened with the burning of their small homes and chalets unless they give away their pensions and contribute money on a regular basis.  This is happening every day of the week.  It is one thing to talk about it, but I hope to offer to the Minister what I would regard as practical proposals which she could <Col N="1495" /> immediately adopt without incurring any extravagant expense on the Department. That Department are very hard pressed at the moment, as I realise all too well. The Minister is engaged in her Department in investigating the feasibility of community policing on a greater scale. More police patrols and greater police presence would be very welcome, certainly to this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I suggest tonight &mdash; and it can be done quite easily &mdash; the initiation of a neighbourhood watch scheme in Dublin city. Such a scheme has the approval of the Garda authorities and would work directly in co-operation with the Garda. This scheme works to great effect in the United States where urban crime and attacks of this kind have been reduced in the order of 30 per cent.  No element of the vigilante is involved, but rather a caring atmosphere of co-operation in the community should be in operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister could easily establish an advice centre in which very willing residents' associations and community groups, who are very anxious to become involved in such a system, could seek organised and well thought out information rather than take the law into their own hands, which we would all deplore. In this centre, people could be advised on how to set up a community watch.  It would be well worth while if the Minister or her officials were to travel abroad to collect information to be presented to the House.  It would start with perhaps ten or 20 such neighbourhood watches throughout the city and the system could expand from there.</P>
    <P>Every senior citizen should be equipped with a simple and effective alarm system.  We are not talking about high cost &mdash; about an elaborate system of wiring households or flats.  I suggest some type of warning system to which other members of the community would be alert and would know exactly what was happening if such an alarm went off.  In some cases of extreme isolation, perhaps the alarm system could be linked with other neighbours' houses.  This could work very effectively, right into the schools.  It could encompass all types of <Col N="1496" /> associations.  The Irish Countrywomen's Association are very keen to become involved in schemes of this kind, as are many residents' associations.</P>
    <P>My next point concerns trying, where possible, to equip elderly folk with telephones.  Here again, if this would be a very costly operation &mdash; and I realise the pressure on telephone lines &mdash; it might well be possible to provide extensions to other households who were willing to keep a watch on the elderly.</P>
    <P>All this would have to be assisted by a publicity campaign carried on in the Minister's Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, through local authorities.  The machinery is there already and the infrastructure is there.  It is just a question of organising things to introduce a system of watching over elderly folk in Dublin city.  Naturally violent crime of this nature does not only affect old folk but applies in every walk of life.  My reason for mentioning the elderly is that reports I have received in my own constitutency, where people from all walks of life reside, suggest that the elderly are living in fear.  Close on 46 per cent of Dubliners are afraid to go out alone at night within one mile of their homes.  That is an alarming statistic.  It is a big change from the Dublin we knew five years ago.  This situation will be aggravated by increasing unemployment. As the Garda become more efficient in combatting crime greater attention will be paid to the soft touch &mdash; those from whom it is easier to get money.</P>
    <P>I think I will receive co-operation from the Minister this evening but if I get a feeling that something practical will not be done we will have to keep pressing this further and do our best to highlight the problem through local authorities. There is an obligation on the Minister for Justice to do something.  The Garda tell us they cannot cope with the problem alone.  I share that view.  Looking to the establishment is not the answer.  The community must be involved in a neighbourhood watch.  That is the secret.  Erect signs in neighbourhoods to show that the neighbourhood is being watched with the approval of the Garda.  I suggest that the Minister compile a register of elderly <Col N="1497" /> people.  By doing so it would be much easier to put the system into operation. I await anxiously the Minister's reply for some practical action to be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording Deputy Brady the opportunity to raise this matter.  I thank the Minister for attending.  Deputy Brady referred to the city area.  I should like to refer to the outskirts of Dublin which were once outlying areas but now have become built up.  The problems of the elderly in these areas are well known. Their movements are well known and they are a marked people.  If they remain inside their movements are still well known.  On occasions such as when they collect their social welfare on Fridays they are a marked people.  They are living in fear.  I appreciate the problem is not a new one.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt we will receive co-operation from the Minister.  I am also concerned about milk roundsmen who collect money at the week-ends.  I refer particularly to employees of Premier Dairies in Crumlin.  The attacks on these men number four or five at weekends. One employee of Dublin Dairies was brutally assaulted and viciously attacked recently.  He had to be hospitalised. Something will have to be done.  The time has come for all bodies to work together including the police and firms such as these.  These employees give a wonderful service to people.  They are in danger at the week-ends particularly on Friday evenings. Some of them live in my constituency. These men deserve special mention. In looking at the problem the Minister should give some consideration to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their good wishes.  I commend both Deputies for their sincerity and concern about this problem.  I have no doubt that they reflect the concern of everyone in the House.  We all have elderly relatives.  We have been confronted with the problem of protecting the elderly in our constituencies.  It seems to be an almost impossible task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1498" /> I noted the points made by Deputy Brady.  They are worthy of deep and serious consideration.  I also saw the US system of neighbourhood watch while in Philadelphia last year and was intrigued by it.  There were placards placed on trees in the area and as a stranger to the country one could not but be alterted to this apparently well organised system.  When I inquired about it I felt it was an extremely good idea.  I was not long enough in the city to see how efficient it was.  Apparently the Deputy has gone into it in greater detail.  The Minister for Justice referred to it in a debate recently in the House.  These cowardly attacks must be condemned in the strongest possible manner.  Society which has become used to all forms of violence and destruction is still repulsed by accounts of attacks on old people.  There is no excuse for the violence and viciousness meted out by the perpetrators of such crimes particularly against the most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>The general increase in crime in recent years presents an obvious danger to society. Many reasons are put forward for the upsurge in criminal activities.  Some commentators put the blame on declining moral values, while others are critical of the way offenders are treated and many would like to see greater deterrents. Whatever the reason it is clear that more people are prepared to break the law by perpetrating attacks both on people and on property, private and public.  These people will not be allowed succeed.  The Government have a definite commitment to do whatever is necessary to maintain standards of law and order.</P>
    <P>Crimes of violence can have many effects.  There is the physical injury that is the immediate result.  That is bad in itself but there are other effects especially when one speaks of the elderly.  One of the noticeable effects is that while an elderly person may not be injured to any great degree at the time of an attack, the shock and the trauma that ensue may prove fatal within a short time.  I have known of cases of sprightly seventy-year-olds or older who would have continued to enjoy life but for having been attacked after which they went into a slow decline.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> In addition the knowledge that violence is so close has the effect of leaving people afraid.  As the Deputy said, about 40 per cent of all people in Dublin are living in fear.  This can create restrictions and limitations on their lives to the extent that it forces them to impose curfews on themselves and to regard as no-go areas places to which they would in the past have gone to freely.  It is important that the public be kept informed of the level of crime and of the steps being taken to deal with it but it is regrettable that the sensational reporting of crime can often cause grave anxiety particularly to the elderly.  The problem of attacks on senior citizens is part of the wider crime problem but it is a problem that is being tackled on a number of fronts.  We are increasing Garda manpower, improving the deployment of gardaí and giving greater powers to the Garda.  Obviously, in the time available it is not possible to go into detail on the wide-ranging measures being taken but I would refer to one important aspect, that is, the effort being made to increase substantially Garda presence in our streets.  In the recent past Garda presence had decreased.  The elderly have been accustomed to seeing gardaí on the beat and this has given them a feeling of security.</P>
    <P>One of the questions I should like to put regarding attacks on old people and the fact that many of these attacks are perpetrated by very young boys and girls is, what has happened to the respect and the regard that young people had for the elderly?  Why has there been this apparent alienation between the generations? Is it because of the break-up of the extended family?  Have we put a generation gap between the teenager and the 60-, 70- or 80-year old?  If one has respect for one's grandmother or grand-aunt one would hardly be so hostile and vicious to someone else's elderly relative.</P>
    <P>The public like to think that the Garda are readily accessible to them and are <Col N="1500" /> reassured by permanent Garda presence. A total of 450 recruits have been assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Area since August last and Garda strength in the area is now the highest ever.  Most of the new recruits are being assigned to a revised rostering system which allows for greater concentration of manpower at the times when demand for Garda services is greatest.  In addition, the commissioner recently carried out a review of Garda deployment.  Following this review he has arranged to have the strength of the uniformed branch augmented in so far as possible.  More frequent patrolling on the beat by gardaí plays a big part in allaying public concern about crime.  Perhaps this is the best means the Garda have for coping with their prime objective of protecting people and property and of preventing crime.</P>
    <P>The recent attacks on elderly people are of considerable concern to the Garda. In one case a person has been charged with a very serious offence while other cases are under active Garda investigation. However, the proposals and the suggestions that the Deputy has put forward and which are positive and worthwhile will be taken note of.  Indeed, I would agree with a great deal of what the Deputy says.  When we as public representatives hear of cases of attacks on old people or of old people being afraid because of being on their own following the death of a spouse or after children have left home or because of attacks on other people in the area, one is tempted to contact somebody in the community. This situation is one that should cause concern to more people than the Garda. I agree that some community interest should be engendered.  This is a sad reflection on the society we live in but we cannot continue to tolerate a situation in which our elderly are put at such a risk.</P>

      <P>The western drainage scheme already applies in those areas of west Limerick which are designated as disadvantaged areas under EEC regulations.  An extension of the scheme to other areas in the <Col N="1265" /> county would require those areas to be declared disadvantaged.  In this connection, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a number of question regarding the extension of the disadvantaged areas in general.</P>

      <P>For many years the annuities payable under the farmers' retirement scheme have been increased annually in line with increases in the consumer price index. The latest increase took effect on 1 May 1983 and brought the annuities to £2,268 for a married couple and £1,512 for a single or widowed person.  Participants in the scheme have of course, also the sale price or lease rent of the land, plus a premium of 10 per cent of the purchase price, subject to a maximum of £1,500, or twice the annual lease rent subject to a maximum of £3,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question from the Deputy on 26 January 1983, concerning this pedestrian crossing, I informed him, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The provision of pedestrian traffic signals is a matter for the road authority, Galway County Council.  The cost of the work would normally fall to be financed from the council's own resources supplemented by the block grant allocated annually by my Department.</P>
      <P>The county council has requested the allocation of a specific national road improvement grant to meet the cost of providing the signals and this will be borne in mind when this year's road grant allocations are being determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In determining the amounts of the road <Col N="1272" /> grant allocations for this year, I allocated a block grant of £812,000 to Galway County Council for 1983 compared with an allocation of £732,500 for 1982.  It is open to the local authority to finance the cost of the pedestrian crossing (estimated at £5,500) from the block grant or from their own resources.  I regret, however, that it was not possible to make a specific national road improvement grant in this case, because of the need in present circumstances to allocate the grant under this heading to national works of a more important nature.</P>

      <P>An annual planting target of 10,000 hectares continues to be the overall policy objective.  However, it has been accepted that, in the short term, pending an improvement in the reserve of plantable land for the State afforestation programme and an acceleration of private forestry, an annual State planting programme (including reforestation) of 7,500 hectares &mdash; to be augmented as much as possible by private planting &mdash; would be the most practical policy.  Private planting is being actively encouraged through the operation of planting grant schemes and a free technical advisory service.  The question of utilising available funds to the best advantage with a view to bringing about a significant increase in the area of marginal land that can be secured for afforestation, is at present under consideration.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the relief due to an employee for expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the course of an employment is dependant on the actual expenditure incurred.  However, in certain instances, inspectors of taxes have agreed with representatives of trades and other groups a general expenses figure where there are common features in the duties being performed. These allowances are based on details of expenses submitted to inspectors and are subject to periodic review.</P>
      <P>In the case of the female catering staff, who are included in the category of non-nursing hospital staff, an annual expenses allowance of £20 for tax purposes was agreed with trade union representatives for years 1978-79 onwards. An application to increase this figure was received by the inspector of taxes early in 1981 but no agreement has been reached to date between the trade union representatives and the inspector of taxes.</P>

      <P>(1) 78,468; (2) 86,963.  This figure represents the number of VAT registrations as at 30 April 1982; (3) As at 30 April 1983, payments were received in 11,839 cases where an estimate under section 22 of the VAT Act, 1972, had been issued.  In a further 3,207 cases where such estimates had issued, VAT 3s constituting repayment claims have also been received; (4) The number of VAT 3 returns submitted by the due date is not available.  By the end of the due month, i.e. by 31 May 1982, returns had been submitted or were no longer outstanding in 17,722 cases; (5) By the end of the third month after the due date, i.e. by 31 August 1982, VAT 3 returns had been submitted, or were no longer outstanding, in 43,819 cases; (6) As at 30 April 1983, the number of VAT 3 returns still under collection for the March-April 1982 taxable period was 18,668.</P>

      <P>The latest available information reflects the position as at 30 April 1983, and is as follows: (a) 187, 348 section 22 estimates have issued for the six taxable periods January-February 1982 to November-December 1982; (b) Payments were received in 61,366 instances where estimates were raised.  In a further 18,392 instances the estimate has been discharged following the receipt of a repayment claim; (c) £835,997,000; (d) The monetary value of section 22 estimates where payments were received was £602,434,000.  The amount paid in discharge of these estimates was £294,668,000.  The value of estimates discharged by returns showing a claim to repayment was £70,322,000.  The value of estimates closed or not being pursued for various reasons e.g. no liability, business ceased, was £34,429,000.  The value of estimates outstanding for collection was £128,812,000.  However, the actual amount of tax at issue in these cases is likely to be considerably less; (e) Not known.</P>

      <P>The statistics available in relation to estimates raised under section 23 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, are produced by reference to the taxable period during which the notice of estimate actually issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that basis, the following is the required information in respect of section 23 estimates raised during the year 1982: (a) and (b) 11,846 estimates were raised <Col N="1308" /> but the number of taxpayers concerned would have been less since more than one estimate would have been raised on some taxpayers; (c) £45,798,084.71.  This figure, however, does not reflect a credit for payments made prior to raising the estimates for the taxable periods covered. The total paid for the periods covered by the estimates, as at 30 April 1983, is £20,683,416.44; (d) As at 30 April 1983, 1,767 estimates raised in 1982 have been paid in full.  In all but 47 of the remaining estimates, not subject to appeal, the collection procedure has passed to either the demand or enforcement stage; (e) Not available; (f) As at 30 April 1983, 2,180 estimates were under appeal; (g) As at 30 April 1983, the gross amount of the estimates under appeal was £11,216,849.77. The tax due on foot of those estimates, after account is taken of payments made, was £7,480,851.02.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction mentioned is, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, a provision of the recent Finance Act.  It is consequent on the provision in section 88 of the same Act which has the effect of lowering, from 23 per cent. to 5 per cent., the VAT rate on <Col N="1310" /> repairs to farm machinery.  Both provisions will come into operation on 1 July next and are designed that, when taken together, they will result in no loss to farmers generally.</P>

    <P>(a)  The estimates given in the table are in respect of the period of twelve months beginning on 1 January in each year except in the case of (1) accelerated capital allowances, (2) export sales relief and (3) &lsquo;Shannon&rsquo; relief which are available only in respect of the income tax year.</P>
    <P>(b)  Many of the estimates supplied are very tentative and are subject to a wide margin of error. This applies particularly to items marked*.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Notes on table</P>
    <P>(1) Business interest.  Statistics are not available which would enable the information requested to be given.  To obtain the information sought would require an individual examination of numerous tax returns for the years in question and such an examination could only be carried out at a disproportionate cost.</P>
    <P>(2) Rented accommodation.  The cost of the relief estimated at £2 million for 1983 is a partial cost in respect of dwelling units completed and let since 29 January 1981.  The full cost of the relief in respect of the total qualifying expenditure incurred up to the end of 1982 is estimated to be £18 million but this is expected to be spread over a number of years.</P>
    <P>(3) Multi-storey car parks and Toll roads, bridges and viaducts.  In view of the limited amount of activity taking place in these areas it would be contrary to secrecy obligations to disclose any information about the extent of the tax relief likely to be availed of by taxpayers.</P>

      <P>The determination of eligibility to hold a medical card is a matter for the chief executive officer of the health board and decisions are made in accordance with the guidelines set down for determining eligibility with due regard to the applicant's medical expenses.</P>
      <P>In this case the applicant was granted a medical card in July 1982 and was notified on 31 January 1983 that a review of his eligibility was to take place.  On the basis of the details supplied at that time the person in question was informed on 22 March 1983 that as his income was in excess of the guidelines he was no longer entitled to hold a medical card.  The decision was appealed and confirmation of the applicant's income was requested on 18 April 1983.  To date this information has not been received by the health board.  On receipt of the requested information, I understand from the Eastern Health Board that a final decision will be made in the case.</P>

      <P>Domiciliary care allowance is payable by health boards to the mother or guardian of certain handicapped children up to the age of 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> The person in question was in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance until her handicapped son reached the age of 16 years in July 1981.  The person's son was then informed of his right to apply for a disabled persons maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board did not receive a completed application form on his behalf until 28 September 1981.  A disabled persons maintenance allowance was granted at the maximum rate with effect from 1 April 1982.</P>
    <P>There was a delay in reaching a decision in this case because the applicant attends a centre providing both education and training.  Disabled persons maintenance allowance is not payable to persons attending full-time education. When it was established that the applicant was receiving training rather than education an allowance was deemed payable.</P>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board are giving sympathetic consideration to making the allowance payable from an earlier date and I have asked that a decision be expedited.</P>

    <P>Details of the contributions paid in the 1982-83 contribution year are not available so far.  In the normal course of processing they will be added to the record of the person concerned during the autumn of this year, in time for the new benefit year commencing in January 1984.  In the meantime, they will be shown on the form P60 received by him from his employer in April last.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the contributions paid and credited on his behalf to date the person concerned will qualify for retirement pension at age 65 and for old age contributory pension at age 66.  The rate of pension will depend on his contribution record from January 1973 to the end of the contribution year before he reaches the appropriate pension age, i.e. the end of 1986-87 or 1987-88.  If he continues to maintain an average of 48 contributions, paid or credited, he will qualify for either pension at the maximum rate.</P>
    <P>The citizenship of the person concerned at pension age will not affect payment of either pension.</P>

The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 19 June 1982. The governing contribution year in his case was 6 April 1980 to 5 April 1981. Only 30 employment contributions were recorded in respect of him for that year and he was allowed unemployment benefit at the appropriate rate in his case of <Col N="1341" /> £64.70.  His record of 52 contributions in the contribution year from 6 April 1981 to 5 April 1982 was not reckonable in determining his claim made on 19 June 1982.  However in order to ensure that he had no unrecorded contributions during the contribution year from 6 April 1980 to 5 April 1981, he has been asked for full details of his employment history during that year.  If these inquiries reveal any unrecorded contributions during that period his entitlement will be reviewed accordingly.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit for the period from 18 November 1980 to 13 November 1982, under the RSI number allocated to her as a single person.  She was also paid maternity allowance concurrently from 5 January 1981 to 28 March 1981 under the RSI number allocated to her as a married person.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts a person must have at least 156 paid contributions to her credit since entry into insurable employment in order to qualify for payment of disability benefit for a period exceeding 52 weeks.</P>
      <P>According to the records of the Department the person concerned has a total of only 130 such contributions.  Her entitlement to disability benefit became exhausted therefore on 8 February 1982. She has consequently been overpaid disability benefit amounting to £1,273.30 for the periods from 5 January 1981 to 28 March 1981 and from 9 February 1982 to 13 November 1982.</P>
      <P>In order to requalify for payment of disability benefit she would need at least a further 13 weeks of insurable employment in respect of which contributions at the appropriate rate were paid.</P>
      <P>She was informed of the position on 11 March 1983.</P>

The claimant subsequently indicated that he was employed in Northern Ireland during the 1981-82 year and following inquiries concerning his employment record in that year it was established that he had a title to benefit.

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance from 17 February 1972 up to 30 April 1980 when it came to light that his wife had another farm which he had not disclosed when his means were being assessed and payment to him was suspended.  A deciding officer revoked his qualification certificate with effect from 17 February 1972 and revised his means upwards from that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following an appeal, an appeals officer made some reduction in the amounts assessed by the deciding officer for the period after 1977 and confirmed that there had been wilful concealment of means, giving rise to an overpayment of £6,073.57 which was due to be recovered. The person concerned is presently assessed with means of £32.65 giving entitlement to unemployment assistance of £36.90 being the maximum rate £69.55 in his case less £32.65 means.  However, in view of the size of the overpayment the total amount is being withheld until <Col N="1350" /> the full amount irregularly obtained has been recovered.  The amount still due for recovery is approximately £1,850.00.</P>
    <P>This will be increased to £43.90 per week from 29 June 1983.  The unemployment assistance for which the person concerned is qualified is being withheld in recovery of the amount irregularly received by him.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I assume the Deputy's question is intended to ascertain if I think that the law providing for the disciplinary functions of the Incorporated Law Society in relation to solicitors is inappropriate and should be changed.  That law was enacted following full deliberation by both Houses of the Oireachtas and I have no proposals for its amendment.</P>

      <P>The Glynn/St. Mullans area is within the Graiguenamanagh post-primary catchment area and the school in Graiguenamanagh provides adequate courses at <Col N="1362" /> both senior and junior cycle levels.  The senior cycle course was introduced in September 1982.</P>
      <P>A transport service is provided to convey pupils from the Glynn/St. Mullans area to Graiguenamanagh.

      <P>The higher education grants scheme, including the means test conditions, applicable to a candidate is the scheme of the year in which the candidate qualified for a grant on the basis of academic attainment at the leaving certificate examination.</P>
      <P>The person referred to in the question from the Deputy qualified academically in accordance with the terms of the 1979 scheme but was ineligible for a grant on grounds of means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The higher education grants scheme contains a provision which permits a candidate <Col N="1363" /> who was previously ineligible solely on grounds of means to reapply for grant where the means requirements of the relevant scheme, 1979 in this case, would subsequently be fulfilled because of a deterioration in the financial circumstances in the case of the applicant.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, if the person in question feels that, due to a decrease in family circumstances, the means test conditions of the 1979 scheme would now be fulfilled in her case, she should contact her local county council, the body which administers the scheme.</P>
