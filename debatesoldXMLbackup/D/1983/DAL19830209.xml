      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 4, 5, 1 and 2.  Business will be interrupted at 3.30 p.m. today to take item No. 1 followed by item No. 2, and the Order will not be resumed thereafter.  By agreement the Dáil will sit later than 9 p.m. today and not later than 12 midnight to enable the Financial Resolutions, with the exception of the General Financial Resolution, to be concluded and to allow item No. 2 to be disposed of.  It is proposed that, following the budget statement of the Minister for Finance and the statements of the spokesmen of the parties in opposition, the sitting will be suspended for 30 minutes.</P>

    <Title>An Bille um an Ochtú Leasú ar an mBunreacht, 1982: An Dara Céim.   Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Tairgim: &ldquo;Go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to amend section 3 of Article 40 of the Constitution by adding the following subsection&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3º The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are proceeding with <Col N="1354" /> this measure in accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government that legislation would be introduced to have adopted the Pro-Life Amendment published by the outgoing Government. As stated in the Programme, the Parliamentary Labour Party reserve the right to a free vote on this issue.</P>
    <P>I am sure the reasons for proposing that the Constitution should be amended in this respect will be familiar to all Deputies, having regard to the publicity which this issue has received over the past year or so but, for the record, I think it right to refer briefly to the background.</P>
    <P>The existing statute law on the subject is contained in sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861. The effect of those sections, broadly speaking, is to make it an offence unlawfully to procure an abortion.  Until recent years, those provisions were regarded as adequate but developments, mainly in other countries, have taken place which have given rise to concern amongst many people.  It has become apparent that judicial decisions concerning abortion can alter fundamentally what had been accepted to be the law, even to the extent of introducing what is virtually a system of abortion on demand.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that there was any widespread fear that such a development might occur for a number of years ahead as far as our own Supreme Court is concerned. There was also, however, another and, I believe, a well-founded fear.  That was that a situation might arise where an Irish Government might find itself pressurised by a decision made abroad &mdash; in Strasbourg, for example &mdash; into introducing legislation to facilitate abortion or, in the alternative, faced with a series of legal actions before the European Court.  Recent developments in cases taken under the European Convention on Human Rights are such as to suggest that that Convention may be interpreted as conferring a right to have an abortion.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that a constitutional change would affect the decision that may be made by the European Commission or Court but, if the people of this State now indicate through a referendum that <Col N="1355" /> they do not want abortion to be facilitated, it seems to me that that expression of the people's will must prevail.  It is quite clear, of course, that this State could never have signed that convention if it had been seriously thought that it might one day be interpreted in a way that would make pro-abortion legislation compulsory.  I may say in passing that I very much hope it will never be so interpreted because, if it is, I believe that it will prove detrimental to the further development of international agreements relating to human rights and freedoms.  I say this because the interpretation of a convention or similar agreement in a wider way than was ever thought possible at the outset, while it may appear at first sight to be a vindication of a particular point of view, cannot but make Governments much more reluctant to enter into any further commitments of a similar kind since they cannot know what they may be committing their countries to.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have already said that I am not suggesting that there is any serious risk that the Supreme Court as it is now constituted would hold that the Constitution as it stands is such as to be incompatible with the present statutory prohibition on abortion. Indeed, the very opposite might well be the case &mdash; the court might hold that there is already a constitutional protection for the unborn even though it is not explicitly stated.  The issue has not, in fact, come before the courts but there are two <i>dicta</i> of Mr. Justice Walsh which suggest that the unborn child has a constitutionally protected right to life.  It will suffice to refer to one of them.</P>
    <P>In <i>G. v. An Bord Uchtála,</i> he said-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;[The child] has the right to life itself and the right to be guarded against all threats directed to its existence whether before or after birth ....  The right to life necessarily implies the right to be born, the right to preserve and defend and to have preserved and defended, that life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, that view, however persuasive, is not binding.  Our constitutional law is in a continuous state of development. <Col N="1356" /> In this context, it is necessary to think of the United States Supreme Court decision on marital privacy.  That proved to be the first step on the road to what has become something very close to abortion on demand.  Such changes could come about in disregard of deeply-felt convictions of the majority, even the great majority, of the general public. Changes have come elsewhere as a result of legal decisions with consequences that have dismayed even some of the very people who were originally to the fore-front in advocating liberalisation of the anti-abortion laws.</P>
    <P>These were the considerations that led my party &mdash; and, I assume, the main Opposition Party though perhaps I should make it clear that I am not authorised to speak for them &mdash; to agree to propose a constitutional amendment to protect the right of the unborn so that the amendment might be put to the people by way of referendum.  The Bill we are debating today was presented to this House by the previous Government last November and, having lapsed on the dissolution, was restored to the Order Paper on the initiative of this Government.</P>
    <P>That is all I think I need say on the background.  It will be clear from what I have said that, as I see it, the object of the amendment, to put it briefly, is to ensure that, unless and until the people in another referendum decide otherwise, the kind of statutory restriction on abortion that is contained in the existing law, as that law is generally understood to be, can be retained without risk of being set aside by any judicial authority, domestic or foreign, and moreover that it will in fact be retained.  One could make the same point in another way by saying that the object is to ensure that what is commonly called legalised abortion does not become a feature of our law or of our society against the wishes of the people.</P>
    <P>Although the Government of which I an a member were not involved in the drafting of the proposed amendment, we are in no doubt that the drafting of the amendment presented difficulties.  It is indeed apparent that many drafts were produced by various people before the present text was adopted and put forward. <Col N="1357" /> I am sure that the previous administration would not have claimed that it is a perfect text &mdash; there is no such thing as a perfect text in such a context &mdash; but I, for my part, acknowledge fully the work done in this respect by the previous Government.  That work produced the present text which, when it appeared, met with a substantial measure of support or acceptance even amongst people who had been sceptical, though more recently there is evidence of some second &mdash; or perhaps I should say third &mdash; thoughts. My party accepted the amendment as reasonable.</P>
    <P>Having as I hope clearly acknowledged the work done and the merits of the text produced by the previous administration, I also acknowledge that, more recently, questions have arisen as to whether the particular wording of the amendment could cause unforeseen difficulties. For example, on the one hand, I have been advised that, on one particular interpretation, the amendment could in fact have an effect very different indeed from what it might at first sight appear to have and that it could positively facilitate the introduction of abortion on a very wide scale.  That point, though it has received some brief mention in print, has not to my knowledge been widely made, but it is of its nature a serious point that deserves to be and must be seriously considered. On the other hand, on another interpretation of the text, which has been put to me by a very responsible authority as a probable interpretation, it could require the State to make the 1861 Act more restrictive than it is, which I think is something that nobody has suggested it is either necessary or appropriate.</P>
    <P>I think it right to emphasise that I am not saying that any of the interpretations to which I have referred would necessarily be upheld by the Supreme Court, but they have been put by responsible people as interpretations that could be supported by reasoned argument and that might prevail.  Moreover, quite apart from those points that have already come before me in various ways, I am more than willing to listen with an open mind to anything said by anyone inside this House or outside that will help to clarify <Col N="1358" /> the text and prevent any future difficulties.</P>
    <P>But I would not like there to be any misunderstanding about this.  When I say that I have an open mind about suggestions for amendment, I mean of course suggestions that would not affect or erode the underlying principle of the amendment which is that the practice of abortion in the ordinary sense of that term should not be permitted to creep into our law.  I am committed to that underlying principle and there is no point in my saying that I will give consideration to any suggestions that would conflict with it.  Such suggestions cannot be accepted as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is all I need to say at this stage about the reasons for introducing the Bill and about my attitude to the particular wording of the constitutional amendment which it proposes.  It would be unreal, however, if I were to leave it at that and ignore the fact that the proposal has attracted criticism based on the contention that it reflects a sectarian view of the rights of the unborn or, at best, that it reflects a view that ought not to be enshrined in the Constitution as distinct from ordinary legislation.</P>
    <P>In principle I do not see that any distinction can be drawn in this context between a statutory provision and a constitutional one to the same effect.  It is possible to argue that it is unwise to give constitutional status to a particular statutory provision but that is a different matter.  I do not think that it is possible to argue that a provision which in a statute is not sectarian can become so if it appears in the Constitution.  A number of those who have described the amendment as sectarian are using arguments which, if valid, would also apply to the existing law.  The existing law, however, is contained in a statute that was enacted by the Westminster Parliament for the whole of the then United Kingdom in the year 1861.  It is a statute that operates to this day in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I leave that point at that and move on to the substance of the criticism that has been made.  Some of that criticism has come from people speaking from what I might call the secular-humanist stand-point. <Col N="1359" /> I cannot hope to convince anybody of that way of thinking.  If a person believes that a woman has a right to have an abortion at any time and for any reason or none &mdash; that the matter is exclusively her concern and that, as the expression has it, hers is the &ldquo;right to choose&rdquo;&mdash; there is really no common ground that I can see for debate between that person and somebody who believes that pre-natal life is human life with independent rights of its own, rights that are in some sense commensurate with its status as human life.</P>
    <P>What I have to say must therefore be primarily addressed to people who support the underlying idea that abortion normally is, at the very least, an offence against human rights but who nevertheless believe that it must be accepted as the lesser of two evils in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Even on that basis, there is a major problem about discussion because of the very wide variation in what different people would regard as sufficiently exceptional to justify an abortion.  Not only is there no agreement amongst different religious denominations on this issue but, in many cases, there can be wider differences of view within a particular denomination than between one denomination and another.  The law cannot cater for the variety of attitudes which different people may conscientiously hold unless it is wide enough to cater for the view that accepts what amounts to abortion on demand.</P>
    <P>Of course, one must take that a stage further and ask why the law should not allow even for abortion on demand. Why, in what is claimed to be a pluralist society, are minorities not allowed to have abortions where their consciences so permit?  For an answer to that, one has to look at the nature of the problem.  If a person believes that the unborn have a right to life, even though it be only a qualified right, that person cannot agree that the law should allow that right to life to be taken away simply because somebody else, even somebody so intimately and uniquely related to it as its mother, decides that it should be so taken.  Even <Col N="1360" /> if it could be shown that that view about the right to life of the unborn was objectively invalid, those who hold it would still have the same duty to act according to their consciences and, in so far as they could through the laws enacted on their behalf, to protect what they see as human life.  For those who believe that another human life is at stake, the matter is clearly not a purely private decision but a matter which ought to be dealt with by the law and, while giving due weight to the rights of the mother, they must logically afford that protection even against the wishes of the mother.  Indeed, if that were not so, abortion law would have little meaning.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a special difficulty if in fact the attitude to which I have referred about the importance of pre-natal life is, for all practical purposes, exclusively held by members of one church even if they may be in the majority. I think, therefore, it is worth looking at the facts a little more closely.</P>
    <P>First of all, an important distinction must be made.  It is one thing to say that abortion should be permitted for special reasons at a certain stage of pre-natal life and quite another thing to say that the early stages of pre-natal life are such that the life that is there has no rights at all. I do not think it is either necessary or desirable for me to attempt to discuss here whether, in any debate about life at and from human conception, one should seek to distinguish between &ldquo;life&rdquo;, &ldquo;human life&rdquo;, &ldquo;human being&rdquo; and &ldquo;human person&rdquo;.  In very large measure, that kind of argument is sterile because it is often a matter of how one defines the terms one is using.  The substantive question at this point is whether there is any validity in the claim that the Catholic Church is alone in holding that the point at which pre-natal life has a claim to protection is the time of conception.  The question of possible exceptions to a general prohibition on abortion can be dealt with later.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, no doubt that the Catholic Church holds that the critical point is the time of conception.  There is equally no doubt that some opponents of the amendment, in seeking to establish that the amendment is sectarian, have <Col N="1361" /> given the impression that the emphasis on conception as the relevant time is, in their language, the &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; view. Incidentally, if anybody doubts that that is the impression given, even by casual references, I would refer to a recent leaflet of the Anti-Amendment Campaign where they expressly referred to the possibility of the expression &ldquo;the unborn&rdquo; being interpreted as operative from the time of conception as being an interpretation &ldquo;in a strictly Catholic sense&rdquo;.  May I say in passing that I myself am using the word &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; simply as the term that corresponds with ordinary usage in this and many other countries &mdash; I am sure I need not state that I am not using it in any way that would be offensive to those Protestants who apply the adjective &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; to themselves or their Church.</P>
    <P>The Church of Ireland have issued several statements on the amendment.  They oppose the amendment for reasons they have given.  They have, incidentally, not only not used words such as &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; but have gone to trouble to correct allegations that they had done so and I believe that, when the dust of this present controversy has settled, they will be recognised for the care they have taken in what they have said.  In their statements, they have consistently referred back to &mdash; and one may fairly say they have taken their stance on &mdash; a report presented to the Lambeth Conference of 1958.  That report, which I assume from the Church of Ireland statements was in fact adopted by the Lambeth Conference, accepts the possibility of abortion at the dictate of &ldquo;strict and undeniable medical necessity&rdquo;.  I shall come back to that later.  At this stage I simply note that the fact that the report admits some exceptions on grounds of medical necessity gives added force to what I now want to say about another point in the report, namely that it also includes the following:</P>
    <P>In the strongest terms Christians reject the practice of induced abortion, or infanticide, which involves the killing of a life already conceived ...</P>
    <P>May I repeat the words: &ldquo;the killing of a life already conceived&rdquo;?  So it seems that <Col N="1362" /> the Anglican Church too, or in our context the Church of Ireland, takes the view, in the context of an examination of the problem of abortion, that conception is the point of critical significance.</P>
    <P>I believe that the words &ldquo;the unborn&rdquo; quite probably would be interpreted by the Supreme Court as being applicable from conception but for reasons independent either of Catholic or Church of Ireland theology.  I understand that the weight of legal opinion is strongly behind the proposition that that is how the existing law of the land is to be interpreted. That is all the more significant when the particular law is exactly as we inherited it at the foundation of the State &mdash; the same law as then obtained in the neighbouring island &mdash; and therefore, one may reasonably assume, not influenced overtly or covertly by any ecclesiastical pressure groups.</P>
    <P>I give the following quotation, the date of it is 1957 but, despite legal changes since then which liberalised abortion law in England, the basic position as to what is covered by the law remains, even to this day.  The quotation reads:</P>
    <P>At present, both English law and the law of the great majority of the United States regard any interference with pregnancy, however early it may take place, as criminal unless for therapeutic reasons.  The foetus is a human life to be protected from the moment when the ovum is fertilised.</P>
    <P>Again, the words at the end of that bear repetition: &ldquo; ...a human life to be protected from the moment when the ovum is fertilised&rdquo;. The quotation is from page 141 of <i>The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law</i> by Dr. Glanville Williams, acknowledged as one of Britain's most eminent academic lawyers and, as it happens, a strong advocate of liberal abortion laws.  Incidentally, in case anybody should think that even Dr. Williams, in the tradition of Homer, could have nodded on that particular occasion, I could add that the same statement of the law may be found in another work of his, volume 5 of <i>Current Legal Problems &mdash; The Law of Abortion,</i> pages 128-129.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> Is this acknowledgement of conception as the critical point peculiar to the common law countries?  Apparently not.  The Report of the European Commission on Human Rights in a 1977 case, Bruggemann and Scheuten <i>v</i> Federal Republic of Germany, paragraph 60, states that a survey of 13 states who are parties to the European Convention on Human Rights revealed that, and I quote, &ldquo;without exception, certain rights are attributed to the conceived but unborn child ...&rdquo;.  It may be that the word &ldquo;conceived&rdquo;, in relation to some of the states concerned, is an interpretation by the Commission, but the word is apparently actually used in the laws of a number of the 13 states.</P>
    <P>If we go further afield, to the western hemisphere, we find that the American Convention on Human Rights, which was drafted under the auspices of the Organisation of American States and which came into force in 1978, provides, in Article 1, that the right to life shall be protected by law and, I quote, &ldquo;in general, from the moment of conception&rdquo;. Once again it will be seen that the emphasis is on conception as the critical time.</P>
    <P>So, the proposition that conception is the point of commencement of life the taking of which constitutes abortion and to which legal rights are attributed is more than just a peculiar notion of the Catholic Church or of it and the Anglican Church.  It is a proposition that in one way or another seems to be reflected in the laws of most of what is usually described as the western world.  This, of course, does not in any way imply that those laws do not admit of wide exceptions. Obviously they do and, as I have already indicated, the United States Supreme Court has decided that the rights of privacy of the mother take precedence over the rights of the various states to legislate as they might wish, at all events until a late stage in pregnancy, but that is not the point that is now at issue.  The point that I am making is that I think it must be quite probable that the Supreme Court would interpret the words &ldquo;the unborn&rdquo; as extending back to the time of conception and that if they were to do so they would not in any <Col N="1364" /> rational sense of the term be applying a peculiarly &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; interpretation to those words.</P>
    <P>If we agree, even as a working hypothesis, that that is how the expression would be likely to be interpreted and that there is ample legal support from the laws of other countries for adopting such an approach, there still remains, of course, the problem about exceptions and I will not try to deny that it is a very, very difficult one and, at the end of the day, there may be no real solution but only an appeal for mutual understanding.  I hope, however, that I may have some contribution to make at least towards promoting mutual understanding.  Why cannot we have clearly expressed exceptions to cater for the views of minorities?  I have already touched on the nature of that problem: first, that we are dealing here with deep-seated convictions that what is at issue is not the right of dissent but the protection of independent human life and, second, that there is such wide disagreement about the exceptions that no law could cater for all opinions without reducing itself to something meaningless.</P>
    <P>In a recent newspaper article &mdash; in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2 February 1983 &mdash; a prominent spokesman of one of the Protestant Churches was quoted as having made certain comments and, in between the direct quotations, there was what appears to be an attribution of opinion to him in the following terms:</P>
    <P>But that didn't change the basic opposition to the amendment and though the &ldquo;life of the mother&rdquo; clause would cover some of the Protestant requirements for termination of pregnancy it didn't cover the psychological health of the mother or the position of rape victims.</P>
    <P>If this is in fact a substantially accurate attribution &mdash; and it is in line with what has been said by others so in any event it represents a point that calls for an answer &mdash; it immediately raises two difficulties. The first is that it is not easy to see how there could be anything that could properly be identified as &ldquo;Protestant requirements for termination of pregnancy&rdquo;, bearing in mind that the Irish Council of <Col N="1365" /> Churches in their statement have expressly drawn attention to the fact that differing views are held amongst the member Churches.</P>
    <P>The second difficulty is perhaps even more important.  I can well understand and sympathise with the feeling of concern which underlies references by a Christian clergyman to the psychological health of a mother in distress, but the sad fact is that if one were to invite someone to write an abortionists' charter, something that would most simply and effectively provide for abortion on demand without actually using those very words, the ready-made phrase is &ldquo;the psychological health of the mother&rdquo;&mdash; not, indeed, that any variation on that theme would be much better.  It is not a question of being on the slippery slope &mdash; with that kind of provision or proviso in the law, we would already have reached the end of the slope: we would have arrived.</P>
    <P>I know of no way around this obstacle. Even if there were no difficulties in principle in providing for exceptional circumstances in which the law might treat induced abortion as acceptable, I know of no way in which the law could provide for exceptions based on hard cases without leaving the door open for abortion on an increasing scale, all the more so when even here the public are being bombarded, day in day out, with pro-abortion propaganda.  If anybody, whether representative of any of the Churches or of the Jewish community or of any other group, can produce to me a text that will meet those problems, I have already indicated that he or she can be assured that I will give the suggestion my fullest consideration and nothing that I have said or that I will have to say in any way takes from that.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer briefly to hard cases.  I would like to make it quite clear that by hard cases I mean a very small minority of cases where an abortion may be sought in very difficult circumstances. I am not referring to certain drug treatment that may be afforded to a rape victim within a fairly short time of the rape.  I am not referring to that because, on the information available to me at present, and having regard to the special <Col N="1366" /> considerations that have to be taken into account where a rape has taken place and a conception that might otherwise occur may be prevented, I am not to be taken as accepting that that kind of treatment of a rape victim would be in conflict with either the letter or the spirit of the amendment.  But there could be some hard cases where the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; sought would constitute abortion which conflicts both with existing law and with the proposed amendment.  The question may, therefore, legitimately be asked whether what I have said amounts to saying that neither the law nor society can take account of hard cases no matter how heartrending they may be and that there can be no allowance for a woman who breaks this rigid law.  Of course it does not mean that.  The law forbids theft.  It does not go on to say that allowances will be made for a person who is in serious need.  Yet, in its practical operation and in its application by the courts, hard cases are catered for and one of the basic functions of the courts is to apply the law in a manner that takes account of all the relevant circumstances.</P>
    <P>This may not seem to some to be the ideal answer, and I can see their point of view.  But, in practical terms, I suggest that it is either that or open the flood-gates. If leaders of religious groups put, on one side of the balance, a problem, which, however real, concerns what they surely accept as being a very small number of cases that they would be prepared to see as exceptions, and if they put on the other side of the balance the massive scale of abortion that is nowadays a feature of life over most of the known world, what conclusion can they reach as to which is the greater evil?</P>
    <P>There is only one remaining point that I think it necessary to deal with.  That is the suggestion that a Constitution deals with general principles and not specifics, that a Constitution ought to be such as to be able in all its provisions to command the assent of all right-thinking citizens and that for those and other reasons it is undesirable that what is presented as a complex moral and social issue should be the subject of a constitutional provision rather than a legislative one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> Some Constitutions set out only general principles.  Ours is not one of that kind.  It is entirely appropriate that such a basic right as the right to life of the unborn should be explicitly mentioned in it.  There are specific references to many rights of much less importance.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that a Constitution should be such as to command the support of all right-thinking people for all its provisions is, I am afraid, unsustainable as a theory and wholly unattainable in practice.  The Constitution's provisions on trade union membership are, for instance, criticised by some as giving too much freedom to unions and by others as unwisely restricting trade union activity. Both criticisms may be invalid but both cannot be valid.  Likewise, provisions about, for instance, the right to own private property are criticised.  Therefore, I do not think the proposition that a Constitution must in all respects command universal support is one that can be sustained.</P>
    <P>What of that point that the Constitution should not deal with complex moral and social issues?  Certainly there are, within the general area of abortion problems, many issues that are complex in the moral and social sense, but the basic issue, to those who believe that pre-natal life is human life, is not complex.  It is starkly simple and reduces itself to whether we as a society are willing to accept the introduction of the practice of induced abortion into our legal system. At the end of the day, there are only two possible answers to that basic question. One is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  The other is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I submit to the House that the answer ought to be &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In commending the motion to the House &mdash; the motion that the Bill be now read a Second Time &mdash; I do so on the basis of what I have said earlier, namely, that in approving of the principle of the Bill, which is what the House does in giving a Bill a Second Reading, Deputies would not as far as I am concerned be committing themselves to the particular wording now proposed or any other particular form of wording but only to the <Col N="1368" /> principle which I think we all understand. On that basis, I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Tairgim leasú Uimh. 1:</P>
      <P>Go scriosfar na focail go léir i ndiaidh &ldquo;Go&rdquo; agus go gcuirfear an méid seo a leanas ina n-ionad:</P>
      <P>ndiúltaíonn Dáil Éireann an dara léamh a thabhairt don Bhille go dtí go bhfaighidh sí tuarascáil ar an mBille ó Chomhchoiste den Dáil agus den Seanad ag a mbeidh cumhacht fios a chur ar dhaoine, ar pháipéir agus ar thaifid.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give a second reading to the Bill until it receives a report on the Bill from a <Col N="1369" /> Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad, having powers to send for persons, papers and records.</P>
    <P>I consider that what the Minister had to say this morning, except for the last paragraph, was an attempt to ride two horses, to appear to support the amendment which the Government have brought in and at the same time to indicate that the Bill was not an attempt to force individuals or people at large to accept a denominational clause in the Constitution.  I note that during his speech he did not attempt at any stage to define what he meant by abortion.  He spoke about life commencing at conception. Prior to that he said it would be sterile to try to discuss if we were talking about human life, human beings or whatever.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that a discussion on these very questions is most important.  The question of when the Anglican Church or the Catholic Church are talking about life at conception, the form of that life, whether it is a human life or a human being, is a very important point.  If we got 166 theologians in here instead of 166 TDs I believe we would get 166 different opinions as to when life commences and whether it is human life or otherwise.  I have said a number of times outside the House that I consider this amendment to be a sectarian one.  I consider it to be an attempt by a small group of people, who took advantage of a delicate political situation.  At a time when the major political parties were looking for every single vote they could find, a small group of people grasped this opportunity and unfortunately the leaders of the two major political parties agreed, on the spur of the moment, to an amendment which will have far-reaching consequences, much more than appears on the surface at the present time.</P>
    <P>We have put down an amendment to this Bill asking that the matter be referred to an all-party committee.  The reason for that is that I feel there is a need for everybody in the House to sit down calmly, out of the glare of publicity, and to tease through all the legal, theological and medical implications of the proposal <Col N="1370" /> before us today.  We are talking about an amendment to the Constitution which, as the Minister said, deals with the question of life.  We are attempting to deal with that today in a couple of hours.  At the same time, the Dáil has on numerous occasions, over a period of 20 years or more, referred other questions, questions which were not so important, to committees of the Dáil.  They have sat on them and discussed the matter year after year and brought forward recommendations. But the Dáil, because it was unsure, failed to proceed with the amendment to the Constitution which was recommended. I suggest that this particular amendment is far more important than anything which has come before the Dáil on three previous occasions and, for that reason, I strongly recommend that the amendment put down by The Workers' Party to this Bill be supported by the majority of the Deputies in the House.</P>
    <P>The question of whether the amendment will prevent the use of certain contraceptives is an important issue which was not dealt with by the Minister.  He indicated that in his view the Bill would not prevent the administration or prescribing of a morning-after pill in rape cases.  That brings us back to the question of whether the life referred to is a life from the point of conception.  I feel it is an indication that the matters which the Minister referred to have not been fully thought through.  He talks about abortion on demand and he indicates that nobody in the House wants abortion on demand. He does not talk about the exceptions which the Roman Catholic Church allow where pregnancies can be terminated in two specific circumstances.  Presumably, from the terms of the speech the Minister made, he does not regard the exceptions allowed by the Catholic Church for abortions, but they are terminations of pregnancies. They are induced abortions.  The Minister claims that this Bill is to prevent induced abortions.  I feel that the Dáil would be far better served at this stage if it accepted the amendment put down by The Workers' Party in order to allow quite a detailed study of the implications so that we are not saddled with a sectarian clause in our Constitution and that the <Col N="1371" /> political development, not only of this State but of the island as a whole, will not be stunted in any way.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is on record as being anxious to engage in a constitutional crusade with a view to making our Constitution more acceptable to people in Northern Ireland who are not inclined to agree to a united Ireland.  Despite what the Minister has said, the generality of people and certainly those who are not Roman Catholic are very strongly of the view that the inclusion of this amendment in the Constitution will render that document even more sectarian than it is already.  As I had not expected to be involved in this debate until near the end, I shall not speak further at this stage.</P>

      <P>I find the Minister's speech extraordinary.  It must be a precedent that he should come here and recommend to the House the principle of the Bill before us while obviously not having made up his mind about the Bill as a whole.  He says that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In commending the motion to the <Col N="1372" /> House &mdash; the motion that the Bill be now read a Second Time &mdash; I do so on the basis of what I have said earlier, namely that, in approving of the principle of the Bill, which is what the House does in giving a Bill a Second Reading, Deputies would not, as far as I am concerned, be commiting themselves to the particular wording now proposed or any other particular form of wording but only to the principle which I think we all understand.</P>
    <P>We have had from the Minister a very much two-handed presentation.  Repeatedly he has used the phrases, &ldquo;on the one hand&rdquo; and &ldquo;on the other hand&rdquo;.  He has left everyone in total confusion as to his position in relation to the Bill.  To say the least his presentation of Second Stage is very weak.  This indicates a great doubt about the commitment of the Government and particularly of the Minister to the Bill.  For all those who are interested in this legislation, this must be a bombshell.</P>
    <P>At the outset the Minister reminded us that the Labour Party will reserve the right to a free vote on this issue.  We were fairly well aware of that but it looks now as if the Minister wishes to have a free vote on the issue also.  One can only question whether Fine Gael are supporting the Bill.  We have a situation in which not only the Cabinet are divided, as has been indicated clearly, but wherein the Taoiseach came into the House earlier and said that the Bill was being introduced with the collective agreement of the Cabinet purely to the Bill's introduction to the House, or, in effect, the reintroduction of a Bill that we introduced before leaving office.</P>
    <P>Obviously the collective responsibility has stopped very sharply at the point of the introduction of the Bill.  We now have the Minister introducing a note of chaos into the debate on this very important Bill.  This is most regrettable.  In addition, the Minister has thrown in scare headlines by saying that questions have arisen as to whether the particular wording of the amendment could cause unforeseen difficulties.  He says that on the one hand he has been advised that on one interpretation <Col N="1373" /> the amendment could have an effect very different from what it might appear at first sight to have and it could positively facilitate the introduction of abortion on a very wide scale.  One can imagine the agony that that sort of statement from a responsible Minister will cause to people who are sincerely interested in the protection of the life of the unborn.  The Minister went on to say that though that point has received some brief mention in print, it has not been widely made but is a point that must be seriously considered.  Apparently the Minister does not himself believe in the point yet he raises it here by way of what I would regard as a major red herring and scare headline.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that he thinks it right to emphasise that he is not saying that any of the interpretations to which he has referred would necessarily be upheld by the Supreme Court but that they had been put by responsible people as interpretations that could be supported by reasoned argument and that that might prevail.  The Minister tells us that he is more than willing to listen with an open mind to anything said either inside or outside this House that will help to clarify the position.</P>

      <P>The Minister's leader was not fuzzy about the amendment during the run up to the election.  He did not have any doubts about the matter.  To prove the point I am making I will quote from a letter sent on 6 November 1982, that was after the election had been declared, to the pro-life amendment campaign people.  The letter is from Fine Gael headquarters and is addressed to Ms. Julia Vaughan, Chairman, Pro-Life Amendment Campaign.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Dear Dr. Vaughan,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have pleasure in enclosing a copy of the statement which was issued as a <Col N="1374" /> result of a unanimous decision of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party following the publication of the draft amendment. As you will see, we are committed to introducing this amendment in Government and having it put to the people in a referendum before 31st March next.  This referendum will not be delayed by any other consideration. This is an integral part of our programme and will be undertaken by any Government that I may have the responsibility of leading after the next General Election.</P>
    <P>May I add that the Party and myself are grateful for the very helpful discussion that you had with us on this subject recently.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Garret FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>Associated with that the Fine Gael Press and Information Services released the following:</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Statement issued by the Fine Gael" RHead="Party on Wednesday, 3rd November 1982">
    <Title>Statement issued by the Fine Gael Party on Wednesday, 3rd November 1982.</Title>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party welcomes the form of the Amendment to the Constitution proposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Amendment as proposed is worded in positive terms, designed to strengthen the Constitutional protection of life, as proposed by the Leader of Fine Gael in his Ard-Fheis speech.</P>
    <P>At its meeting today the Fine Gael Party decided to support the Amendment and in Government to initiate legislation with a view to a referendum to be held by the end of March next.</P>
    <P>At that time there was no doubt or fuzziness in the minds of the Fine Gael Party and that is the way they went to the electorate.  Here this morning we have a totally different approach.  The Minister does not appear to have made up his mind and he indicated that he is not committed to the wording of the Bill as it stands.  This must cast doubt on his commitment and the Government's commitment to the Bill.</P>
    <P>We should be quite clear that this Bill is of great historic significance not only in Ireland but beyond our shores.  Its introduction at a time when man's inhumanity <Col N="1375" /> to his fellow man and his lack of respect for life has reached a new level of degradation is a challenge to the international communities with whom we have relations.  Just as we as a small nation campaigned for nuclear disarmament to avoid a nuclear holocaust so too should we be the ones to cry stop to the holocaust of pre-born children which we see around us in today's world and take the necessary action through our constitutional safeguards to ensure that what happened in other countries cannot, without the consent of the majority, be introduced here.</P>
    <P>We have a Constitution which has served us well.  Through it we have been able to ensure that the laws passed in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann not only reflect the current thinking among Oireachtas Members but also reflect the values and aspirations of our people as a whole.  There has been in recent times a tendency for reasons of efficiency and speed to leave decisions to the professionals, be they medical, scientific or legal. It is the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party to reflect in our Constitution and legislation the thinking of the people and in this way to provide a framework for the professions which will embody a sense of the wisdom, experience and value of the community.  We in Fianna Fáil have never feared to speak out against the international tide when we were convinced of the stand we should take.  One such area of our convictions is the dignity of human life and the measures we should take to prevent practices which are inimical to the preservation of life and which have become commonplace in other countries.  Here, I believe, the Minister is in agreement with us.</P>
    <P>Some months ago the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, announced in Dáil Éireann that it was the Fianna Fáil Government's intention to introduce legislation to enable a referendum to be held to amend the Constitution to guarantee the right to life of the unborn.  On 2 November 1982 I, as Minister for Health, introduced this Bill which the present Coalition Government have reintroduced without amendment.  Our commitment <Col N="1376" /> in this regard was a response to the widely and very deeply held view of the majority of the people that our respect for the dignity of human life should not be undermined.  If this approach displeases certain vocal anti-amendment groups and vested interests, then so be it. We have never hesitated to state our belief in certain fundamental rights and decency and to stand by these values.</P>
    <P>Some argue that a constitutional amendment is inappropriate at this time. The Workers' Party would suggest, through their amendment, that it be deferred for some time, to be considered at Committee level, to have numerous reports prepared and come back here after the final report is available.  Those who argue that the amendment is inappropriate at this time say they do not favour abortion and that the existing law is adequate to deal with our needs.  They claim the amendment should be deferred.  On the contrary we say the assertion of our commitment as a community to the right to life of the unborn is entirely in keeping with our present legislation.</P>
    <P>The Constitution contains a number of guarantees of personal and family rights which express something of the value system which far more than laws or geography serves to bind us together as a people.  When our Constitution was drafted it was unthinkable that abortion could be seen as a human right and still less a public health service.  It was not considered necessary at that time to ensure the right to life of the unborn as a fundamental constitutional right, but times have changed.  In many countries the dignity of life has been undermined by the legislature in legalising abortion. We have only to look at Great Britain and the United States of America to see what could be done here.  In these circumstances it is entirely appropriate that the Irish people now affirm in our basic constitutional law our commitment to the inalienable right to life of the unborn.</P>
    <P>It is only by amending our Constitution that we can accord the final say in this matter to the will of the people.  In one sense the amendment can be seen as a strengthening of the democratic process <Col N="1377" /> in our community.  As such the step we are taking is enlightened and of truly historic significance and we are fully committed to it unequivocally.  If we as a people mark our respect for the life and dignity of the unborn, who knows what ripples may flow throughout the world which has lost its reverence for life in the womb through the degrading practice of abortion.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of the experiences in other countries.  The experience in America is particularly relevant.  There are those who say that there has been an American holocaust, and it has been a holocaust if one considers the vast numbers of babies aborted there.  There are those who say this could never happen here, yet if we look at the growth of well funded pressure groups and their abortion referrals to Great Britain, we can see that already we are well under way.  In addition we have a Women's Right to Choose group which I understand provide an abortion referral service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue from my notes.  The approach we are seeing here is similar to the experience in the United States during the sixties.  This led to the Supreme Court decision of 1973 that unborn children are not persons, under section 1 of the 14th Amendment.  As the Minister has said, this is based on the right to personal privacy of choice whether or not to abort.  The American Supreme Court also held that a State may not enact laws protecting unborn children for the period prior to their being viable &mdash; that is, able to live outside the mother's womb &mdash; which is taken in their context, as between 24 and 28 weeks. <Col N="1378" /> There, the professionals of the Supreme Court made a decision, by a majority of 7 to 2, to legalise abortion on demand, the people having no say in this matter. Subsequent decisions have gone much further.  Since January 1973, over 12 million abortions have been recorded in the United States.  This is the nature of the holocaust there.  The present figure for pre-born children killed in the United States is over 1.5 million &mdash; this, at a time when only 100,000 children are available for adoption and the number of families or couples seeking to adopt is registered as 800,000.</P>
      <P>In the United States there is a growing revulsion against the present abortion practices and an amendment to the Constitution is seen as the only way to prevent abortion.  Proposed amendments have taken various forms &mdash; one would protect life from the time of conception, while another would permit each state to decide on its own abortion laws.  Almost half of the United States legislators have already called for a special constitutional convention to pass a pro-life amendment. There is a considerable movement in the United States as a result of a revulsion against widescale abortion.  I could talk for some time from notes and references if Deputy Molony wishes.  One case was recently reported of a container which obviously went astray and, as containers can do, became trans-shipped to a wrong destination and left aside.  Eventually, that container was found to contain 17,000 unborn babies.  That is a matter of record and I could give a good deal more information relating to that case.  It indicates the proportions of the holocaust and the business which has developed regarding abortion.  Tremendous problems have been created there because of difficulties in relation to burial following the Supreme Court's decision that unborn children are not children.  That matter has been decided only quite recently and these children have gone for burial.  There are many similar incidents of the horrifying practices which have developed because professionals were given the freedom to decide for all the people at Supreme Court level by a majority vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> Britain was once constrained, as we are still, by the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act.  However, they now have abortion on demand under their 1967 Abortion Act.  Initially, the British Parlaiment clearly intended to limit the situation in which abortion would be available but this has not worked.  Between 1967 and 1982, over 2 million unborn children were killed in national health service hospitals and state licensed private abortion clinics. Their annual rate of abortion is estimated at 180,000.  One very significant feature of the British system is that 94 per cent of women who attended pregnancy advisory centres had abortions. Nearly 90 per cent of abortions in the private sector were carried out for the mental health of the mother and 99 per cent of these were on grounds of neurosis and transient situational disturbances.  In effect, Britain now has abortion for social convenience.  In these cases, abortion can hardly be said to provide an emotional cure, but rather a physical one.  Therefore, only about 2 per cent of UK cases are as the Act originally intended.</P>
    <P>The number of Irish women being referred to the UK for abortion has increased from 64 in 1968, just after the Act was introduced, to 3,603 in 1981.  The British figures are particularly horrifying. One would wonder how such a large figure as 94 per cent could end up having abortions.</P>
    <P>Journalists do some very good investigative work from time to time.  One such investigation was done by Michael Lich-field and Susan Kentish regarding the British abortion business.  Their under-cover studies of the clinics and referral centres confirm absolutely the figures originally accepted in relation to the number of pregnant women having abortions. Indeed, they indicate that in many cases there is no pregnancy when these people are sent for abortion.  There have been a number of formal investigations, but these were always done with pre-advice on the visit and the questions to be asked.</P>
    <P>Many Irish women who go to England are referred there by pregnancy counselling services in Dublin.  It can therefore <Col N="1380" /> be assumed that a high percentage of counselling sessions would also result in abortion.  Perhaps some of our journalists might like to investigate this situation.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of abortion internationally, one of the reasons given for abortion and sometimes put into practice by health services in some countries is the need to avoid serious mental or physical handicap.  We have a very special regard for the handicapped and their right to life, which contrasts starkly with the approach in some European neighbour states where unborn children known to have serious physical or mental abnormalities are aborted.  In statistics, the lower British incidence of such disorders as mental handicap and spina bifida is affected very much by the process of aborting a large proportion of these cases.  A classical example of this took place recently in the United States when one of a pair of twins was diagnosed as suffering from Downs Syndrome.  What was done in that case was that the medical staff in a special operation pierced the mother's womb and then the heart of the Downs Syndrome child with a large syringe, withdrawing its life fluids causing it to die.  Can one honestly say then that such children have no part to play in our lives?  If we look at the love and affection which such handicapped children can bring to their families and communities one certainly recognises the contribution they can make to society.  One might well pose the question: who has the right to deprive mankind of the literary genius of a spastic like Christy Brown or indeed Christopher Nolan?</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the cost of the referendum by those opposed to it. They maintain that this would constitute a waste of money, arguing that it would be a waste of resources at this time when there is so much pressure in so many areas.  Clearly the state of our public finances, as we shall discover this afternoon, is such that every effort should be made to carefully scrutinise public expenditure ensuring that it is justified. As it is, we devote a very large proportion of our collective resources to services for the elderly, for the young and disabled. Through our policies of taxation we redistribute <Col N="1381" /> our wealth and resources, ensuring that all can enjoy a decent standard of living.  In a way this is a reflection of our basic values and fundamental approach to our community.  Our record in the provision of services is as good as, if not in some instances better than, that of other countries economically much better off.</P>
    <P>The right to life, then, should rank with other basic rights and should be involved in a similar way in such commitment. Given the importance we attach to this fundamental right, the estimated £750,000 involved in conducting a referendum is, in my view, entirely justifiable. Indeed, through this exercise we shall confirm both now and for the future our adherence to this fundamental principle. In any event the money will be spent on the creation of employment over a short period in printing and so on.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that we in Fianna Fáil regard the provision of support services of primary importance.  In introducing this Bill in the first instance it was our intention to effect parallel improvements in the support services available here.  We have made some progress in that regard already but we saw the introduction of the constitutional amendment as a time when we should strengthen our approach in that direction.  The insertion of the clause into our Constitution is in itself insufficient to solve the problem of abortion in our society.  We are all in this House only too well aware of the number of women who have recourse to abortion services in Britain.  That is the reason I believe that the passage of this Bill should mark the beginning of a sustained campaign to ensure that the services Irish women need in this regard are provided, that they are not pressured into seeking solutions in abortion clinics in other countries.  We must be satisfied that the support services are available to them, that they will provide the most sophisticated assistance, advice and care that can be given.</P>
    <P>We are aware also of the great efforts made by the personal social services, both statutory and voluntary in this regard, organisations such as CURA and ALLY to assist women, particularly <Col N="1382" /> pregnant women and single parents, in their difficulties.  There is an onus on us in this House, particularly in discussing this Bill, to ensure that adequate funds are provided for this purpose.  It was our intention to ensure that these services would have the level of support necessary for them to continue and expand their work.  Of course material support alone is not sufficient.  How many of these women have sought a solution to their problems through abortion, who have been led to do so by the attitudes of families, friends and the community generally. I know, from my own experience and from what we read, that general attitudes in that regard have improved enormously in recent years.  A supportive attitude within the community is crucial if we are to provide the assistance needed by such people at that difficult time. Therefore when we assert in our Constitution that we respect the life of the unborn child we must ensure that our actions accord in that respect.  There is now an opportunity afforded us all to make that a reality.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the wording of the amendment.  I am sure this aspect will be discussed further in the course of this debate.  When we in Fianna Fáil assumed office the challenge confronting us was to find a satisfactory and acceptable wording for the amendment which would fulfil the promises and pledges we had made in that regard.  Of course the previous Coalition Government, in their short period in office, failed to do so.  In particular we wanted to draft an amendment which would reflect the values we held in common, which would not alter the medical or legal <i>status quo.</i> That is what we were endeavouring to do.  I appreciate that that is what the Minister would like to achieve.  We were most anxious also that the amendment would be neither sectarian nor divisive. Naturally, we had to become involved in a great deal of research as to what exactly were the current legal and medical practices. In particular we had to take account of certain operations carried out on mothers whose lives would otherwise be endangered and which might, as a side effect entail a termination of pregnancy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> However the issue is not one of law or medical practice only.  What is at issue is the preservation of a fundamental human right: the right to life of the unborn child. Throughout the civilised world it is generally accepted that this fundamental right should be enshrined in Constitutions, or in somewhat similar Bills of Rights.  These fundamental rights are to be found in every Constitution in the world and are not merely a matter for legislation.  Some criticisms of the pro-life amendment come from sources which are unfamiliar with this approach and where their own country may not have a written Constitution.  Britain's position as a country without a written Constitution is fairly unique internationally but the fact is we are an independent State and like all modern countries we have a written Constitution. Fundamental rights are precisely what should be contained in a written Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church would appear to hold that the right to life of the unborn is a fundamental right.  The Minister quoted the Lambeth Conference in 1958.  It was stated at that conference&mdash;this has been quoted in correspondence from the Mothers' Union of Ireland&mdash;that:</P>
    <P>The sacredness of life is, in Christian eyes, an absolute which should not be violated.</P>
    <P>The necessity in legal terms for particular clauses in a written Constitution is something which may be open to argument. The Constitution applies to the law and not directly to individual cases.  One could argue as to the need for a clause in the Constitution requiring collective responsibility of Members of the Government since the two parties at present in Government seem to be determined to find their own way around that.  It is easy to see why people who believe in the efficacy of the protection afforded by a written Constitution should be concerned that the right to life of the unborn should be included.  On the other hand, it is difficult to see how people can become passionately worked up about the alleged lack of necessity for the amendment.  If, <Col N="1384" /> as they so often say, all that is wrong with the amendment is that it is not necessary and there is sufficient cover already, why are they so concerned about having such an amendment?</P>
    <P>As a party we consulted the representatives of all the Churches in Ireland including the Irish Council of Churches in Belfast.  The representatives of the Protestant Churches had initially some misgivings mainly based on a misconception of the Government's intentions. They feared the Government might put forward an amendment which would reflect only the Catholic teaching.  It would not be an exaggeration to say that the wording took full account of the Protestant thinking at that time.  When the amendment was published we were entitled to believe following these discussions that we had secured the general support and agreement of the Church of Ireland and the Catholic Church at the highest levels and either a benevolent attitude or lack of opposition from most of the other Churches.  This view was consolidated by a statement made yesterday by a group of Protestant ministers representing four denominations&mdash;Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, Methodist and Baptist &mdash; and read on their behalf by Reverend Mr. Sidney Garland, Presbyterian Church, Northern Ireland.  It was presented at a news conference held by the pro-life amendment campaign in the Shelbourne Hotel.  It stated:</P>
    <P>We rejoice in the continuing protection which the Pro-Life amendment would ensure for the unborn child.  We agree that the unborn as well as the born have a right to life.  We accept that the life of the mother is also protected in the wording of the amendment. We reject the criticisms of the amendment put forward in some recent Protestant statements.</P>
    <P>We do not accept that the proposed amendment is sectarian.  Abortion is not exclusively a Roman Catholic issue.  It is a matter of basic human rights.  The right to life of the unborn is based on the indisputable scientific fact that human life begins at fertilisation. As Professor Jerome Le Jeune, the world renowned geneticist said: If <Col N="1385" /> a fertilised egg is not by itself a full human being it can never become a man because something would have to be added to it.  We know that that does not happen.  The foetus is a human being.  Genetically it is complete.  This is not an opinion; it is a fact.</P>
    <P>To continue with the quotation of the four Protestant Ministers, they say:</P>
    <P>There is nothing sectarian about these facts.  The medical evidence concerning the beginning of life does not change whether you are a Catholic or Protestant.  We do not accept that the proposed amendment will enshrine the Roman Catholic view on abortion in the Constitution.  The amendment is entirely in accord with our Protestant view of abortion.  There are differences among Protestants on the issue of abortion. However we believe the majority of Protestants will support the proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>They called on us not to be deflected from our common objective but to realise the common ground in this amendment between Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter, North and South.  They stated:</P>
    <P>We call on the politicans and people of Ireland to support this amendment and to say loud and clear both to their own critics and a watching world that abortion is wrong and uncivilised and that social problems are not dissolved by killing.  We call also for increased efforts to provide practical and caring support for any woman facing a problem pregnancy.</P>
    <P>We do not accept that a pro-life Amendment to the Republic's Constitution would worsen relations with the Protestants of Northern Ireland.  In fact this is one area where there is opportunity for agreement and common approach.  A recent gallup poll has shown that the views of the peoples of both parts of Ireland very nearly converge on the issue of abortion.  It is a fact that Protestants have been at the forefront of LIFE&mdash;a pro-life organisation which is growing rapidly in Northern Ireland.  LIFE have received public support from politicians on all sides including leading members of the <Col N="1386" /> official Unionist and Democratic Parties.</P>
    <P>In many respects it is fortuitous that on the eve of the debate in this House these Protestant gentlemen should make their position clear and get away from the suggestion of a sectarian position or a Catholic approach in relation to the amendment.</P>
    <P>The amendment does not contain any prohibition.  It is stated in very positive terms.  Already this has been misrepresented in some of the speeches and communications which have been made.  All the Protestant Churches in their discussions expressed relief at the fact that there was no prohibition involved in it.  It is difficult to say why so much is made of statements that oppose the constitutional prohibition when no constitutional prohibition is at issue.  It is misleading to suggest that it is.</P>
    <P>Despite what would undoubtedly have been the wish of the promoters of this amendment and the majority church in this island, there is no attempt in the wording of the amendment to define the moment at which the life of the unborn begins.  The amendment does not attempt to make this definition.  Most, of course, would argue that it begins at the time of conception, but this is a matter of theological and scientific argument and in preparing the wording of the amendment we felt it was not appropriate to the Constitution to have such definitions.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the wording to the equal right to life of the mother.  Many references have been made to fears, whether justified or not, in the Protestant Churches that the right to life of the mother might, if a choice had to be made, be sacrificed to the right to life of the unborn.  While many felt that such a reference in the wording was unnecessary because the right to life of the mother, as the right to life of all other citizens, was already very explicitly guaranteed within the Constitution, nevertheless following discussions and deliberations the right to life of the mother was made quite clear in the wording chosen.  It is hard to understand why a statement issued by the Church of Ireland on 16 November and interpreted as at least qualified support <Col N="1387" /> for the amendment should now be interpreted as opposition to the amendment.</P>
    <P>The extent to which this issue has become politicised is regrettable, particularly the sectarian ground on which the argument is being made.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have his opportunity to speak in due course.  I am not talking about the party political aspect but about the debate which is being developed outside in which the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; has been introduced on a political basis as grounds on which to fight the argument.  I believe this is intellectually dishonest and politically very harmful.</P>
      <P>Some newspaper editors have done service in the past in presenting the ideals of a new Ireland and these same newspaper editors are doing no service now by misrepresenting the nature of the amendment and, by extension, the nature of our country and what we stand for.  The battle is not between one denomination and another but between those who want a society which would reflect human and traditional Irish values and those who want a secular society where abortion would eventually be permitted. There are people who make that case.  The Minister has referred to groups with whom he would have no particular sympathy because he accepts that there is a political argument.  He has made his personal position quite clear.</P>
      <P>Various individuals have sought to create the impression that the Protestant Churches were opposed to the amendment. The Evangelical Presbyterian clergyman, the Reverend Sidney Garland, has said: &ldquo;I am aware that certain Protestant Church Committees have been critical of the proposed pro-life amendment. I would contend that these committees are not reflecting grassroots Protestant opinion in Ireland&rdquo;.  It is clear that many Protestant people would support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not forget that on this island <Col N="1388" /> there are some people who would have a political interest in trying to depict this part of the island as a sectarian State.  In this respect the behaviour of the Coalition with regard to the amendment is a somewhat unedifying spectacle.  In May 1981 the present Taoiseach wished to give his support to the proposed amendment and he went so far as to hound out of his party a vice-president of Young Fine Gael for daring to suggest that abortion might be justified in certain circumstances. The deputy leader of the Labour Party also rushed in to sign an unconditional pledge of support for SPUC.  The following autumn Deputy FitzGerald launched his constitutional crusade in terms which many of his own party disowned and which insulted the people and the institutions of the State by calling them sectarian.  He is now seen to be hoist with his own petard in this respect. If he was willing to misrepresent some of our existing laws and constitutional clauses as sectarian, then it can legitimately be asked what is so different about the pro-life amendment.  Contradictions which come from his political opportunism are now clearly exposed.  His reputation and standing are therefore not advanced.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil gave a commitment to this amendment and if it were not for Fianna Fáil this Bill would never have come before the House.  The wranglings and evasions of the Fine Gael Party in the past two years were obvious right up to the party conference last autumn and it was only when we had discovered the solution to their problems that they rushed in to accept it.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are also at sixes and sevens on this issue and the Cabinet itself is divided.  It is very strange that the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, who would be primarily responsible for the care of the unborn, should be opposed to any constitutional protection for them. He is also in constitutional contradiction with himself in that as Minister he shares collective responsibility for the Bill while at the same time he is against the Bill.  He has explained this away by saying he is in favour of its introduction but not in favour of its passage through the House. <Col N="1389" /> I am sure he will have a good deal more to say on this because he has created a very confused situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some comment on the controversies surrounding press and television coverage.  Since the whole question is now a political issue to be decided by the electorate in a referendum, I believe there can be no case for stifling discussion of the matter on any suitable programmes.  On the other hand, media coverage of this issue has on the whole been unbalanced in favour of the anti-amendment case.  The views of the vast majority of women have not yet been sufficiently presented in any balanced fashion either on RTE or in the newspapers. I trust that now that the debate has begun in the House we will have a balanced presentation in the media and an open debate.  Indeed, critics of the amendment are attempting to show that consulting the people in a referendum is almost undemocratic.  How can a vote by the people be described as undemocratic? Are many of our so-called liberals anti-democratic or elitest?  Surely the putting of an amendment to the people for decision is one of the most democratic steps that can be taken, especially in a country where we have a free and open media.</P>
    <P>The opponents of the amendment are using might and main to try to prevent the referendum taking place, or at least to have it deferred.  That is obvious in various statements made recently.  It concerned me greatly when I heard the Minister this morning suggesting that he was making a very open presentation in which he was committed to the principle but not necessarily to the amendment which he had presented.  I do not believe that those who try to make the case against the amendment to the Constitution want popular consultation.  My reason for that view is because they know that their views are not widely shared.  Fianna Fáil can be proud of its achievement in bringing forward this amendment which has been acknowledged by Fine Gael to be as well worded as possible.  As a party we have been consistent in our approach on this matter.  Despite what may be said, representatives of all traditions were <Col N="1390" /> involved in the preparing of the wording of this amendment.  The chosen formula incorporates the views of Catholics, Protestants and Dissenters and does not conflict in any way with true republican principles. That fact should be publicly acknowledged rather than allowing misrepresentation to continue.  The thorough consultations that took place before the wording was finalised make it a model for constitutional change for the future.</P>
    <P>I have tried to cover broadly our approach when we introduced the Bill when in Government.  The Bill is being reintroduced exactly as it was when we put it to the House.  I am glad the Coalition have introduced it and I hope that notwithstanding the two-handed approach adopted by the Minister &mdash; he said on the one hand that he would consider one situation and on the other hand he would consider another &mdash; he will be committed to bringing the Bill through the House as quickly as practicable.  I hope there will not be any deferring of the Bill in an effort to put off the day when it can be put to the Irish people.  I am suspicious when I hear people introducing the type of measures that have been introduced elsewhere to put off constitutional amendments.  When I consider what has happened elsewhere I become fearful because similar processes are being introduced here.  I hope the Minister has the conviction to press ahead with this Bill and have it passed so that the amendment can be put before our people with the greatest speed possible. Certainly if he does that, he will have our full support.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister clarify two things for me before we move to the next speaker?  I always understood that the rules of the House were that a Minister in introducing a Bill to the House recommends it <i>in toto</i> and that such a Bill may be amended in the course of Committee Stage or Report Stage.  On this occasion the Minister has introduced a Bill which proposes an amendment to the Constitution but in the course of his speech he has only asked for agreement to it in principle.  Therefore, I submit that the Minister is not recommending <Col N="1391" /> anything to the House.  Secondly, I should like to know if the Minister has an amendment in mind to be introduced on Committee Stage.  If he has, it would be helpful for those of us who are interested in this measure if he made us aware of it.  It would lead to a more constructive debate.</P>

      <P>The Bill looks like generating a great deal of feeling and, naturally, offers to the Opposition an opportunity, as they see it, to shift difficulties which they have been labouring under, and still are, somewhat out of sight and replace them, in the focus of media attention, by the difficulties of others.  It is because of that that I should like to make it clear now how I intend to vote on this Bill and why.  The majority, as I understood <Col N="1392" /> it, even the unanimous judgment of my party, was in favour of amending the Constitution in the sense which the Bill represents.  It causes me no difficulty of conscience whatsoever to accept that majority judgment and I propose to follow it and be part of it.  I intend to support the Bill for that reason; but also for another reason: although I have reservations about the mode by which the Bill has reached the House, and the political background to the entire movement which achieved a response at Government level, if I were to do anything else but support it &mdash; if I were to vote against it or abstain &mdash; it would not represent my true feelings on the subject.  That is quite apart from the fact that, were I to do anything else, it would instantly be misconstrued, sincerely no doubt by some people, and accidentally by others, but also, I have no doubt, unscrupulously and maliciously by others.</P>
      <P>I feel a certain diffidence which it would be seemly in every Deputy to feel in laying down the law or being part of a debate which lays down the law on moral issues.  None of us is perfect.  I must confess to a feeling of distaste at hearing somebody express positive moral injunctions, particularly when they are ones which in the nature of things he is never going to be called upon to decide whether to obey or disobey.  But at the same time I find the termination of a pregnancy by interference, I find abortion a revolting and horrible thing.  It is easy to be revolted by the sins of others, particularly when one is in the nature of things in no danger of being tempted oneself.  It is easy and cheap, and I do not want credit from anybody for saying that I find abortion revolting.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, if I were to do anything but support this Bill, it would misrepresent those feelings and disguise them.  I see no reason to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go any further, having made that as clear as I possibly can make it, I want to protest against the way this issue has been politicised.  I heard Deputy Woods beginning to utter a similar protest and, when I checked him on the grounds that, above all people, he and his party were the least well entitled to <Col N="1393" /> make such a protest, he appeared to shift his ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the way in which a delicate moral issue has been politicised as disgusting.  I regard it as disgusting that the Leaders of the two biggest parties should have felt compelled &mdash; I will not say by any ill-intentioned threats; it would be quite unfair to any group to say they were compelled &mdash; in the heat of an approaching election to give undertakings about a matter so serious as amending our Constitution.</P>
      <P>I regard it as disgusting that the Leader of the party opposite, at the outset of the November 1982 general election, should have sought to fight the election on that issue.  At one of his opening press conferences he said he intended to make this an issue, and it was only when he discovered that neither the press, the people or his political opponents were interested in making it an issue, that he dropped it.  He was willing to make it an issue &mdash; and let me say this &mdash; not because I believe he is particularly, or peculiarly, or uniquely interested in this matter, but purely because he thought it might be a means of embarrassing political opponents.</P>
      <P>To make a political issue of a legislative proposal in regard to land ownership, or free school transport, or something of that kind, is fair game I suppose.  To make a political issue of something like this is a disgusting operation.  It would have been beneath our political leaders in the twenties, the thirties, the forties, the fifties and the sixties.  In the days when John Costello on one side of the House and Eamon de Valera on the other side were in confrontation on a wide range of issues, I do not believe for a moment that either of those gentlemen would have stooped to indulging at political level in a debate on a matter of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fifties were very pious days.  These were the days when I was a student and first became interested in watching and reading about politics.  Mr. de Valera and <Col N="1394" /> Mr. Costello were intensely devoted and loyal Catholics.  I do not think their personal practices need to be brought into this, but marginally I might be allowed to say that both were known to attend Mass and receive Communion daily.  In those days that was, and still would be regarded as, a fair and genuine index of one's devotion to one's church if one was a Catholic.</P>
    <P>Neither of those gentlemen would have stooped to trying to batter the other over the head by alleging, or allowing it to be supposed by the simplest and most backward supporter or potential supporter, that the other was in some way dubious on a serious moral issue, that in some way he could not be relied on to do the right thing.  That would have been so far beneath John Costello that he could not even have seen an argument like that.  I believe the very same was true of Eamon de Valera.</P>
    <P>I can say the same with equal emphasis about the leaders on both sides who came after them.  I believe the same was true of Sean Lemass as it is of Liam Cosgrave. The same is true of the leader of this Government who did not set out to make this an issue in the 1982 election.  If I had been in his place in the heat of an election on which a great deal depended, and forced to deal on that basis with people I knew were unscrupulous rogues, I too might have been rushed into a decision or an undertaking the objectives of which I might heartily agree with, as I do in this instance, but the modalities and methods by which it was arrived at I think were unwise and not necessarily in the public interest.</P>
    <P>It is a dreadful reflection on the degeneracy of the way in which politics is now conducted that, with all the other things we might have done with the Constitution, we now find ourselves debating this Bill today for no other reason than that a well-meaning &mdash; and I concede that 100 per cent &mdash; concerned and anguished lobby came forward within the visible octave of an election in 1981, and again in 1982, and extracted from party leaders what ultimately amounted to a commitment on an ultimatum to which there was a date attached, if you do not mind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> I have said &mdash; and I hope I do not need to say it again &mdash; that the right to speak the truth and not be misrepresented is, in its own humble way, as absolute as the right to life.  I hope that truth in its own important way is as sacred as the right to life.  The right to speak the truth as one sees it is entitled to respect even from those who do not agree with your vision of it.</P>
    <P>I have said &mdash; and I do not want to go on saying it &mdash; that I abominate the idea of abortion.  I never would support the repeal of any legislation which forbids it. I deplore it, and anything useful I could do to prevent people from resorting to it I would do.  I say that in one breath but, in another breath with which the first is perfectly consistent, I protest against the political mechanisms and the methods by which this legislation has reached us here today.</P>
    <P>I could not but be nauseated as every decent person in the country was, no matter what their view on this amendment, at the sight of some Deputies whom I will not name because I do not particurly want to wound them, who went out of their way in the recent election campaigns to try to pretend that a vote given to Fine Gael was a vote for people who were unsound on an issue of this kind.  I remember one western Deputy in particular, a man I never knew to make a speech inside or outside this House, except perhaps at his own church gate, who went public on this issue.  He is a nice man to meet, and I have no personal quarrel with him.  He never gave me any cause for offence; but it is a sad reflection on politics that a representative of the Irish people should put himself before the notice of the public for the purpose only of suggesting what he must have known as an untruth about his opponents in another party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods made a couple of points in which I must concede there was some substance, but he was very careful to steer away from the one point which would have interested me, namely: Is it necessary to amend the Constitution at this time in order to achieve the objective of the right to life, which he so eloquently <Col N="1396" /> described and clearly supports as I do myself?  I do not question his sincerity; but I listened in vain for this in his speech. Where was there any reference in his speech to the legal emergency in this country &mdash; do not mind Arizona or New Jersey &mdash; which calls for this constitutional fire brigade action we are witnessing here today?</P>
    <P>If I get heated or rhetorical on this subject, I hope it will not be taken by anybody inside or outside the House as detracting from the seriousness with which I made my opening remarks.  It is perfectly possible to be bitterly against something and, at the same time, resent seeing it turned into a political football and even the Constitution dragged into it in order to do down opponents or because one party are afraid the other will tell lies about them.  We are reduced to a pitiable condition here.</P>
    <P>The situations which Deputy Dr. Woods was describing in the United States and elsewhere I am sure are a matter of great anguish to people in the United States and elsewhere who share his and my view about the sacredness of life.  But is it possible to conclude that merely because something happens and is tolerated in the United States it is necessarily going to happen here?  No one in this House is more open than I am to the fact that we tend to take our tone from abroad, but there is a big difference in many ways between the culture, ethos, society and traditions of the United States and those in this country.  It is an enormous country with a great variety of facets, and nowhere more so than in the legal field.  In some states there is no death penalty, in others they have the death penalty.  In those states that have a death penalty, they administer it in some by lethal injection and in others by a firing squad &mdash; for which citizens are permitted to volunteer!  Citizens volunteer to be on a firing squad in the state of Utah.  What is law in one state is not law in another.</P>
    <P>What is more important still, what the American Supreme Court says one day, it can say the exact opposite to the next day.  Perhaps that is an extreme instance, I suppose there is not actually an instance <Col N="1397" /> of them changing their minds literally overnight and I do not want to say anything offensive about an august institution in a friendly state; but it has been the case in this century that judgments of the United States Supreme Court have been described disparagingly, not by Irish people but by Americans, as being like one-day railroad tickets, good for that day only.  The Supreme Court has changed its mind on a number of occasions on a number of issues, and everybody knows the political dimensions of the American Supreme Court.  People are able to list the judges there in terms of whether they are liberal, left-wing, right-wing or associated with the President who was behind their nomination.</P>
    <P>In the United States of America the Catholic population, although on the east coast in particular a very important political element of the population, is a minority element.  It is a social minority as well as a numerical one, or was for a very long time.  There has only been one Catholic President in 200 years.  There is rarely more than one Catholic judge on the Supreme Court of nine.  Where is the similarity?  It is a country of very diverse ethnical origins and economic complexion. To say that merely because a thing happens in America one day it is going to happen here the next may be true on the level of pop music or the level of technology, but it most assuredly is not true on the level of ethos, legal or cultural. That this House should be stampeded into something which it would not spontaneously have done, merely because this hare has been raised by some people outside, well though they undoubtedly mean it and sincerely anguished although they undoubtedly are, is a pitiable reflection on the way we do our business in politics here generally and in this House in particular.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a suggestion in regard to the conduct of politics here in future.  That the parties should agree with one another, naturally not in writing but as a matter of honour &mdash; a gentleman's agreement with one another &mdash; that once it comes into the octave of an election &mdash; that is a curious expression as I always understood that octaves are time after <Col N="1398" /> rather than time before &mdash; within visible distance of an election, parties should close down on the reception of representations. It is not right that people should be asked to make up their minds when they have a lot of other things to think about under pressure of political ambition, of having to make serious decisions about their programme, under all kinds of pressure, not least of which is physical fatigue.  That parties should submit to political pressure is lamentable but, since they do not seem to be able to stand up to it, the right thing to do is for political parties to make it clearly understood that when they produce a programme at the outset of an election campaign it is for the people to take or to leave.  That does not imply a lack of sympathy with the people behind a particular movement or lobby, not in the slightest degree, but there should be an understanding that, after a certain moment has arrived, all representations are to be put on the long finger until after the election.</P>
    <P>I realise it is pathetic I should be even talking like this.  We are all supposed to be adult men and women and have a bit of backbone and strength of character. We should not require rules and conventions to protect us from ourselves but, apparently, we do; and there should be a convention that lobbies are not entertained, except to tea, after a given time from the moment an election comes into view.  There is plenty of time between elections to make points of view known and plenty of time for a party or parties to consider those matters maturely and decide what is the right thing to do.  It is regrettable that parties should be pressurised or forced, by fear of the unscrupulousness of their opponents or fear perhaps of the simple-mindedness of people who will misconstrue outside even without one's opponents encouraging them to do so, to take steps which they otherwise would not have done.  If they had the backbone they had in the twenties, thirties and forties it would not be necessary to say all this but the backbone of political parties has been whittled away, softened by the way we organise our politics that I am protesting about this last while. Until we decide what this whole game is <Col N="1399" /> about, what our objectives are and organise ourselves accordingly we are going to get worse and worse and go further and faster downhill.</P>
    <P>How serious are the apprehensions in regard to what our Supreme Court may possibly do?  The only clues which are available as to the Supreme Court's attitude towards this matter are contained in two cases, the cases of Mrs. McGee in 1974 and a case called G. &mdash; it is an abbreviation of a name for reasons of privacy &mdash; G. v. An Bord Uchtála, the Adoption Board, a few years later.  I think that was in 1980 but I have not got the exact date.  In both these cases Mr. Justice Walsh spoke on this very point in terms which are quite unambiguous and I will read them to the House.  I am going to quote from the later case &mdash; G. v. An Bord Uchtála which is in Volume 113 of the Irish Law Times Reports.  Mr. Justice Walsh spoke in both these cases; and it is true that, inasmuch as what he said on this matter was not squarely in issue in either of the cases, what he said can be regarded as an <i>obiter dictum,</i> in other words it does not bind.  <i>Obiter dicta</i> in cases of this importance are not lightly uttered, they are regarded as being the next best thing to a binding authority and are freely cited in court by counsel.  They are treated for all practical purposes as though they were authority, even though they do not have a status in the ordinary hierarchy of binding precedent that we respect here.</P>
    <P>I also want to say, if I may be permitted to do so within the rules of the House, that of all the judges in the Supreme Court there is none whose influence has been so powerful over the last 20 years as that of Mr. Justice Walsh.  I say with respect &mdash; I am not supposed to have any opinions about it &mdash; there are instances in which the Supreme Court as a single court has handed down judgments where it is not visible whether they are majority or unanimous judgments, judgments which have been delivered by Mr. Justice Walsh himself.  Clearly the judge who speaks must belong to the majority &mdash; it would be perverse and cruel to ask a dissenting judge to read the majority <Col N="1400" /> judgment of his colleagues &mdash; and I have no doubt that Mr. Justice Walsh not only physically pronounced but also personally wrote a great number of these judgments. I also have no doubt, so far as it can be said with respect to all the other members of the court in the last 20 years, that there are very few whose authority would be regarded as being as weighty as his.  This is what he said in the case of G. v. An Bord Uchtála:</P>
    <P>The right to life necessarily implies the right to be born, the right to preserve and defend, and to have preserved and defended, that life, and the right to maintain that life at a proper human standard in matters of food, clothing and habitation.  It lies not in the power of the parent who has the primary natural rights and duties in respect of the child to exercise them in such a way as intentionally or by neglect to endanger the health or life of the child or to terminate its existence. The child's natural right to life and all that flows from that right are independent of any right of the parent as such.  I wish here to repeat what I said in <i>McGee's Case</i> (at p. 312):</P>
    <P>... any action on the part of either the husband and the wife or of the State to limit family sizes by endangering &mdash; or destroying human life must necessarily not only be an offence against the common good but also against the guaranteed personal rights of the human life in question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I interpreted that as meaning &mdash; I think I wrote something to that effect &mdash; that the right to life already mentioned in Article 40.3 of the Constitution included the right of an unborn child not to have its existence terminated.</P>
    <P>Naturally lawyers will differ: they could not live if they did not differ and my opinion is no better than that of the next lawyer.  However, I want to state my opinion in so far as a judgment of a future likelihood is an opinion.  I think there is not the smallest chance that Chief Justice O'Higgins, Mr. Justice Walsh, Mr. Justice Griffin, Mr. Justice Hederman and <Col N="1401" /> Mr. Justice McCarthy will at any time interfere with or strike down the old legislation which penalises abortion.  That is a guess based on observing the Supreme Court at work, which is my special interest and hobby.  In so far as I can measure these judges&mdash;and I know them personally&mdash;there is not the slightest chance of it happening.  I cannot foresee what a generation of judges will do 30 or 50 years from now.  I concede freely to the Pro-Life Amendment group and the other groups who take a very sincere and understandable interest in the matter that they are quite right in saying that public opinion here can change rapidly, and has in fact changed rapidly.  The McGee case which was decided in 1973 most certainly would not have been so decided 20 years previously.  If the Supreme Court had been asked in 1953 to strike down that section of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, one would have been laughed out of court.  One would have found it difficult to get solicitor and counsel even to raise such a case.  I would not like to be positive about what might have happened had it been raised in 1963. If one were lucky with one's High Court judge&mdash;I will not mention names&mdash;the High Court in 1963 might have made a decision similar to that made by the Supreme Court in 1973.  However, I would not like to guess whether it would have got through the Supreme Court at that time.  I admit freely that the climate of opinion changes, and that that is a very good instance of changing opinion which was reflected in the judgment of a court.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how fast or how far public opinion is going to change in this matter, but there seems to me to be a huge difference between the matter of contraception and abortion.  I am not a theologian or a doctor: I cannot explain the matter in language appropriate to either of those disciplines, but I feel it by instinct.  There is a huge difference, and I should not have to waste breath on that proposition. I do not think there is the slightest likelihood in any future I can foresee of the danger which the promoters of this amendment fear will come to pass.</P>
    <P>They are afraid that under cover of the privacy of the family, which right has <Col N="1402" /> been recognised by the Supreme Court, there might suddenly creep in the idea that if a family's affairs, particularly at this intimate level, are private their right to decide even after conception whether to add to their family or not must also be private.  By analogy, that right must extend even to an unmarried mother.  I think that is the essence of their apprehension.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the present personnel of the Supreme Court and likely personnel in any future we can foresee, my guess is that likelihood is about as great as that they would use the same right of privacy of the family in order to strike down the laws against cruelty to children or against wife-beating.  A great deal of cruelty to children takes place in the family&mdash;horrible, stomach-turning cases of child neglect and deliberate brutality that one reads about sometimes.  I have no doubt that often these cases are rooted in horrible social conditions, and in despair of one kind or another operating on the parents, but so far as the children are concerned the cases are of unimaginable cruelty.  That is something I feel just as strongly about as abortion, and I would just as strongly oppose any proposal to change the law so as to make it easier to be cruel to children.  However, I do not see any reason to incorporate a special barrier in the Constitution against it, because I think it is just about as likely that the Supreme Court will strike down those laws as that they will strike down the law against abortion.</P>
    <P>Knowing what the party opposite are like, I should not have been so amazed at the contribution of Deputy Woods. Nevertheless, I was amazed to hear him criticise the modest and dispassionate tone of the Minister's speech.  This is a subject that cries out for modesty and lack of passion, for a calm, dispassionate appraisal, not indeed so far as the emotional revulsion towards abortion is concerned, but for anything as serious as amending the Constitution is concerned. That is exactly what it got from the Minister. I was proud I belonged to his party, and I consider it a model speech in a matter of this kind.  Certainly he showed diffidence in regard to the 100 per cent <Col N="1403" /> advisability of this form or that form.  He was perfectly right to do so, and anyone who thinks that this is a matter where diffidence is out of place is being deliberately disingenuous or does not understand what is going on.  Above all, it is not a matter for primitive puffing and blowing, a &ldquo;we're right and you're wrong&rdquo; attitude, such as Fianna Fáil have always shown&mdash;&ldquo;We have the republican interests at heart and we never deviated  ...&rdquo; and so on.  That kind of attitude is quite out of place in a matter like this. Deputy Dr. Woods, whose title suggests higher education at the fourth level, ought to know better than to wish that kind of talk on the House in a matter of this kind.  He should be ashamed of what he said about Deputy Noonan's speech.</P>
    <P>Having said that in praise of the Minister, I would like to make one point if he will not mind me doing so, where it seems that the Minister has sold himself short, or got the wrong end of the stick, or maybe I have got the wrong end of the stick.  I did not know that the Minister was going to say this until I heard him speak an hour ago: he said that in addition to the Supreme Court striking down the legislation of 1861 there was the danger that we might be held in breach of our obligations under the Human Rights Convention in Strasbourg.  Of course that danger exists, as does the danger that we might be held in breach of those obligations by not having a divorce law, and I suppose there are several other things on which we might be at risk in that regard also.  However, I understood that it was a principle of international law&mdash;I am speaking off the top of my head because I have not had the chance to check this&mdash; that an obligation incurred under international law could not be avoided by pointing to one's own domestic Constitution. Of course an instrument such as the European Human Rights Convention is an item of international law.  One cannot say to one's partners in an international convention, &ldquo;We are terribly sorry, we cannot do what you are doing because our Constitution here will not allow us to do it&rdquo;.  One's own Constitution <Col N="1404" /> may provide cover in a civil action in one's own country, but it does not free one of one's international obligations before an international tribunal.</P>
    <P>My point to the Minister, in mild criticism of the way he presented the matter, superb though it was in other respects, is that even if we amend the Constitution in the sense which this amendment proposes, it will not save us from anything in Strasbourg.  Even if we were to spell out in even clearer terms our revulsion at abortion as expressed in Article 40, that will not save us from trouble in Strasbourg. The whole point about an international jurisdiction is that it operates in response to general principles, on which the member countries are broadly agreed, and must operate obligatorily whether or not domestic law inside one of the countries would tend in an opposite direction.  Therefore, we are achieving absolutely nothing so far as the European Convention is concerned by passing an amendment of this kind.  It would be no protection to us.  I am not conversant enough with the European scene to be sure of this, but if it should ever happen that the European Convention appears to impose on us an obligation which is repugnant to the great majority of people in this country &mdash; an obligation of this kind would come into that category for me and probably everybody else in this House &mdash; then it is time to leave the convention, or to derogate from it if it is open to us to do that.  It is no use to us any longer if it obliges us to permit abortion. It would be the exact opposite of what we conceive of as human rights if it obliged us to do that; and we can get out of it very simply by packing up and leaving. That would be sad in a number of ways, and I hope we will not be driven to that length, but I would not countenance for a second staying behind in the European Convention with partners who are running a jurisdictional organ which compels me to assume, for so long as I was part of the convention, that people had a human right to destroy unborn offspring. But we are not protecting ourselves from that consequence by amending the Constitution which, unless I am very much mistaken, is not recognised as <Col N="1405" /> a defence in international law to the charge that one has breached one's international obligations.  As I may be wrong about that, I hope that the Minister will ask his advisers to check on it, because I do not want to make a serious point with such emphasis and end up by misleading him.</P>
    <P>The Minister was particularly good in dealing with the objections raised against this amendment by what I hope I am not offending anybody by calling the pluralist camp.  They do not impress me very much.  Some of the arguments raised against the amendment I would not be associated with under any conditions.  An example is the so-called &ldquo;right to choose&rdquo;.  No doubt it may be a repellent spectacle for someone who thinks otherwise to see a man of middle age laying down the law about what a woman ought or ought not to be allowed to do, and I am very sorry if I offend anybody by doing that.  However, it may be the duty of any Deputy elected here and offering to speak his mind on something to do that.  I do not agree that there is a right to choose in the context in which the argument is advanced.  I would concede to a woman the right, up to the moment when a new life begins within her, to choose her partner, her practices with her partner and so on.  This is a matter too private, intimate and difficult for the State to stick its nose into.  I said that during the 1974 contraception debate here, and again a couple of years ago when we were getting &ldquo;an Irish solution to the Irish problem&rdquo;.  I do not agree with State interference at that level, but when a new life begins &mdash; I hope I do not upset the pluralists by saying this &mdash; a new dimension enters the question.  It is desperately hard on women that it should be so, and if they are in a condition of despair I hope not to be thought short on compassion for that.  I can imagine how hard it is and I never would throw a stone at or condemn anyone who makes the wrong decision.  However, we must stick to recognising that it is not simply a &ldquo;right to choose&rdquo; involving the woman herself but that something further is involved. Another life is involved.  I hate lecturing on such things, and I am not going to go <Col N="1406" /> on about this, but I do not accept the correctness or honesty of this form of argument.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the amendment or the law here are in some way sectarian is ludicrous, given, as the Minister rightly pointed out, that the same law against abortion is enforced in Northern Ireland. I will take no lecturing from the North of Ireland about sectarianism.  I will take no lectures from people who were for 60 years a by-word for sectarianism, bigotry, narrow-mindedness and at whose door, along with that of the British, must ultimately be laid the blame for the blood-shed and horrors that have been seen up there in the last 14 years.  Having said that, I have very much the same feelings as the leader of my party, the Taoiseach, in regard to reconciliation with the North of Ireland.  He has manfully stood his ground about the way the Irish people must develop if we are ever to have peace.  I agree with him entirely on that. He has almost never said anything with which I could feel any disagreement.</P>
    <P>However, in regard to the people who argue about the &ldquo;sectarianism&rdquo; of this amendment, no one ever really envisaged Irish unity in what would be an undifferentiated, non-federal, unitary state.  It is true that <i>The Irish Times</i> was running that theme 12 or 13 years ago with its editor, Mr. Gageby and its principal political commentator, Mr. Healy, who were all-for-one-and-one-for-all boys at the time.  They had stepped into the Moses role, they were heavily into prophesy, and anyone who went in for half-way houses like a federal solution was a milk-sop or a &ldquo;Hibernian&rdquo;&mdash; not to put too fine a point on it, a Hibernian was what they called me &mdash; for talking about a federal solution.  It was to be all or nothing and if only one stripped away the ugly surface one would see the sound United Ireland heart beating beneath the uniform of the RUC man playing a tin whistle, people buying Peggy's Leg at the Oul' Lammas Fair at Ballycastle, all the fun of the fair and so on.  It was blasted away by blood and bombs within a year or two and we have not heard of it since.</P>
    <P>The truth, as Deputy Eamon de Valera, Deputy John Costello, Deputy Liam <Col N="1407" /> Cosgrave and now Deputy Garret FitzGerald recognised, is that if ever there is a constitutional association between the two parts of Ireland this must come via some tentative arrangement the shape of which naturally I cannot foresee and do not wish to try to sketch out here, but must be something of a federal or semi-federal kind.  The whole point about a federal system here or in America is that each federal unit is free on a large range of matters to make its own laws and arrangements, and free within that range to give free play to its own ethos.  That is the whole point of it. If we ever have constitutional association between the North and South of Ireland that pattern will be visible.  There are people in the North of Ireland &mdash; I do not know if they literally represent the numerical majority but they are a large proportion &mdash; who regard it as a scandal in the face of God that people should go into pubs and to football matches on a Sunday.  I do not make fun of that belief, but I do not share it.  I never go to a football match any day of the week myself, but I can see no harm in people going to football matches or playing football on a Sunday, and I can see no harm in them taking a drink any day.</P>

      <P>No.  With respect, I am steering a difficult course here.  I would like to recapitulate, if I may have the indulgence of the other Deputies.  I support the amendment.  I dislike the way it reached the House and the political process by which it arrived.  I honestly do not think it is necessary, but to do anything else than support it would misrepresent my feelings about abortion which are just <Col N="1408" /> as strong as those of the majority inside the House and outside it.  With these reservations and misgivings I will support it.  I am now engaged in trying to answer, in the way the Minister also did, but adding a couple of extra dimensions, the argument that an amendment of this kind is sectarian.  I am pointing to the North of Ireland and saying that if we ever have a constitutional association with them &mdash; it is because of the North of Ireland that this matter has surfaced &mdash; it will necessarily be a federal one and that means that in each part of Ireland the majority must be free to imprint to some degree &mdash; with respect for the local minority naturally in some degree &mdash; to leave the trace of their ethos on the local laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see the reason for the sabbatarianism which is such a large stratum in Northern Protestantism.  I cannot understand why until lately, if it is not still the case, children's swings are locked up on Sundays in Belfast city parks.  That is as strange to me as the habits of Eskimoes or Maoris.  Having said that, I take it for granted that in a federal Ireland, if we ever have such a thing, there will be free play for strong local ethical feelings on topics like that, that the Northern majority not be bullied by us even though we do not share them down here.  Most Catholics or Protestants down here do not share them.  Equally, I do not see that we need to apologise for running our affairs down here in a way that suits us without wishing then to force them on the Northern majority and, of course, with due regard to the real rights of our own local minority.  I do not mean even a formal minority, I mean a minority of dissent because we do not all have to be paid-up members of the Church of Ireland, or the Methodist Church, in order to be regarded as part of a minority &mdash; one does not have to have a religion to be a minority in the terms of an opinion. Although a majority anywhere must expect to be entitled to leave their trace on the general ethos of this society, including its laws, they have to do that with moderation, restraint and respect for the people among them who disagree. I do not believe on that standard which <Col N="1409" /> I am trying to outline here in a few words that this amendment is objectionable.  I do not object to it on those lines.  I have not got a great deal of patience with the arguments which are advanced about the alleged sectarianism of what we are doing.</P>
    <P>The urgency with which we are dealing with this thing is something I must confess I do not altogether understand.  I am not exactly sure why we are stuck to a dead-line. If the people outside the House who have received commitments can be convinced from our demeanour inside the House that the Government are serious about going ahead with this measure they might perhaps be willing to allow that a matter as serious as this cannot be accommodated in a time schedule as tight as that.  I am saying that off the top of my head.  I have no riding instructions from anybody; I am not in cahoots with the Government or anybody else about that; but we may have problems in trying to make a proper job of this Bill and amendment and getting it through this House, the other House and the people before the end of March.  I do not see the need for that urgency.  I would like to recall that in 1976 &mdash; the Minister mentioned this &mdash; when an unforeseen situation developed regarding the adoption laws we had a referendum to plug that loop-hole in a very short time.  I was then Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and I sat at Government meetings at which this matter was discussed.  There was absolutely no delay about to bringing in an amendment to the Constitution in order to plug a very unfortunate loophole.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why that cannot be done in this particular instance if the case should arise, which I do not expect will arise, of the Supreme Court taking leave of its senses, or going against everything which it has given evidence of so far, and striking down the 1861 legislation.  Lay people outside the House may not realise this but the Supreme Court do not just sit at 11 o'clock in the morning one day and say: &ldquo;By the way, before we start we have an announcement to make.  The 1861 law penalising abortion is unconstitutional&rdquo;. That is not how the Supreme <Col N="1410" /> Court works, that is not how any court works.  In order for this danger ever to eventuate, first of all, somebody has to bring an action.  I use the word &ldquo;action&rdquo; in the broadest sense.  There could be a variety of proceedings in which it could arise, but these are highly public proceedings. This is the same in relation to every court document, from a summons or statement of claim which is open to public inspection in the High Court office. These things do not happen in private.</P>
    <P>Let us take, for example, the recent litigation about the rights of homosexuals. That case had a very high profile. The papers reported that the action had been launched.  It was also reported in the papers from time to time that it was coming on.  It was reported when it was due to start and so on.  It started, ran for several days and then there was another long wait until months later before the judge made up his mind.  That is quite right, as matters like that cannot be decided overnight.  There is another long interval before the thing goes to the Supreme Court; or if it has been before the Supreme Court there will be a further long interval before it is decided.  It is not as though any of us will be taken short by the court getting up one fine morning and changing the 1861 law.  We will have plenty of notice that something of this sort is round the corner.</P>
    <P>I do not want, having said this much, to strike a discordant note and I particualrly do not want to deliver to the other side material for alleging that anyone has cold feet.  Suppose there was a feeling &mdash; I hope it will be a feeling with some representatives on the far side of the House &mdash; that at least there was no need for urgency of a kind that would justify spending this year £1 million or £2 million on a special referendum, not to speak of the general social and economic convulsion that any election day causes in the middle of the week, if there were that kind of consensus there are two ways I can think of by which we could save that money while still doing what this amendment proposes.  If I am in a minority of one in proposing it, so be it, but let me just allow these alternatives to surface. Firstly, we could pass this Bill through all <Col N="1411" /> Stages in one House and through all Stages but one in the other House and defer the Final Stage in the second House until the autumn when we are very likely to have a Presidential election in any case, which will bring the people to the poles.  They could decide, as they have done on several former occasions, to decide two issues on the one day and save the taxpayer that much money by so doing.</P>
    <P>The second suggestion, which is more radical, is that we could bring the Bill through all Stages in one House and through all Stages but one in the second House and then let it sit on the Order Paper, in other words, not even proceed with the referendum.  I am not actually advocating that.  I realise it would conflict with a commitment which the Government gave and which the Opposition gave.  I am not advocating it.  I am only saying that suppose a consensus were to emerge that this might be a possible way of proceeding, of not amending the Constitution needlessly, then that would be an option also.  It has never been done before; I am not particularly keen on the idea but, at least, technically it would be possible.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of this matter that may not be understood fully by the people outside who have promoted the legislation.  Unfortunately, they by their action, and the parties by their complacency in agreeing to amend the Constitution in this way, may have done a serious disservice to the cause which these people represent and believe in.  I suspect, and each passing day reinforces my suspicion, that there will be a large vote against the measure.  That is something I would have considered unthinkable at one time.  I would not have considered as much as a 3 per cent vote against a proposal to strengthen the law against abortion would be possible; but for a variety of motives, ranging from those of the out-and-out &ldquo;Womens-Right-to-Choose&rdquo; group to people who do not wish to see £1 million of public money being wasted, there is a wide spectrum of opinion coming from various sources but converging in opposition to this amendment. <Col N="1412" /> When that front has been formed it will be very difficult to dissolve.</P>
    <P>The groups promoting this legislation have created unwittingly what has never existed before, that is, a large secular platform from which in the future repeated attacks will be launched, possibly for the repeal of this amendment. They have created something which I doubt they thought of when starting out. I admit that I had not thought of this either at that time.  While I would not wish to put a figure on what may be the vote against the amendment, I should not be surprised if it were in the region of 20 per cent.  That would be a huge vote against, on an issue of this kind, in a country like ours.  While the amendment is being promoted in the best faith the responsibility for the creation of a secular platform representing a substantial percentage of the population must rest with the ill-advised enthusiasts outside and the cowardice of people inside.</P>
    <P>This whole discussion is rooted in concern for the unborn child.  What I have finally to say bears with particular force on the behaviour of the people opposite during the past five years, though I am addressing my remarks to all sides of the House: I should like our concern for the unborn to surface in a more concrete and more palpable way than merely changing an Article in the Constitution.  I should like us to show concern for the unborn by way of not asking them to pay debts we incur in order to make life easier for ourselves, which is what we have been doing with increasing irresponsibility and recklessness since 1972.  Perhaps the oil crisis made our behaviour defensible to some extent until 1975 or 1976 but since 1977 the situation has gone beyond all control.  The &ldquo;current budget deficit&rdquo; is not simply an economist's stick with which to beat politicians, or to argue about across the House.  It is something which in clear brutal language means that we are enjoying today what the unborn will be deprived of tomorrow.  That is a valid and graphic way of looking at what we have been doing in this State in the past five or six years.</P>
    <P>Again, the blame for that must be attributed to cowardice and to the insane <Col N="1413" /> way in which politics here are structured whereby one on this side is reluctant to advocate taxation in case Deputies opposite will try to make one unpopular for that reason and whereby many of them are slow to advocate taxation because of their being afraid of our telling lies about them.  Although what we are doing today is a pious exercise by way of protecting the unborn against abortion, we are not protecting them against poverty, joblessness and misery of all kinds in the course of their lives.  That is also an aspect that deserves thought on both sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill as circulated but in common with other Deputies on this side I am concerned about the last paragraph in the Minister's speech where he says that in commending the motion to the House he is doing so on the basis that in approving of the principle of the Bill Deputies would not be committing themselves to the wording proposed now or to any other form of wording.  It would appear from that that we are to have an amendment to the Bill as it stands.  But if that is the case, it would be very worthwhile having such amendment before us while the Second Stage is in progress.</P>
      <P>The Bill is one of the most important pieces of social legislation to come before the House since the foundation of the State.  It concerns the most fundamental of all human rights&mdash;the right to life.  If, as I expect, the Bill is passed the people will be given the opportunity by way of referendum of enshrining in our constitution the protection of the unborn child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been argued that there is no need for the amendment at this time.  Deputy Kelly has referred to that but it is recognised that there is not in our Constitution any protection for the unborn child. Article 40 guarantees the protection of the life of the citizen specifically.  It has been stated that when the Constitution was drawn up in 1937 it was never envisaged that there would be any risk to the life of the baby in the womb.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, declares every person born in Ireland to <Col N="1414" /> be an Irish citizen from birth.  In other words, it is only after birth that one has conferred on him the rights bestowed by the 1956 Act.  The Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, is still in force.  That is the legislation which makes abortion illegal.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will replace the fee-per-item system of payment for doctors and pharmacists in the general medical services scheme by a capitation system of payment in view of the major contribution it has made to the cost of our health services and of the potential that now exists for over-prescription and over-visiting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the evidence suggesting that payment of doctors on the basis of a fee-per-item of service may result in excessive visiting and prescribing.  My concern is to ensure that a high quality of general practice continues to be available to the community as a whole, including patients treated under the general medical service.  The future method of payment of GPs is one of the matters to be considered by a working party which is currently reviewing the operation of the GMS.</P>
      <P>I propose to examine the report of the working party before determining my approach to this question.  With regard to pharmacists, the method of payment is not such as to influence the volume of their work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned, as are other Deputies, that under the GMS we spent £48.5 million on drugs last year, excluding fees, and £25 million in the hospital area, the total being £73.5 million. I am convinced that we can substantially reduce that cost figure.  There may well be considerable merit in persuasive formularies such as the British national system.  That would be in line with efforts made by the GMS payments board to encourage doctors to prescribe more economically. We are at the moment examining that situation, but this is a very complex area.  I am also examining it in the context of the elimination of non-prescription items and the recent decision of the former Government which, to an extent, is a formulary of sorts, limiting <Col N="1417" /> drugs available for prescription.  I am very anxious to see the extension of hospital drug committees at all levels.  They could produce formularies for their own hospitals, substantially reducing drug costs.  There is no doubt that the Departments of Health and of Finance will be taking an exceptionally rigorous view of the cost of drugs for the 1984 Estimates.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is a formulary which has been tested in the Eastern Health Board area and gives the basis for the kind of development about which he is speaking? Also, many hospitals have recently established drug committees which have been very effective in bringing down the cost.

      <P>There should be reasonable savings on the proposed new agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries.  Deputy Woods is aware of the drafting of that agreement. I am convinced that there can be further savings in that area, depending on the life of that agreement.  I share the Deputy's views that at hospital and health board levels &mdash; and, indeed, at voluntary hospital level &mdash; very considerable savings could be made.  However, it is one thing saying, another doing it.  I am also concerned to make sure that the hospitals do this.</P>

      <P>Under the European Communities (Proprietary Medicinal Products) Regulations, 1975, a proprietary medicine may be placed on the market here only on the authorisation of the Minister for Health, following the advice of the National Drugs Advisory Board who carry out a detailed assessment of the application.

The board operate arrangements also for the post-marketing surveillance of medicines.</P>

In view of the budgetary commitment last year of £1 million to undertake an emergency programme on a national basis to provide better living accommodation for old people living in insanitary and unfit accommodation, would he not consider this to be a very small amount of money? May I add that, in County Galway, £60,000 only&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of transport subsidies for islanders who are required to attend health clinics on the mainland is a matter for the individual health board concerned.  The boards <Col N="1423" /> mainly involved with the provision of transport services for islanders are the North-Western and Southern Health Boards.  The North-Western Health Board pays the transport costs of islanders attending clinics on the mainland.  In the Western and Southern Health Boards, a patient who incurrs undue hardship in bearing the cost of transport may receive full or partial refund depending on the circumstances of the case.  The health boards will arrange patient transport free of charge in all genuine cases of emergency.  I am satisfied, therefore, that these arrangements are adequate to meet the needs of the islanders concerned.</P>

My personal view &mdash; and this is a matter which will have to be negotiated with the health boards and perhaps additional moneys made available to them &mdash; is that it should be open to the health boards to provide such services, if they so wish, or to subvent voluntary family planning organisations providing those services &mdash; whether a service on a national basis must be made available and the current anomalies in legislation removed.</P>

I am examining that tentative provision at present.  I am not entirely happy with it. The children Bill is a very comprehensive one and I am examining its headings at present.  It is a very complex area because it relates also to the age of criminal responsibility.  There has been no decision taken at Government level yet as to what should be the most appropriate age.</P>

Does the Minister not agree further that this is urgent since there are numerous and ever increasing cases of juveniles being brought by gardaí to Garda stations who, on being brought, have to be released on their own bail of sometimes 50 pence because their parents refuse to bail them out?

      <P>I do not share the Deputy's view in this matter.  As he knows in the Estimates which were published in November a provision was specifically included to cover price increases in 1983.  Undoubtedly recent increases have eroded a portion of that but it is only a small fraction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate the major issues in changing the present entitlement and funding <Col N="1431" /> arrangements in the health services are complex and will need very careful and comprehensive examination.</P>
      <P>I propose to deal with these issues in a White Paper on the Health Services which I propose to publish before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Prior to the publication of the White Paper there will, of course, be full consultation with all interested parties including Government Departments, members of the Oireachtas and of political parties, health boards, voluntary hospitals and other health agencies, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, the various statutory and other bodies dealing with the health professions and the unions and staff organisations concerned.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that he caused considerable concern in a number of areas in the health services because of the statement he made in <i>The Irish Times</i> in relation to his desire for a comprehensive compulsory health insurance scheme incorporating the VHI? Statements such as this can only cause concern among the health boards, the public and those concerned with voluntary hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I also said in that interview that while I was wholly in favour of a universal system of entitlement to the health services on a public national health service basis, we must all be prepared to pay for such a system. Above all it must be an effective cost control system.  With these criteria in mind I intend to prepare a White Paper. Naturally since 30 per cent of the population are in the VHI, the role of the VHI and those who are contributing will have to be encompassed in such a White Paper.  There is no cause for concern but there is cause for concern that we are now spending £980 million a year on health services and I do not believe that the country is getting the kind of service it should have for that money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will release finance to allow the South Eastern Health Board to continue adequate funding of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children centre at Wexford or alternatively make a direct grant to the centre to promote its work on behalf of the disadvantaged families and children in Wexford, in view of the recognition by all Deputies and the people of County Wexford of the tremendous results achieved by this group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would first like to explain briefly the background to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Family Centre at Wexford was established as a three-year pilot project in January 1980.  As the project approached the end of its pilot phase the South-Eastern Health Board, having reviewed its work and achievements concluded that it had not been as effective as conceived at the outset.  The members of the board subsequently agreed unanimously <Col N="1433" /> with the recommendation of its chief executive officer that the board should not continue to fund the project, in its existing form, as from 31 December 1982 which marked the end of its pilot phase.</P>
    <P>However, the health board would like to have the continued involvement of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in child care in the Wexford area but on a basis which the board consider would best meet the needs of the most deprived families of that area. The society has been asked to consider participation in a pilot preventive social work scheme, which the board had designed to meet those needs.  The board's intention is that this pilot study should last for two years; it should be undertaken by a qualified social worker, aided by volunteers, and that the study should be financed by a grant from the board to cover 60 per cent of the (a) costs of the social worker and (b) agreed budget of the family centre.  The society had indicated its willingness to discuss this proposal with the board at a meeting arranged for 4 March next.  The board will not be in a position to make a final decision as to the extent of future funding pending the outcome of that meeting.</P>
    <P>I might emphasise, however, that the board will have to act within its restricted resources.  I am not in a position to increase the financial allocation already made to the board.  Furthermore even if the necessary funds were available to me, it would not be appropriate for me to fund the project by direct grant since it is clearly providing a local service and therefore appropriate to funding by the health board.</P>
    <P>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this centre is still in operation on the basis of local funding?  The operation will cease on 31 March and schemes such as day care for deprived children will have to cease.  How does the Minister propose to cater for this need?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The health board <Col N="1434" /> have a statutory responsibility in relation to child care services, social worker support and the payment of such workers. The health board have, if I recall correctly, four social workers in the County Wexford area and it is of critical importance that the four social workers should be available to the whole of the county and that the limited resources of the health board should not be concentrated solely in one area.  That is the view of the health board.  It is not for the Minister for Health to direct any health board as to their organisational structures in any area, otherwise my Department might as well take over the whole running of every health board operation in every part of the country.  I am very concerned that the conflict which appears to exist between the society and the health board in the Wexford area should be resolved as quickly as possible and I am prepared to give every assistance in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell me why the health board feel that this project was not successful?  All the Wexford Deputies and all the people of Wexford feel that it was an outstanding success.  Is the Minister aware that an arrangement was made between the health board and the local voluntary organisation to review the situation at the end of the project? This review did not take place and the South Eastern Health Board decided to close down the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken a very active interest in this matter, not with a view to cutting across the unanimous policy of the health board in relation to their budget or the professional decisions of the community care team.  I have no intention of interfering in such a way and I am currently trying to help both sides. I may be in a position later, not today, to make my intentions known.  That will become evident to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another question I should like to put to the Minister which arises directly from the question before us.  Deputy Hugh Byrne has asked for adequate funding.  I wonder if the Minister realises how small this amount <Col N="1435" /> of money is.  The sum of £20,000 would see this centre through the next year.  I ask this question from an informed point of view.  I was on the management board of this family centre for over two years and I feel I know what I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would stress that the funding of the centre is a matter for the health board.  It is not a matter for the Department of Health.  It is for the health board to decide on the allocation of resources in the Wexford area.  I cannot direct health boards as to how they should allocate funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the broad range of hazards to public health which may be attributed to environmental conditions, in addition to the traditional transmissible diseases.</P>
      <P>So far as the latter diseases are concerned, there are well-established programmes of vaccination and infectious disease control.  These programmes are under review at present and revised guidance will be issued to health boards shortly.</P>
      <P>As regards other diseases of an environmental origin, which may arise from contamination of food and water, for example, co-operation is maintained between health boards and sanitary authorities.  Medical officers of health and the health inspectors employed by health boards have responsibility for maintaining surveillance in these matters.</P>
      <P>Other Departments also have functions in relation to environmental conditions with a bearing on public health.  For example, the Departments of the Environment and of Industry and Energy have a common concern with my Department as regards the problem of lead pollution. There is a regular exchange of information between the Departments in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another example is radiation, which is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Industry and Energy. Controls are provided for under the Nuclear Energy Act, 1971, and these are being supplemented to conform with an EEC Directive which lays down requirements in relation to the use, recording <Col N="1439" /> and authorisation of radiation apparatus and radio-active substances.</P>
    <P>The Medico-Social Research Board, which is funded by my Department, has carried out a number of research projects relevant to the Deputy's question.  These projects include recent studies of respiratory symptoms in farmers and non-farmers and an investigation of the association between natural background radiation and cancer mortality in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Health Education Bureau also conducts research and develops programmes which are designed to encourage a wider public appreciation of the need for a life-style which is conducive to the prevention of many ailments which are a particular feature of modern living.</P>

    <P>These are the criteria for determining the granting of medical cards in each area.  Differences exist between counties in the percentage of the population covered by medical cards.  The primary cause of these differences relates to such disparities between counties as the income pattern of the region and the age structure of the population.  A study is at present being carried out which seeks to identify other reasons for these differences.</P>

      <P>I was unable to hear all of the Minister's reply but I am not asking him to repeat it.  It was very difficult to hear him.  His reply sounded complicated dealing with age structures and so on.  It seems extraordinary &mdash; and this has not been explained by the Minister in his reply &mdash; why there should be such an enormous disparity between one area and another.  In these difficult times when medical services are so expensive and money is so short it is a matter of grave concern, particularly in Dublin city, that medical cards are not available on the same basis and granted under the same criteria as in other areas.  Is there any evidence that political influence is used in other areas to dispense medical cards like confetti, as is happening?</P>

      <P>The main objectives of budgetary policy this year are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;to reduce the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to reduce and control the current budget deficit;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to minimise the effects of recession and of the necessary adjustment policies on the low-paid and on those on low incomes generally;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" />&mdash;to achieve the necessary moderation in pay policy so that we can reverse the decline in competitiveness which so endangers our employment levels.</P>
    <P>We are in the grip of a severe recession. The natural reaction to this situation would be to prepare a Budget which would give a fiscal stimulus to the economy.  After careful reflection and consideration of all the factors affecting and determining our present situation, the Government have concluded that this course is not open to us.</P>
    <P>In my view, it is vital that we in this House and the people we represent should understand clearly why this is so. The origins of this budget lie almost ten years in the past.  During the sixties, we enjoyed stable, self-sustaining growth which met a sudden shock in the massive oil price rise of 1973.  We faced a real choice then, but instead of reducing our living standards to accommodate this transfer of real resources to the oil producers, we decided, in effect, to avoid the new reality and instead to maintain our living standards and finance them by borrowing.  This was a perfectly acceptable way of dealing with the problem in the short term, provided we were setting in train measures to increase productivity and production and thereby to adjust to the situation in the medium term.  We did, in fact, take some steps towards making the necessary adjustments in the mid-seventies, but unfortunately these measures did not go far enough and the policy was not sustained.  This, in retrospect, can be seen as a major policy error, because at a time when economic conditions were favourable and provided scope for further rectification of the Exchequer position, Exchequer borrowing was in fact substantially increased.</P>
    <P>When the second oil price shock of 1979-80 arrived, therefore, the margin for manoeuvre in the economy which could, perhaps, have absorbed it, had already been taken up and the nation was, collectively, unwilling to face the severe measures which by then were called for.  We continued in the delusion that we could maintain our standards of living by borrowing, even though this <Col N="1471" /> second major increase in oil prices had substantially increased the transfer of resources to the oil producing countries. The world recession then became another reason for cushioning ourselves against reality.  As a result, we were one of the later countries to feel the effects of the recession in terms of lost output and employment.  Borrowing effectively bought us time, but the cost of repaying that borrowing has pre-empted resources for the future.  We must now face that reality.</P>
    <P>The July 1981 supplementary budget was the first real attempt to do this.  The proposed January 1982 Budget aimed at consolidating this turnaround.  The March 1982 Budget interrupted progress on this path and was itself undermined by international and domestic economic developments.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have said that the position we are in today is not the result of recent developments, or of a sudden change in our circumstances.  It is the result of an accumulation of drift over a number of years and cannot be reversed overnight.  We are, therefore, facing two or perhaps three years of unremitting effort to restore a proper balance between expenditure and revenue and to lay the foundations for growth and prosperity in the future.</P>
    <P>As I have said, a beginning was made in July 1981.  The most encouraging aspect of 1982 was that expenditure was kept within the limits set in the Budget, even if by belated action.  This is the first time for years that this has happened.  In the time that has been available to this Government since we took office, we have had to concentrate on making the decisions required to restrain the built-in pressure for further growth in expenditure rather than getting down to the fundamental readjustments which will be necessary.  It is very difficult to change the course of expenditure in the short term and the inescapable rise in unemployment expenditure due to the recession inevitably adds to these difficulties. The main impact of today's budget on the current budget deficit will be largely through tax changes, but our intention is <Col N="1472" /> that expenditure adjustments will be the primary focus of Government attention during the coming year.</P>
    <P>In our Programme for Government we are committed to achieving economic growth and higher employment, while exercising a disciplined financial management and placing special emphasis on competitiveness.  This is a difficult target, but the measures which I will introduce today are a first step on the road to genuine progress.  This policy will require that we bring about a gradual improvement in the State's finances and eliminate the current budget deficit on a phased basis between now and 1987.</P>
    <P>Eliminating the deficit means both extra taxation, on the one hand, and controlling State expenditure on the other. To attempt to close the gap completely by taxation would require levels of taxation which would simply be unacceptable. Cutbacks in services are, therefore, unavoidable.  In curtailing services the Government are taking all possible steps to ensure that the poorer sections of the community do not suffer.  Eliminating the deficit and reducing the stifling weight of past borrowing on current economic and social policies also means recognising, as a community, that we cannot, over the next few years, sustain the level of expectations as to real living standards that has become so widespread in recent years.</P>
    <P>Today's budget is introduced against a background of continuing international recession.  More than once in recent years we have glimpsed a false dawn of recovery, only to have our hopes dashed. There is now a cautious optimism that an improvement is likely later this year and I hope that this optimism will prove justified. This cannot be used, however, as an excuse for inaction, more especially since the impact of any world recovery on our economy cannot be felt before the end of this year; it must rather strengthen our determination to bring about substantial improvement.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Finance in recent years have indicated their concern to establish a more equitable system of taxation.  There has been a widespread recognition that the burden of taxation is unbalanced and is excessive in some <Col N="1473" /> areas.  The extra taxation imposed in this Budget makes it imperative that substantive progress be made in improving taxation equity, and the Government are totally committed to changes in taxation over the next few years which will result in a demonstrably fairer system.  The specific taxation measures in today's budget will bear witness to this commitment.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REFORM OF FINANCIAL PROCEDURES</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government recognises the need for reforms in our parliamentary institutions and financial procedures.  My principal contribution to this process will be to see that procedures relating to public expenditure and taxation are up-dated and that Dáil Éireann is better informed on expenditure developments.</P>
    <P>I intend shortly to publish the results of a pilot exercise which my Department have undertaken, aimed at a new, comprehensive presentation of public expenditure by programme to complement the traditional Estimates volume and other budget publications.  This presentation will identify major areas of policy by activity rather than by departmental responsibility.  It will show the total costs associated with each area, provide background information on the activities and policies being pursued and will develop measures of output and performance where possible.  In the light of reaction to the pilot presentation, I will consider extending this approach to the whole range of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>I also intend to introduce reforms aimed at streamlining the Government accounting system.  Proposals are under preparation in my Department to standardise the information provided in the annual Estimates and to place greater emphasis on expenditure-type classifications. There will also be a better balance between the amount of detail provided and the size of the various provisions.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1474" />THE ECONOMIC SITUATION</P>
    <P>Economic commentators are generally agreed on how the economy performed in 1982 and on the pattern of likely developments in the year ahead.  The outturn for 1982 clearly illustrates the price of failure to take adequate corrective measures in earlier years.  The imbalances in the economy, combined with the continued impact of recession, are now taking a toll in terms of unemployment unmatched since the early thirties.</P>
    <P>Despite Exchequer borrowing of £1,945 million, equivalent to 16½ per cent of GNP, growth in output was only about 1 per cent in 1982 and this growth was in any event more than absorbed by the sharp increase in interest payments abroad.  Furthermore, output in transportable goods industries remained static, while total investment declined and private investment was down for the third successive year.</P>
    <P>This deterioration clearly demonstrates that excessive borrowing is not an antidote for international recession.  Far from helping investment and employment, it adds to the burden of debt service and encourages excessive pay claims which undermine our competitive position.  It also affects confidence, both domestic and foreign, because it suggests that we lack the will to make the necessary adjustments to live within our means.</P>
    <P>There are, admittedly, certain positive features, notably the easing of inflation, the fall in interest rates and the recovery in agricultural output.  The year 1982 also saw a worthwhile increase in industrial exports, but unfortunately this rate of increase is expected to weaken in the year ahead, an ominous reminder of the importance of competitiveness in a weak international market.</P>
    <P>While a modest recovery in international trade is expected during 1983, it is unlikely to be sufficiently strong to have a major impact this year on industrial exports.  Prospects generally for next year are, however, somewhat better: international inflation is coming down, international interest rates have dropped considerably and there are signs of an <Col N="1475" /> increasing willingness by governments to co-ordinate their policies in a mutually supportive way.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the resolution of our present difficulties will take several years of concerted policy action and it will be essential to ensure that all the resources of the nation are brought to the task.  Permanent structures to ensure effective economic and social planning will, therefore, be established and an outline of these planning arrangements has been set out in the &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INCOMES POLICY</P>
    <P>Pay developments will be a critical factor in determining whether the many problems confronting the economy will be eased or worsened.</P>
    <P>In a small economy, as dependent as we are on international trade, we have no alternative but to ensure that our unit costs are brought into line with those of our major competitors for the goods and services we produce.  Otherwise, existing jobs are lost to overseas suppliers and Ireland's attractiveness as a location for new manufacturing and services jobs declines or could even disappear.  A major determinant of changes in our costs is the development of labour costs and, in particular, wages.  In 1982, our wage costs per unit of manufacturing output rose by twice the average of our major trading partners in national currency terms.  The sad consequence of this is that many factories had to close their doors and jobs were lost on a large scale. Some of these jobs would have been lost in any event, but it is a bitter experience to have added to them because of cost increases imposed at our own discretion.</P>
    <P>The latest forecasts for our major trading partners show that their unit wage costs will increase by no more than about 5 per cent on average in 1983.  When account is taken of the carry-over effects of increases here last year, the scope for a further pay rise is very modest, even if our aim is no more than to maintain competitiveness in our main markets.  We <Col N="1476" /> should, of course, be striving not merely to maintain but to improve competitiveness and thereby provide the maximum opportunities for job creation.  At a minimum, a more moderate and responsible approach to pay rates is called for.  The Government recognise the commitment of the social partners to maintaining and increasing employment.  Wage moderation is the only practical way of achieving this on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>As already announced, the Government intend, following the Budget, to have further consultations with the trade unions and the employers on the outlook for the economy and employment, including pay development.  Pending the outcome of these talks and in order not to prejudice their results, the Government have asked all employers and unions, whether in the public or private sector, not to take any action which would set a headline for a new pay round.</P>
    <P>The Government's ability to provide for additional increases in public sector pay is severely curtailed by the state of the public finances.  The Exchequer pay and pensions bill has grown substantially in recent years to a point where it amounted to £2,187 million in 1982.  This represented an increase in excess of £260 million or over 13.5 per cent on the 1981 outturn.  Furthermore, this increase occurred despite the almost total moratorium on special pay increases arising from the terms of the revised public service pay agreement.</P>
    <P>Turning to 1983, the Government were faced with an opening cost for the Exchequer pay and pensions bill of £2,391 million.  This represented an increase of £204 million or 9.3 per cent on the 1982 outturn.  It includes the cost of the deferred 5 per cent third phase of the public service pay agreement, which was paid from 1 January 1983.  The revised public expenditure allocations, which I will deal with later, will reduce this bill by about £16 million.  I must, however, make provision today for an extra £60 million to cover the cost of retrospective payments for the period of deferral of the third phase during 1982 and also the cost of special pay increases which were provided for in the renegotiated <Col N="1477" /> settlement of the public service pay agreement last October.  As a result the Exchequer pay and pensions bill will rise by about £250 million or almost 11½ per cent compared with 1982.</P>
    <P>This leaves little room for a further increase, no matter from how late a date, on the expiration of the present public service pay agreement.  I am, in fact, making no provision in the Budget for any further pay settlements in 1983.  If the outcome of the consultations already referred to necessitates increased expenditure on pay this year, then it will be necessary in turn for the Government to take appropriate measures in order to fund the cost.</P>
    <P>Public sector conditions of service, including pay rates, compare favourably with those in private employment.  In the current recession, with sharply rising unemployment, most public sector workers would agree that they enjoy a sense of security of employment which is lacking in almost every other area of the economy.  This security can be guaranteed only if balance is restored to the national finances, a process which in turn is highly dependent on future developments in public sector pay.  The Government, therefore, feel entitled to call on public sector unions to take full account of the imbalance in the public finances and to have adequate regard to their members' longer-term interests in formulating and negotiating pay claims in 1983.</P>
    <P>I believe that public sector workers should have regard to the overall interests of the national economy and above all to the employment prospects of fellow-workers, the viability of many of whose jobs is currently at risk.  Good industrial relations are also important in attracting industry to this country and in this context I feel that those who have jobs should consider their obligations to those less fortunate.  Thankfully, our record on industrial relations in 1982 was a relatively good one even if our cost increases left much to be desired.  We must get both our costs and industrial relations right in 1983 to make progress in solving the very grave problems facing us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" />PUBLIC SECTOR NUMBERS</P>
    <P>The elimination of unnecessary or out-dated schemes and programmes and the promotion of administrative efficiency are the cornerstones of the Government's policy in relation to public sector numbers. The foundations of this policy were laid in July 1981 with the decision to contain public sector numbers within the levels then obtaining.  Restrictions on the filling of public service vacancies to offset the creation of essential new posts were announced in the Budget Statement of 27 January 1982 and continued in force by the Government statement of 30 July 1982.  The Estimates published last November were prepared on the basis that these restrictions would continue up to the end of 1983.  The effect on public sector numbers is that, for 1983, the arrangement whereby two out of every three vacancies are held open as they arise will continue to apply to the civil service and many non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  This restriction will also apply in full to the officer grades of the local authorities.  Measures of equivalent effect both in terms of numbers employed and costs are being applied in the Defence Forces, the health area and the non-teaching staff in the education sector.</P>
    <P>While these restrictions will yield immediate staff savings, the longer-term savings must be achieved in association with the ongoing review of administrative efficiency and of schemes and programmes of all Departments conducted with the involvement of the Departments of Finance and the Public Service.  These reviews are being intensified forthwith and will embrace all areas under the control of each Minister.  High-level steering committees in each Department will examine, on a continuing basis, all opportunities for increased efficiency and the feasibility of eliminating schemes and programmes or reducing their scope, in order to release staff for redeployment on other more important tasks.</P>
    <P>These measures are directed at the improvement of the cost-effectiveness of administration &mdash; securing better value for money.  Such improvement can be <Col N="1479" /> lasting only if it is part of the general improvement in the management of Government Departments.  The development of better systems of management in all Departments, systems which will place increased responsibility for results on individual managers, will be an important feature of the programme of public service reform being undertaken by the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REVIEW OF BUDGET 1982 OUTTURN</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit for 1982 was £988 million, or 8½ per cent of GNP, and the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement reached £1,945 million, or 16½ per cent of GNP.  While Central Fund Services cost £39 million more than provided for, due mainly to high interest rates, expenditure on current services was £92 million below the March 1982 Budget estimate, due to a combination of the corrective measures taken in July 1982 and restrictions on recruitment and on the filling of public service vacancies.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the Public Capital Programme and on non-programme outlays was £117 million below the March budget estimate, resulting in Exchequer borrowing for capital purposes being £47 million below the March budget figure.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the experience of previous years, the difficulties in 1982 arose from revenue shortfalls rather than expenditure overruns.  These shortfalls reflected both the lower growth in incomes because of the international recession and a steep fall-off in the level of real consumer spending.  The result was major shortfalls in revenue from income tax, VAT and excise duties.</P>
    <P>The overall outturn for 1982 was disappointing. In the event, however, current expenditure for the year was maintained within the target levels set in the March budget, and there was a turnaround in the growth of the Exchequer borrowing requirement as a percentage of GNP.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1480" />EXCHEQUER FINANCING</P>
    <P>Five years ago, the Exchequer's debt service absorbed 77 per cent of income tax revenue.  In 1982 it absorbed the whole of a much higher income tax figure. We cannot go on pre-empting more and more revenue in the service of debt much of which, to make matters worse, has been incurred on capital investments which have produced little or no return. It limits our options for creating an economic climate for development, it limits our options for social policy and constricts our ability to borrow in future for essential purposes.</P>
    <P>DOMESTIC BORROWING</P>
    <P>In 1982, sales of Government securities were a record £736 million.  Sales to the banks represented more than a doubling of 1981 receipts, while sales to the non-bank domestic sector showed an increase of £300 million on the 1981 outturn. Receipts from both sources were heavily influenced by the effects of recession on other investment outlets and we must, therefore, be cautious in assuming that large-scale domestic funds will automatically be available this year to meet Exchequer needs.</P>
    <P>FOREIGN BORROWING</P>
    <P>Net foreign borrowing was £1,148 million in 1982, some £140 million less than in 1981, a reduction in part made possible, as I have already said, by favourable conditions in the domestic gilt market. We must make further progress in reducing our foreign borrowing in 1983.  When we borrow in foreign currencies, the debt must be repaid in those currencies.  If they appreciate, the repayment of the loan costs more in Irish pound terms. Foreign currency appreciation alone added £340 million to the Exchequer's total foreign debt during 1982.</P>
    <P>In addition, much of our foreign borrowing is on a floating interest rate basis. International interest rates are notoriously volatile, as was clearly demonstrated last year.  An increase of just one <Col N="1481" /> per cent in the average rate of interest would cost us about £33 million in interest payments over a full year.</P>
    <P>Foreign interest charges add considerably to the balance of payments deficit, accounting for one half of it in 1982 alone. This represents a real drain out of the country of resources which we need for our future economic and social development and they must be paid for by increased exports in a difficult international climate.</P>
    <P>The position in 1983 is qualitatively different from that in previous years.  For most of the last decade, we have been able to regard foreign borrowing as, in a sense, the residual source of Exchequer finance after both domestic sources and the possibilities of extra taxation had been used.  This may no longer be the case.  Severe strains have become apparent during the past six months in the international banking system.  The well-publicised difficulties of a number of major sovereign and commercial borrowers have caused serious funding problems for lenders.  There is now a real question mark over the ability of the system to continue expanding at the rapid pace of recent years.  While our own ability to borrow is, so far, unimpaired, the international climate of uncertainty underlines the need to reduce our dependence on foreign funds.</P>
    <P>SMALL SAVINGS</P>
    <P>We must, therefore, rely increasingly on our own resources.  Saving is an aspect of that self-reliance and it is a habit which must be encouraged.</P>
    <P>National Savings which are operated through the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Trustee Savings Banks, with the advice of the National Savings Committee, have a number of worthwhile schemes for the small investor. In order to keep up the momentum achieved in recent years, I propose to make the following improvements in selected schemes:</P>
    <P>(i)  I am increasing the maximum amount which persons of 55 years or over may hold in index-linked bonds <Col N="1482" /> from £5,000 to £10,000 and I am introducing joint holdings of the bonds;</P>
    <P>(ii)  I am also increasing from £100 to £150 a month the maximum amount which a person may invest in national instalment savings and reducing from two years to one year the deposit period required to earn an index-linked return on amounts saved under the scheme.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OPENING CURRENT BUDGET DEFICIT AND EXCHEQUER BORROWING REQUIREMENT</P>
    <P>CURRENT DEFICIT</P>
    <P>The pre-budget estimates of receipts and expenditure, published last Saturday, show the opening deficit on current account as £956 million.  This might suggest that, even before taking any measures in this Budget, we have already a starting-point lower than the 1982 outturn. The reality is, unfortunately, a good deal worse.  The £956 million figure is based on the expenditure proposals of the previous Government as published last November and takes account of the excise duties imposed by this Government from 8 January of this year.  As I shall explain later, a number of factors would, in the absence of countervailing action, have added a total of some £134 million to this figure, while the £119 million of excises introduced in January is, properly speaking, a part of this Budget. The combined effect of both these adjustments is to add £253 million to the figure, giving a true opening deficit of £1,209 million.  In addition, a budgetary provision for increases in social welfare payments must also be made and I will deal with these towards the end of this statement.</P>
    <P>CENTRAL FUND SERVICES</P>
    <P>The estimate for expenditure on Central Fund Services this year at £1,650 million shows an increase of £250 million on the 1982 cost of £1,400 million.  The cost of servicing the public debt accounts <Col N="1483" /> for almost £220 million of this increase, with the growth in the size of the public debt substantially outweighing gains from changes in interest costs.</P>
    <P>CURRENT REVENUE</P>
    <P>Tax revenue is estimated at £4,572 million, or almost 13 per cent above the 1982 outturn.  The underlying rate of increase is not as large as in recent years, reflecting a tapering-off both in inflation and in the rate of increase in incomes.  The estimate for non-tax revenue, at £984 million, is 15 per cent above the 1982 outturn.  It allows for a modest growth in Post Office business in 1983.</P>
    <P>The opening revenue figure does not take account of the impact of today's measures on underlying revenue buoyancy and I will be making an adjustment for this in reconciling the total budget arithmetic.  This procedure is a departure from the usual practice, under which the buoyancy impact of the budget was taken into account in the opening revenue figures as published in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure.  The procedure I am adopting represents more accurately the overall impact of the budget.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the major shortfalls in revenue in 1982.  As a consequence, the bases for making tax forecasts have been thoroughly reviewed and I am statisfied that the budget estimates are as accurate as is reasonably possible. This is not to say that there is no uncertainty and that there will be no significant divergences under individual headings. Tax forecasting, particularly at a time of economic uncertainty, is open to a wide degree of error.  I am confident, however, that if economic performance comes up to expectations, the overall tax revenue outturn will be close to target.</P>
    <P>EXCHEQUER BORROWING REQUIREMENT</P>
    <P>The borrowing requirement for capital purposes on the basis of the expenditure proposals as published by the previous Government, plus potential overruns of <Col N="1484" /> £17 million, came to a total of £1,023 million.  If we add to this the true opening current deficit of £1,209 million, it will be seen that I was faced with an opening Exchequer borrowing requirement of £2,232 million.  The magnitude of this figure is in itself a clear indication of where the drift of policies over the last decade was leading us and a measure of the size of the task that faces us in rectifying the public finances.</P>
    <P Just="Center">GENERAL BUDGET STRATEGY 1983</P>
    <P>The Government's room for manoeuvre in framing the budget strategy was, therefore, extremely limited.  I have already mentioned that in normal circumstances there would be arguments for stimulating demand, particularly from the viewpoint of encouraging growth in employment.  The experience of that policy over the last ten years shows that it produces very limited returns.  Its impact on the Exchequer finances has, however, been severe and its continuation is no longer a practical option.</P>
    <P>The consequences of the position are, therefore, crystal-clear.  We must achieve a major reduction in Exchequer borrowing. To defer action for yet another year would be neither prudent nor feasible. The problem would become greater and our capacity to solve it weaker.  The Government have, accordingly, decided on major expenditure and taxation changes with a view to reducing borrowing to a more acceptable level.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PUBLIC EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>The budget does not usually change the thrust of public expenditure policy, since it is normally the same Government which present both the Estimates and the budget.  The Estimates and the Public Capital Programme as presented to this House were, however, adopted by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has already said in this House that he has no doubt that the previous Government would have taken <Col N="1485" /> the necessary policy decisions in respect of all of the published Estimates, and validated the Book of Estimates in due course by so doing, had the Government not changed, or the election not taken place.  But when this Government took office, we found that some of the decisions required to stay within the financial limits implicit in the Estimates remained to be taken.</P>
    <P>The main area in which this situation faced us was in relation to the Exchequer contribution to local authority finances. Furthermore, there were decisions taken by the previous Government which we rejected, a step which involved accepting the implication of higher expenditure unless there were off-setting savings elsewhere. Finally, the provision made in the published Social Welfare Estimate for unemployment was based on a view of the likely average level of unemployment this year which the unexpectedly large increase in the live register figure for recent months has shown to be optimistic.</P>
    <P>Taking account of all of the factors I have mentioned, expenditure in 1983, current and capital, would, in the absence of countervailing action, have been over £150 million higher than decided by the previous Government.  This Government could not accept that position.  Our view was that, for the reasons I have already given, it was imperative to reduce total public expenditure, taking current and capital together, below the level decided by our predecessors.</P>
    <P>As regards current expenditure, the position as decided by this Government is that, after taking the necessary decisions to eliminate excesses and to provide for inescapable commitments, the total revised provision is £4,891 million, or some £29 million more than the provision of £4,862 million in the 1983 Book of Estimates.  Holding current expenditure to this amount has required policy decisions involving some £105 million. Details of these expenditure reductions are set out in detail in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i>, which will be available to Deputies at the end of my speech, and the reductions are summarised at <Col N="1486" /> column (5) of page 2 of that document. The increase of £29 million does not take account of the additional public service pay cost of £60 million to which I have already referred or of any provision for social welfare increases.</P>
    <P>The Government's decisions will be reflected in the full and revised Book of Estimates which will be published in some weeks time.  The Public Capital Programme is also being fully revised and will be republished shortly.  I will mention a few examples here.</P>
    <P>The Government are providing £31 million more for unemployment benefit and assistance payments than was allocated in the published Estimates.  An additional £31.5 million is being provided from the Exchequer to local authorities, by way of the grant in relief of domestic rates and the grant in relief of agricultural rates.  Legislation will be introduced as a matter of urgency under which local authorities are to raise about £65 million in extra revenue themselves by way of new local charges and increases in existing charges.  This they must do on the necessary scale; no further Exchequer aid will be provided this year.</P>
    <P>As regards capital expenditure, the position had been reached by end-1982 that spending on the programme was about 60 per cent higher in real terms than in 1977.  But large elements of the programme, while adding sharply to the burden of interest payments on the Exchequer and State bodies, were having little or no effect on the country's capacity to produce and sell more goods and services on world markets.</P>
    <P>In the light of this experience and having regard to the overriding constraint imposed by the need to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement, the Government have decided to reduce the Public Capital Programme, as published, by £220 million in total.  This reduction includes the deferment for this year of the global contingency provision, pending the emergence of projects which would meet the necessary investment criteria. A provisional allocation of £120 million was made by the previous Government for this, but was not earmarked by it for any particular projects. <Col N="1487" /> Details of the other capital reductions are set out in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i>  A new additional provision of £1 million is being made, however, for the task force on special housing aid for the elderly.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government we undertook to establish a National Development Corporation, which would have a major innovative and developmental role directed towards growth areas of the economy.  Consideration is already being given to the legislative and other measures which need to be taken to establish the corporation.  In the meantime, I am providing £7 million capital for any new projects which the corporation may undertake this year.  This amount is additional to the £3 million capital which has already been provided for projects to be undertaken by the National Enterprise Agency.</P>
    <P>A net reduction of £43 million has also been made in the Exchequer provision for capital restructuring of commercial semi-State bodies.  The final allocation of the reduced sum will be settled by the Government after they have considered further the position of a number of these bodies.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of these steps on capital spending, and taking credit for an increase of £4 million in internal resources, the Exchequer borrowing requirement for capital purposes has been reduced from the £1,006 million associated with the published Public Capital Programme to £825 million.</P>
    <P>CONTROL OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>Given the severe constraints under which we must operate, control of public expenditure is vital.  Every organisation financed out of public funds must give greater emphasis to expenditure control and reduction.  Every public sector manager, including those in the civil service, must regard this as a key aspect of his work.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, an intensified systematic examination of the use of State funds by Government Departments and State agencies is being undertaken <Col N="1488" /> forthwith.  It is also the Government's intention to achieve closer monitoring of the plans and performance of commercial State-sponsored bodies while still recognising their independence in day-to-day operations.  In general, the financial performance of such bodies has not been good and in some cases has deteriorated markedly in recent years despite major investment.  The recession has been a contributory, but not the sole or even the major cause of this; it has merely accentuated existing problems and weaknesses.</P>
    <P>Improved procedures for planning and controlling capital expenditure generally are being prepared.  The Government have already eliminated in their review of the Public Capital Programme expenditures which appeared to them to have insufficient justification.</P>
    <P>TAXATION</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the Government's commitment to achieve a better distribution of taxation and I will now turn my attention to the individual tax measures which form part of today's budget. Before doing so, I should like to outline briefly the Government's overall approach to taxation and to comment on the First Report of the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>There is understandable concern at the present burden of taxation, a concern increased by a widespread feeling that this burden is unfairly distributed.  Unfortunately, the imbalance in the State's finances does not allow tax concessions on any scale in this budget and, indeed, it is necessary to raise additional taxation if current services are not to be curtailed to an unacceptable extent.  We can, however, begin to tackle the problem of tax inequity immediately.  This Budget contains a number of measures which will improve the equity of the tax system and which will, I think, be seen and accepted in this light.  It will be the Government's principal aim to devise tax arrangements under which the heaviest burden will be carried by those who are best able to pay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1489" />COMMISSION ON TAXATION</P>
    <P>The First Report of the Commission on Taxation was published last July.  It deals with various aspects of direct taxation and puts forward numerous proposals for change in the present system. Before turning to the proposals themselves, I should like to congratulate the members of the commission on the excellence of their work.  The report contains a well-researched and well-presented analysis of our taxation arrangements and it will serve as a most useful reference point for the future.</P>
    <P>The report outlines a blueprint for a radical overhaul of the direct taxation system as we know it.  Some of the more important proposals are long-term in nature: it is never easy to overhaul a long-established system.  Fundamental to the Government's approach to the proposals of the commission, no matter how well-founded these may otherwise be, must be the maintenance of an adequate tax revenue yield; otherwise, our public finances would be in disarray.</P>
    <P>The costing of the commission's proposals is, therefore, a critical factor.  This costing shows that a combined single rate of income tax and social security tax levied on all personal and corporate income at a relatively low level, as envisaged by the commission, is not a practical proposition at this time because of the loss to the Exchequer.  This loss could be made good only by introducing the single rate at a level which would be unacceptably high for the majority of taxpayers.  In these circumstances action towards implementing the main thrust of the commission's proposals cannot be undertaken for the time being at least.  I intend, however, to keep the matter under review.</P>
    <P>Some of the commission's recommendations do not depend on the adoption of the general package put forward and can be considered on their individual merits. I am satisfied that changes should be made without further delay in a number of areas along the lines recommended by the commission and I will refer to these later.  The commission are continuing <Col N="1490" /> their work and I look forward to receiving further reports from them later this year.</P>
    <P>INCOME TAX</P>
    <P>There will be no major changes in the income tax structure of personal allowances against income tax.  The question of introducing tax credits is being considered as a longer-term option; it would not be administratively possible to change over to a full tax credit system by April next.</P>
    <P>Most rate bands and allowances will remain unchanged this year.  Moreover, because of the very serious budget situation, I have no option but to impose further taxation on incomes.  I am, therefore, introducing a temporary 1 per cent levy on income.  It will apply to the same income categories and will be collected in the same manner as the youth employment levy introduced last year.  This should yield £47 million in 1983 and about £80 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I think it appropriate also that the better-off be asked to make a further contribution.  I am, therefore, providing for a new top rate of 65 per cent in addition to existing rates.  The 60 per cent band will be £4,000 for married couples and £2,000 for single persons.  This change should yield about £7 million in 1983 and £11 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I recognise that income tax levels are high at present and I would hope that, as our public finances are improved, it will be possible over the next few years to reduce the burden on the average PAYE taxpayer in particular.  For the moment, however, there is no scope for major concessions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>PRSI Allowance</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year a special PRSI tax allowance was introduced as a temporary measure to improve the take-home pay of those who pay the higher rates of contribution. This allowance of £312 was intended to apply for the tax year 1982-83 only.  As there is no opportunity for improvements in rate bands and allowances generally, I am renewing the allowance for a further year subject to a minor modification.  To <Col N="1491" /> ensure that lower-paid families derive greater benefit, I am providing for a new social welfare family income supplement to which I will refer later.  To balance the cost of this supplement, I am reducing the PRSI allowance by £26 to £286.  This renewal of the allowance at the reduced level will cost £55 million in 1983 and £84 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Year of Marriage</i>
    </P>
    <P>Since the introduction of income-splitting in 1980, couples have, in the year of marriage, enjoyed very favourable tax treatment in that they can, in effect, qualify for three times the allowances and rate bands to which a single person is entitled.  The Commission on Taxation point out that this is anomalous and recommend that in the year of marriage both spouses should be taxed as single persons with the right to elect for joint assessment. In such cases the tax repayment should be reduced in the proportion that the period of marriage bears to the full year.  I intend to adopt the Commission's recommendation for 1983-84 and subsequent years.  This will yield £6 million in 1983 and £8 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>General Exemption Limits</i>
    </P>
    <P>The general exemption limits will be increased from £2,200 to £2,400 for single and widowed persons and from £4,400 to £4,800 for married couples.  These improvements and the retention of the PRSI allowance will remove over 21,000 persons from liability to income tax and many more will benefit from marginal relief.  The increase in the general exemption limits will cost £4 million in 1983 and £6 million in a full year.  There will be no change in the age exemption limits.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Personal Interest Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>The existing wide and generous range of income tax reliefs involves a substantial loss of tax revenue.  This factor has been highlighted in the Report of the Commission on Taxation.  Frequently, two taxpayers of equal means pay widely differing amounts of tax because one of <Col N="1492" /> them makes the maximum use of the reliefs available.</P>
    <P>In the budget proposals of last year, major changes in personal interest relief were announced.  The intention at the time was to curtail this relief considerably, but in the event only modest changes were made.  This was largely because of administrative problems.  I am now proposing that in the case of loans taken out after today, other than a mortgage in respect of the borrower's principal private residence, there will be no income tax relief for personal interest for 1983/84 or subsequent years.  In the case of existing non-mortgage loans, or existing mortgages on second homes, no relief for interest will be allowed after 5 April 1985.  Tax reliefs incurred on borrowings for personal and less essential purposes further narrow the tax base, provide a disproportionate benefit as income increases and are very costly to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Mortgage interest is an unavoidable and severe burden for many householders and it would be unfair in the context of my other budgetary proposals to consider the abolition of tax relief in respect of such interest.  The overall ceiling for interest relief, however, at £4,800 for married couples and £2,400 for single persons, is generous and is of particular benefit to the better-off taxpayers who are on the higher marginal rates of tax. I have considered the possibility of limiting this relief to the standard tax rate, but this is not a feasible option at this stage for a number of practical and administrative reasons.</P>
    <P>I have decided instead to reduce the ceiling to £4,000 for married couples, £2,900 for widowed persons and £2,000 for single persons with effect from April next.  These new limits will apply to both new and existing loans.  This still allows a generous concession and at current interest rates it should cover a mortgage up to about £30,000 for married couples. Interest on borrowings which are applied in the purchase, repair or improvement of a taxpayer's principal private residence will continue to be equated with mortgage interest for the purpose of tax relief.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> These changes in interest relief should yield about £4 million in 1983.</P>
    <P>TAXATION OF THE SELF-EMPLOYED</P>
    <P>The question of placing the PAYE sector and the self-employed on an equivalent basis of assessment for income tax has been under consideration for some time and there have been indications in earlier Budget Statements that this problem would be resolved without delay. The Commission on Taxation have recommended that the self-employed should be assessed on a current year basis and I intend to provide accordingly.  This change, however, raises extremely complex administrative difficulties and it is not possible to bring it into effect at short notice.</P>
    <P>I hope to incorporate the necessary legislative provisions in the 1984 Finance Bill with a view to having the new basis of assessment in operation for the tax year 1984-85.  In the meantime, I will welcome the views of interested parties on the mechanics of the proposed change, but I want to make it clear now that there can be no concessions, involving a net loss of revenue, as part of a changeover package.</P>
    <P>FARM TAXATION</P>
    <P>Public perception of tax equity demands that all income earners should be liable to tax on an equal footing.  Up to now, however, only one third of the farming population has been included in the tax net.  There is no longer any justification for excluding the greater number of farmers from tax liability and I believe that the farming community itself accepts this viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, from April next all farmers will be liable for income tax.  Due to the relatively low level of many farming incomes this extension of liability is not expected to lead to a substantial increase in tax yield in the short term.  Because of the absence of statistics it is difficult to calculate the additional yield and the best estimate is that the removal of the threshold <Col N="1494" /> will result in an increase of about £2.5 million in farm taxation in 1983.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the extension of liability may cause problems for farmers who are brought into the tax net for the first time, particularly as many of these will have no liability because of their low incomes.  The Revenue Commissioners are considering various means of phasing in this arrangement, including the provision of a simplified form for statement of the farmer's circumstances.  I will return to this later.</P>
    <P>Farmers paid an estimated £24 million in income tax in 1982 and the amount due in rates in the normal course in respect of 1982 would have been £18 million, giving an overall estimate of £42 million due in 1982.  Rates for full-time farmers have now been abolished and the income tax yield for 1983 would be about £29 million if no other changes were made.  I think it is fair to expect more than this from the farming community.  Accordingly, it has been decided not to renew the present system of two payment dates for farmers, so that farmers will now be required, like other self-employed traders, to pay income tax in one instalment on 1 October.  In addition, the rates credit against tax will not apply in respect of the income tax year 1983-84.  These changes, together with the extension of income tax liability to all farmers, should bring the total income tax yield from farmers this year to about £47 million.</P>
    <P>The 1982 budget provided a stock relief rate of 110 per cent for farmers.  I propose to renew this special concession for a further year, in line with the Government's commitment to treat the recovery of the national herd as a major priority.</P>
    <P>SIMPLIFIED TAX REGIME FOR FAMILY BUSINESSES</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government there is a commitment to establish a committee of enquiry containing representatives of small business and the Revenue Commissioners to recommend a simplified tax regime for family businesses.  I <Col N="1495" /> will take steps shortly to establish this committee as a matter of urgency and I intend to extend its remit to consider also the scope for simplified arrangements for smaller farmers.  To this end I will invite farming representatives to participate in the work of the committee.</P>
    <P>CAPITAL TAXATION</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of capital taxation.  It is important in the interests of equity that capital taxes should make a reasonable contribution to the overall tax requirement, provided of course they do not act as a disincentive to investment and economic growth.  The yield from capital taxation is relatively low; existing taxes will yield only some £25 million this year.  On the other hand, there is only limited scope for increases and it would be unrealistic to suggest that a large-scale redistribution of the tax burden can be achieved simply through the imposition of higher capital taxes.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government there was a commitment to a review of discretionary trusts to eliminate the use of these trusts for tax avoidance.  In line with this commitment, I am examining what taxation measures may be required to ensure that discretionary trusts are not used as a vehicle for abuse.  This is a complex problem and I must take care that any tax changes do not result in a penal imposition on trusts which are set up for genuine purposes.  There are situations where trusts are necessary to guarantee the transfer of property under fair conditions and it would be unreasonable to impose a special tax in such cases.</P>
    <P>I am also looking at the whole area of capital acquisitions tax and its impact on the transfer of property from one generation to another.  I wish to assess the social effects of this tax and to consider whether the effects might be more worthwhile if the tax were structured differently. In any event there is an obvious need to simplify the present system which has a confusing multiplicity of tax rates and classes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" />RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAX</P>
    <P>A new income-related residential property tax is being introduced and the full details will be published in the Finance Bill.  In accordance with the provisions in the Programme for Government, there will be minimum thresholds of £20,000 income and £65,000 property value for liability for the tax.  Those whose income is above the £20,000 threshold will be required to state the market values of their residential properties. The tax will be at a rate of 1½ per cent on the excess value of taxable property over £65,000.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the tax will be payable in one instalment annually and the first payment will be due next October. The income threshold will be increased by £1,000 in respect of each child from the fifth child upwards so as to provide a relief for larger families and there will be provision for marginal relief where incomes are only just above £20,000.  There will be special arrangements for houses of historical or architectural significance where there is reasonable provision for public access.</P>
    <P>Because of inadequate statistics on the numbers likely to be liable for the new tax, it is not possible to estimate precisely what yield can be expected.  I am including in the budget arithmetic a provision of £10 million for 1983.</P>
    <P>STAMP DUTIES</P>
    <P>The exemption from stamp duty which applies where property is transferred to a person in consideration of his or her marriage is being removed.  The yield from this change is estimated at £0.25 million in 1983 and £0.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>TAXATION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND DEPOSIT INTEREST</P>
    <P>There is an obvious need for rationalisation of tax arrangements in relation to the different financial institutions.  I have examined the tax provisions for the various institutions and I now intend to bring <Col N="1497" /> forward a number of changes which will represent a movement towards a fairer system of taxation of deposit interest.</P>
    <P>Interest on deposits with certain financial institutions is exempt from income tax up to certain specified limits.  This exemption has led to considerable friction: in particular, those institutions which enjoy no concession argue that it is discriminatory.  As a first step towards putting the tax arrangements on a more equal basis, I propose to reduce this exemption.  The existing ceiling of £70 will be reduced to £50 and the ceiling of £150 to £120.  In the case of a married couple where both spouses are in receipt of interest, each will continue to qualify for a separate exemption.  The new limits will apply in respect of interest assessable for 1983-84.  This change will yield an estimated £1 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>The special arrangements for taxation of investors in building societies will be continued for 1983-84.  The deposit ceiling below which a special reduced rate of tax applies was raised last year on a temporary basis to £30,000.  That ceiling will be restored to £15,000 for 1983-84.  The Revenue Commissioners have a statutory obligation to verify this reduced rate, which is known as the composite rate, and to adjust it, as necessary, in order to ensure that the correct amount of tax is paid on building society interest as a whole.  Accordingly, they will extend the arrangements for 1983-84 to those societies which agree to a survey of their investors to enable a true composite rate to be computed for the future.  Where such agreement is not forthcoming, the composite rate for 1983-84 will be 75 per cent of the standard rate of income tax, rather than 70 per cent of that rate as at present.</P>
    <P>As regards the general question of taxing financial institutions, the bank levy must be retained for a further period, because there is no prospect of an alternative which would provide anything approaching the equivalent tax yield in the short term.  The amount of the levy for 1983 will be £25 million.  I envisage, however, that the levy will be phased out over the next few years in line with policy <Col N="1498" /> changes regarding the taxation of these institutions.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the widespread criticisms made in recent years regarding the level of the contribution to taxation by banks. Tax-based financing, which is the underlying cause of the present reduced level of tax payments by the banks, has fulfilled an important role in reducing the financing costs of industrial and other borrowers.  The amount of tax being lost to the Exchequer, however, has been growing every year and this cannot be allowed to continue.  Accordingly, consideration will be given as to whether the tax loss can be reduced by restricting these facilities to investment which is in line with the priorities of official industrial policy.</P>
    <P>The insurance levy of one per cent on gross premium income will be continued on the same basis as at present.</P>
    <P>COMPANY TAXATION</P>
    <P>Income tax is not deducted from dividends paid by Irish resident companies but the tax liability of the recipients of those dividends and other distributions may be reduced by a tax credit and, in certain cases, the tax credit may in fact be paid by the Revenue to the share-holder. However, due to the availability of tax reliefs, many companies who make distributions may not pay sufficient corporation tax to cover the tax credits or indeed may pay no corporation tax at all.</P>
    <P>In order to remedy this defect in corporation tax, I propose to change the present system so that companies will be required to make a payment of corporation tax sufficient to cover the tax credit attaching to distributions made on or after today.  This payment will be known as advance corporation tax and will be equal to the tax credits attaching to distributions made by a company in an accounting period less the amount of tax credits attaching to any distributions received by the company during that period.  Subject to certain limitations, details of which will appear in the Finance Bill, the payment of advance corporation tax will be available for set-off against the <Col N="1499" /> paying company's corporation tax liability in respect of its income.  The set-off will be allowed against the full amount of such corporation tax and will not be confined to the proportion of that tax which is imputed to shareholders by way of a tax credit.  A corrective measure on these lines has been recommended by the Commission on Taxation and similar provisions form an integral part of the tax systems of other countries.  In order to minimise the impact on companies, the payment will be due six months after the end of the accounting period in which the relevant distribution is made, that is, on the same date as payment of the first instalment of normal corporation tax.</P>
    <P>Advance corporation tax will materially affect only those companies who distribute profits but do not pay sufficient corporation tax to cover the tax credit applicable to their distributions.  Manufacturing companies whose dividend carry no tax credit or a low tax credit by virtue of the export sales relief, Shannon and 10 per cent schemes will be largely unaffected by the introduction of advance corporation tax.  The new measure will result in a small yield to the Exchequer this year and an increase of about £10 million in 1984 in the overall yield from corporation tax.</P>
    <P>Distributions under both existing &ldquo;section 84&rdquo; loan contracts and such contacts which are now under negotiation and are finalised within three months from today will be excluded from advance corporation tax.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the increase in the corporation tax rate which was introduced in last year's Finance Act, the tax credit attached to distributions made on or after 6 April 1983 will be increased from 30/70ths to 35/65ths of the distribution.</P>
    <P>STOCK RELIEF</P>
    <P>I am extending for a further year the present arrangements for stock relief on an unchanged basis, at an estimated cost of £1 million in 1983.  I have taken this decision after careful consideration of the <Col N="1500" /> representations which have been made for an easement of the clawback provisions in view of the current recessionary difficulties.  The present budgetary difficulties, however, leave me with no alternative but to continue the existing arrangements unchanged.</P>
    <P>INCENTIVES</P>
    <P>The existing incentives for capital investment, in particular accelerated capital allowances for plant, machinery and industrial buildings, are substantial.  They compare very favourably with those available in other countries and entail a high cost to the Exchequer in terms of tax forgone.  I am concerned that a proper balance should be achieved between incentives for capital and for employment and I will be examining this in detail.</P>
    <P>Last year an incentive was introduced for companies creating additional employment in the year to end-June 1983.  As this period is not yet ended, it is not possible at this stage to assess the effect of this incentive.  I am extending it for a further year in its present form.</P>
    <P>I am terminating as from today the 20 per cent income tax relief on dividends for shareholders in certain publicly-quoted companies.  This relief, which dates from 1932, has been superseded by the major reliefs introduced in more recent years which, by much reducing their tax burden, enable companies to distribute a greater proportion of profits than previously.  The full-year Exchequer saving from this change will be about £0.5 million with a very small saving in 1983.</P>
    <P>The 1981 budget announced the introduction of a special allowance of 100 per cent in respect of expenditure incurred on the construction of moderate-cost rented residential accommodation.  This allowance, which has come to be known as the &ldquo;section 23 incentive&rdquo;, is subject to review at the end of a three-year period.  I will consider whether the continuation of this incentive beyond the current expiry date is warranted when I come to prepare the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INDIRECT TAXES</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1501" /> The bulk of our tax revenue comes from indirect taxes, particularly excise duties and VAT.  While our reliance on indirect taxes has traditionally been, and continues to be, relatively high by international standards, present circumstances demand that we must look to them for additional revenue this year.  In allocating the increases between different areas, the Government have been concerned to spread the burden as equitably as possible.  I would stress, however, that the overall thrust and impact of the budget as a whole should be the focus of attention, rather than the impact of each individual measure.</P>
    <P>EXCISE DUTIES</P>
    <P>Increases in the main excise duties have already been introduced from 8 January 1983.  The products involved are beer, spirits, wine, tobacco, petrol, road diesel and Liquid Petroleum Gas used in road vehicles.  This step was taken in order to maximise the revenue gain this year from the increases and it is estimated that an additional £10 million revenue will accrue as a consequence.  The total yield from the increases will be £118.7 million in 1983 and £125 million in a full year.  I propose later today to move a motion noting these changes, so that the House can have the opportunity to debate them.</P>
    <P>I propose now to increase some of the other excise duties.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Hydrocarbons</i></P>
    <P>The general rate of excise duty on hydrocarbon oils and LPG used other than in road vehicles was set at 7p per gallon in 1980 and has not been adjusted since.  I propose to increase this by 1p per gallon to 8p with immediate effect.  This increase will not apply to residual fuel oil used by the ESB, nor will there be any change in the concessionary rates already applying to residual fuel oil used by industry and to oil used by fishermen and horticultural producers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" />&mdash;<i>Foreign Travel</i></P>
    <P>I propose to increase the foreign travel tax to £5 in respect of tickets purchased from 1 April 1983.  This new rate will apply to travel by both sea and air.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Televisions</i></P>
    <P>There will be an increase of £15 in the excise duty on the top category of colour TV, with pro rata increases for all other categories of colour and monochrome sets, with effect from midnight tonight.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Video Players</i></P>
    <P>I propose to increase the duty on video players by £20, with immediate effect.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Licences</i></P>
    <P>There will be an increase with immediate effect in the duty on excise licences required in connection with gaming.  I also propose, in the forthcoming Finance Bill, to increase the duty on excise licences on firearms, dogs, auctioneering and bookmaking.  The details are set out in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i></P>
    <P>The total yield from the excise duty increases set out above is estimated at £7.4 million in 1983 and £9 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Oil Price Developments</i></P>
    <P>Because of the world market situation, it is expected that there will be a significant fall in oil prices in the coming months.  In addition, changes in the INPC's contractual arrangements and in the sources of crude oil refined by it will result in substantial cost reductions.  The Government propose to absorb some of this reduction at the retail level by increasing the excise duty on petrol and other road vehicle fuels.  Because of the varying factors which will influence the timing and the size of the fall in oil prices, I am not in a position at this time to state what the precise excise increases will be, or when they will apply.  I am providing for a yield of £15 million this year from this source.  The Dáil will of course be <Col N="1503" /> given an opportunity to debate these increases.</P>
    <P>VALUE-ADDED TAX</P>
    <P>Value-added tax has the advantage of applying to a wider range of goods and services than the excise duties, which bear rather heavily on a small number of specific products.  The scope for imposing substantial real increases in excise duties is very limited at this stage, so the necessary additional revenue must be sought from increases in the existing VAT rates and widening the coverage of VAT.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Standard Rate</i></P>
    <P>It is proposed to increase the standard rate of VAT from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Low Rate</i></P>
    <P>The low rate of VAT will be increased from 18 per cent to 23 per cent.  However, the effect of this increase on beer, spirits, wine, cigarettes and tobacco will be offset by a corresponding reduction in the excise duty, so that in general there will be no change in the retail price of these goods.</P>
    <P>As in the case of other recent increases in this rate, an effective deferment of the increase to 31 December 1983 will be allowed in respect of accommodation and car and boat hire provided to non-residents under the terms of fixed-price contracts entered into before 1 January 1983.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>3 per cent Effective Rate</i></P>
    <P>The 3 per cent effective rate of VAT, which applies to building and certain agricultural contracting services, will be increased to 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fuel</i>
    </P>
    <P>Fuel, which is zero-rated at present, will be charged to VAT at 5 per cent, apart from the supply of electricity.  The existing rebate of VAT for fishermen will be extended to cover VAT on fuel.</P>
    <P>The flat-rate VAT rebate for unregistered <Col N="1504" /> farmers will be increased from 1.8 per cent to 2.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>These increases will take effect from 1 March 1983, apart from the 5 per cent rate on fuel which will operate from 1 May 1983.  The net additional revenue, after allowing for compensating excise duty reductions on beer, spirits, wine, cigarettes and tobacco, is estimated at £131.4 million in 1983 and £227 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I am aware that many questions arise in respect of the present VAT structure, which was designed at a time when the VAT rates were much lower.  I expect that the Commission on Taxation will be covering VAT in one of their further reports and, in the light of their recommendations, I will review the system in detail.  I accept also that high VAT rates may affect the competitive position of registered traders compared to unregistered traders.  I propose to examine this problem with a view to including any necessary legislative changes in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>VAT ON IMPORTS</P>
    <P>I am aware of the problems which the changes introduced last year in the arrangements for payment of VAT on imports have caused for industry and business generally.  The Government are committed to resolving these problems as soon as it is feasible to do so.  While there is little continuing revenue yield from the new system, there would be a substantial loss of revenue were it dismantled.  Given the present financial constraints, it is not possible to make major changes in this area at this stage.</P>
    <P>I propose, however, to make a concession for those who are primarily involved in manufacturing for export.  Firms who export 75 per cent or more of their production will be allowed to import their raw materials and components without payment of VAT from 1 April 1983.  This will reduce Exchequer revenue by £12.3 million in 1983.  Details of how this concession will operate will be announced by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" />ROAD TAX</P>
    <P>I am proposing increases in road tax rates for a number of categories of vehicle. The annual rates of road tax on cars not exceeding 12 horse-power will be increased by £2 per unit of horse-power, while the rates for cars over 12 horse-power will be increased by £3 per unit. Rates for goods vehicles will be increased by about 10 per cent, on average.  There will also be increases in the rates applying to a number of other categories of vehicle. In addition, I propose to double first registration charges for all vehicles. Charges for trade licences will also be doubled.  Finally, annual driving licence fees will be increased by £1, with corresponding increases in the fees for three-year and provisional licences.  Details of all these increases are set out in the <i>Principal Features.</i>  The effective date of these changes will be 1 April 1983, except for trade licence charges which will apply from 1 January 1984.  The additional revenue from these road tax measures is estimated at £16 million in 1983 and £21 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this subject, I wish to refer to the question of evasion of road tax.  The maximum fines for evasion were, on average, doubled last year.  The Garda Síochána will vigorously pursue their campaign to detect evaders.  The effectiveness of this campaign will be enhanced by recently introduced regulations which tighten up the provisions governing registered ownership of vehicles.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TAX EVASION AND AVOIDANCE</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in recent years in countering tax evasion and avoidance and there have been some notable successes.  While it is not possible to estimate the precise extent of these practices, it is evident that they are widespread. There seems little doubt that many of the problems associated with raising adequate taxation would be overcome if evasion and avoidance were brought under control.</P>
    <P>There is considerable public disquiet <Col N="1506" /> about the level of tax evasion in particular. It is important that this disquiet should be matched by a determination to counter evasion effectively.  The strengthening of legal powers for dealing with evasion should certainly yield results but this approach must be balanced against the necessity to protect the interests and privacy of the honest taxpayer. I would prefer that we would beat this problem through the weight of public attitudes but this alone may be insufficient. I am therefore introducing a number of measures today which will help to counter evasion.</P>
    <P>Tax avoidance has become an industry in its own right and it is clear that there is a considerable loss of revenue from artificial transactions designed to avoid tax.  Tax planners who engage in these activities can expect that greater attention will be given in future to closing off loopholes which they exploit.  They would be unwise to assume that anti-avoidance legislation will invariably apply from a current date only.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have recently set up a special anti-evasion branch which will be responsible for the overall co-ordination of anti-evasion work.  In the new branch the emphasis will be on prosecutions rather than monetary settlements.  I am confident that the new organisation will improve significantly the effectiveness of the campaign against evasion and I shall be monitoring its progress with interest.</P>
    <P>Last year the monetary penalties for many of the tax offences were increased. I am not satisfied, however, that the present code provides adequate sanctions against those who deliberately provide false information about their tax affairs or deliberately submit incorrect returns or accounts.  For this reason I intend to provide in the Finance Bill for a term of imprisonment of up to two years, in addition or as an alternative to a heavy monetary penalty, on conviction on indictment for major tax offences involving deliberate fraud.  Where a company has committed an offence, the new penalties can be applied to the officers of the company involved in the offence.</P>
    <P>I am introducing a number of other <Col N="1507" /> changes which will help to curb evasion and avoidance.</P>
    <P>For the future the purchase and sale of government securities must be disclosed in tax returns.  In addition, nominee holders of Government securities will be required to disclose particulars of transactions to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In order to counteract evasion through the practice of spreading deposits over a number of accounts, the disclosure limit for bank interest is being reduced from £70 to £50.  The new threshold will apply in respect of deposit interest paid in the 12-month period ending today.  I am also providing that, in future, declarations of non-residence will have no effect where the bank is not satisfied as to the bona fides of such declarations.</P>
    <P>Because of the favourable tax concessions available, there is a considerable market for investment schemes linked to life assurance or purchased life annuities. In some instances, however, these have led to blatant abuses where schemes are simply tax avoidance devices.  I want to serve notice in good time that provisions will be included in the 1984 Finance Bill to counteract these abuses.  These provisions will be designed to ensure that reliefs are available only in respect of investments linked to genuine life assurance policies or annuities.</P>
    <P>In order to speed up the processing of tax appeals, which are now frequently subject to undue delay, I am introducing a change in the existing procedures. There will be stricter provisions for the admission of late appeals and the appeal commissioners will have the power to determine that an assessment has become final and conclusive where evidence, such as returns, accounts or statements, has not been submitted to the inspector of taxes by a date previously specified by the appeal commissioners.  Where an assessment has become final and conclusive in such circumstances, the appellant will not have a right to a re-hearing by the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Tax evaders have up to now been protected by a cloak of anonymity except where convicted in open court.  I think this is unfair to the large majority of <Col N="1508" /> taxpayers who comply with the law. Accordingly, I propose that for the future the Revenue Commissioners will publish annually a list of persons and companies who have been convicted of a tax offence or with whom settlements have been reached in the larger back-duty cases involving default by the taxpayer.  Publication will not apply where settlements are made and agreed amounts paid before the end of 1983 or where there is a full and voluntary disclosure in advance of any investigation.  To some, this may seem a radical innovation but in fact it is accepted practice in a number of countries.</P>
    <P>I am also reviewing the reporting arrangements for payments to individuals and companies by Government Departments and public authorities to ensure that the necessary details will be available to the Revenue Commissioners so that those who benefit directly or indirectly from such payments will pay the appropriate tax on such income.</P>
    <P>The package on evasion and avoidance which I have outlined will, I expect, have a major impact and will increase tax yields substantially.  While it is not possible to make a precise estimate of what additional yield might result this year, I would expect it to be not less than £20 million.</P>
    <P>DUTY-FREE FACILITIES AND SMUGGLING</P>
    <P>The Government are very concerned about the growing number of consumers who are legitimately buying goods outside the State, either &ldquo;duty-free&rdquo; or otherwise. This transfer of purchasing power outside the State reduces the level of domestic economic activity and is having a particularly severe impact on certain trades.  It also reduces Exchequer revenue and means that taxation generally must be set at a higher level than would otherwise be necessary.</P>
    <P>The basic cause of these developments is undoubtedly the difference in prices, with the level of tax being a major factor for many goods.  Our tax level, however, and its distribution between the various sectors must be determined primarily in <Col N="1509" /> the light of our own needs and preferences rather than by reference to tax rates elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is one specific measure which I propose to introduce in this area.  The amount of goods bought in duty-free shops which travellers arriving from other EEC countries may bring in with them without payment of tax will be reduced from 1 April 1983 to the same level as that now applying to travellers arriving from non-EEC countries.  This means in particular that the allowance for spirits will be reduced from one and a half litres to one litre and for cigarettes from 300 to 200.  Most other EEC countries already apply this reduced allowance. It is estimated that the gain to the Exchequer from additional purchases in the State because of this measure will amount to £7 million in 1983 and £10 million in a full year.  This change will not affect the amount of duty-free goods which departing travellers, including tourists, may purchase.  This is determined by the tax-free allowance in the country to which they are travelling.</P>
    <P>Smuggling is becoming an ever-greater problem.  The Government will give urgent attention to combating it with all the resources at their command.  I will be glad to receive any proposals which the various trading groups directly affected may wish to put forward as to practical means of overcoming this problem and will be available for early discussions on such proposals.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NON-TAX REVENUE</P>
    <P>TELECOMMUNICATIONS CHARGES</P>
    <P>It is proposed to increase telecommunications charges to coincide with the next quarterly accounts to produce £23 million extra revenue in the current year.  Details of the increases will be announced separately by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" />BORD GÁIS ÉIREANN SURPLUS PROFITS</P>
    <P>The profits of Bord Gáis Éireann may, under its legislation, be applied to the benefit of the Exchequer.  I am exempting from corporation tax the profits earned by the board in its current accounting period and future accounting periods. This will enable an additional amount of approximately £21 million of the board's estimated 1983 profits to be paid into the Exchequer in the current year.</P>
    <P>The foregoing revenue proposals are expected to raise a gross total of £277 million this year and £432 million in a full year in additional revenue.  This, combined with the earlier excise duty increases, will raise the consumer price index by about three and a half percentage points.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SOCIAL WELFARE</P>
    <P>Even in the depths of economic depression and financial cutbacks those who must rely on welfare payments ought to be helped.  Total outlay on social welfare benefits and health allowances in 1983, as contained in the published Estimates, will be £1,771 million.  Since these Estimates were finalised the unemployment live register has risen by almost 22,000. While £425 million is already committed to the cost of unemployment payments, the Government consider that prudent management warrants a higher provision. I am, therefore, adding £31 million to finance the additional costs of potentially higher unemployment.  This will bring total expenditure on social welfare and health allowances to £1,802 million before any provision is made for an increase in current rates of benefit.</P>
    <P>All long-term weekly welfare rates will be increased commencing in the last week in June by 12 per cent.  This will mean, for example, increases of £5.15 a week for a contributory old age pensioner under 80 years and living alone, giving a total pension of £48.10 a week; £4.45 a week for the corresponding non-contributory pensioner, bringing that pension to £41.60 a week; £8.45 a week for a married couple, both of pension age and under 80 years, on contributory pension, giving a <Col N="1511" /> total weekly pension of £78.75; £8.10 a week for a contributory widow under 66 with three children, giving a total weekly pension of £75.40; and £7.40 a week in the case of a non-contributory widow with three children, giving a total weekly pension of £69.40.</P>
    <P>The Government would wish to give bigger increases and from an earlier date also, but we simply cannot afford to do this because of the additional taxation that would be required.  Last April personal and adult dependant rates of pensions and of other long-term benefits were increased by as much as 25 per cent. Since then the trend in inflation has improved, so that price rises between April 1982 and June next will come to substantially less than 25 per cent.  The measures I have announced today should protect pensioners and other long-term beneficiaries from the effects of inflation up to June 1984.</P>
    <P>Recent years have seen a very considerable growth in short-term weekly welfare rates.  There is a need for a more modest approach on this occasion to increases in short-term rates of benefit. The short-term rates will be increased from end-June next by 10 per cent.  This will, for example, mean an increase in flat-rate benefit of:</P>
    <P>&mdash;£3.15 a week for the personal rate of unemployment and disability benefit; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;£7.50 a week for a married couple with three children on unemployment or disability benefit.</P>
    <P>Of course, pay-related benefit may also be payable with flat-rate disability benefit, unemployment benefit or maternity allowance; and, in this connection, the Estimates allow for an increase in the earnings ceiling for pay-related benefit purposes, to £11,000.</P>
    <P>I should explain that this increase in short-term welfare rates will not apply to those smallholders whose means were assessed using the notional PLV basis. This follows the High Court decision declaring the use of the PLV system to be unconstitutional.  However, the smallholders <Col N="1512" /> in question have the option of having their means assessed on a factual income basis, and those who qualify for assistance on this basis, as very many will in fact, will benefit from the rate increase that I have announced.</P>
    <P>The recent improvements in short-term payments have narrowed, and in some instances completely closed, the income gap between those at work and those drawing unemployment or disability benefits.  The work incentive is suffering and there is an unacceptable inducement to exploit the social welfare system. To help restore a sensible balance between disposable earnings when at work and the level of maximum benefits when sick or unemployed, an adjustment to the rate of pay-related benefit, together with certain other limitations, has already been provided for in the published Estimates giving rise to a saving of £27.2 million.  I am adding to this saving a further £7 million, arising from the application of a 25 per cent maximum rate of pay-related benefit.  These adjustments will apply from April next.</P>
    <P>At the same time, there will be a concerted drive to eliminate the wrongful claiming of social welfare benefits by people who are actually employed and in receipt of an income from work.  This is an abuse which, I regret to say, is condoned and even used for their own profit by some employers who, it would appear, employ such people at lower than normal wages.  In this way, such employers join in the fraudulent exploitation of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Details of the social welfare adjustments not already provided for in the Estimates are set out in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i></P>
    <P>FAMILY INCOME SUPPLEMENT</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that in some instances the narrowing income gap between those at work and those on benefit may reflect low rates of take-home pay, which rarely take account of a worker's family circumstances.  As a result some workers with family dependants may be only marginally better-off <Col N="1513" /> working than on benefit; and those on benefit can have little incentive to take up relatively low-paid employment.  The Government wish to alter this situation and to restore the incentive to work.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government foreshadowed specific measures to supplement low take-home incomes.  A number of possibilities were considered and the Government have decided that on balance the most appropriate way forward is to introduce a supplement for low-income families in the active labour force.  Details of the scheme and how it will operate, will be worked out as quickly as possible.  In the meantime, I am allocating £5 million for this purpose in 1983.  It is envisaged that about 20,000 families could benefit from this scheme. The net extra cost of the adjustments to the published Estimates that I have announced today, including the extra provision to meet higher unemployment, is £107.3 million in 1983.  Of this sum, £88.6 million is accounted for by the improvements in weekly payments together with the family income supplement provision.</P>
    <P>As long as there is sufficient growth in public revenues it is possible to maintain and improve social welfare payments.  In recent years our sources of revenue did not increase in line with welfare expenditure. This imbalance was corrected to an extent last year when there was an increase in pay-related social insurance contributions.  I have ruled out for this year a further increase in the PRSI rate of contribution.  However, the published Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare was based on an increase in the PRSI ceiling for contribution purposes from £9,500 to £13,000.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SPECIAL FEATURES</P>
    <P>I should now like to mention a number of special features which form part of this budget.</P>
    <P>YOUTH SERVICES</P>
    <P>The youth employment and related services of the Department of Education <Col N="1514" /> have been transferred to the Minister for Labour who, with his Minister of State, is now responsible for matters affecting youth.  Special recognition has already been given to youth through the Youth Employment Agency.  In further recognition of the scale of youth needs I have now decided to allocate an additional £250,000 for youth services.  The details of this allocation will be made public in due course.</P>
    <P>VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Government's Programme, the National Community Development Agency is not being retained and this will save £1.8 million on the Vote of the Department of Health. This sum is being earmarked for the Department of Social Welfare pending the establishment of an anti-poverty agency and the settlement of its financial allocation for 1983.  Some £500,000 of the transferred funds will be used in the current year towards the work of suitable voluntary bodies in the social services area, preferably for &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; projects. The grants will be decided after consultation with the health boards and will be additional to the grants already decided by the boards for such bodies in 1983.</P>
    <P>OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE</P>
    <P>The overall provision for Ireland's official assistance to developing countries is being increased by £3 million above the sum decided upon by the previous Government.  Many under-developed countries are suffering severely from the world recession and we are still a relatively high income country by world standards.</P>
    <P Just="Center">DEFICIT AND BORROWING REQUIREMENT</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the pre-budget estimates show an opening current deficit of £956 million.  This, however, does not tell the full story.  Adjusting this figure for the excise increases introduced on 8 <Col N="1515" /> January and for a number of factors affecting expenditure, the true opening current deficit amounted to £1,209 million. The excise increases and expenditure reductions have brought this down to the published opening figure of £956 million.</P>
    <P>Starting, therefore, from £956 million, the expenditure proposals will result in a net addition of £178 million, while the revenue changes will result in a net reduction of £277 million.  Taking account of an estimated £35 million which Departments have in balances from 1982, and allowing for an estimated reduction of £75 million in underlying tax revenue buoyancy in order to take account of the effects of today's measures, the estimated current deficit emerges at £897 million or 6¾ per cent of GNP.  This compares with £988 million or 8½ per cent of GNP in 1982.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the net reduction of £181 million which I have announced today, the Exchequer borrowing requirement for capital purposes comes to £825 million.  Together with the current budget deficit of £897 million, the estimate of total Exchequer borrowing for 1983 is £1,722 million, or about 13 per cent of GNP.  This compares with borrowing of £1,945 million, or 16¼ per cent of GNP, last year.</P>
    <P>These reductions in the level of both the current deficit and the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement are substantial.  The reduction in the borrowing requirement accords with the recommendations of the EEC Commission as adopted by the Council on 17 December 1982.  The targets set, and the measures taken today to attain them, demonstrate beyond question the Government's resolve to bring the public finances under control.</P>
    <P>As the experience of recent years has amply shown, the mere setting of targets, and the introduction of proposals to achieve these targets, are not in themselves any guarantee that the targets will be reached.  The Government are strongly committed to avoiding any major overrun this year.  This is critical if confidence in our ability to manage the <Col N="1516" /> public finances is not to be jeopardised. The Government are, therefore, acutely conscious of the need to adhere strictly to the budgeted expenditure allocations, to monitor closely the evolution of the finances throughout the year and to act quickly to deal with any emerging problems.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning of this statement that we are in the grip of a severe recession. We can see its effects in the continuing increase in the numbers of our people who are unemployed.  We can see its effects in the change in their standards of living and in their growing fears for their children's future prospects.</P>
    <P>But we cannot blame all of our problems on the international recession.  We must accept a part of the responsibility ourselves.  I speak not only of us, the Members of this House; I speak also of our whole community.  For it is we ourselves, as a community, who have insisted on and pursued standards of living higher than those which could be justified by our levels of production.  It is we ourselves, as a community, who have insisted on and provided higher levels of service than we could sustain.  It is we ourselves, as a community, who have failed to identify properly our real priorities and to choose among them within the limits of our capabilities.  Finally, it is we ourselves who are, in large part, responsible for the inequities in our society, and particularly for the inequity of depriving, by our excessive expectations, many of our neighbours of the opportunity to work and to make their own way in the world.</P>
    <P>It is not too late to change all this.  The problems which we ourselves have created can be resolved by our own actions. Today is not a time for despair or for hopelessness in the face of the magnitude and complexity of our problems.  We have met and countered inflation before this.  The Irish people have in the past suffered cruel unemployment and surmounted it.  For decades we have been making progress, slow though it might often seem, against inequality.  We can <Col N="1517" /> do all these things again if only we have the will.  We can do them if our leaders show the resolve required to motivate our community, and it is as a community that we must face our problems.</P>
    <P>What I have presented today is this Government's first step in attacking these problems.  It shows clearly the difficulty of our task but, even more importantly, <Col N="1518" /> it shows our determination to shoulder fully the responsibilities of Government and to guide our actions as a community over a period of years, so that we can all participate in a real and constructive way in the betterment of our community.</P>
    <P>I have faith in the Irish people's ability to set themselves, with courage and determination, to the task in hand, and I have no doubt that we can succeed.</P>

    <P>Figures for 1979 to 1982 have been revised.</P>
    <Col N="1543" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to this year's budget is a catastrophic unemployment situation.  In the past two months the figure climbed again, going up by 17,000 to an awesome total of 170,000.  It is hardly possible for any of us to comprehend fully the accumulation of misery, hardship, frustration and despondency represented by that figure. Economists and financial experts will analyse the budget for us and give us their assessment from many different aspects but for thousands of individuals and families the key question will be whether the budget offers them any hope of obtaining employment or whether they must resign themselves for the foreseeable future to the degradation of the dole queue.  By that crucial yardstick this budget must be judged a total failure.  Far from offering any prospect of improvement or new employment opportunities, the whole series of measures seriously and perhaps disastrously make the situation worse.</P>
      <P>The primary economic and social objective of our plan.  <i>The Way Forward</i>, was to reverse this upward trend in unemployment. We planned to achieve this by a comprehensive and integrated programme of measures designed to achieve greater competitiveness and to stimulate productive economic activity in manufacturing industry, in the building and construction industry and in the private services.  The Government should not have rejected our plan without having something to put in its place.  The result is that this budget can be seen only as having isolated objectives related to the management of the public finances for one year instead of being an integral part of overall, long-term strategy for employment. I say to the Government that since they have no plan of their own, they should be mature enough to adopt the one we left.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That plan was produced with great care.  All the best available expert opinion was mobilised and all the relevant institutions contributed to its formulation.  It was based on detailed <Col N="1544" /> analysis and scientific projection.  If the Government are statesman-like enough to acknowledge that <i>The Way Forward</i> represents the right approach, I assure them there will be no smallmindedness on our part.  Instead, we will applaud the Government for doing so because that plan offers the only possibility of reversing the trend in unemployment and putting us into a position where we can provide the jobs needed for our increasing population.</P>
      <P>The basic strategy of this budget is fundamentally wrong.  The Minister is borrowing to meet current expenditure by a greatly increased amount, somewhere between £200 million and £150 million depending on one's starting point while borrowing for capital projects which would provide employment is down by £220 million.  That will have an incalculable effect on the unemployment situation.  Such level of reduction in capital investment in the coming year cannot but lengthen the dole queues.  I draw particular attention to the fact that £43 million is being taken off the £119 million of Exchequer investment in State companies. That represents a reduction of one-third in the amount we provided for those State companies for the purpose basically of procuring increased economic activity from them and of course of increasing employment.  The reduction in this instance must result in some of the State companies closing down.  I challenge the Minister to tell us why he did not say in his budget statement what the £43 million would cover and why he had to leave it to another day to give us that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget is littered with postponed decisions and with the deferment of vital issues.  For instance, there is no decision on the key element of public service pay. Neither is there any decision on the various proposals of the Commission on Taxation with the exception perhaps of the mean little decision in regard to married couples.  There is no decision for action on the discretionary trust proposal and neither is there any decision on the section 23 building concession.  Likewise, there is no decision in respect of tax on the self-employed just as there is no <Col N="1545" /> decision on the acquisition tax.  In his statement the Minister left more of such matters in abeyance than he dealt with.</P>
    <P>Now that most of the key figures and indicators for 1982 are available it is fair to say that on 14 December 1982 we handed over to our successors an economy that had been well managed during last year.</P>

      <P>Very grave problems still exist but major improvements in some of the principal economic areas enable us now to take a more optimistic view of the situation than would have been possible even a few months ago.  A crucial indicator of this is the balance-of-payments situation and the major reduction from 14 per cent of GNP in 1981 to 8 per cent in 1982.  That exceeded the most optimistic forecasts of this time last year and it is anticipated that the figure will fall further though less dramatically this year.  This result reduces the worst of the pressure on interest rates and on exchange rates and gives a clear signal to the international financial market as to the stability of our currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another major achievement was the reduction by almost one-half in the space of 12 months in the rate of inflation &mdash; from 23 to 12 per cent.  The underlying rate of inflation is probably down now to single figures.  Our success in rigidly controlling Government expenditure in 1982 set a good headline for the Minister for Finance and gave him a very good starting point for his 1983 budgetary exercise. For the first time for many years the final expenditure outturn for 1982 was below the budget estimate, some £15 million below it.  That was achieved mainly due to the maintenance of rigid expenditure control and of the corrective measures we took in July last year.  When we were returned to office in March last, an accumulation of public service pay commitments, especially in regard to special pay increases, hung over the financial horizon like a dark threatening cloud.  The brilliant achievement of Deputy Gene <Col N="1546" /> Fitzgerald in re-negotiating and securing a major review of the public service pay agreement in the autumn of last year vastly improved that whole situation and enabled this Government to come into office with the decks already cleared.  The reduction in the expectations in this area is probably one of the most valuable legacies handed over to the incoming Government.  I must point out that that improvement in the situation was brought about with the full co-operation of the trade unions concerned.  It is to be hoped that this co-operation will be continued by the present Government despite the dangerous signs in this area that have emerged in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>Our action in bringing forward for the first time ever the Estimates for the coming year, well before the end of last year, in November, gave this Government another valuable aid in preparing today's budget.  In 1982 net agricultural output went up by 6 per cent to 7 per cent and real farm incomes also increased.  There are indications that the decline in manufacturing output has bottomed out.  Our exports have been increasing remarkably well and we can look forward to another improvement in exports and in the terms of trade in 1983.  Falling oil prices, falling international interest rates and an upturn in the US economy in the latter half of this year will all contribute to a more favourable international climate this year.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister in his budgetary strategy taken full account of these developments at home and abroad?  I doubt it.  I cannot see any indications of a development strategy of any kind, a strategy which, recognising the harsh realities of our situation, would nevertheless be flexible enough to respond to any opportunity or any upturn on the economic front. That is the major weakness of this budget.  No framework is set out in which development, if it becomes possible, can be accommodated and employment increased.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that the continuing recession and the falling off in consumer spending as a result brought about the increase in the 1982 budget deficit over the planned figure.  This was an entirely <Col N="1547" /> new fiscal development in our situation in that an increase in the budget deficit was not caused by excesses in expenditure. In the event, the deficit of £988 million or 8.5 per cent of GNP was broadly similar to the 1981 outcome.  The size of the budget deficit and the period within which it is to be phased out, has been the subject of considerable division, I believe, within the Government parties. In <i>The Way Forward</i> we indicated our belief that the current budget deficit should be set at £750 million and phased out over four years.  This is clearly the conscientious view of the present Minister for Finance also.</P>
    <P>The absence of an upturn in the economy during 1982 and the overrun on the current budget deficit by £300 million, made it imperative that no further time should be lost in setting out and acting upon a firm time table.  Our view has been reinforced by the EEC Commission in their annual economic review where they said that the current policy stance must not only be maintained but must be vigorously pursued.  They suggest that the current budget for 1983 should be set at £700 million.  It is a matter for considerable regret that when some weeks ago the Minister for Finance expressed his belief that the current budget deficit for 1983 should be set at £750 million, the Taoiseach and the Government saw fit to administer a public rebuke to the Minister for Finance in discharging his duty and they have forced him to go against his better judgment and against the Fine Gael policy as put before the electorate.</P>
    <P>Rapidly rising numbers of unemployed, the erratic performance of this Government since coming into office and the absence of any clear economic or fiscal strategy are all continuing to reduce confidence in our economy.  The decision to plan for a considerably higher budget deficit than was generally accepted as necessary may well undermine confidence in the resolution of this Coalition to tackle our problems, particularly because of the likelihood in adverse economic circumstances that budgetary targets may not be met.</P>
    <P>It must be clearly understood that this <Col N="1548" /> higher current budget deficit of £900 million, allied to the decision to phase out the deficit over a longer period of years, will add significantly to Exchequer borrowing despite all that the Fine Gael Party have preached to us about the need to reduce Exchequer borrowing.  We estimate that this Government by their decision to extend the period over which the budget deficit is to be phased out from four years to the five years, the five years we proposed, will add £500 million to the total Exchequer borrowing in that period, and that was on the basis of an opening budget deficit of much less than the £900 million the Minister has been forced to settle for.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about the Minister's budget and arithmetic is that there is no provision whatsoever for any increase in public service pay in the coming year.  The Government have not yet revealed or discussed with the trade unions their approach to this issue.  So far they have limited themselves to formalities. It is essential if understanding and co-operation are to be maintained with the unions that the Government take us into their confidence.</P>
    <P>Our policy was laid down in <i>The Way Forward</i> and was generally accepted as reasonable.  We said that excluding carry-over effects from 1982 into 1983 public service pay should not rise by more than 5 per cent.  It remained to be determined, given the provision in the Estimates of the 7.7 per cent rise in public service pay, what scope there is, if any, for any future pay increases in 1983.  But this is not an issue the Government can avoid.  I do not think it is good enough for the Minister for Finance in this House on budget day, when he is supposed to be giving us the whole economic and financial strategy for the coming year, to leave this matter in abeyance and to say he is providing nothing for a public service pay increase in 1983 and if there is some increase, further action will have to be taken.  That is a serious piece missing from this budget and it is a very suspicious attitude for the Minister to take.</P>
    <P>This budget with its heavy extra impositions on working families is hardly likely <Col N="1549" /> to be helpful to pay moderation.  People are seeing their real incomes and wages inexorably reduced.  It is regrettable that the measures taken early in January and in today's budget, and all the extra changes that have been or will be shortly imposed, are not conducive to creating the right climate for any new understanding on pay.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party fought the election 18 months ago on a dishonest programme of tax reform which was stated to be the most pressing problem of the moment.  It is interesting to note that this has now been shelved, and that so far from relieving the income tax burden the Government have today increased in a number of ways the burden right across the taxpaying public.  The Taoiseach made many election promises about tax reform concessions, the most notorious of which was the promise to pay £9.60 per week to housewives working in the home.  But there were others, tax credits and so on, and they have all been abandoned one by one.  Instead there is a further imposition of a 1 per cent levy on income today and that is going to fall mainly on the PAYE sector; the PAYE allowance is being reduced by £26 million; mortgage interest relief is being curtailed, and certain higher incomes will be subject to 65 per cent tax.  With that record of broken promises in this area of taxation, I believe I am entitled to put to the electorate the perfectly legitimate question: &ldquo;Would you ever again buy an election promise on taxation from this man?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is widespread popular demand that abuses in the social welfare system must be prevented.  Among those at work in particular, those paying PAYE, there is a sense of outrage about these abuses. Our approach was to tackle this in three ways: to limit unemployment benefit for short-term workers to a five-day working week without pay-related benefit; to put a ceiling of 80 per cent on reckonable weekly earnings and overall benefits for disability benefit purposes; and to reduce the levels of pay-related benefit from 40 per cent to 30 per cent for six months and 20 per cent for the remaining nine months.  That was a reasonable proposal. <Col N="1550" /> The Government today, I understand from a quick scrutiny of this budget paper, propose that that 40 per cent be reduced to 25 per cent.  Why have we not had these proposals before now?  When we left office, we left legislation ready to be enacted.  Is it that the Coalition Government cannot reach agreement on these proposals?  I find it very difficult to understand the failure of the Government to announce the extension of the operation of section 23 of the 1981 Finance Act beyond the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Employment in the construction industry is at a disastrously low level.  In March of last year, we re-allocated some £50 million to building and construction.  It was to be expected that the incoming Government, of whatever party, would mobilise some of the capital reserve to this purpose today.  However, it has to be recognised, and it was recognised in <i>The Way Forward</i>, that there is a limit to how long one can sustain the high level of net capital formation that we have.  The construction industry cannot rely on public investment alone.  That is all the more reason why the Minister should have given a clear indication, today at least in his budget, that section 23 would be extended.  That section has been quite successful in its operation.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the part of the budget which was implemented in advance by the imposition in early January of extra excise duties to raise £119 million.  On this side of the House, we question the legality of an imposition of duties of this size outside the House, particularly when the Dáil was in recess.  The imposition of substantial additional excise duties in this way, without prior Dáil approval, undermines our parliamentary system.  It is difficult to reconcile this draconian, executive procedure with Deputy John Bruton's frequently expressed wish for greater control by the Dáil over the public finances.  Are we now to have a situation where the Government can raise much of the money it needs by way of excise duties without recourse to this Parliament? According to press reports in January, the Government made these decisions at a time when they did not have the full picture as to how they could <Col N="1551" /> control expenditure and what other sources of revenue there were.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may be too optimistic in projecting that extra £119 million from the increase in excise duties announced early this month.  The revenue from excise duties increased by only £70 million in 1982, against £160 million anticipated in the March budget. The biggest increase in excise duties is on petroleum products, imports of which increased by only 2 per cent in value in the 11 months up to November, implying a considerable fall in volume.  It is likely that sales of petrol and related fuels will further drop in volume this year as a result of this budget.  The sales of most other goods subject to excise duty have also fallen, particularly beer and spirits. The Minister is anticipating an increase of 10.5 per cent in the excise yield this year, a figure close to the anticipated average rise in the cost of living.  Last year, there was a drop in real personal consumption of about 6 per cent and, according to some latest economic reports, it is suggested that there will be a further fall in personal consumption in the region of about 2 per cent.  This will be consistent with likely developments in incomes and public expenditure.</P>
    <P>There was fairly general surprise when the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure was published, between the figures of receipts and expenditure and the opening deficit.  They were much better than we had all been led to anticipate. I must question the projected figures in this budget, on account of last year's experience that, as real incomes were further squeezed, discretionary spending progressively declined.  The limits on many forms of indirect taxation are near to being reached and the Minister for Finance must be certain that he is being realistic about the likely revenue yields of particular forms of taxation.  Any further substantial slippage on the budget deficit, because of over-estimation of revenue of the kind which occurred in 1982, must be avoided because it seriously undermines the whole budgetary strategy. That is particularly so because the Minister and the Government have taken <Col N="1552" /> this soft option of going for a budget deficit on current account of £900 million, instead of the £750 million that we proposed or the £700 million proposed by the EEC.</P>
    <P>This 1983 budget was expected to be severe&mdash;that was widely accepted.  Getting the current budget and the level of public borrowing down could not be achieved without major pruning of public expenditure and other similar painful measures.  Our policy, which was set out in <i>The Way Forward</i>, represented a balanced, integrated approach over a five-year period.  It was carefully measured combination of corrective and developmental measures.  <i>The Way Forward</i> set realistic long-term targets for improvement in the public finances, a reduction in inflation and the rate of unemployment. The present Government has no such strategy.  <i>The Way Forward</i> concentrated on competitiveness, import-led growth in employment and the restoration of the public finances.  This Government have abandoned that rational approach and have brought in here today a budget which will rock the economy to its foundation.  There is no balance.  It is oppressive and inflationary beyond anything justified by the requirements of our situation.  It will not solve our problems, it will exacerbate them.  It does not fit into any long-term plan or programme, as we had planned that our 1983 budget would.</P>
    <P>We, in the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government, formulated a plan, a specific programme for the years ahead.  Fine Gael and the present Taoiseach criticised us.  Now that they are in Government, they have nothing to put in its place.  This budget does not look beyond this year.  It is not part of any long-term strategy.  It represents the worst type of economic and fiscal policy, <i>ad hoc</i> measures dealing with the immediate situation in a heavy handed, blunt instrument fashion, but not related to any long-term plan.  In particular, the budget, as I have said, offers no hope whatsoever for those young people throughout our country who today are so desperately and so anxiously looking for employment opportunities.</P>

    <P>The totally inadequate social welfare increases of 12 per cent and 10 per cent cannot possibly compensate for the increases that this budget is going to impose on the poorer and weaker sections of our community.

What are this section of our community to do in the meantime?  We protected that section of the community and <Col N="1554" /> no matter what else we had to do or what we had to forego and despite all the economic and financial difficulties of the past three years, we made sure that that section of the community were adequately looked after and catered for.  I say to the Ministers of the Government, Fine Gael and Labour, that they have failed in their primary responsibility.  They have not protected those who should be their special care, whose welfare should be their first concern.  Because they have failed these people, both they and their budget stand condemned before the nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I would have to agree with most of the remarks of Deputy Haughey in his attack on this budget.  I am amazed that it appears he <Col N="1555" /> was able to have a prepared speech as if he knew in advance exactly what was going to be in the budget.  In fact when he made the point that he would have reduced the budget deficit to £750 million I hesitate to think what his budget would have been like.</P>
      <P>I must describe this budget as unbelievably bad.  In modern parlance I suppose one could call it a GUBU budget. Certainly I found it shocking.  What stands out immediately is the 1 per cent income levy to bring in £47 million this year from the PAYE worker and £80 million next year.  I might stress that in addition to that 1 per cent income levy there is no indexation of the PAYE tax bands which means that an enormously increased amount in PAYE taxation will be taken in as a result of inflation and increased incomes.  Therefore again the PAYE worker, who had expected that there would be no increase or, at the very worst, that his tax would be maintained at the terrible rate it was last year, is now burdened with this enormous increase. This is in addition to the huge increase in VAT, affecting the worker also, all of whose income is spent every week. Value-added tax is a tax on spending and will bear more heavily on workers' incomes than on the incomes of those who have large amounts remaining to invest in capital which is not taxed at all in this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed this budget is a joke when it comes to capital taxation.  The Minister's statement, written and issued in this bland manner, makes one wonder whether the Minister for Finance has any idea how the public at large will receive this unbelievably bad budget.  Again the Minister's statement which refers to the Commission on Taxation, talks about the need to have a fairer taxation system, but that is all.  This budget blandly makes it worse, increasing the burden on the PAYE worker by way of excise duties imposed a few weeks ago &mdash; as Deputy Haughey said without any reference to this House while in recess.  One might well ask: why not bring the whole lot in while the House was in recess at the same time as the Minister for Education introduced <Col N="1556" /> the cut-backs on education?  Yet a couple of weeks later the Minister for Finance introduced excise duties which will bear more heavily on workers than anybody else because a higher percentage of their income will go in this direction, everything they earn being spent. Therefore they pay more in excise duties, more in VAT and now more under PAYE under this savage budget which in addition to having no indexation of the tax bands has raised the highest tax band while adding a 1 per cent income levy.</P>
    <P>The very minimum increase in social welfare benefits this year should have been 15 per cent merely to hold the line. It must be remembered that these are the people suffering from the poverty trap, the people whose incomes will be reduced because the increase in benefits will be 12 per cent only and, in the case of short-term benefits, by 10 per cent only.  There is no reference whatever to the poverty trap in which long-term unemployed people find themselves, which is becoming an increasing problem year by year.  I think this case has been submitted already to the Minister for Finance by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, pointing out that its alleviation constitutes a grave need.  Yet it has not even been referred to in this budget.</P>
    <P>Then there is the miserable £2.5 million increase in farmer taxation which is a joke because &mdash; as I have said already &mdash; the 1 per cent income levy on PAYE workers will bring in as much this year as all of farmer taxation.</P>
    <P>When it comes to capital taxation the Minister blandly says that the yield therefrom is relatively low and that the existing taxes will yield only some £25 million this year.  Twenty-five million pounds is only chicken feed; children would spent it on sweets in this day and age.  The Minister continues to say, in regard to capital taxation:</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is only limited scope for increases ...</P>
    <P>and finishes by saying there is no scope whatever for increases.</P>
    <P>It was announced in this morning's papers that four of the top companies in this country &mdash; the Rohan Group, Jefferson <Col N="1557" /> Smurfit, Independent Newspapers and Cement Roadstone paid dividends to their shareholders in advance because of the fear that the Minister for Finance would introduce advance corporation profits tax.  None of them had to worry. They should have known that, whatever Government were in power, they would not have to worry about this.  It did not happen last year, it has not happened this year, nor the year before last.  We are told all the time that it might happen.  We are told there is a need to increase capital taxation.  Now we are told there is no scope for its introduction.  There is ample scope for it.  There was a higher amount of capital taxation paid in 1974 than there is now.  Death and estate duties had been in operation for years.  They were abolished in 1974 and, since then, there has not been the same yield for capital taxation. In fact in the year 1980, in real terms, the capital taxation yield dropped by 50 per cent.  Yet the Minister for Finance in 1983 can tell us there is no scope for increased capital taxation. There is no scope because the Minister does not want to find scope, because the Fine Gael Party do not want any scope for increasing capital taxation.</P>
    <P>The result is that they hit the same people all the time.  How long do they think they can do this?  In the next few days, workers will realise the enormous attack made on them in this budget, with no effect whatever made to hit the rich, the people who pay up to £50,000 for a motor car, who own two houses.  The workers see these things happening, they see the great wealth being paraded.  Now they see the Minister for Finance making no effort whatever to take any taxation from these wealthy people.  Does he think that the worker will sit down and take this for ever?  A few years ago they marched in a peaceful manner.  They thought they had made their point, that they were paying too much taxation. Every Minister agreed they were paying too much.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation was established and has reported, in my view a very poor report, referred to here and there in the course of the Minister's statement today, when he attempted to give <Col N="1558" /> the impression that he was introducing part of their recommendations.  The whole Report of the Commission on Taxation called for a reform and restructuring of the whole of the taxation system. That is not being done by the Minister for Finance.  It was not done by his predecessor. Neither have we had any information from the Minister as to whether the Government will implement any of the ideas contained in the Report of the Commission on Taxation, nor if they have any intention in the future of easing the burden on the PAYE worker.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers also in the course of his remarks to tax evasion.  It sounds great.  We get the impression that something will be done at last.  I am glad that he intends to publish the names of those evading tax.  The Minister expects that £20 million will be taken in by the Exchequer as a result.  That was an extraordinary statement because the Comptroller and Auditor General published a report last year in which he stated that £450 million was not paid over to the Exchequer.  We have regular bankruptcy in companies such as that in Carrigaline where it was discovered that they were not paying PAYE or PRSI to the Revenue Commissioners.  We have clear evidence that companies and people have been evading tax to the tune of £200 million.  The Minister expects to bring in only £20 million so I wonder how serious he is about tackling tax evasion.</P>
    <P>I am most disappointed that the budget, as Deputy Haughey said, is a book-keeping exercise.  I had hoped that the Minister would indicate the strategy of the new Government, give some indication of a Government plan and give some hope.  If people, particularly young people, had some hope today and could see something happening in two or three years time to which they could look forward, they would accept almost anything. There is no hope whatever in the Minister's speech.  There is no indication of any plan to develop the country's resources, create jobs or see some way forward out of this morass except to tax more and hope that in the long run we will get out of it somehow.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> There is absolute need for a plan. Young people need to be shown that there is a way forward.  Have the Government looked at the Telesis Report?  Have they given any indication that they believe there is anything in it?  Have they looked at the manner in which our resources are wasted as was shown in that report?  Could they not have a positive way to balance the budget?  Our problem is we spend more than we earn.  The Government say: &ldquo;Let us cut back on our spending&rdquo;.  Surely increasing our earnings would be far better.  There should be a positive plan for developing and increasing our output.  We would need to increase output by 5 per cent per year. The people would be willing to do this if there was a plan and if there was leadership. If we balanced the budget in that way we would be in a better position when the recession ends.  In the present position we are going further down the slippery slope each year and even if the international recession ends and the economic climate improves, we will not be in a position to take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave no indication of plan or hope for the future.  I see very little expectation that people will accept this. They would accept it if there was hope for the future, but that is not there.  I am very disappointed.  There are one or two features of the budget which I welcome but they are relatively minor.  One which is welcome is the increase in the general exemption limits for single, widowed and married couples.  However, widows should have been given the same exemption limits as married couples.  That is something which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The self-employed are to be assessed in the same manner as PAYE workers. This is to be welcomed but why is it not being done this year?  I hope it will be done next year as is stated.  VAT on the imports of raw materials is being removed and that is welcome.  There are some welcome minor features in the budget but the major part of it will not be acceptable to the vast majority of the people.</P>

      <P>On the question of the increase in television licences, roughly how much is owing by defaulters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with excise duties, not licences, so the question does not arise on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It does arise in relation to revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not arise on this and I have not in this file any information on it.  I have a figure in my head which I have heard but it would be incorrect to give the House information which might prove to be inexact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not have that. We are not going to debate this budget on the basis of hearsay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about raising revenue on televisions.  There is also a licence on televisions and revenue is accumulated in various ways.  I am asking the Taoiseach to tell me how much is outstanding on existing televisions.  The main purpose of my question is to find out why new excise duty should be imposed instead of using resources available to collect money due to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to be unhelpful but there is no official estimate of the amount outstanding.  As nobody knows who the defaulters are and how many there are, it is not possible to give an official estimate.  A figure of several million pounds has been mentioned by <Col N="1562" /> RTE but in the nature of things I do not think there can be any official estimate. The figure would certainly be substantial by any estimate, running to a number of millions of pounds.  The yield of the VAT increase here is £0.5 million and the yield of the excise increase is £0.9 million in the present year.  The overall effect of the changes is therefore £1.4 million this year aid will be £1.6 million in a full year.  The Deputy would be correct in saying that these figures are probably a good deal less than the amount which is unpaid in respect of licences.  It is a separate subject but it is one that concerns the Government, as it has concerned previous administrations.  We are anxious to take steps to catch up on as much of that licence money as possible and steps towards that end are under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this I should like to raise a query about something which is close to my heart.  I assume that the exemption for pensioners in regard to television licences will be maintained. Apologies, I have fallen into the same mistake as my colleague, Deputy MacSharry, because this refers to excise duty on the sale of televisions and not television licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that but the Minister for Finance in the course of his statement today mentioned evasion and avoidance and this is another example of the Government not being interested in tackling that aspect of evasion as far as TV licences are concerned.  The amount runs into millions.  The Government by this further imposition of £1.4 million on televisions are hitting at the honest taxpayer once again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct when he says that the Government are not concerned about this.  We have inherited a situation where there are arrears, as indeed did each Government in recent times.  Fianna Fáil inherited it <Col N="1563" /> and we inherited it in June 1981.  But, for the Deputy's information, the Government have had some discussion on this matter and are seeking means of catching up on these arrears and avoidance.  We are trying to find means of collecting as large a part as possible of the sums that are not being paid.  The Government have already concerned themselves with this and the Deputy is incorrect in saying that the Government are not concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this concern the Taoiseach says the Government have, will the Taoiseach outline to the House how much it is expected will be collected by the measures to be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said we have introduced measures but that the Government have discussed the question and that proposals in relation to this will be before the Government in due course. There is no official estimate of the amount of money but there are unofficial estimates of uncertain value and it would be unwise of me to give them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that they may not help us in the debate and that they may not be relevant to the Financial Resolution but the Taoiseach should accept that in regard to the honest taxpayers &mdash; we are all concerned about them and they were hit fairly hard today &mdash; for a small amount of £1.4 million they are being penalised and at the same time <Col N="1564" /> the Taoiseach cannot tell me how much was lost through avoidance.  The Taoiseach agrees that it is a substantial amount but he is not prepared to tell the House the measures the Government propose to take to collect that money.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been Minister for Finance for about eight months and not taken any action in the matter, the Deputy is not in a position to criticise us for not having acted within eight weeks. It is a separate question to the matter under discussion.  The money in question which is not being paid for television licences is not relevant to the Exchequer directly.  It is relevant to the question of the RTE licence fee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little confused <Col N="1565" /> about the huge hikes we had on fuel oil and so on in January.  Where do they arise in regard to the budget?  I understood the Minister to say that he would be seeking the authority of the House for those by way of a Financial Resolution.  I accept that under Financial Resolution No. 3 hydrocarbon oils are dealt with but how will the House give effect, belatedly, to the huge increases announced early in January?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As was done by the Government of which the Deputy was a member in March last year, the increases were brought in in the manner indicated and are before the House tonight in the form of a motion which I will move after the Resolutions.  The motion will cover the increases introduced last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain to the House why they should be before the House by way of a separate resolution and away from the group of resolutions which are before us to implement the terms of today's savage budget?  What is the reason for this? Members are entitled to an explanation as to the procedural reasons for this attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The excise duty increases were introduced in January in order to avoid the loss of revenue through the delay in the introduction of the budget following the change of Government in exactly the same way as the Government of which the Deputy was a member acted last year when, again, there was a danger of loss of revenue through the change of Government occurring.  The procedure was adopted in respect of the ordinary excise duty increases for what are known as &ldquo;the old reliables&rdquo;.  The resolution the Deputy has referred to relates to duty on other oils, heating oils and so on but excluding very heavy fuel oils and petrol.  This is a separate imposition on a different product not covered by the excise duty increases announced in January and which will be validated by the House later this evening when we come to the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1566" />
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Taoiseach for a political explanation about the resolutions.  I asked the Taoiseach to explain why the resolution on hydrocarbon oil is before us by way of Financial Resolution while the resolution to legalise the horrific increases announced in January is not on the list before us.  Are we entitled to discuss those increases later tonight in addition to being entitled to discuss the terms of the Resolution before us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be coming before the House later tonight and we will have a discussion on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair.  In that event I will deal with Financial Resolution No. 3.  What hydrocarbon oils are included in that resolution? What use are they put to?  Will the Taoiseach give an indication of the amount of revenue obtained from that oil in 1982 at the rate of 7p per gallon?  Will the Taoiseach indicate the amount of additional revenue it is hoped to get by the imposition of the 1p per gallon increase today?  I presume the hydrocarbon oil covers heavy industry and in that event it will have a serious impact on employment.  I presume LPG will be used by industry and that home heating oil is also included.  I should like to know what the Minister for Finance meant when he said that this would not apply to residual fuel oil used by the ESB and that there would not be any change in the concessionary rates already applying to residual fuel oil used by industry, to oil used by fishermen or for horticultural purposes. Will the Taoiseach give us a detailed account of the rates that already apply to residual fuel oil used by industry?  What industries specifically, not what type of industry, but what individual industries are exempt from this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This resolution deals with certain hydrocarbon oils and LPG which are used for non-automotive purposes, subject to exceptions.  The main categories of oil affected are diesel oil used in agriculture, in industry and in <Col N="1567" /> commercial and home heating, kerosene, lubricating oils, and certain light oils used in industry.  Residual fuel oil which is the main type of oil used in industry and by the ESB is not affected by the increase and is not covered by the resolution. There are certain duties on these oils at present: 4½p a gallon when used by the try and 7p per gallon when used by the ESB.  These are not being changed. Industry is only marginally affected as the oils dealt with here are the minority of the oils used in industry and have a very limited effect.  Similarly the increase is not being applied to oils used in sea fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, it is very difficult to hear the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry.  I thought I was being loud and clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry about that.  Perhaps the microphone is not as attuned to me as I should like.  The increase is not applied to oils used in sea fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach going back over what he said?  We did not hear what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start again.  I am very sorry about that.  These duties are on certain hydrocarbon oils and LPG used for non-automotive purposes.  The main categories of oils affected are diesel oil used in agriculture, in industry and in commercial and home heating, kerosene, lubricating oils and certain light oils used in industry.  Residual fuel oil, which is the main type of oil used by industry and the ESB, is not affected by the increase.  The resolution does not apply to residual fuel oil on which there are duties at present of 4½p per gallon in the case of industry and 7p per gallon in the case of the ESB. This resolution does not affect them and they are not changed.  As the great bulk of the oil used by industry is residual fuel <Col N="1568" /> oil, and diesel and kerosene and lubricating oils and light oils are relatively unimportant in industrial use, the impact of this on industry is quite marginal.</P>
      <P>In the case of sea fishing this increase does not apply.  It is not being applied to oils used in sea fishing.  There is a charge of 5p per gallon at present and that is not being changed.  In the case of horticultural production where there is a 2p per gallon rate at present, that is not being changed.  The effects on industry, fishing, and horticulture are either minimal or in the case of the latter two non-existent.  A large part of the impact will be in commercial and home heating which will be affected because of the type of oil used for that purpose in particular.  The Deputy also asked about the effect on the revenue: £2.7 million in the current financial year and £3.0 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it from what the Taoiseach said that the reference today means that where residual fuel oil is concerned it does not apply to any section of industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not apply to residual fuel oil.  That is not conveyed in the Minister's speech this afternoon. He said that this increase will not apply to residual fuel oil used by the ESB, nor will there be any change in the concessionary rates already applying to residual fuel oil used by industry.  We must remember there are two types of residual oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained that, with different rates of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a second. Part of the Taoiseach's problem is that he does not listen.  That is why we have such a budget before us.  The Minister said &ldquo; ...nor will there be any change in the <Col N="1569" /> concessionary rates already applying to residual fuel oil used by industry&rdquo;.  Those concessionary rates do not apply to all industry across the board.  They are selective. I am asking the Taoiseach to explain clearly to the House what is involved.  He said there is no increase in residual fuel oil, full stop.  The implication is that there is an increase on some residual fuel oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy is reading into the Minister's wording something which is not there.  Residual fuel oil is not affected by this resolution. Residual fuel oil is used by industry and by the ESB and, in the case of industry, it represents the great bulk of the oil used by industry.  Consequently the impact of the resolution on industry is minimal.  I hope that clarification for the third time will leave no doubt in the Deputy's mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  Are there two rates of charges for residual fuel oil?  In other words, is there a concessionary rate for some industries as distinct from the general rate?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a rate of 4½p per gallon chargeable on residual fuel oil used by industry and that is unchanged and unaffected by this resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>So we are absolutely sure it is confined to home heating, agriculture and commercial heating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I told the Deputy it also affects diesel oil used in agriculture and industry and in commercial and home heating, kerosene, lubrication oils <Col N="1570" /> and certain light oils used in industry. These represent a very small proportion of the total oil used by industry, the great bulk of which is residual fuel oil to which the resolution does not apply.</P>

      <P>It is because of these pink pages that we are asking these questions.  These pink pages were not read out this afternoon. I am sure when the members of the Labour Party studied what was in them, as we did, they were horrified to see the second budget.  That is why we are asking the Taoiseach to show us what other hidden budgets there may be in the Financial Resolution before the House.  These pink pages contain very severe impositions which were glossed over this afternoon in the Minister's speech.  They make very interesting reading.  I hope the press have had an opportunity to read them and see where the real boot presses.

      <P>Has the Taoiseach calculated the amount of income that will arise as a result of the increased imposition on televisions and videos?  Would he also inform the House how many jobs he expects will be lost in the trade as a result of these impositions?  The Taoiseach may not be aware that the duty in the North is 15 per cent VAT and the increase here will now be 35 per cent VAT.  As the Taoiseach is aware, quite a number of television and video sets are coming down from the North and depriving many people of their livelihood in the trade. The imposition of the increased rate of duty on televisions and videos will further damage the trade.  The Taoiseach has caused more job losses to add to the 180,000 people who are at present unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before replying to that, I was seeking to add to the information of the House.  Reference was made to the pink pages, page 46, and perhaps I should read out the part which Deputy Lenihan started to read but did not finish:</P>
      <P>The duty increase on road diesel does not apply to scheduled road passenger services.  The existing rebate of petrol duty for disabled drivers has been increased to offset the duty increase on petrol.</P>
      <P>On the question of television and video sets, I have given the figure of revenue with regard to television duties.  With regard to video players, it is anticipated that the overall effect of the increases will be £.6 million in 1983 and £.9 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that those figures are totally unrealistic, bearing in mind that a television set in the North is half the price of a set here? There is no duty in the North except VAT at 15 per cent.  The Taoiseach should not be fooling the House by saying he is going to get a certain amount of revenue when he knows in his heart that he cannot prevent the movement of television sets and videos coming across the Border and depriving our people of a livelihood because of the duty which he is imposing <Col N="1573" /> here tonight.  The Taoiseach must know he is damaging the trade but it is obvious, from the unemployment figures, that he is not interested in that area.  However, we on this side of the House are interested in creating employment.  This trade is very worried tonight as a result of the imposition of VAT at the rate of 35 per cent and the increased duties.  The Taoiseach will not get the revenue he expects from this quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The revenue figures are calculated to make due allowance for the problem which the Deputy mentions. No-one denies there is a problem in this area because although people are not entitled to import these articles, because their value exceeds the amount of the allowance, nevertheless there is a disturbing amount of smuggling.  The customs officials are attempting to control this and have been seizing a considerable number of these articles from individuals travelling from Northern Ireland and paying special attention to roads with a land frontier likely to be used by persons returning from shopping excursions to Northern Ireland.  In one area alone last Sunday there were 17 seizures, which is having a deterrent effect.  When the seizure rate gets as high as that, people think twice about involving themselves in illegal activities of this kind.  There are mobile patrols providing an integrated radio controlled system of surveillance on a 24-hour basis.  Extra staff are provided where necessary and additional patrols operate at weekends.  Despite the embargo on filling vacancies in the civil service, every effort is made to ensure that staffing levels in the Border areas are maintained at an adequate strength.  Considerable efforts are being made to control what is a very real problem and one which is giving rise to grave difficulties for traders in Border areas.  The Government recognise this and are giving priority to trying to tackle it and to achieve a rate of seizure which will discourage this type of illegal importation.</P>

      <P>The gallon of road diesel went up by 12p on the original <Col N="1574" /> increase in January.  Another penny is going on hydrocarbon oil.  Later on, in another resolution, we are going to have an increase also in VAT on it.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The penny on hydrocarbon oils is for non automotive carbon oils and therefore, has to be separated from road diesel oil.  The figure of 12p that the Deputy read out is, as stated on page 46, inclusive of VAT so the effect on road diesel of the impositions in the budget and the net cumulative effect of what has been done is 12p in total.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <P>I accept the Taoiseach's apology.  That is the second time I have been misled.  It is very difficult to extract the proper information.  Will there be a minimum effect on agriculture in relation to the hydrocarbon tax?  I understand the type of oil we are talking about is heavy oil which we call here residual oil.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have explained that.  I pointed out that this duty applies to diesel oil used in industry, to kerosene in so far as that is used in industry, to lubricating oil also used in industry and to certain light oils used in industry. Together these represent a small minority of the total volume of oil used by industry.  Obviously it will vary from industry to industry and I made that clear in my earlier reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that was explained in the Budget Statement.  It includes £2.7 million for the current year deriving from Resolution No. 3, from the impact of 1p per gallon.  It consists of two things.  There is the £2.7 million which the 1p per gallon to be imposed by this resolution would yield and another figure of £15 million which will derive from future increases in duties related to reductions in the price of oil arising in part from contracts renegotiated by the NPC and in part from reductions in the price of oil already in the pipeline.  The £15 million is a separate item but the two together make a total of £17.7 million for the purpose of the summary table.</P>

      <P>The Minister said in his speech that when this matter arises and when we reach the stage where the impact of the more favourable contracts with the NPC and reductions in the price of crude oil prices reach us, then further action in the House will be necessary. The House will have the opportunity of debating any proposals for an increase <Col N="1577" /> designed to yield the £15 million which is not covered by these resolutions.  The Minister made that clear today.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>From April onwards. At this stage I would not like to give a specific date.  There are different components in this reduction and obviously one does not want to come to the House every week for adjustment.  It will depend on the scale and time of reductions in the cost of oil for the Government to choose the best time to come to the House and seek increases appropriate to those reductions and also having regard to the part of the year remaining.  It will be some time from April onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he does not want to come to the House for adjustments every day.  He did not come to the House on 7 January.  Will he come to the House when he intends taking action on this matter or will it be done by order outside the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend on the time when it comes about.  The Deputy had the experience himself in Government of using this mechanism in order to increase excise duties so as not to lose revenue by waiting for the House to resume.  In the ordinary way these matters are dealt with in the House unless the situation arises during a recess when the procedure which the Deputy as Minister used last year would be applied.  For example, if an increase were required during the summer recess, the procedure could be used and it would be validated by the Dáil subsequently.  However, if the Dáil is in session it would be brought to the Dáil in the usual way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the earlier statement by the Taoiseach that the imposition of hydrocarbon duties and tax would have little or no effect on industry, would he now agree that the imposition of £17.7 million in total will have a very <Col N="1578" /> significant effect on industry and agriculture? Could he also tell me the effect that will have on the CPI?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the imposition of duties under Resolution No. 3 would have relatively little effect on industry as most of the oils used in industry are not covered by this resolution which raises £2.7 million.  As regards the other £15 million, we are talking of additional taxation which would be imposed where oil prices are falling and where it would be possible to secure additional taxation either with no consequent increase in the cost of oil to the consumer, industrial or otherwise, or possibly with some reduction depending upon how much of the drop in oil prices is taken up by the increase in taxation.  Therefore, a CPI effect is not involved in the £15 million and one cannot at this stage say whether there will be a CPI reduction. That would depend on the scale of the fall in oil prices during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to please stop misleading the House about the extent to which light oils are used in industry.  The vast majority of light industries and farming use light oil and diesel oil.  When you talk about the big volumes of oil used in industry you are talking in total about the very heavy consumption of a very small number of very large industries who use enormous boilers which consume the very heavy oils.  The bulk of light industry are affected by this and they would have been expecting a reduction in the 7p and not an increase in it.  Therefore, it will have an adverse effect on a wide range of industries and on general farming because of the extent of the use of light oils there.  The Taoiseach is misunderstanding the situation and I can understand why.  If you take industry, the big volume of oil goes into the ESB and to a certain limited number of very big industries, that is he global volume.  The volume used by the rest of light industry, which is very important in this country, relatively speaking is small. You are talking then about the bulk of light industry.  That is the relationship <Col N="1579" /> which has been somewhat confused here in this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make the point that it would be uneven in industry, depending on the proportions of heavy or light oil used, and I am sure the Deputy is well informed on the point.  The impact will be variable.  I am sure that that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the impact not be more severe on the smaller industries than on some of the giants the Taoiseach is talking about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Obviously, if an industry uses light oils rather than heavy oils it will be more affected by this.  That is self-evident.  The imposition itself, 1p, is not very heavy.  Of the £2.7 million a very significant proportion of it I think would relate to non-industrial uses.  Commerce, the public service and residential use accounts for almost half of the total diesel oil used in the country.  The proportion of the £2.7 million which would fall on industry would probably be no more than about £.75 million.  I hazard a guess.  I am not seeking to give precise figures but the order of magnitude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask two questions and I will not ask any more on this group of resolutions.  I want the figure of the CPI impact of Resolution No. 3 plus the VAT implication plus the oil increases, petrol, diesel or whatever, of 7 January.  In other words, what is the effect on CPI of the oil increases in today's budget plus VAT and the savage budget of 7 January plus VAT on those? The second figure I want from the Taoiseach is the overall impact on CPI of the six resolutions we are discussing at the moment plus VAT on those.  I hope that I have expressed myself clearly enough to avoid confusion of the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give the Deputy the breakdown.  He will appreciate that the CPI effect of VAT on any one element is included in the CPI effect of VAT generally in the budget.  We do not want to double-count.  I want to be careful in the answer I give and not to mislead.  The effect on petrol is .345 per cent increase in CPI for the increase of 7 January and .245 per cent for the VAT increase on 1 March giving a total of .59 per cent.  So far as Resolution No. 3 is concerned the impact of the resolution itself on CPI is estimated at .014 per cent. In addition the VAT increase on 1 May of 5 per cent in so far as it relates to oils covered by Resolution No. 3 will be .083 per cent.  Therefore, the total impact on CPI of taxation increases of Resolution No. 3 plus Vat in relation to these oils we are talking about is .097 per cent.  The total effect of taxation on petrol both in the increase of 7 January and VAT is .59 per cent.  Therefore, the figure between the two, which is obviously what the Deputy wants, is about .69 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to take them one by one.  I will give the total effect including VAT, although of course the VAT element is counted in the CPI effect on VAT which will be listed separately in the budget resumé.  For Resolution No. 1 &mdash; televisions &mdash; the impact will be .01 per cent.  In the case of videos there is no significant impact but the fact that videos <Col N="1581" /> may not have featured largely in the household budget inquiry when the present CPI base was established means that the figures we have here probably are not totally representative.  Even if they were included the effect would be very small indeed as can be seen from the amount of money involved.  In regard to Resolution No. 3 I have answered that &mdash; .097 per cent is the effect of the resolution and VAT together.  In the case of Resolution No. 4 there is no effect on CPI and the same is true of Resolution No. 5.  CPI does not take account of gambling.  With Resolution No. 6 there is no CPI effect. Foreign travel is not included in CPI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Resolution No. 6, I take it that in relation to foreign <Col N="1582" /> travel tax a change is being made in relation to subsection (1) and it will be on aircraft carrying more than 15 passengers and that the tax will not apply to aircraft, either internal or external, flying internationally which are not carrying more than 15 passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In fact a situation has arisen where on a particular route aircraft with fewer than 15 passengers are operating parallel with aircraft carrying more than 15 passengers and this is leading to a distortion of competition.  The provision exempting aircraft carrying under 15 passengers is removed by the resolution although obviously charter or executive aircraft would not be covered by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If somebody charters a small aircraft carrying three or four or seven or eight people this will not apply. I do not mean a large charter.  If you charter the whole aircraft and there are tickets issued it is payable.  That position remains.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is now being applied to such cases.  It has not been hitherto.  One effect of this resolution is to apply it because of a distortion of competition which has arisen on one route because it has not hitherto been applied to aircraft carrying fewer than 15 passengers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is unwise to use phrases like &ldquo;sorting out&rdquo; in the light of happenings in recent days.  The increase in revenue for foreign travel, as I mentioned to Deputy MacSharry a moment ago, is £2.3 million this year and £3 million in a full year, as a result of the increase in the rate of duty to £5 per person and, although this obviously will be very small indeed, the removal of the exemption in relation to aircraft with fewer than 15 passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back to something the Taoiseach said.  I see that the resolution involves the deletion of part of subsection (1) by the deletion of &ldquo;aircraft means an aircraft suitable for the carriage of more than 15 passengers&rdquo;. I understand the reason those words are being deleted from that subsection is because of some distortion on some journeys. Would the Taoiseach like to elaborate on where that occurred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It arose from the introduction of eight seater and 15 seater aircraft by one of the air companies on scheduled flights to the Isle of Man creating an anomaly whereby passengers travelling on one of the larger 30 seater aircraft operated by the company were liable for the duty while those travelling on the smaller aircraft were not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the further imposition of this increase to £5 per ticket will cause considerable unemployment in the travel business where it will end up as being more attractive to cross the Border and purchase tickets there for the purpose of on-flying journeys?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I am sure the Taoiseach would agree that he is as capable as possible from the <Col N="1585" /> Government side to answer the queries that are being put to him without interruptions from some of his Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not make any declaration of incapacity nor can I fail to be entertained occasionally by some of the interruptions from both sides of the House, disorderly though they may be. The imposition of additional duty of either £2 or £3, depending on the form of travel, is very unlikely to divert anybody <i>via</i> Northern Ireland because of that sum of money.  I would not say that the effect on employment would be negligible; I would say it would be nil.</P>

      <P>My concern is because of the considerable capital requirements of Aer Lingus, the national airline, that it would be a pity if any action taken by the Government now would put further serious financial pressures on the company. With regard to Resolution No. 1, would the Taoiseach be able to indicate the total number employed in that highly technological field of the production of televisions and video players in this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand if the Government were making such an impact on this particular type of production that they would have been conscious of the number in employment in that production field at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is some manufacture of those sets here the bulk of them are manufactured elsewhere. Any impact on employment would be in the distribution end rather than to any significant degree in the manufacturing sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that <Col N="1586" /> there is manufacturing or assembly of those particular devices here at this time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The percentage is very small.  In 1982 only 4 per cent of excise duty receipts in relation to television sets related to home produced sets, which is a very small number indeed.  If there were any employment effects they would be in the distribution rather than the production sector obviously.  There are no figures readily available on the employment in the distribution of television sets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that those particular increases are putting in jeopardy the employment of a very skilful group of people and that the possibility is that there will be massive redundancies because of those levies introduced today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would consider that very improbable since the total number of sets involved would seem to be no more than 5,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach any figure in respect of the now average production cost of a monochrome television attracting the £121 excise duty and also of what percentage of the total production cost would the £121 represent?  The answer might be very educational from the point of view of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

The Act provides that gaming is permissible only <Col N="1588" /> in amusement halls and funfairs.

      <P>I have suggested that because of the impositions contained in this legislation, all the Members should stay.  Never have any government put before the House as penal, as hard hitting, or as farreaching a Financial Resolution as this which we are about to discuss.  I look across to the Labour Party benches and think of a once proud Labour Party.  They are decent Members over there and I ask them very seriously do they realise what they are taking on when they support these resolutions, obviously introduced by a Fine Gael Government and to which they are now going to subscribe?  There is 5 per cent increase on VAT on the standard rate from 18 per cent to 23 per cent and on the higher rate from 30 per cent to 35 per cent and the increase on the effective rate for building and agriculture from 3 per <Col N="1603" /> cent to 5 per cent.  What will this do to unemployment?  How many job losses will there be?  By how much more is this going to accelerate the dreadful job losses which we have been seeing?  We know of the downturn in the building industry. We also know that never did that industry more need a fillip.  Yet, in one fell swoop this afternoon when the budget speech was over and the Minister had completed his reply to the budget, we had the pink pages &mdash; and by that name they will become famous.  They were handed out and in them were the details of the cuts which had been casually referred to by the Minister for Finance &mdash; glossed over, I would say, for fear that they would be picked up.  We realised, on reading these pink pages, the serious cutbacks in public expenditure in the areas involved.  The development corporation about which we heard so much from those benches were given a measly £7 million.</P>

      <P>And further diminishing.  I speak in the presence of a very respected Member of that party. That man must be seriously considering what a mistake has been made by his party. He should be voting with us against these penal measures when this motion is put to the House.  There is a 5 per cent increase on almost every item.  Last year we were horrified to hear that VAT was to be imposed on clothing and footwear. The Government fell and, fortunately, that imposition did not occur. Tonight we are in an almost worse position. We talk about essential needs and goods.  Surely what is contained among the items in the srtandard rate of tax is essential to the ordinary home, the ordinary housewife and the ordinary worker? I sympathise with Minister Boland on hearing that not one shilling was provided for public service pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not one shilling over and above what had been provided for the re-negotiated public service pay agreement last November.  When has that ever happened before in a budget? I also want the Taoiseach to put on record the impact of the 5 per cent increase on the CPI of VAT from 18 to 23 per cent and from 30 to 35 per cent.  His colleague Minister will live with it, eat with it and sleep with it over the coming weeks.  I know full well the burden he will have to carry because of the callous acts of the Minister for Finance here this evening. Never did a Minister create so much hardship in such a short time.  I want to go through quickly the essential items contained in the goods chargeable at the lower rate &mdash; fertilisers which are essential to the farming community.  The farmers over there will be voting a 5 per cent increase on machinery, seeds and plants at this time of year.  The items include printed books and school books, newspapers, periodicals, materials commonly used in the construction of buildings &mdash; blocks, cement and so forth.  What unemployment will be created and how many <Col N="1605" /> jobs will be lost.  I am sure many of my colleagues will have a lot of things to say because no budget has ever been so severe on clearing people out of work, on creating redundancies, creating unemployment rather than employment.</P>
      <P>The Public Capital Programme has been cut back more than £200 million.  In itself that will completely cripple the building industry already in bad shape.  It is proposed to impose a 5 per cent increase in the various VAT bands right across the board.  That is something we shall oppose in this House this evening and in coming weeks both inside and outside this House.  Even the workers' net income is being clawed back more and more by a Government whom I believe have gone too far on this occasion. The cost of these increases, by way of wage increases and so on, is so horrific one is afraid to venture to forecast the outcome.</P>
      <P>I should be glad if the Taoiseach would tell us what will be the effect of these increases on the Consumer Price Index. Above all I must make it clear that we are absolutely opposed to this measure because, whatever is the present future for employment, certainly it has taken a stab in the back, a body blow this afternoon from which it will take years to recover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On this side of the House we have no alternative, in fact it is our duty to strenuously oppose these VAT increases.  They will have a very considerable impact on our economy and on the community in general in many different ways.  There are two aspects of them to which we must address ourselves: the first is the burden these increases will place on families and households.  In effect one can say that they will increase the price of the entire range of consumer goods within the VAT net by 5 per cent. There are some minor diversions from that general rule, but, as far as we can ascertain, the 18 per cent is going to 23 per cent, the 30 per cent to 35 per cent and a new rate being introduced of 5 per cent on fuels at present zero rated.  That includes practically everything one can think of.  The 3 per cent rate applicable <Col N="1606" /> to building and certain agricultural services is going up to 5 per cent so there is an increase of just 2 per cent there but, by and large, the overall increase is in the region of 5 per cent.  Certainly that will very seriously affect the lower and middle income groups and will seriously distort the household family budgets of the over-whelming majority of people.  I cannot see how that can be justified in present circumstances.</P>
      <P>Of course the second major impact it will have is on employment.  From a number of points of view I believe that that probably constitutes its most serious aspect.  Certainly it will depress the consumption of the goods concerned.  In so far as these goods are produced and manufactured in this country there will be a considerable falling off in output as a result of these impositions.  Therefore the increase of 5 per cent is entirely detrimental from the point of view of the cost of living on a very large section of our community and that of employment prospects also.</P>
      <P>Therefore we must oppose these impositions.  Somebody has pointed out that the building construction industry is on the floor.  This budget deals that building and construction industry a series of severe blows, as if it were not bad enough already.  Unemployment in that industry is at an all-time high.  The condition of the industry as such &mdash; which constitutes a backbone type of industry in our economy &mdash; has hardly ever been worse.  The increase of 3 per cent VAT to 5 per cent on building will deal a very severe blow to that industry.  There are many other things throughout the budget that will affect it also but I believe it will have a very serious effect on the house-building side of the construction industry.  The picture that will emerge following the imposition of these increases will be a very bleak one indeed and it is very difficult to see how these increases can be justified on any grounds whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some matters I want to have firmly cleared up by the Taoiseach when he comes to reply.  First of all, what exact types of fuel will be involved now in the increase from zero rating to 5 per cent? Are we correct in thinking that this new <Col N="1607" /> 5 per cent rate will apply to turf, turf briquettes, coal, various types of heating oil, other than hydrocarbon oils?  It is very important that we know exactly what is happening in that area.</P>
    <P>Would the Taoiseach confirm also that the only change being made in the other category, the 18 per cent category, is that that is going to 23 per cent; in other words that there are no changes being made in the items coming within that category?  Is it just that everything that is subject to 18 per cent at present will be subject to 23 per cent, that nothing will be taken out of the category or added to it?  Does the same rule apply to the 30 per cent category at present?  Will that 30 per cent rate just go to 35 per cent <i>simpliciter</i>, with no additions to the 30 or 35 per cent category, or no subtractions from it?  In other words will the Taoiseach confirm that I am right in saying that building and agricultural services will go from 3 per cent to 5 per cent, everything that is 18 per cent will go to 23 per cent with no change in the category, everything that is 30 per cent will go to 35 per cent with no change in the category and that a new 5 per cent VAT rate will be introduced for certain types of fuel?  Will he indicate what those types are?  There is also the question of unregistered farmers going from 1.8 per cent to 2.3 per cent.  That item does not need clarification.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will clarify these points for me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with some of the specific queries raised and then deal with the more general issues. Deputy Fitzgerald sought to list some of the items which he said were affected by this.  He did not mention very many although he said he could go on forever. Of the ones he mentioned, seeds are at zero rate when used for food production. School books are zero rated as are fertilisers used for agricultural purposes.  He was unfortunate in his choice of items. Of course there is a long list of items to which the increases apply but these are not among them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the VAT increases on the CPI, including the VAT impact on fuel <Col N="1608" /> which we dealt with earlier, is 1.64 per cent.  That is the effect of all the VAT rate increases &mdash; the introduction of the 5 per cent rate for fuel, raising the 3 per cent rate to 5 per cent in respect of building and other services, the increase from 18 per cent to 23 per cent, taking account of the excise adjustments, and the increase from 30 per cent to 35 per cent. Taking these together the effect on the CPI is 1.64 per cent or just under half of the total impact of the budget on the CPI. There are no changes in the categories. Deputy Haughey is correct in that.  Last year we examined some of the items in the categories when in Government and would like to re-examine some of them before the next budget.  The increase mentioned by Deputy Haughey of 1.8 per cent to 2.3 per cent is an increased relief for farmers to offset the adverse impact on them of VAT on goods they purchase.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the increase in the rebate from 1.8 per cent to 2.3 per cent.  With regard to fuel it applies to all fuel other than electricity. This includes coal, coke, turf, firewood, heating oil, paraffin and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an entirely new category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is a new category. It is a tax on fuel other than electricity. Deputy Haughey seemed to suggest that all consumer goods were included.  This is not the case because almost one-third of consumer goods &mdash; food, clothing, footwear and electricity &mdash; continue at zero rate.  There is no change in relation to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opposition speakers have been critical of these impositions because of their impact on the cost of living and the possible effect on employment.  The amount raised by these changes is £119 million. Deputy Haughey earlier confirmed that his party's policy was to reduce the current budget deficit to £700 million.  The document <i>The Way Forward</i> refers to a budget deficit of 5.5 per cent of GNP. <Col N="1609" /> That would mean a deficit of £730 million. Deputy Haughey suggested the EEC had proposed that we reduce the deficit to £700 million.  That is not correct. No such guidelines were given by the EEC.  The only guideline given by them related to total borrowing.  They suggested we should reduce the level of borrowing by 3 per cent of GDP.  This budget reduces it by 3½ per cent.  There is no authority for the figure of £700 million except Fianna Fáil in their document <i>The Way Forward.</i>  The former Taoiseach confirmed the view tonight that that is the figure we should have aimed at.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil were in Government what would we face?  Deputy Fitzgerald said how terrible it was that the Labour Party had to face this budget.  He indicated how much better they would have been with Fianna Fáil.  If Fianna Fáil policy had been pursued let us consider how we would have fared.  It would have required £165 million net additional revenue to reach the target to which Deputy Haughey referred and incorporated in <i>The Way Forward.</i>  To achieve that figure, allowing for the impact on buoyancy, would have required £230 million gross additional revenue because of the loss of buoyancy which such an impost would lead to as regards the return to the Exchequer.  The Deputy is now telling us that the Opposition opposed this tax which will yield £120 million.</P>
    <P>We are in the position where the Opposition are telling us that we should have imposed £350 million taxation other than VAT.  I am sure they would scarcely suggest that we should have imposed more excise duty on drink and tobacco. Indeed it has been suggested that we have gone past the point of no return in that regard.  It is legitimate for me to ask where that £350 million would have come from if Fianna Fáil were in office.  What taxes would they have imposed?  If you exclude VAT and excise duties the only other major item of taxation capable of yielding large sums is income tax.  The only way that could have been raised and the deficit reduced to the level of the Fianna Fáil target would have been to increase the total income tax take by <Col N="1610" /> one-fifth, from £1,750 million to £2,100 million.  It is fair to ask Deputy Haughey if that is Fianna Fáil policy, and, if not, where they would have got the revenue from in order to achieve the target set in <i>The Way Forward</i> and confirmed by him here tonight.  I look forward to hearing his answer.</P>
    <P>Constructive criticism from the Opposition is welcome but in this case we know their policies in broad outline.  We know what they feel should have been done. They apparently feel this is not part of how that should have been achieved.  We are left with the question of where the additional £350 million revenue would come from.  I am more than happy to sit down and let Deputy Haughey answer that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise if I suggested that the EEC put forward a suggestion for a £700 million deficit in our circumstances in 1983.  I think they did so but if the Taoiseach says otherwise I will accept it.  We were certainly planning on a budget deficit of £750 million but that was at the time we left office and we ceased our calculations in November.  It is probably legitimate for us to say that the figure may have been somewhere between £700 million and £800 million, depending on the level of GNP attainable in 1983.  It seems from the White Paper on Estimates for receipts and expenditure that the situation this year may be a bit more buoyant than we were led to believe last November.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Taoiseach should make too much of an issue of our aiming for a current budget deficit of £750 million. It is legitimate for us to say that the figure might in our case have gone to £800 million but that is only £100 million of a difference between us.  The really significant difference between us is that the Government have decided to phase out the current budget deficit over five years instead of four years.  I know this must be going in the teeth of every piece of economic and financial advice they are receiving.  That is where the real cost in Exchequer borrowing will arise.  When we were preparing <i>The Way Forward</i> we were under considerable pressure from a certain section of our advisers to eliminate the current budget deficit in three years and it was only after a great deal of argument and discussion that they were prepared in <i>The Way Forward</i> to agree to a four-year period.  The Government have extended it to five years and this is where the Taoiseach is playing politics in order to keep the Coalition Government together and keep the Labour Party with him in order to stay in office.  The stretching of the phasing out period from four years to five years will add at least £500 million and probably more to our Exchequer borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has for some time been very articulate on the question <Col N="1612" /> of the amount of our taxation which is being used to pay for borrowing and he says that situation must be put right so that we can use the revenue from taxes for the building up of the economy, the provision of services and so on.  At the same time by a conscious political decision taken in the face of advice he is certainly getting from the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the ESRI, he has stretched the period for eliminating the current budget deficit from four years to five years, adding at least £500 million to our Exchequer borrowing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fine piece of smoke-screening but it does not get away from the basic issue which the Deputy has raised.  He suggests that the £750 million might have become £800 million because of greater buoyancy of GNP.  I understand the position to be that the target of 5.5 per cent of GNP fixed in <i>The Way Forward</i> would, applied to the present estimate of GNP, involve a deficit of £730 million, not £800 million.  The Deputy, I think, is wrong.  It is the difference between that and the figure in this budget which Fianna Fáil believe should have been raised in additional revenue. To raise that £165 million net over and above what is provided for here would have involved gross additional taxation of about £230 million to allow for loss of buoyancy.  To raise the further money required not to impose the taxation the Opposition are now opposing would require another £120 million and the fact remains that Fianna Fáil policies, as enunciated here tonight, would require the raising of £350 million by other means.</P>

We have heard this evening in the same speech from the Leader of the Opposition two totally different streams of thought, depending on which piece of paper he was looking at. One referred to the undesirability of such a high level of deficit, which he said should be around the figure of £750 million, <Col N="1613" /> and the other stream of thought suggested that the budget was too deflationary. Anybody who can within the same speech and in the space of five minutes put forward these two opposite propositions is certainly better on the Opposition benches than in Government.</P>

      <P>I want to raise the issue of the increase in the rate of VAT from 3 per cent to 5 per cent but I must take up the Taoiseach on his reference to two streams of thought.</P>
      <P>I have before me his abortive budget of 27 January 1982 and a copy of today's budget statement.  He has taken a very different line in this budget to that taken last year, particularly in relation to the current budget deficit and in his ideas regarding the need for financial rectitude, something which is absent in this budget. He said last year that one of the main objectives was to change the income tax system so as to make it fairer and to lessen the burden imposed on the lower paid.  He went on to say that budget deficits are demoralising and that his Government would eliminate the budget deficit in four years.  The Labour Party have clearly made an impact on him and his Government and the reported exit of the Tánaiste from several Cabinet meetings has changed the Taoiseach's views of a year ago.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what exactly is meant on page 21 of the now infamous pink document by the requirement to reduce by £10 million the 1983 provision for the Housing Finance Agency.  One of the most serious aspects of this budget will be the effect of the VAT increase on the construction industry which is now in a very serious state. They made their position clear to the Minister for the Environment some weeks ago and he gave a clear commitment that no action would be taken which would in any way damage the construction industry, already seriously affected. This action will bring that industry to its knees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already seen during the term of this Government the teachers and the publicans protesting at the gates of Leinster <Col N="1614" /> House and I am convinced that we will soon see the construction industry making a public protest, if they can afford to come.  This is a reprehensible step and it is clear that the Government have no commitment to one of our most vulnerable industries.  We can expect very serious repercussions because of this action. Perhaps the Minister would answer my question regarding the reduction of £10 million in the provision for the Housing Finance Agency.</P>

Had all the considerations which Deputy Haughey developed a few minutes ago been applied in 1980 we might not be having this discussion in these terms this evening.</P>
      <P>On the specific question raised by the Deputy it is pointed out on page 21 of the Principal Features of the Budget that a revised assessment of the requirements of the Housing Finance Agency has enabled a reduction of £10 million to be made.  This reduction is in the non-Exchequer provision for the agency and it becomes possible to make that reduction because it is now forecast that the level of activity in this area will be such as to reduce the requirement below the level originally intended.  I might add that this in itself does not in any way involve a reduction in the amount of finance available for housing as compared with last year.</P>

      <P>It is clear that the reason the money is not required is because the scheme has been a complete failure and people are not taking up the finance that is available from the agency.

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also opposed to this resolution because of the serious affect it will have on the motor industry.  In recent months all Members were made aware of the critical state of that industry and I should like to know how Government backbenchers will be able to explain the situation that will exist as a result of the budget to those engaged in the motor industry in their constituencies.  They will have to explain to those people that they were unsuccessful in their efforts to have the VAT rate for services in the motor trade decreased from 18 per cent to 3 per cent.  Those Members got a great kick in the teeth from the Minister for Finance today because instead of getting a decrease the VAT rate is being increased by 5 per cent.  That will take some explaining.  Representatives of the motor trade have pointed out to us all what was happening in the motor trade and what would occur if there was not a decrease in the VAT rate.  They expressed concern at suggestions that VAT might be raised in the budget &mdash; I wonder if information was leaked from a Government meeting about this matter &mdash; and they feared that if that happened it would spell disaster for the motor trade.  They pointed out that VAT registered outlets had already suffered a loss of 6,000 jobs in three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all expressed concern about the unemployment situation and what <Col N="1616" /> should be done to rectify it but now an uncaring Minister, and an uncaring Government, are inflicting more damage on an industry that has already suffered and has reached the stage of diminishing returns as a result of the increase in petrol.  We will be discussing the proposal to increase road tax at a later stage.  It should be evident to the Government that an industry which lost 6,000 jobs in three years will be hopelessly uncompetitive as a result of the budget and the big number of unregistered outlets.  There will be more redundancies and company failures and there is little prospect of any apprentices being taken on in that industry.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the motor industry told us in recent weeks that in 1982 there was a drop of 34,000 in new car sales compared to the previous year resulting in a loss to the Exchequer of at least £50 million from excise duty and VAT.  It should have been obvious to the Government that there was no scope for imposing a further increase in the tax on new cars.  The recent massive hike in the price of petrol has also affected the industry. I should like to know what Fords of Cork will do now.  How will the Government backbenchers from that county explain to the workers of Fords the effect of Financial Resolution No. 7 on that thriving industry?  That industry gives tremendous employment, direct and indirect, in Cork city and county but undoubtedly, it will be under tremendous pressure.  We should be considering ways of expanding such an industry to take up the slack in other areas.  The increase in VAT in this area will have disastrous effects on the motor industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also opposed to the terms of this resolution.  Already we have the highest indirect taxes in Europe. Such taxes are very regressive and hit hardest on those least able to pay, the lower income group, because a higher proportion is paid out by them in VAT, which covers everything from washing powder to Pampers and all items purchased in supermarkets.  Consumers will be hardest hit because there is widespread evasion of VAT by those who also <Col N="1617" /> evade income tax.  Consumers do not have any way of avoiding paying VAT on the items they buy.  This resolution covers a wide range of goods and activities.  The tourist trade has been hit by a whole range of increases in the last month and such matters as closures in B &amp; I and CIE but now it will be hit again by these VAT increases.  They will have an appalling effect on tourism.</P>
      <P>One item that sickens me about this increase &mdash; Deputy Haughey asked a question about it but I do not think he was given a satisfactory answer &mdash; is in regard to VAT on fuel.  I do not know how much the Government expect to take in on this but it is appalling to put 5 per cent VAT on briquettes, a bag of logs or a bag of coal.  It must be remembered that some people can only afford to purchase a bag of coal per week.  Will the imposition of VAT on wax candles and night lights bring in £100?  Will it bring in £10?  Will it bring in enough to pay the cost of having them printed in this resolution? It should be remembered that excluded are candles and night lights which are decorated, spiralled, tapered or perfumed.  I am in a position to bring the Minister to houses in Dublin where wax candles are used for light because the electricity has been cut off.  I am aware of one house where the electricity was cut off five years ago and the occupants have not been able to pay the amount required to have it restored. There are people who depend on wax candles for light.  What will the Minister make from them?  Why put VAT on wax candles and night lights?</P>
      <P>The Minister should look again at the tax on heating and, in particular, on the solid fuel items, coal, logs and peat, and also gas and central heating.  I doubt that the amount of money brought in will in any way cover the possible medical problems which will arise particularly for old people, and the cost generated for the State when they are taken to hospital or suffer from diseases of one kind or another as a result of lack of heating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole range of VAT will affect jobs in various industries such as the car trade which was hit disastrously over a number of years past.  The 5 per cent on <Col N="1618" /> heating and fuel is an absolute disaster and the Minister should look at it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Lyons I had a number of discussions with people in the motor trade about the difficulties they face now.  For some time past they have been wondering what the effect would be if there were increases in taxation in this budget.  As to whether they had access to a leak, I must say I bow to the superior wisdom of the Opposition in matters of that kind.  They did not get any indication from me as to what they might expect.</P>
      <P>I fully understand that the motor trade is in a difficult position.  It is not the only industry in a difficult position.  It is in a difficult position not because of increases in petrol prices only, or increases in VAT on cars only.  It has not been helped enormously by the reduction in rates of excise on spare parts only.  A whole complex of factors has to do with their present economic situation which combined to create difficulties for the industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lyons said 6,000 jobs were lost in the motor industry over the past three years.  I do not dispute those figures.  They come from the motor industry itself. What I am proposing to do tonight has not had any effect over the past three years, and still the industry has had a problem over that period.  We must look at the problems of that industry in a wider context than the measures we are discussing here this evening.</P>
      <P>During the course of my statement this afternoon I said I wanted to have a look at the effects of increases in VAT rates on the competitive position of registered businesses as opposed to unregistered businesses.  That is a problem from which the motor industry suffers at the moment. It is one of the areas I had in mind when I said I would examine it between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill with a view to seeing what legislative measures might be taken in order to go some of the way towards dealing with that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a general problem.  I pointed out that high levels of VAT have this extra complication in them.  We can all agree on that.  The point at issue is not the specific proposal we are making this evening. <Col N="1619" /> It is the wider problem of how we get more of the unregistered businesses to register.  I suppose that, in this connection, the words &ldquo;unregistered businesses&rdquo; are in some cases a euphemism for what we normally call the black economy.  There is a major problem here and we will have to deal with it.  It is a separate issue from the one we are dealing with now.</P>
    <P>It can be said that if we had a more buoyant level of activity in this industry and in many others, the revenue to the State would increase because of the fact that we would be getting extra excise duty or extra VAT on those higher levels of activity.  At the moment we have the levels of activity which we have and, on the other hand, the public finances are faced with their own problem of financing during this year.  We have to make up our minds on how we will face those problems. Taking account of all the factors before us, the series of measures which I proposed to the House today appear to us to be the best balance of measures we can take in order to meet the problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla claimed that VAT is highly regressive.  There is a great deal of evidence to suggest otherwise in our present system, particularly because of the large number of items which are zero rated and items at the lower rates.  The items which are zero rated compose a large proportion of the expenditure of lower income households and therefore moderate the effect of VAT on people at the lower end of the income scale.  For that reason in proposing these changes we have not proposed a large number of changes from the zero rate into the 5 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla also made a point about VAT on fuel and on certain wax candles and night lights.  They are not in the lower rate but in the higher rate.  As regards wax candles and night lights generally, there is a point for consideration between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill.  These items would not account for a large proportion of revenue. Apart from that, we must look at the overall question of what proposals we can make and what measures we can take <Col N="1620" /> to bring about the revenue versus expenditure situation at which we are aiming.</P>
    <P>To pick the measures we are discussing out of total context, and to make all these points about it &mdash; with many of which I can agree in isolation &mdash; and to home in on it and criticise it in the way it has been criticised, is to lose the perspective of the overall budgetary situation.</P>
    <P>The measures we propose are designed, taken together, to achieve a particular result.  We have fashioned them to give the best balance possible taking account of equity requirements, the effect on people at the lower end of the income scale, and we want to do this in the most equitable fashion possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very concerned about the increases in VAT and the introduction for the first time of VAT on fuels which will have the effect of adding 25p per cwt. to the price of coal.  Fianna Fáil introduced measures such as the Turf Bill to encourage the use of native fuel. The Minister now proposes to put VAT on the price of peat.  The Minister will not have much of a problem with the produce of Bord na Móna but, since the Bill was introduced and since grant aiding was available for machines to cut the turf, the contractors have leased bogs.  They cut the crop and sell it by area, by rood, or by three hours' cutting.  They purchase or harvest this crop.  How does the Minister propose to assess VAT on peat at that level?  VAT on contracting has been increased from 3 per cent to 5 per cent. This is going to have a very serious effect in an area of operation where it is almost impossible to secure contractors, because for one reason or another, it was not profitable.  Many small farmers now have to purchase jointly very expensive machinery for a short period because those contractors have gone out of business. It is a retrograde step to increase VAT on contracting, whether it is silage making, spraying, land drainage or land reclamation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very disappointed at the attitude of the Taoiseach <Col N="1621" /> when he treated almost with derision questions addressed to him by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the effects on the underprivileged of the 5 per cent increase in fuel.  I am also worried about the effect of the increases on the construction industry.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the construction industry, despite going through a difficult patch, is one of the areas with the highest multiplier effect and, as such, is looked upon by economic experts as an area to generate growth and to promote employment. I was surprised that the Taoiseach refused to deal constructively with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister advised us not to home in on any particular matter.  The more you move out into the wider area of Government policy as it relates to this budget and look at areas even like education, you will see that this Government are acting in an élitist fashion.  The underprivileged and the lower paid seem to be treated with far less sensitivity and concern than we had been led to believe this Government would do.  The Leader of the Opposition and a number of other Deputies have asked a question in relation to the total revenue that is likely to accrue from the 5 per cent on fuel but we still have not got a reply.  I am seriously concerned that the application of this percentage right across the board would have a most damaging and injurious effect on the lower paid.  I would like the Minister to give us the information in relation to that question.  I would also like him to address himself to the problems that will definitely arise in small industries, retail outlets and manufacturing units who are not in a very strong competitive position in relation to the increase in VAT from 18 per cent to 23 per cent.  I spoke to a number of business people with small retail units who had already been suffering losses in employment due to the ravages of the recession and who expressed extreme apprehension about the likely effects in the area of employment of the increase.  I do not know where they got their information but they were anticipating this 5 per cent increase with great fear and trepidation. I would like the Minister to think again <Col N="1622" /> in relation to the 5 per cent on fuel and in relation to the effects the increase from 18 per cent to 23 per cent are likely to have on small retail units.  I would ask him to think about the implications they have for employment and the likely effects on the building industry.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister reading politely and articulately from this white document, we believed the budget was going to be reasonably harmless but on reading the pink and cream documents we found out where the real venom was.  I suppose it could be regarded as the pink and cream budget with a very black content.</P>
      <P>I should like to comment on the hotels industry.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the dire straits in which that industry is at present.  He has had many submissions and deputations from them. An increase in VAT from 18 per cent to 23 per cent will have a disastrous effect on the industry because they had sought a reduction in the rate.  The Minister will be aware of the fact that many hotels are for sale because of the enormous VAT rate.  To increase it now adds insult to injury.  I would ask the Minister to think again about this because he will be aware that the employment generated by the hotel industry, especially in summer, can be high.  Unfortunately, as a result of what is proposed here, the unemployment levels will increase significantly this year.  It is whitewash to suggest that because a deferment of the increase to 31 December 1983 is being allowed, it will make a noticeable difference.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider the hotels industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the tourist industry which the Minister is aware of because the Hotel Industry Federation met him in relation to the impact that the previous tax impositions had on the industry and the effects of VAT on the services given by the industry.  I had the pleasure of meeting the Minister when I was on a deputation from County Donegal.  The hoteliers there are going through a very bad patch at present because they depended mostly on cross-Border <Col N="1623" /> tourism, day trippers, night functions and so on.  So far as that county is concerned, the tourist industry has collapsed completely and the imposition of a further 5 per cent will erode completely the remaining business.</P>
      <P>I should have thought that any Government would have considered sympathetically the tourist industry, an area over which our people have control because we must face the fact that there are many industries over which we have no control. The work of the people engaged in the tourist industry and the hospitality of the Irish people has made this country attractive to many visitors from Europe and throughout the world.  Yet, this industry which has provided many services is being taxed to such an extent that it cannot survive.  Serious consideration should have been given towards helping the tourist industry which has been of considerable benefit to the economy.  I ask the Minister to consider again the results of the impact of VAT on this industry and to give the matter a second thought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody likes VAT increases but I do not know if the Minister is aware that the furniture and carpet business is on its back.  By increasing VAT on both industries I wonder if the Minister will get any extra VAT in the long term?  He stated he will collect £131.4 million in VAT returns and I ask him to tell the House how much will be taken from the furniture and carpet industries.  I agree with the principle that firms exporting 75 per cent or more of their products be allowed to import raw materials and components without payment of VAT from 1 April 1983 and I ask the Minister to tell the House the cost of this concession in 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The furniture and carpet industries depend on selling most of their products at home and I doubt very much if they will qualify for this concession.  I would be glad if the Minister would correct me if I am wrong in this.  I do not think the Minister has been wise in his proposals on this point.  These industries will not be able to carry the burden being placed on them.  There is considerable unemployment <Col N="1624" /> in carpet and furniture factories in Navan.  The trade is not able to make any profits because of various charges and also because of the recession.  The building trade will also be affected by VAT charges and indirectly this will affect adversely production in carpet and furniture factories.  I repeat my two questions to the Minister.  Of the £131.4 million, how much will be taken from the furniture and carpet industries and, secondly, what will be the cost of the concession to companies who export more than 75 per cent of their production?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by making the point this is not the first time that VAT has applied to fuel.  It was imposed on fuel in 1972 at a rate of 5.26 per cent and it was removed by the then Government in July 1975 when the rates stood at 6.75 per cent.  The total revenue which I expect to get from VAT on fuel is £7.7 million in 1983.</P>
      <P>With regard to the effect of this charge on sectors of the population who have been mentioned, I make the point that to discuss the matter in these terms is to get back into the wider budgetary context. There is a series of specific provisions in the budget designed to assist people with lower levels of income in order, among other things, to help them to deal with the extra charges because of increases in the tax rates.  For example, I mention increases in social welfare payments and the new family income supplement, both measures intended directly to help people with lower incomes.  Therefore, they will offset the effects of increases in charges in these areas to the extent that they have an impact on people at lower levels of income.  In addition, other schemes that directly assist people on lower incomes are being continued in force, such as the fuel voucher scheme. All of these will moderate the impact which appears at first sight to be imposed on lower income people by the kind of charge we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as VAT on peat is concerned, I make the point that VAT becomes payable and collectible when a business moves to the point where it becomes liable for registration under the system. <Col N="1625" /> In the normal course of events, someone who is harvesting and selling peat will not be liable unless his sales go over the threshold where he comes into the VAT system &mdash; that is £30,000 of sales.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made the point he did not see any great difficulty in the application of this VAT in the case of Bord na Móna.  As far as the hotels industry is concerned, I take the point that was made.  Deputy Conaghan mentioned I had a discussion with a number of delegations from the hotels industry, including a delegation of hoteliers from County Donegal.  Here, again, the problem is not just the problem of VAT.  It is another case of an industry where problems have been developing over a number of years because of the growth of costs in the industry.  They certainly ante-date increases in VAT rates and, consequently, we cannot put all the blame for the difficulties in the industry on increases in VAT.  The case of the Donegal hoteliers is a different one which we meet in a number of industries in Border areas.  It arises from the difference between VAT levels here and those in Northern Ireland.  As I said in my statement this afternoon, while we must be conscious of that kind of problem, we must fix our tax structure to suit our requirements.  We cannot fix our tax levels here only because other people fix their taxes at different levels.  The representatives of the hotel industry sought a reduction in the level of VAT applicable to the services they provide and they make a very convincing case, as many other industrial groups can make, but the cost of making a substantial reduction in the level of VAT applicable to that service would be very high and would mean that increases in other forms of tax revenue, in order again to keep within the global figures we have fixed within the budget increases in other forms of tax revenue, would have had to be higher and might have had more damaging effects than the combination we have chosen.  I will come back to the combination <Col N="1626" /> of the measures we have put forward.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hilliard made a point about furniture and carpets.  The total cost of the overall concession of VAT on imports, as I mentioned during the course of my statement this afternoon, is £12.3 million.  That is the cost this year of making the arrangements for firms who export more than 75 per cent of their production.  It will reduce our income from VAT by £12.3 million this year.  As far as the amount in regard to furniture and carpets is concerned, I have not the information asked here but I will get it for the Deputy if we have it broken down to that level.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On that I could not give a detailed breakdown for particular sectors of the industry, but obviously none of the benefit of that measure would go to firms who do not export more than 75 per cent of their output.  That measure applies only to firms who export more than 75 per cent of their production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  If a firm manufacturing carpets or furniture are exporting more than 75 per cent of their product then they will benefit from this concession.  I can think of one firm in that line of business whom I think will benefit from that concession because they are exporting more than 75 per cent of their production.  It depends upon the makeup of the activities of a given firm.  The concession will not have an across-the-board effect on any sector of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Section (5) of the resolution imposes a low rate of VAT on the goods and services set out in the Sixth Schedule.  The Sixth Schedule refers to such services as land drainage and reclamation, <Col N="1627" /> the services of an auctioneer, solicitor, estate agent or other agent directly related to the supply of immovable goods used for the purposes of an Annex A activity, farm accountancy or farm management services.  What is the logic in having a special low rate of VAT on those services?  What is it about those services that attracts a special low rate of VAT?  I understand that the rate of VAT on those services up to now has been 3 per cent.  Now it is being increased to 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>I want to refer also to a few points the Minister made in his statement in reply to some speakers on this side of the House a few moments ago.  The Minister has been as helpful as he can during this debate and I appreciate that.  However, I am at a total loss to understand the logic in much of what he said.  He made the point that this is not the first time that VAT is being introduced on fuel.  It seems completely and totally irrelevant whether this is the first, second or 20th time that VAT was put on fuel.  The Minister should look at the effect of the imposition of VAT on fuel for use for domestic purposes in the social and economic circumstances of the country now.  It is now that he is imposing that VAT.</P>
      <P>He also made the point that the family income supplement will to a certain extent offset the effect of these fuel increases on the poorer sections of the community and the old.  It seems totally illogical to introduce a tax and then have to introduce something reasonably complex, like a family income supplement, which will require probably extra civil service staff and certainly at least extra man-hours from the civil service to offset the effect of a tax increase which the Minister has just introduced.  It seems to be giving with one hand and taking away with the other.  I cannot understand the logic of it.  Perhaps the Taoiseach can help me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the other speakers who have criticised the imposition of a 5 per cent rate of VAT on fuel at this time. The effect of that on the poorer sections of the community and on the old cannot <Col N="1628" /> be looked at in isolation.  It must be looked at in combination with the direct price increases which will arise with the increase in the lower rate of VAT from 18 per cent to 23 per cent, which is enormous, and also with the miserly increases in social benefits which the Minister introduced earlier this afternoon.  The net effect of what the Minister has done this afternoon is to hit the poorer sections of the community savagely.  I am sad, genuinely sad, that the Minister has done that and I am even more sad that he has done it with the assent, assistance and collusion of the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would direct the attention of the Minister for Finance to the imposition of VAT.  Nobody wants to pay VAT.  Nobody likes to pay VAT. Nobody wants to pay any taxes because taxation is extremely painful when it comes to having to pay them.  Nevertheless, taxes have to paid, but a degree of commonsense and intelligence should be exercised in imposing taxes and particularly VAT.  I disagree completely with the imposition of VAT in relation to auctioneers, estate agents and solicitors. Particularly in the country, the auctioneer or estate agent renders a very useful service.  This is not the first time that VAT has been imposed on the services rendered by estate agents and auctioneers and it would be unreasonable to accuse the present Minister of doing this for the first time, but I am surprised at the extraordinarily limited vocabulary in this House in relation to auctioneers, valuers and solicitors.  I could never see any degree of commonsense in making auctioneers and solicitors tax collectors. Heaven knows, it is extremely difficult with the depressed markets, and markets have been considerably depressed, particularly during the recession without <Col N="1629" /> making it more difficult for city auctioneers to pay staff, office accommodation, rent, ground rent and still be subject to VAT which must be levied on every pound that goes into the auctioneers' and valuers' pockets.</P>
      <P>With regard to solicitors I am surprised we have not heard more on this from the Incorporated Law Society and I am surprised that there have not been stronger representations from all sides of the House because it is solicitors' clients who suffer.  The staff in solicitors' offices have to decide on the amount of VAT that has to be paid, levy it on the clients and collect it.  It is quite wrong to have the legal profession and the auctioneering profession, who give a good service to their clients, being liable for what they describe as a penance for the continuance in a satisfactory manner of the service they give to their clients.  People of the highest standards of integrity are in the auctioneering and legal professions.</P>

      <P>We can both share that title in the circumstances.  I am glad I am not a practising auctioneer in the present circumstances but I am in close touch with my colleagues in the profession. I keep in close touch with members of the Auctioneers and Valuers Institute. I am an honorary life member of the institute.  I meet those people very <Col N="1630" /> frequently and I know how difficult it is for their staff who are obliged to be collectors for the State.  I do not care whether it is Fianna Fáil or a mixture of Fine Gael and Labour.  It is wrong in the case of the auctioneers and legal professions to expect them to be tax collectors for the State for the amount of money that is collected.  I believe it is not very great.</P>
      <P>The amount of time taken by auctioneers, valuers and solicitors in preparing accounts and the difficulties which both professions have in extracting money from their clients is so great that I feel it would have been a considerable help to both professions if steps were taken to remove this VAT imposition from them.  They could run their businesses more easily, more efficiently and more effectively without having to penalise their clients by asking them to pay VAT.  I know in the case of many auctioneers and solicitors that when the accounts are sent out to their clients when those clients come into the offices to settle their accounts or send their cheques in they leave the VAT out and there is no means by which many auctioneers and solicitors can collect the VAT which their clients will not pay.  The result is that many members of both those honourable professions are out of pocket.  This is wrong.  That is the reason why I do not approve of this.  I hoped the Minister for Finance would have relieved the legal profession of this obstruction to their high standard of efficiency.  This is an unfair burden on their clients who have to seek legal aid and also on the clients of auctioneers who want to obtain the best possible professional services from those skilled people who are engaged in the auctioneering business.  I want to express, on behalf of both professions, my disapproval of this burden of taxation imposed on them.</P>

How much extra will go on to a gallon of each of those three commodities arising from the hydrocarbon oil and the VAT increases? This is one simple question and there are three figures in reply.</P>

      <P>I believe the Minister for Finance dealt with the points raised up to the time he left the House.  I want to deal with the points in the order they were raised since I came into the House. A point was raised with regard to the reason for the inclusion in the resolution of &ldquo;services consisting of the development of immovable goods and the maintenance and repair of immovable goods including the installation of fixtures, where the value of moveable goods, if any, provided in pursuance of an agreement in relation to such services does not exceed two-thirds of the total amount on which tax is chargeable in respect of the agreement ...&rdquo;. I do not blame any Deputy for asking questions about what that means. It is not self-evident to the layman.  I understand that what is involved here is a lower rate of VAT being imposed on agricultural contracting services because a higher rate would require an increase in the flat rate rebate to farmers.  This is an attempt to give the money back but it does not necessarily give it back in the exact amount to the precise people who gave it.  The purpose is to avoid an undue imposition of VAT on the agricultural sector.  These agricultural contractor services have always been at the lower rate for some time.  This merely maintains that situation although the rate is now raised from 3 per cent to 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of fuel, I was asked about the effect of the provisions in regard to fuel.  The figures I have been given are £7.7 million in 1983 and £14 million in a full year.  With regard to the other question put to me now by Deputy MacSharry, I understand the answers are 11.3p on petrol, 9.6p on diesel and 8.6p on auto LPG.  One of the Deputies opposite asked me to reply to something that Deputy Haughey said but <Col N="1632" /> I was not clear as to what was the issue he raised.</P>

The point in question, and it is one that I put to the Minister for Finance but which he failed to take up, is that I consider this budget to reflect an elitist approach by the Government to the overall situation but especially to those who will be hit hardest by the budget.  I refer to the least protected people in our society who will suffer as a result of the increase in VAT on fuel.</P>

Our Government removed that specific imposition in 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances of 1973-75, when we had not faced the rigours of the oil crisis, it was possible to effect reductions in tax on goods which would affect the less well off in terms of tax.  In present circumstances, regardless of who is in Government, we do not have the same freedom of action after ten years of failure to cope with our problems. The point that the Deputy seemed to be making was that it was irrational to impose this duty at the same time as we were introducing a family income allowance to compensate for it.  That is a misconception of the nature of the two decisions. The decision with regard to fuel affects everyone, including the less well off.  The impact of 5 per cent on fuel on people who are less well off will, in terms <Col N="1633" /> of the actual increase in the cost of living, be relatively small but one of a number of additional imposts affecting everyone, including that group.  In this budget we have set out our intention to introduce a family income supplement for low-paid workers who are at work, who consequently are not in the social welfare category and who are not well off enough to pay income tax so that they cannot be relieved by any change in the income tax code and who never get anything from anyone because the system does not allow that.  Last year in our January budget we introduced a family income supplement but for reasons that I have not been able to identify, two months later Fianna Fáil failed to include that provision in their budget.</P>

      <P>There is often room for disagreement between different parties on various impositions but I would have thought that a measure designed to help the low-paid worker who is often in receipt of significantly less than are others who are unemployed and receiving pay-related benefit, for example, would have had the general agreement of the House. Not only was I very disappointed but I was puzzled by the decision of Fianna Fáil to eliminate that provision.  However, we are back in power and we are determined to reintroduce measures on those lines.  As the Minister has outlined, he has made provision for about £5 million which he hopes will benefit about 20,000 people in the low-paid category.</P>

      <P>I am not filibustering but trying to answer questions as fully as possible.  I was asked how I justified VAT on fuel while at the same time bringing in a scheme to help low-paid people, having regard to all the extra work involved in that.  I am trying to explain that the two are not related, that we are not bringing in a family income supplement because of a 5 per cent VAT impost on fuel, the impact of which will be very small on a family budget and will be a very small fraction of the £5 per week on average by way of family income supplement. The family income supplement decision derives from our commitment to the low-paid worker as indicated in our budget of last year.  This measure will not merely have the effect of cushioning the impact of this VAT on fuel and of other tax increases but will go far beyond that so that when these low-paid workers face the full implications of the budget they will, with this additional income, be better off, as they should be.  Therefore, the family income supplement ante-dates this other measure, is separate from it and is on a scale totally incommensurate with the impact of the 5 per cent on fuel.</P>

      <P>I am very impressed by this concern for behaviour from the back-benchers opposite.  Even the word &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; has a delightfully old-fashioned air about it in the light of recent events.  I understand Deputy Flanagan's concern about certain professions being included for VAT but that is a decision that was taken last year.  It is true that the raising of the VAT rates from 3 to 5 per cent in respect of auctioneers selling agricultural land and from 18 to 23 per cent in other cases involves a heavier burden so far as these services are concerned. <Col N="1636" /> When this measure was introduced last year the aim was to ensure that VAT would be paid equally by all to whom it could be applied, there being certain professions such as medicine where it cannot be applied because of EEC requirements.  It was in the interest of general equity that we imposed this VAT last year but it does not arise in this budget because of its having been in last year's budget.  It is not something that we would go back on in this year's budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Financial Resolution-No. 8 will have an adverse impact because workers who need their cars to travel to and from their employment will have a lot of extra expense.  This imposition will affect industry very seriously, raising the cost of transport of goods because trucks and lorries are involved. It will also affect the carriage of agricultural produce.  This, along with the increase in fuel prices contained in the previous Financial Resolution which will come into force on 1 March next, will make a significant impact along with the increases imposed on motor tax and other vehicle taxes.  Could the Taoiseach tell me what approximate effect this will have on the consumer price index?  This is a quite savage increase which will affect <Col N="1647" /> essential goods.  There will be a wave of increases for the haulage of goods to shops.  What people may not realise is that its direct effect will be a flood of applications to the prices commission seeking increases because their costs will have increased substantially bearing in mind the impact of increased fuel cost.  I should like to know from the Taoiseach what effect this will have on the consumer price index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of road tax on the consumer price index is 0.12 per cent or less than one-eighth of 1 per cent. With regard to the actual increases and the impact in the particular areas to which the Deputy has referred &mdash; he has referred to the effect on workers using their cars going to work &mdash; for cars of up to 12 horsepower, which constitutes 76 per cent of all cars and I suppose relatively few workers going to work are in the top 24 per cent in terms of size of car &mdash; the increase is no higher than £24 a year, or, in the extreme case, less than 50p a week.</P>
      <P>With regard to commercial vehicles the increase averages about 10 per cent.  The last increase in road tax on these vehicles was in the 1973 budget which increased, in the case of smaller vehicles under eight tonnes, the charges but reduced the charges applying to commercial vehicles over eight tonnes.  In respect of these larger vehicles the last time there was an increase was in 1952.  I cannot off-hand think of anything else in the country which has not gone up since 1952 and will not, after this budget, have risen in taxation by more than 10 per cent in a period of 30 years.  In these circumstances I think the Deputy is somewhat exaggerating the problem.</P>

I do not think anybody <Col N="1648" /> here is so foolish as to imagine that people owning these vehicles who must pay the 10 per cent are not going to pass it on because certainly they will.  We cannot get away from that.  That is the reality of the situation.  It will revert to essential goods and will have an impact on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When one is endeavouring to raise revenue by taxation in the critical circumstances we face it seems not unreasonable to impose a 10 per cent increase on something which has not gone up since 1952.  It is hard to think of anything more reasonable to tax than something in that category, with all due respect to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I intend to do just that.  Arising more or less from what Deputy Connolly has been saying and the frivolous way it is being treated by the Taoiseach and the Government in relation to the further imposition on a user of a motor car, it is small and the Taoiseach can give the answer he did.  But viewed in the context of the overall measures taken in January, those put forward today and the difficulties we all know the entire motor trade and industry face and have faced over the last 12 months, can the Taoiseach not accept that the Government &mdash; in relation to the entire motor industry &mdash; have gone too far overall in this budget including the January imposition?</P>

      <P>(1)  That Part XX of the income Tax Act, 1967 (No. 6 of 1967), shall not apply or have effect in relation to any distribution or payment of interest referred to in that Part that is made on or after the 9th day of February, 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional <Col N="1650" /> Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What is involved here is relief involving a reduction of 20 per cent of the tax liability of individuals solely resident in the State in respect of distributions or payments of interest made on stocks, shares or securities held by them which come within the provisions, originally, of an Act of 1932 designed to give preference to holdings in Irish companies.  Since that time many things have happened.  Of course, the level of taxation in manufacturing companies today is 10 per cent, very much lower than it was in the past.  This relief is being discontinued at this point, the original purposes of which are not relevant in the way they were at the time it was introduced, at the time of the establishment of Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It implements one of the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on Taxation, recommendation No. 31, which said that the 20 per cent relief for individual investors in certain industrial companies should be ended on the grounds that the relief had served the purpose for which it was introduced and was now unnecessary.  The Commission added that today the demand for investment opportunities in publicly-quoted Irish companies exceeded what the market supplied.  Indeed that is one of our problems, that there is an inadequate range of Irish companies in which one can currently invest and the funds available for investment exceed that demand. There is no problem today in attracting people to invest in Irish industry and publicly-quoted companies.  There are just not enough publicly-quoted companies for people to invest in.  Therefore the situation in 1932, when it was necessary to attract people to invest in Irish companies no longer arises.  The Commission on Taxation recommend therefore that <Col N="1651" /> this provision be ended and we are carrying out their recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at cross purposes. To understand the proposal in Resolution No. 10 one would have to go back to the original relief referred to. The point Deputy MacSharry is putting forward is not covered in this resolution. It is only fair to say that if people were taking advantage of ACT they must have had some information about it.  This resolution is not the one which has been abused but it is a serious matter if people seem to have taken advantage of this in the sure and certain knowledge that some adjustment would be made in the budget. That raises serious implications.  The points put forward by Deputy MacSharry are legitimate even though they do not relate to this resolution.  The Taoiseach should have an investigation carried out in the Department of Finance in this area. Somebody must have had knowledge of <Col N="1654" /> what was going to happen and advantage was taken of it.</P>

      <P>There is a serious implication in what the Deputy says.  Obviously it requires investigation but it could also be fortuitous. There were many people doing things in anticipation of the budget.  There were people seeking to resign and take gratuities from the public service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that in present circumstances where we are trying to give some incentive to industry and where a company was floated in Ireland recently to invest in American industry that this is the appropriate time to remove that remission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on Taxation recommended that it should be removed because circumstances today are different from those in 1932.  At that time there was no confidence in Irish industry and an incentive was needed to get people to invest in publicly quoted companies.  The situation has now been reversed and demand for such shares seems to exceed supply because the number of publicly quoted companies has not expanded commensurately with the increased flow of funds in the country. To provide an incentive for investment in Irish industry when there is more money seeking to invest in industry than can do so is rather a waste of taxpayers' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not accept that the reason there is more money around to invest in Irish industry is because we joined the EMS and have exchange control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of publicly quoted Irish companies is relatively small and the total number of shares available is small <i>vis-à-vis</i> the number of people seeking such shares.  It goes back over a <Col N="1656" /> number of years and has nothing to do with the EMS.  The EMS may have intensified that situation but it goes back long before that and it has been a problem in this country that the number of publicly quoted companies is so small and that so many companies are still private companies. What we really need is an incentive for private companies to go public rather than an incentive for people to invest in publicly quoted companies where the demand for shares exceeds the available supply.  There is no justification for retaining this and the Commission on Taxation were quite clear on that point.</P>

      <P>This is the first budget in a number of years where direct income taxpayers have been hit fairly hard with no worthwhile relief for the vast majority of PAYE contributions. The figure of £4 million is given by Deputy MacSharry.  Every PAYE contributor who is still at work when the effects of all this hit Irish industry will be paying substantially more by way of PAYE.  Already today there has been the reduction of £26 in the £312 PRSI allowance introduced last year by Deputy MacSharry to alleviate hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Financial Resolution No. 11 another tax band is introduced and we are told in the nicely couched language of the Minister's speech that this is an effort to get at the more highly paid.  I would ask the Taoiseach to say how much income tax would have been paid prior to the introduction of this budget by a single person earning £12,000.  I want him also to state <Col N="1658" /> what the increase is.  Secondly, I would ask him to take the case of a two income family where both earners have a salary of £12,000 and tell the House what income tax they would have been paying prior to the introduction of these measures, assuming in both cases that they were in receipt of the £312 allowance.</P>

      <P>In the year 1982-83 a single person earning £12,000 paid £4,283 in tax and that figure now becomes £4,418, an increase of £135 or 3 per cent. In the case of a married couple, without children, both spouses earning £12,000 a year between them and opting for joint assessment, the increase in tax is from £2,347 to £2,485 or £138, an increase of 6 per cent.</P>

      <P>The only change in regard to tax bands is the introduction of the new band at 65 per cent.  It seems a little ridiculous that rates should go from 55 per cent to 60 per cent and then to 65 per cent and I see no reason why they should not go from 55 per cent to 65 per cent.  The administrative difficulties in having such small differences in the tax bands are not justified.  I am not saying that more taxation should be imposed.  I remember a time when there was a rate of 77 per cent and it was agreed that this represented a considerable disincentive. Rates are now going up again.  The evidence is that there are considerable disincentives when a person reaches taxation level above 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>I recall a discussion on this aspect of last year's budget and the narrowing of the 35 per cent band. Quite an amount was said on this subject by the present Taoiseach and by Members of the Labour Party.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes a little time to undo all the things which had been unwisely done by the previous Government and some of these are matters to be tackled in next year's budget.  It would, of course, be possible to change the 60 per cent band to 65 per cent but the effect would be to increase very significantly taxation on people at that level.  It is arguable that we reach high tax rates too soon.  There may be arguments as to whether the top tax rate is too high or too low but compared to other countries we tend to reach high tax rates at lower income levels.  Single people who have not great incomes, not much over £10,000 a year &mdash; not an enormous income by any means &mdash; are at the 60 per cent tax rate. In those circumstances simply to increase the 60 per cent rate to 65 per cent would involve a rather hard imposition at that level.  The Government were concerned that in the economic situation now facing us those in the community who have relatively high incomes would contribute disproportionately to the needs of the economy and make contributions enabling us to relieve the burden at other levels in terms of social welfare increases, without additional PRSI, and in terms of the family income supplement.  The way to do that appeared to us to be to introduce a higher income tax rate than 60 per cent &mdash; not going back to the 80 or 77 per cent that was there before we took office in the mid-seventies, but certainly some higher impost on the people with high income but not to apply to a single person on £10,000 per year or a married person with £20,000 but at a somewhat higher level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can legitimately argue as to what the bands should have been.  It could be argued that there should be a £4,000 band so that a married person reaches the highest tax rate at £24,000 instead of £20,000 as it is now approximately &mdash; £23,500 as against £19,500 to be more precise &mdash; or people might argue that we should have a wider band.  In that event the amount of money we would get would be less. This imposition brings in £7 million this year and £11 million next year.  Given the critical situation of the country it did not seem unreasonable to seek a sum of that <Col N="1660" /> order of magnitude from the higher income earners.  When one balances the undesirability of reaching the highest tax rate at too low a level of income, especially for single people, and on the other hand the desirability of getting at least something of the order of £10 million per year from the people with the highest incomes in the country, the best judgment we could make was to introduce the 65 per cent tax rate with a £4,000 band or £2,000 in the case of single people. Obviously, it is a matter of judgment as to precisely where one places that and this is the best judgment we could make. I am satisfied that broadly it is the correct course of action.</P>
    <P>If we are going to convince all our people that equity is the objective of the Government, that we are seeking to have an equitable tax system we must tackle avoidance and evasion vigorously but we must also in certain circumstances seek from the better off a greater contribution than hitherto without imposing that burden at too low a level where it would be harsh.  In my view we have got it about right and the broad acceptability of the budget to the great majority of our people &mdash; I know we are paying 65 per cent &mdash; is increased by virtue of the fact that they see that those who are best off are going to pay more.  I am satisfied that it is a wise provision and one that contributes to the overall balance of the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the total increase he expects to get from the PAYE sector next year, not just the £11 million he expects to get under the new rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not an additional imposition in the budget.  The PRSI relief was for one year only and we have re-introduced it this year at a slightly lower level so as to leave £5 million free for the family income supplement.  That is technically a relief by comparison with what would have happened had we done nothing.  It is fair to say that people probably expected the PRSI relief to continue and if one takes that position there is a <Col N="1661" /> marginal reduction in it involving perhaps £15 per year for a typical worker.  I believe most workers would be willing to contribute £15 per year so that 20,000 of the lowest paid workers could have £5 per week more.  It seems to most that it is a reasonable proposition.  That is the only change in income tax in the budget, apart from the 65 per cent rate.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, the buoyancy of revenue from income tax which is substantial in a situation where no changes were made in the bands.  In other circumstances this or any other Government would wish to adjust the bands in order to offer some relief related to the increase that has taken place in the cost of living and the position with regard to incomes generally over the period.  In the budget that has not been practicable.  Were we to have sought to have given any relief that would be noticeable in terms of the level of the bands the sums of money involved in that would be very large.  I recall one proposition &mdash; I cannot remember the exact details of it &mdash; which would have involved £68 million. Obviously, with the constraints imposed upon us in this budget that was simply not practicable.  There is nowhere else we could reasonably look for that money. Nobody has told us that the VAT increases are too low although, for example, we could get more money there. Nobody has said that the excise duties are too low.  It is not clear to me where the money could have been got on that scale to give any significant relief in the bands.  There is, because of fiscal drag arising from the fact that the bands have not been changed, significant buoyancy in income tax revenue.  That does not arise from any act in the budget but from the omission of any relief in terms of the bands.  That has led to a situation where the level of income tax receipts are estimated at £1,739 million in the budget as against £1,459 million last year, an increase of £280 million or about 20 per cent.</P>

      <P>Another point we will have to pay some attention to is that this reference to PAYE is confusing.  The assumption seems to be that PAYE is what the ordinary worker pays.  It is, but it is paid also by other people.  My information is that some of the wealthiest people here are PAYE taxpayers on their earnings. In some cases that can run into several hundred thousand pounds per year.  We are going to see if we can sort this out and I am anxious that the PAYE receipts be broken down by the level of incomes in question so that we can see how much comes from the different groups.  At present, when people say that 87 per cent is imposed on the PAYE worker, it is not clear that some proportion of that is coming from some of the wealthiest people.  We would get a clearer picture if we could see how much comes from the lower paid, the middle income and higher income groups.  I hope we can present the data in that way to avoid the confusion that exists at present which is giving a distorted impression.</P>

      <P>When the budget is studied in detail I am sure that many hidden taxes will be revealed.  It is easy to say that the tax bands have not been changed but when one takes into account the decision to remove relief of personal interest on married couples one can see that there will be an increase in tax revenue. That will have the effect of putting many taxpayers into the higher bands. That has not been stated by Government speakers.  In my view thousands of people will now be moving from the 45 per cent to the 55 per cent bracket and from the 35 per cent into the 45 per cent bracket. In effect that amounts to a hidden tax. What is the expected yield as a result of the decision to alter the position in regard to the relief on personal interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of extra revenue accruing from the abolition of the interest relief is about £4 million. There is no break down of that as between PAYE taxpayers and others.  It <Col N="1663" /> is fairly evident that personal interest payments on overdrafts are more likely to arise in the case of people in the middle and upper income brackets than in the lower income groups.  The latter do not have, in many cases, bank accounts, not to mention overdrafts or interest payments. The allowances in respect of personal interest, like the other allowances in our tax system are all regressive and involve benefits accruing to the better off people requiring, therefore, that when a given amount of money has to be raised more tax is raised from the less well-off. Our system of taxation contains many of these features which we have inherited from the past and which are perverse, regressive and involve relief being given to those who are in the middle and upper income groups and more particularly to the people in the upper income groups who can arrange their affairs so as to get maximum benefit but which are of no benefit to the people lower down.  In practice few or none of the people in the lower level of the income tax bands can afford to get into the situation of having personal loans.  No one would lend them money because of their income.  They would not be in a position to borrow and, therefore, get the benefit of these reliefs. The removal of this relief is going to mean that £4 million will be collected.  It will affect people in the middle income group as well as in the upper income group, and much more in the latter than the former. It is a small move towards a more progressive system in which the whole taxation system will not be distorted in favour of the middle and upper income groups as against the less well off.  In those terms it is defensible and I defend it very strongly.</P>

      <P>I do not think it will take us until then to demolish this piece of chicanery.  Resolution No. 13 proposes to put a levy of 1 per cent on all incomes. This is another very undesirable development in this area.  We have already had one such imposition, the youth employment levy, when a levy of 1 per cent was placed on all incomes right across the board for the purposes of the Youth Employment Fund.  At that time we indicated quite clearly that we did not like that idea of an income levy.  On that occasion at least the money raised was being devoted for the purposes of youth employment.  Therefore, we did not oppose it as strenuously as we might have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here the Government, apparently encouraged by that manoeuvre at that time, are coming in again with this unacceptable type of taxation.  It is unacceptable because it goes right across the board on all incomes without any regard to the different circumstances of the individual income earner.  It is unjust and discriminatory in that regard.  It is unjust and discriminatory in another way.  Everyone knows that, when you put a levy of this sort on incomes, you will succeed only in extracting it from one section of the community, that is, the PAYE section. Experience has shown that the 1 per cent youth employment levy is not being collected from those other sections who are supposed to be paying, the self employed, farmers and so on.  This particular mechanism suffers from those two defects.  First of all, as far as those who pay it are concerned, it does not make any allowance for individual circumstances of the payer.  At least the ordinary income tax takes into account family and other circumstances of taxpayers and makes certain allowances to cater for those differences, but this mechanism does nothing of that sort.  Everybody pays it no matter what their circumstances are. It has the other gross inequity which I mentioned, that it is a further levy on the PAYE sector.  For both those reasons we are opposing it and we regard it as a very bad development in our taxation system. It is very undesirable and should not have <Col N="1669" /> been resorted to.  If this money had to be raised in the budget, it should have been put on to the ordinary income tax system in some way because then it would have had some element of equity and fairness.</P>
    <P>There may have been some justification for having it in the case of youth employment, the argument at the time was that this desirable end of youth employment justified the means and, broadly speaking, the House accepted that.  We all let it go without kicking up too much of a row about it.  We are not doing that on this occasion because this is an extension of a bad principle and I am surprised that the Government have resorted to it in this way.  I hope there will be second thoughts about it.  If the Government wish to put it through tonight they can do so because they have the voting strength to do that but I believe they are not behaving properly in regard to the principles of taxation in raising the money in this way.  I presume they are going to push this resolution through tonight but, between now and the Finance Bill, it should be looked at again. The money which is required should be raised in some other way because this is bad and undesirable in principle.  It is also inequitable and unjust in the way it is going to fall on a particular section of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything that my leader has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment on a few things which the Taoiseach said before the Minister for Finance returned.  The Taoiseach referred to buoyancy in taxation, or fiscal drag, amounting to something in the order of £300 million this year plus £18 million income tax changes, plus £47 million from a levy on incomes. That gives a total of £365 million for the PAYE sector.  What is being given away? A sum of £4 million in slight changes in the exemption limits.  Arguably the Government and the Minister will put forward that they are giving away £55 million in the PRSI PAYE allowance. That is not new; people already have it and they expect it will be continued.  It would be very difficult for any Government <Col N="1670" /> not to continue it.  Leaving that aside, the PAYE sector are now being asked this year to pay an extra £365 million in taxation as against 1982-83.  All the Government could find to give away with slight changes in exemption limits was £4 million.  We will have a lot more to say about this in the budget debate and when the Finance Bill comes up, as colleagues of the Minister in Fine Gael and Labour did between March and July of last year in relation to this aspect of PAYE and PRSI payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Of all the impositions in the budget this 1 per cent on PAYE taxpayers is the most unacceptable.  I cannot understand how a Government with a Labour Party element could agree to this kind of imposition.  It is an imposition that will have no bearing on the allowances or otherwise to which the taxpayer will be entitled.  It is also a further £80 million in a full year on top of the £290 million to £300 million which the Taoiseach has already agreed will be taken from the pocket of the PAYE taxpayer. The Taoiseach says that of course there are some people within the PAYE net who are quite wealthy.  The Taoiseach must be moving in circles of which I am unaware if he knows wealthy PAYE taxpayers. If there are a half a dozen at present, there will be very few at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>This levy will only be applied to the PAYE sector.  It will not apply to income from rents, dividends, profits or from incomes which farmers or self-employed are earning.  This is at a time when the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report indicates that something like £450 million are owed in back taxes by various sectors of the community, not I might add the PAYE sector, because they fork it out every Friday evening before they go home.  This 1 per cent levy is unacceptable and I do not understand why the Labour Party are supporting the Coalition on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer also to the points which have been made in relation to the PRSI allowance.  We are told that this allowance is being maintained and that it will cost £84 million in a full year.  At the <Col N="1671" /> same time, this 1 per cent levy is going to take in approximately £80 million in a full year.  Effectively what they are doing is simply putting it into one pocket and taking it out of the other.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement which the Government are so generously giving the low paid workers they are already taking from the PAYE sector by reducing the PRSI allowance.  Again it is a question of grabbing the money from those who are caught most easily.  There is absolutely no attempt, apart from pious platitudes, in the Minister's budget statement to tackle tax evasion, capital taxation, profits or farmers' tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those speakers who have said this is a most penal imposition.  I said earlier I thought this budget would go down in history as the most inequitable in recent times and the Minister for Finance must take the blame for all the unrest it will cause.  For long we heard preaching from Fine Gael when they were in Opposition about the PAYE sector.  On this occasion that sector is being loaded with a burden to an extent not known in recent times and this is the final straw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's absence when the Taoiseach was taking the resolutions he said that the increase on vehicle duty would have little impact.  Unfortunately all these impositions have to be added up and paid for by the workers.  We were told today that the impact on the CPI would be in the region of 4 per cent but the knock-on effect will mean it will be nearer to 5 per cent.  The Minister is well aware of this and he need not argue with me that it will be 3½ per cent.  However, I will be kind to the Minister: I will be conservative and leave the figure at 4 per cent.  To this must be added the 1 per cent and this is a clear 5 per cent imposed on workers.  Will the Labour Party walk into the lobby tonight and impose that additional charge?  What are their views on the matter?  We have not heard from them tonight.  Not one shilling has been provided in the budget for public service pay, yet this 5 per cent is being imposed on public servants, from the lowest to the <Col N="1672" /> highest paid.  I ask the Labour Party members to think twice before they vote in favour of this resolution.  If they do so vote they will never be forgiven in their constituencies.  As Deputy MacSharry said, when we get an opportunity in the coming weeks in the budget debate we will cause considerable embarrassment to the Minister and his colleagues by quoting what they said on those benches a few months ago.</P>
    <P>I add my voice to that of our leader when I ask the Government to have a rethink on this matter.  Not only is it inequitable in general on the PAYE sector but it is also inequitable within that category and this was pointed out by Deputy De Rossa.  Earlier this evening I asked the Taoiseach a question regarding the 65 per cent tax band and I inquired what a single person earning a salary of £12,000 would have to pay.  I was told the increase would be £139 on what he has been paying before the budget.  To this amount must be added the figure of £120. A married person earning the same salary with five or even ten children will also be paying £120.  The Minister estimates that this tax in a full year will realise £80 million.  He knows he is being optimistic here.  He has told us it is a temporary levy that will apply to the categories to whom the youth employment levy applied.  He knows as well as I that it will be very difficult to collect this levy from some of the categories but it will not be difficult to collect it from the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>I ask the Labour Party to wake up before it is too late and ask for a change in the Finance Bill.  Obviously the Government needed another £45 million and they looked around to see where they could obtain it with the least administrative cost.  Last year we agreed to the youth employment levy because of the intention behind that levy but now we are faced with this temporary levy.  In this context the word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; is a misnomer and should not be used.  It is a way of sliding this measure through in the easiest way possible and making it look less objectionable.  The Minister knows that 1 per cent will become 3 or 4 per cent and the Labour Party members who vote for this tonight will have to face their <Col N="1673" /> constituents, whether in six months or 12 months.  They will have to explain why they allowed a new levy to be introduced on the PAYE sector.  I ask them to think carefully about this.  As the days and weeks go by we will embarrass them when we discuss the Finance Bill.  Before it is too late they should ask the Minister to withdraw the 1 per cent levy.</P>

There is no member of the front bench of the Labour Party present for this discussion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing that.  It is one element of the motion that is of concern to me.  The Labour Party represent themselves as socialist but that is one of the greatest political jokes of all time. The real socialists are sitting up there.  I hold no great brief for Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa and what they represent but the truth is that there will be a tremendous shift in Irish politics.  It has now become a reality that The Workers' Party really represent the workers, or a certain element of the workers and the Labour Party and the Labour Ministers represent nobody other than Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have the Government any imagination? Why did they go for the easy option, the 1 per cent levy?  It was such an easy thing to do, with an easy prey in the <Col N="1674" /> PAYE sector.  What they have done is repressive and depressing.  The Government and their advisers have not shown any imagination.  The budget is a disaster. It represents the worst form of bunker mentality politics it has been my misfortune to experience and I have been a Member of this House for nearly 20 years.  It is the most unimaginative budget ever presented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is an arithmetical exercise.  The Government have taken the easy way out.  They have put down a set of figures and have looked for the easy option.  I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that the two major factors facing the economy are unemployment and inflation.  It is against this background that we must look at the budget and we must consider the 1 per cent levy in that context.  Unemployment rising by an average of 300 people a day. Inflation when we were in Government was coming down nicely, not as fast as we would like but well on the way down. When the full, knock-on effects of the 4 per cent, 5 per cent or whatever it is in this budget are added up, when you consider all the increases in VAT, housing and so on &mdash; and probably the price of a private house will rise to the tune of £1,200 &mdash; all those areas on the one hand will depress employment.  There is nothing whatsoever in that budget to boost employment.  Therefore, we have a fatalistic acceptance that unemployment must rise at the rate it is going.</P>
      <P>The budget strategy ignores the primary factors that should be looked at. We will continue to pay out money to people out of work and to put them out of work.  The budget certainly has no strategy in relation to unemployment or inflation.  We know what the direct effect of inflation will be on competitiveness. We know what effect it will have on people trying to sell goods in an increasingly competitive market.  It will mean more jobs lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Still on the area of employment, we have heard from the benches on the far side post-election &mdash; never mind what we hear during election campaigns &mdash; that Fine Gael policies in Government have <Col N="1675" /> the answer to unemployment.  I put it to the Minister and his party, to the front bench spokesman of that party and to the members, absent tonight, of the Labour Party that nothing is done for employment in this budget.  They have taken £220 million off the capital budget.  They have done away with decentralisation. We will have an opportunity in the coming weeks to go right through the whole lot of it and we will take that opportunity to expose the budget for what it is.</P>
    <P>Having done nothing for employment, having accepted that they can do nothing for employment, what do they do?  They increase tax on employment.  That is the reality of that 1 per cent.  At the moment the joint take from an employer and employee tax now stands at 19 per cent, today increased to 20 per cent.  If one of those employees happens to be in a private pension scheme he could be paying 5 per cent or 6 per cent more.  Therefore, for a person employed today we are talking about a minimum 20 per cent tax for having that person employed.  Where is the incentive in that for anybody to take on an extra person in a job?  There is not a hope.  Employers will be looking for ways and means of reducing the number of workers that they have.  That is what this budget will do.  It will put a tax on employment, apart from doing nothing to create employment.</P>
    <P>Was Deputy Spring, Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment, at the Cabinet meeting when this budget was put together?  For a man who had plenty of PR publicity about his meetings with the construction industry and about what was to be done for employment, lo and behold, when you go through it not alone is there nothing here to do it, but the budget that came out in disguise late in those pages&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;makes one wonder. The bland ministerial statement on the budget was beautiful and easy to market but the real budget lies in there.  Throughout the Minister's statement it is easy to <Col N="1676" /> see what happened to the Labour Party when they were inside the doors.  It becomes more evident in the weeks and months ahead when everybody begins to realise what is in that.  The 1 per cent levy, in spite of people who talk about equity in taxation, is a further tax on employment.  That is the direction of the Coalition Government and, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, we will take the greatest of pleasure in exposing it for what it is.  I would like to hear from the Minister if he accepts that the 1 per cent levy, apart from being a tax, is a further tax on employment, a disincentive to employ people.  Is that the strategy adopted by the people opposite towards the major problems facing the economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This income levy is one of the worst features of this budget.  It is a grossly unfair tax which is not related in real terms to a person's income.  It is based on gross income and deducted from the net income.  This is the worst possible way to inflict a tax.  It is very similar, therefore, to the PRSI tax and the youth employment levy in its imposition. Will the old age pensioners be excluded from this additional income levy?  Will medical card holders be excluded?  We hear from the Minister that in reality this is to be a doubling of the present youth employment levy and the weakness of that has been pointed out already in that it falls particularly on those PRSI, PAYE payers who are a captive group as far as the Minister is concerned.  Certainly they will pay it in full and on their full income, on every penny of that income, whereas others may pay part of it, particularly those whose income is much more difficult to ascertain.  Again and again the Minister has talked about equity but in this instance he has once again hit the captive PRSI payer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How much are the farmers and the self-employed paying at present on the youth employment levy?  How much invome is received from the current youth employment levy?  Does the Minister think that he will be able to double the amount of the youth employment levy intake in relation to the self-employed <Col N="1677" /> and the farming sector?  I ask this because, particularly in relation to the health levies, as you increase them you get less money and that is one of the problems.  That one per cent is levied in much the same way as the youth employment levy is taken and by going up yet another one per cent the fall-off effect may well be greater.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned that he hopes to find a means &mdash; he has not said that he has the means yet &mdash; of paying a family income supplement of £5 million. Is he making provision still for the double week for social welfare dependants in September and at the beginning of December, which was the £4 million paid last year, or is his family income supplement taking the place of that £4 million? I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general effect, 7.5 per cent PRSI now becomes effectively 8.5 per cent and that on a maximum of £13,000 &mdash; and we know that this will increase &mdash; instead of £9,500.  The combined effect for a person on £13,000 of this and the one per cent increase in rate is £7 a week for each employee.  An additional £7 a week will be the effect of this combination on the PRSI payer, and that will be taken not from his or her gross income but from net income.  This is where it becomes so unfair.  It is calculated on gross income and taken from what is left after tax and other deductions. I calculate that it will amount to £358 in a year or £7 per week.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Reynolds that when the Labour Party Deputies and Ministers meet their friends in the unions and the friends that possibly they had in the working sector they will find it hard to explain how they agreed to such an unfair imposition.  If money must be raised, why go back to this captive group and raise it in such an inequitable way?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us how many pensioners will be paying this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The levy will apply to those who now pay the youth employment levy. That means that it will be payable by all <Col N="1678" /> individuals over 16 years of age regardless of the level of their income, except for certain social welfare recipients and medical card holders who were not in insurable employment.  The people who will be exempt from the levy on their total income are those who get a range of social welfare allowances which I can list if Deputies wish.  They are the widow's contributory pension, a widow's non-contributory pension, deserted wife's pension, deserted wife's allowance, death benefit by way of widow's pension, social assistance allowance or a payment equivalent to any one of these that I have set out.  The levy would be payable on all income as estimated under the Income Tax Acts but excluding approved superannuation contributions and benefits in kind.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies opposite asked questions about the collection of this levy.  The total amount we would expect to collect from self-employed would be on the same basis that we collect the Youth Employment Levy.  It is estimated that approximately £8 million is collected from the self-employed under that levy. The difficulties of collecting from the self-employed have been adverted to. There are a number of self-employed people who, up to now, in one way or another, have been avoiding the payment of the Youth Employment Levy and, indeed, avoiding the payment of income tax generally.  The measures I referred to earlier today to reduce the amount of tax evasion will necessarily reduce evasion of the Youth Employment Levy and, therefore, of this levy and of income tax generally. As we have more effective measures to prevent tax evasion we will be applying the Youth Employment Levy and this levy as well as health charges, where there is another problem.  We will be extending the collection of those taxes.  I would like also to make the point that to the extent that we extend the income tax net by the measures put forward today we will again be extending the field over which we will be collecting the Youth Employment Levy and this new levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall justification for the measure needs rather more examination than <Col N="1679" /> Members opposite have given it.  Members opposite are running the risk of creating a new mythical animal known as the PAYE worker.  I have a feeling, when listening to the comments made by them and also the comments made by Deputy De Rossa, that the kind of people they have in mind in making those remarks are a particular group of PAYE payers.</P>

      <P>That is not in any way a homogeneous group.  I remember Deputy MacSharry making a rather similar point during the discussion on last year's Finance Bill.  PAYE payers cover a very wide spectrum.  We have people at work who have not yet the privilege, if indeed it is a privilege, of being PAYE payers because their incomes do not come up the taxable level.  We have people who are PAYE payers who pay very large amounts of PAYE tax and who will, after the measures we have taken today, be paying the new 65 per cent rate of tax.  In talking about the PAYE sector we are not talking about a single homogeneous group who would all be affected in the same way by any change in the arrangements.  It covers a very wide spectrum of people ranging from the low paid to the very high paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, including Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  To put them all in the same basket, treat them all in the same way and regard them all as being affected in the same way by any income tax measure is a very incomplete and possible misleading way of viewing the situation.  The levy we are talking about is intended to yield about £47 million this year.  Viewed in the overall context of the budget, £47 million may not appear to be a very large sum.  Viewed in the context of the extra taxation we are raising in the budget it becomes rather more important than that.  Viewed in the <Col N="1680" /> overall context of the total level of taxation that is required in order to sustain the level of services we want to provide it does not amount to a very large impost.</P>
      <P>It will be payable, as has been said, right through the income range, not only by people who pay PAYE but by all people whose incomes are taxable under the Income Tax Acts.  We will spread that burden as much as we can by improving the operation of the Income Tax Acts and, specifically, by extending the effective application of income tax to areas where it does not apply with full effect at the moment.  Viewed in the context of the total requirement to finance the State's activities an extra levy of this kind cannot be regarded as a huge change in taxation or as something that will make a very big difference to the overall spread of the burden of taxation.  I submit that is the way we must look at it in the context of this budget and in the context of our overall financial problem.  We have proposed this measure for those reasons.  It is necessary in the context of the whole budget and I ask the House to support it as being a necessary part of the action we have to take.</P>

Does he see a major difference between those two levies, one which is levied for a specific purpose and allocated for that purpose and this one which is part of the general Exchequer revenue?  If the Minister sees that difference how can he justify this levy as distinct from raising it through taxation or otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between the two levies.  The Youth Employment Levy was raised, as Deputy Haughey says, for a specific purpose and the funds produced by the levy are devoted to particular uses under the terms of an Act passed by this House. There is a difference between that and the levy we are talking about.  The levy we are talking about here is a general contribution made by all of those whose incomes come under the Incomes Tax Acts.  This levy applies to those people. It is a general extra contribution made by all of those people to the funding requirements of the present level of State activities. There is a difference between the two.  In the present circumstances I believe it is reasonable to ask the generality of income tax payers to make this extra contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>My Private Notice Question today was to ask the Minister for Justice to make a statement regarding the stealing of &ldquo;Shergar&rdquo; in order to allay the fears of the bloodstock owners and to prevent irreparable damage being done to the national industry.  I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle, despite the lateness of the hour, for giving me an opportunity to raise this matter.  I am fully confident that he does so in his own love of racing and his eye for a horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I apologise for bringing the Minister for Justice back for this Adjournment debate but I rarely do this without very good reason.  During my time as a Member I have done it on three or four occasions <Col N="1687" /> only and this is the first time that I have put down a Private Notice Question. I congratulate the Minister on his Ministry and wish him well in it.</P>
    <P>Last night in Ballymany stud in County Kildare, two armed men held up the stud groom, Jack Fitzgerald, and his family at gunpoint and stole &ldquo;Shergar&rdquo;.  Thankfully, Mr. Fitzgerald was returned unharmed.  A ransom figure of £2 million has been mentioned but this horse has been valued at much more than that and I hope that this is not a lack of knowledge on the part of the people involved as to the value of the horse.  I know that the Garda&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The loud laughter bespeaks the vacant minds on the opposite benches.  This assures me that there is a great lack of knowledge of the seriousness of this case on their part.  I know that the Garda are working on the case and I have the utmost confidence in them. I know many of them personally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister, while he normally would not make a statement on a case which is the subject of a Garda investigation, can make an exception in this case.  The eyes of the worldwide thoroughbred industry are on us at this time.  Bloodstock breeders throughout the world have looked on this country as the cradle of racing and the nursery of champions.  Until now, even in the most troubled times, it has always been felt that the traditional Irish love of the horse would ensure its safety here, whether as stallions standing here, or visiting mares during the breeding and foaling season.  It was felt that, no matter what the nationality of the owners, Ireland was an equine sanctuary.  However, last night's dastardly act has changed this fine image.  Would the Minister please outline the steps being taken to ensure the safe and immediate return of this great horse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot believe that the horse will be <Col N="1688" /> wilfully harmed but the danger of his being inadvertently injured, or picking up some disease in a strange and new environment is always there.  He has been fully booked for the season and his return to fulfil these obligations should not be delayed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to make the Deputies opposite take the matter seriously, but I hope that they will, because I do.  The realisation of the enormity of this crime and our determination to ensure the safe return of &ldquo;Shergar&rdquo; must be clearly shown.  We have a very important indigenous industry to protect, which gives great employment despite no State grants.  It has proved its worth in the greatest shop window of all &mdash; success on the racecourse.  &ldquo;Shergar&rdquo; by his winnings, which include Derbys in Epsom and on the Curragh, has done his share to prove the merit of the Irish horse.</P>
      <P>His owner, the Aga Khan, turned down fabulous offers for this horse to stand elsewhere and made a great personal financial sacrifice in deciding that the sire should return to stand in the county in which he was born.  This sacrifice is well realised in Kildare, because when the horse returned he was given a civic welcome in Newbridge.  His first foal was born during the week.  So that the great Irish bloodstock industry will not be undermined in the eyes of the world and our good name tarnished &mdash; and as an appreciation of the sporting owner whose father and grandfather poured millions into our bloodstock industry &mdash; would the Minister tell the House that everything possible is being done and that no effort will be spared to see a sound &ldquo;Shergar&rdquo; safely back in his stable?</P>

      <P>I had a meeting on 1 February last with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Prior, M.P. in London.  The Secretary of State was accompanied for part of the meeting by <Col N="1445" /> Lord Gowrie, Minister for State at the Northern Ireland Office.  We were also joined for lunch by Lord Belstead, Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.  This was the first occasion on which I have met Mr. Prior and we had a lengthy exchange of views over a wide range of issues.  We agreed on the desirability of close co-operation between the two Governments in matters of common concern in the political, economic and society fields.  It is not the practice to reveal the contents of confidential discussions of this nature.</P>

      <P>It is expected that conversion of the Westport and Carrowholly exchange areas will be effected about the end of next May, followed quickly by Achill Sound, Currane and Foxford. During the second half of this year it is expected that conversion of the following exchange areas will be completed:&mdash; Bekan Cross, Brickens, Carrowmore-lacken, Killala, Mulrany and Swinford. Conversion of the then remaining 44 manual exchanges in County Mayo will be carried out progressively during next year.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid injury benefit under the occupational injuries benefit scheme from 29 June 1981 to 25 December 1981 in respect of incapacity due to an accident at work. Injury benefit was paid for the maximum <Col N="1460" /> period of 26 weeks.  He was then transferred to disability benefit and this was paid for a period 52 weeks to 24 December 1982.  This was his maximum entitlement as, according to the records of the Department, he has only a total of 124 paid employment contributions to his credit since his entry into insurance.  He would, therefore, need at least 13 further weeks of insurable employment before he could again qualify for disability benefit.
