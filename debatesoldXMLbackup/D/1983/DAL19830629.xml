    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I direct the attention of the Taoiseach to Article 46, paragraph 2 which states:</P>
      <P>Every proposal for an amendment of this Constitution shall be initiated in Dáil Éireann as a Bill, and shall upon having been passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, be submitted by Referendum to the decision of the people in accordance with the law for the time being in force relating to the Referendum.</P>
      <P>That provision in the Constitution is mandatory. I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government are in serious breach of their constitutional responsibility by delaying the making of this order.  If the Taoiseach is not in a position to tell me this morning when the Minister for the Environment will make the order, will he give time for discussion of the motion we have on the Order Paper in the names of Deputies Ahern and Molloy to compel the Minister to make the order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There were legal proceedings which were threatened and which took place in relation to this matter. That made it inappropriate to fix the date.  If the date was fixed now the referendum would have to be held during July.  It is doubtful whether that is the most appropriate time to hold a referendum. For that reason no decision has been taken by the Minister for the Environment on the matter.  I note that the Deputy has a motion down and the proposal in it does not appear inherently unreasonable.  It is a matter which we could discuss.  It is a question of finding the most appropriate time to early out what is the constitutional obligation of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Taoiseach for the offer to discuss the matter.  I accept that offer and perhaps we could discuss it during the course of the day.  What is the Government's intention in regard to a number of motions we have on the Order Paper which would have the effect of setting up a number of committees?  As the Taoiseach knows, the Minister for Industry and Energy and I have had a number of helpful discussions about the establishment of committees. Arising from that we have a clear understanding that the Government will expedite the establishment of some of the committees we propose.  I should like to draw his attention to the committee we propose on crime, lawlessness and vandalism. In view of the serious and alarming, situation we have in that regard, can the Taoiseach give some indication if the Government will agree to the taking of these motions and the establishment of these committees before the recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which in the ordinary way is discussed between the Whips.  The negotiations on the committees we proposed and which were put to the Opposition on 8 March, took over three months to sort out.  We have no desire to hold up discussions on these proposals.  There is the difficulty that if we have too many committees we will have a problem about servicing them. This is something which the leader of the Opposition has been conscious of and stressed on several occasions.  Nevertheless, discussions should be held between the Whips on these proposals to see whether any of them might be worthwhile proceeding with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it the Taoiseach is not adverse to taking one or two of them before the recess?  I would urge on him the argument that he is morally bound, arising from discussions which have taken place, to agree to the establishment of one, two or three of the committees we proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Without prejudice and with no suggestion of being morally <Col N="684" /> bound, I suggest that discussions should take place on these committees with a view to seeing whether agreement can be reached on one or more of them being established that would be appropriate and useful.  We certainly would not wish to hold up those discussions in such a way as to prevent agreement being reached before the recess.  I suggest that the Whips discuss the matter and if agreement can be reached it will be implemented before the Dáil goes into recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a matter on the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to those things later on.  On 29 January 1981 one of my predecessors gave a most carefully considered comprehensive ruling in relation to matters which may be raised on the Order of Business, as reported in volume 326, columns 541 and 543 of the Official Report.  On 26 January 1983 I reiterated the principal points in the ruling, as reported in volume 339, column 407.  The ruling was made in the context of the Standing Orders as they are.  If there is a desire by the House to widen the scope of topics which can be raised on the Order of Business, an amendment to Standing Orders would be necessary. I will, of course, faithfully operate any changes in Standing Orders which the Houses sees fit to make.  I am making arrangements to have a copy of the ruling referred to circulated to each Member for information.</P>
      <P>I might briefly say that under that ruling questions can be raised on the Order of Business and questions only.  The matters which may be raised on the Order of Business are as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  The business for the day.</P>
      <P>2.  The taking of other business on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>3.  The taking of business which has been promised and which therefore can be anticipated.</P>
      <P>4.  Arrangements for sittings.</P>
      <P>5.  When Bills or other documents needed in the House will be circulated.</P>
      <P>Until Standing Orders are changed I earnestly appeal to the House to cooperate with the Chair in enforcing those Standing Orders as they stand, in accordance with the statement made by one of my predecessors and adopted by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things you have not included is the request from this <Col N="686" /> side of the House that a Minister of the Government should make a statement about a particular matter.  Over recent months you have ruled that such requests are in order and you have turned to the Government benches and said that a statment would be in order.  You do not seem to have included such a process in the list you have read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Offhand the Chair does not recollect the occasions mentioned by the Deputy in recent times and before commenting the Chair would like an opportunity to check up on this. A request for a statement is not one of the matters included in my predecessor's interpretation of the rules as adopted by me.  The shortcoming I see in a request to a Minister to make a statement is that if he says he will not do so he will be asked the reason; he will then have to reply and then there is debate and hassle. That is the sort of thing we want to avoid. I want to make it perfectly clear to the House, and I sincerely hope the House accepts my bona fide, that my only anxiety is to enforce Standing Orders and if Standing Orders are changed I will enforce them to the best of my ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must suggest that you have a wider dimension than simply enforcing Standing Orders.  You have other duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>You did say your only duty was to enforce Standing Orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>You have a much wider responsibility, that is, to endeavour to see that this House functions as fully and effectively as possible and that as far as possible Deputies on all sides, but particularly those in Opposition because they have a special role and responsibility to discharge, are given an opportunity within the proper conduct of our affairs to have as much freedom and flexibility as possible.  I did suggest on another <Col N="687" /> occasion that you would take an initiative on this matter of what may or may not be raised on the Order of Business and may or may not be the subject of Private Notice Questions.  I suggested that perhaps you could see it as your responsibility to initiate some reforms in this area and I make that suggestion to you again in your capacity as chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The only comment I would like to make is that things are initiated before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges by Members other than the Chair, usually by the Whips.  I do not know how many meetings of that committee there have been since this Dáil first met but I think we have had more such meetings than during any Dáil in recent years.  On not one occasions has the Chair's conduct been questioned by any Member of that committee. I think it right to say that since the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is respect on our part for the office of the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish you had the same respect in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That remark is unfair. We would see any move to criticise the Chair or a motion of confidence or no confidence in the Chair as a serious fundamental matter which we would be very reluctant even to contemplate.  The fact that we have do not made any moves in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in that area should redound to our credit rather than the reverse.  We wish to conduct out business in an orderly manner. Sometimes, I am afraid your rulings make it difficult for us to do what we want to do in an orderly way.  I would put it no more seriously than that, if you were to call for a special meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to see what reforms, if any, we should make concerning the Order of Business or Private Questions then we might make some progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is part of the Pavlovian response that has been developing recently.  You refused me permission to raise the matter because you said it had been dealt with already.  My contention is that it had not been dealt with.  The Chair will recall that I had to raise the matter here.  While I had the question down in regard to the Cavan Hospital a letter from the Minister of Health appeared in the <i>Anglo Celt</i>.  You, Sir, happen to be a Deputy for the constituency. Your reply to my request did not mention anything that was taken on the Adjournment of the House last week. Consequently, I contend that what I was trying to raise on the Adjournment last night concerned a totally different matter from the matter raised last week.</P>

      <P>I want to make the position clear.  Deputy Wilson asked permission to raise this matter yesterday and in the ordinary way it was processed in my office.  I received advice on it which I considered carefully and which I accepted fully, and I consider I am bound by that.  I refused the question in the light of that advice.  The reason for the refusal was conveyed to the Deputy in a very full and courteous manner by my Private Secretary. As the Deputy knows, it is not in order to seek to question that ruling in the House.  If Deputy Wilson wants to come to my office he is welcome and I will discuss the matter with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope yesterday's television style debate on this Bill is not indicative of what it will be like in the House if television ever comes into it. The debate was punctuated by quorum calls every ten minutes, with the quorums taking the place of the commercials.  Yesterday in the House we had an extraordinary situation even though it was contrived. There were deliberate attempts to put on a show probably for particular reasons.  We had the spectacle of the Leader of the Opposition thumping his desk in frustration and then the Fianna Fáil Party left the House.  The quorums did not bother me because I was here from 3.30 p.m.  They succeeded in making <Col N="697" /> the speeches of the Opposition very disjointed.</P>
      <P>The three Opposition's spokespersons &mdash; Deputy Molloy, Deputy Lenihan and Deputy Fitzgerald &mdash; more or less discussed the same point.  Each of them concentrated on the de-politicisation of An Bord Pleanála.  Deputy Fitzgerald, who has been thrice blessed in this House in that he was a Minister three times, invited members of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party to select and appoint Labour people and Fine Gael people to boards such as this and said that he did not see anything wrong with doing that and that when Fianna Fáil were in power they could do the same thing.  His only requirement was that the people appointed should be good people.  I expressed my shock at this suggestion which would continue in existence of political jobbery in the State.  I asked several times yesterday why it is that Fianna Fáil do not want this board or any other board to be de-politicised.  I wanted to know why it is that Fianna Fáil are so worried about this, considering all the dissatisfaction there has been in the planning area over the years and the dissatisfaction that has been expressed in public and on the media with the present board as constituted and its workings. Does it hit at a power root?  Were the antics in the House yesterday a result of the exposure of a very sensitive political nerve?  Perhaps that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been in power for the greater part of the last 60 years.  If they do not want Government influence in regard to the appointment of boards and positions to be removed maybe they have a vested interest in maintaining the <i>status quo</i>.  I would not like to think that is the situation but there is a lot of evidence around to show that over the years it has been to the advantage of the Government in power to have this political <i>largesse</i> available to them and they have distributed it generously throughout the country. The tentacles of this practice have reached right down through Irish society. Making this board independent is another step in removing that influence, that control.  These tentacles have stretched right down into every sub-post <Col N="698" /> office, every Garda station and every Department of the civil service throughout the State.  I for one would be very pleased to see this influence cut off.  If we have exposed a nerve and the patient is in pain the only thing we can do is to deal with it and find other areas where political influence and patronage exist.</P>
    <P>The last time Labour and Fine Gael were in power they managed to close off some of those.  They established the DPP and set up An Bord Pleanála.  Every legal brief that was ever handed out in the Law Library for years was handed out to known members of political parties and some people never got the opportunities of getting a brief.  The same applies to the judicial appointments, which have been a scandal in this State since 1922.  Only recently have there been one or two appointments that have not been political. Up to that every single judicial appointment, without exception, was a political appointment.  A big furore was kicked up here yesterday by Deputy Lenihan as to why a certain retired judge was not to be appointed to this board. The judge is in his mid-seventies.  We have the situation where people are waiting for three and four years to get their cases into the High Court and we have been removing judges and putting them on boards like this.  We have actually been appointing barristers to the bench for the specific purpose of appointing them as chairman of An Bord Pleanála. That was not a good appointment.  It is not a good idea and I do not think it is necessary for the chairman to be a judge or a lawyer.  I am not sure that lawyers are always the right people to choose for these positions.  The legal profession is an area that I hope this House will some day debate.  It reminds me of the story of the two farmers fighting over a cow.  One is pulling her by the head and the other is pulling her by the tail and the lawyer is milking her.  That situation needs examination in Irish life.</P>
    <P>This attempt by the Minister to set up an independent board must be welcomed. Both Deputy Lenihan and Deputy Molloy said they will resist the setting up of this board and that if they get back into power they will remove the <Col N="699" /> members of the board.  They said they had not in the past ever removed members of boards set up by the Government. What they seem to be saying is that they wish to retain the power of appointing people while they are in power and that we can do it when we are in power and they will not argue about it.  In fact, Deputy Fitzgerald, to his shame, actually said that and put it on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the Rents Restriction Act and the setting up of a rates tribunal.  He said that I had no understanding of or sympathy for the people who are suffering under the situation and that this is what we should be discussing instead of this Bill.  I had not at that stage made any comment about the rents tribunal or anything else and therefore I want to refute Deputy Molloy's statement.  Deputy Molloy said his intention was to change all boards.  The appointment by Government seems to suit Fianna Fáil because in the past it was a method of staying in power.  I do not think that is true at present.  Deputy Molloy also misinterpreted remarks made on this side of the House when someone said Fianna Fáil would never again get into power to make the changes he had suggested. I think it was suggested that Fianna Fáil on their own may never get back to power and that they will not easily make the changes which he and Deputy Lenihan proposed.</P>
    <P>When the planning appeal board was set up and decisions were removed from the Minister, a great sigh of relief was breathed throughout the country by people who were interested in planning and who were aware of abuses of the planning laws.  Did Deputy Molloy also breath a sigh of relief?  Maybe he was happy with the standards in Galway but many people are not.  There has been recent media publicity concerning section 4 in Galway.  I hope that the setting up of this independent board will set a good example which will filter through the whole planning set-up in the country and that people will take decisions seriously, honestly and expertly.  Terrible decisions were made here in the past.  The city of <Col N="700" /> Dublin has been mutilated by bad planning. We have been spared worse excesses throughout the rest of the country mainly because it is sparsely populated. Nothing much can be done about Dublin now but the rest of the country can learn by seeing what happened there. It is essential that we come to grips with the problem and the place to start is at the top.  We are attempting to do that in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I wonder if Deputy Molloy objected to the fact that appeals were removed from the Minister by the setting up of An Bord Pleanála because Fianna Fáil Deputies made very strong play yesterday about retaining power in the hands of the Government and warning that we would rue the day that we made it independent.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil wanted to retain power over political appointments. They kept repeating they did not want to depoliticise the situation.  Three former Ministers said that and they will regret what was said yesterday in this House because it will be demonstrated easily that the real fear is for the future of Fianna Fáil and that they will not have their hands on the giving out of jobs for the boys in sub-post offices, Garda stations and the civil service.  We have seen plenty of examples of the effect of those types of appointments where people who are supposed to be working for the State are using their positions to embarrass Ministers of parties which they do not support by leaking information.  This is corruption and the method used for the past 48 years by Fianna Fáil to stay in power.  We are now trying to stop it and the actions and speeches of Fianna Fáil Deputies yesterday demonstrated clearly that they do not want this power removed from them because when they are back in office they will want to dish out jobs again.  Every attempt will be made to stop that.  This morning's newspapers mentioned that the main objective of Fianna Fáil speeches was that they did not want depoliticisation.  How many people share <Col N="701" /> that view?  How many people have been affected by the abuse of planning laws, by greed, the buying of planning permissions and all the other means used to push through what they want?  I do not think many people will object to the setting up of this board.  Fianna Fáil do not like to fire party hacks but I do not mind incompetent people being fired, no matter what party they are in.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy said that this would be a terrible reflection on our parliamentary system.  I do not think it is but what Deputy Molloy said is a reflection and has been a reflection on parliamentary democracy over the years.  A new respect for politicians, which is badly needed, will be restored but the parliamentary party system to which Deputy Molloy referred is not the system to which we all aspire.  That is why we need professional and business people in parliament who are not affected by the party system, who have not been waiting in the wings for 20 years and who would do anything to get in here and slavishly follow the party line. More people should get involved in the party system because there are many experienced people who, unfortunately, do not want to be associated with any parliamentary party.  We must make them aware of the need to get involved.</P>
      <P>In the past Ministers who would not be capable of running a huckster's shop were running huge Departments with huge amounts of money.  People go out from here and talk to professional bodies or very successful organisations who could give this House the benefit of their expertise and help to sort out the country's problems and only then could we dispense with political patronage and board or job filling.  That is one reason why we need this board badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Molloy made a very serious attack on An Taisce.  He said that their main purpose was to de-politicise the whole process.  An Taisce are a public voluntary body and what they have done is on record.  If their objective is what Deputy Molloy said, then maybe they have good reason for wishing to de-politicise the planning board, and any other such boards.  Let us ask ourselves a few questions about An Taisce.  Would they <Col N="702" /> destroy an amenity?  What are their objectives?  Has Deputy Molloy read the An Taisce magazine?  He is a spokesman on the environment.  Has he ever looked at the quality of the photographs in that magazine, the articles published in it, the little gems they select from the city of Dublin of little shop fronts and details of the towns of Ireland where they show good planning and how towns should be made out properly and the kind of environment we would like to have?  It would be no harm if Deputy Molloy were to subscribe to An Taisce or to their magazine at any rate.</P>
    <P>Would An Taisce have allowed the ESB to demolish half of Fitzwilliam Street and build that ugly office block there?  Would An Taisce allow what Dublin County Council have been trying to achieve, the dump from Chapelizod to Lucan four miles long and 20 to 30 feet wide and a refuse truck every five minutes for the next 50 years piling rubbish and filth in the Liffey Valley which has been there for thousands of years created by God?  The wildlife there would be destroyed.  The county council have said that it is only a swamp.  Would the county council allow the carving up of the Carton estate or the Luttrellstown estate which is now for sale to some developer?  Would they allow themselves to be influenced by some developer or party hack who would offer them money to get a planning permission through?</P>
    <P>There is nothing to worry about in the involvement of An Taisce.  Did Deputy Molloy read the recent publication by An Taisce to find out what their ideas are and the trouble they have gone to in the three years that they took to produce that document?  He attacked An Taisce here yesterday and said that their main purpose is to de-politicise the whole process. Maybe it is, but if what has been happening in this country and city for the last decade is allowed to go on then maybe they are right.  In this situation in relation to An Bord Pleanála, that is what is needed.  If people even think that things are not right regarding planning applications or appeals an attempt must be made to put the matter right.  Such an attempt was not made in the past when Deputy <Col N="703" /> Molloy's party were in power.  An attempt was made the last time the Labour Party and Fine Gael were in power.  I do not know what The Workers' Party will say about it but I would be very surprised if they took the line that Deputy Molloy, Deputy Lenihan and Deputy Fitzgerald have taken.  I know that Deputy De Rossa will tell me that he can speak for himself and on the approach they have taken on other things I will be interested to hear what they have to say about this.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that one of the most important things is the independent image of the board.  The way in which the power has been used recently has led to widespread diminution of public confidence in the appeals system.  Why not, when it was wide open to abuse in the past?  Deputy Lenihan said that there is no need to interfere and that when he was Minister he and the Fianna Fáil Party never interferred with a board set up by the Opposition when in Government, yet just before he left office on the last occasion he appointed fourteen members to Bord na gCapall and he did so in a great hurry.  What was the urgency for him to do that if, as he says, he never interferred? If, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, it does not really matter whether you appoint Labour Party people or Fine Gael people so long as they are good people, why was the appointment of those members not left to the new Minister coming in?</P>

      <P>Are they trying to cod us? Did we really hit the nerve centre of Fianna Fáil yesterday?  Are they really worried that we might be able to get their hands away from the handing out of jobs? Are they afraid that they will lose support when people no longer feel that they can do them favours?  People might start thinking for themselves and saying, rightly, that the politicians cannot do anything for you, that you must elect someone to the House who can make a contribution, who can set the economy right, that we will not elect people simply <Col N="704" /> because they are able to do things or get things done for you.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy made a strong plea about former members of the board who worked in the interests of the nation and gave of their time as if they had to plead with them to take these positions.  I do not know whether that was done but I suggest that in many cases they did not take on these positions to work in the interests of the nation.  This was a type of reward, a payola, a pay-off, and they worked in the interests of prestige.  There was no effort required to get people to accept appointments to these boards. Why was it that members of their own party were always picked for such positions? The reason is simple.  Fianna Fáil had been in power for so long that they were able to hand to out all these posts and the payback in the future would be a guarantee of a vote for the party.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not state but that the objective is to break that but I deduce from the provisions that it is one of the objectives. One of my objectives in the course of this Dáil is to try to straighten things out and anywhere I see even a hint of anything tainted with corruption or political patronage, jobbery or nepotism, I will try to clean it up to restore respect for politicians instead of them being treated as the lowest form of animal here.  It is amazing the amount of disrespect voters have for Members, not as individuals but as Members of the Dáil.  That is as a result of what happened in the past and the quality of people elected to the House.  It has a lot to do with the behaviour of Members and the making of appointments. I hesitate to go into the abuses that have taken place in the planning area or to refer to Members who were in a position to make decisions and did so.  It is well known to those who conduct constituency clinics that it happened judging by the requests made by people.  People expect Deputies to be able to do favours for them.  We have all heard through the grapevine of Deputies being considered good for getting things done.  I hope the Bill is an attempt to do away with that in the future.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lenihan's allegations were nonsense.  Judging by his performance in the last two weeks he is not in any position to talk about smearing by this side of the House because he has endeavoured to make it his full time occupation.  Lack of experience is an important factor in relation to the membership of the board.  Decisions have been slow to come from the board and planning applications have been tied up with the board.  Some of the members of the board do not have the confidence of people involved in the planning field and that is another reason why the board should be de-politicised.  The Minister in the course of his speech said the Bill represented an attempt to appoint an independent board of experts who will be better able to carry out the functions and will be in a position to choose members from different disciplines and professions. He felt they would be better able to represent the interests of good planning and the environment in making their decisions.  It is not good enough to select political cronies and appoint them to a <Col N="706" /> board because they have done something for a party in the past.  We are all aware of the destruction that has been wreaked on the country, particularly in Dublin, by planning decisions in the past.  That is why I welcome the Minister's attempt to make the board independent.  The Minister in the course of his speech said:</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill are intended to restore public confidence in the system and to make the board's operation more efficient.  In short, the objective is to provide for a system which will ensure that justice is in future seen to be done in the making of appointments to the board and that these can never again be alleged to be based on political considerations.  That is what Deputies Lenihan, Molloy and Fitzgerald, three former Fianna Fáil Ministers, objected to.  The big question is why do they not want that?</P>

      <P>I have asked it many times. I hope the public will ask that questions and I hope the media will ask it.  I hope Fianna Fáil will be put on the rack for this because they are the people who made the mistake yesterday, not us.  They have highlighted their worry and fear of depoliticising something which has been the cause of widespread scandal in the past.  This could be the straw that broke the camel's back.  The intention from this side of the House is that they will not again achieve power on their own and they may not get the opportunity to come back into office and remove the members of this board.  I believe this will be welcomed by the public and I do not think there will be any furore about it.  They made their pitch yesterday in the stand they took in carrying out the farcical television debate that went on for seven hours interrupted with quorum commercials. I hope, if RTE ever come in here, they will not start to do that and that we will not have quorum bells ringing for commercials when we can all take a break during the commercial.  This is the kind of circus that was carried on here yesterday. <Col N="707" /> They had their clown prince dominating the ring for quite a time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw that.  They had their prince.  You would think there was one speech written and handed out to all of them and each of them went in and read it because the same points were brought out by all of them.  They were saying they did not want to lose the power of appointment, they did not want to give away their manna, the political <i>largesse</i> which kept them in power for so long. They wanted to retain that.  The Minister proposes to do away with the necessity for having as chairman of the board a High Court judge.  The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The 1976 Act provided that the chairman of the board must be a High Court judge or former judge but this arrangement is not being continued.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that there has been difficulty in getting a serving judge to take the position and that this is understandable for several reasons.  During the period of the last two Governments they found it necessary to appoint a senior barrister as a High Court judge with a view to his immediate appointment as chairman of the board.  The last time that happened was just before the change of Government and a barrister was appointed as a judge specifically with the intention of becoming chairman of An Bord Pleanála but this did not happen. What was that?  That was a blatant political appointment.  They chose a barrister, made him a High Court Judge and attempted to appoint him as chairman of the board.  Is that what Deputies Lenihan, Fitzgerald and Molloy want to continue so that they can go down, pick their man who served the party well &mdash; I do not know if it is true in this case because I do not know anything about the man &mdash; and put him in as chairman of the board?  They want this to be the same as Bord na gCapall.</P>

      <P>I will quote from the Minister's speech: He said:</P>
      <P>The 1976 Act provided that the chairman of the board must be a High Court judge or former judge but this arrangement is not being continued. Governments seem to have found difficulty in getting a serving judge to take the position and this is understandable for several reasons.  As a result, the last two Governments found it necessary to appoint or to seek to appoint, a barrister as a High Court judge with a view to his immediate appointment as chairman.</P>
      <P>That is what I was referring to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right to refer to the Minister's speech provided the Deputy leaves it there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am leaving it there.  I am saying, in reference to the speeches made by the three Deputies mentioned, that that is a blatant political appointment.  I am not referring to any particular person. They want to continue with that and I am saying it is wrong.  They want to put in a retired judge.  Deputy Lenihan mentioned his name five or six times yesterday afternoon.  I do not know why he did that.  There is an appalling situation in the High Court because of lack of judges. If we are taking them away for this kind of work we should appoint more judges. The Law Library is full of expertise and they certainly could get barristers if they are necessary for this particular position, which I doubt very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who decides that we must always run down and get a lawyer every time we <Col N="709" /> want to do something?  Who makes those decisions?  What is so great about lawyers that they must always be at the head of every board, considering the fees they can command, win, lose or draw?  The Minister is right in saying that it is not necessary that a lawyer should be chairman of the board.  Legal advice is available to whatever chairman is appointed. People run their businesses, their professions and their affairs without having legal qualifications and they seem to do quite well.  If they need legal advice they can go down to the Law Library, be ripped off but they only do it by choice. I do not see why we have to appoint a lawyer as chairman of the board when it is not necessary.  This is a welcome innovation in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a chairman is for a seven-year term of office, which is a long term for a person with the responsibilities of An Bord Pleanála.  It is a very sensitive post and a very sensitive board, which will very often cause controversy in relation to the decisions the board have to make.  Many times it will not be the fault of the board that a controversy arises.  It will be because some of the decisions the board have to make will affect a lot of people who will not agree with them.  It is very important that we get the right person for such a long term in office.  There should be a fair method for removing and monitoring the performance of the board.</P>
    <P>The chairman will be selected by a special committee consisting of the President of the High Court, the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, the chief engineering adviser of the Department, the chairman of the Council of An Taisce, the President of the Construction Industry Federation and the President of the Executive Council of Irish Trade Unions.  I do not know if that group is the best one from which to choose a chairman because I can see where there could be a conflict of interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave it at that.  I know an attempt has been made by the Minister to have an independent body capable of selecting the right person.  I am surprised there is no architect suggested as a member of the board: perhaps the Minister of State was worried he might have been criticised if he had suggested an architect as he is an architect himself.  I do not think one could consider appointing a board of this kind without an architect: perhaps the President of the RIAI or someone of that calibre.  Architecture is one of the few disciplines that studies the social surroundings as well as the planning aspect and I consider it essential to have someone from that background on the board.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy's apologia for An Bord Pleanála as enunciated yesterday was not very convincing.  It has been proved and accepted that the board in the past have been useless and have lost the confidence of the people.  For example, in the Harcourt Terrace case the board made a bad blunder in advising the applicants to adjust their application.  They were told they would get permission if they reapplied in that way.  The board went outside their terms and they were not a success. The way they were appointed was not accepted by the public and they lost the confidence of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know how the members and the chairman can be removed.  I should hate to see a situation developing here as applies in the courts where judges are appointed for life and can only be removed by the Oireachtas.  That is a cumbersome method.  Even though there could be the most dreadful decisions by certain members of the board, we might not be able to remove them.  I think the Minister retains the power to do that but it should be spelled out more clearly.  This is most important particularly in view of the fact that, according to three former Ministers in Fianna Fáil, when they get back to power they will remove the members. I am not saying we should do something that will prevent democracy from working in the normal way.  If and when Fianna Fáil get back into power and they wish to take certain actions we do not <Col N="711" /> wish to tie their hands in an unfair way. This debate is dealing with a serious matter but I do not think the debate yesterday as carried out by Fianna Fáil was a serious one.  Quorums do not bother me because I spend much time in the House. In fact, I was thinking of calling for a few quorums yesterday.  Deputy Molloy kept calling for people to come and listen to him but what we had to listen to was not worth hearing.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recognised the importance of having representatives from a wide range of disciplines and bodies who will carry out their work efficiently. Under section 7 ordinary members of the board will be appointed by the Minister for a time not exceeding five years.  Four will be appointed from among persons selected by groups representing professional, environmental, development and community interests, and the fifth ordinary members will be an established civil servant from the Department of the Environment.  The nominating organisations will be decided when the Bill is enacted and the Minister gives an assurance that the organisation he will select will be genuinely representative of the interests concerned.  I gather from that that the Minister is going to select the organisations and that they will appoint a nominee whom he will appoint to the board.  The Minister is not here to answer my point but I wonder if he will select the person concerned because that would defeat the whole object of making the board independent.</P>

He is the fourth Fianna Fáil Member in the past two days who has come along and accused us of innocence. He wants to get back to doing what <Col N="712" /> Fianna Fáil have been doing for the past 48 years.  That is what has the reputation of politicians at such a low level.

      <P>It is very important to have this board because of the abuses of planning rights down the line, and we are starting at the top.  Yesterday I asked why any member of the public should have to go to a county councillor, as I did and beg him not to do something which would have a detrimental effect on the environment. I appealed to a county councillor not to put a dump in the Liffey Valley from Chapelizod to Lucan because it would destroy that valley.  He told me he would thing about it, but it was only a swamp.  In the past county councillors did <Col N="713" /> not to have to answer for their actions because the public have never demanded that they do so.  The public do not take local authority elections very seriously. Six or seven names are put forward and the public vote for faces they do not know.  When the local elections are held next year I will try to impress upon my constituents that they should be very careful when selecting candidates.  The public should ask them their views on certain subjects, such as the environment. They should be asked what they would do if certain things happened. Councillors are elected for five years. This is too long.</P>
      <P>Everybody can see how Dublin County Council has been run.  The councillors run it any way they like.  They ignore the people who voted them into office.  They have made the most attrocious decisions and destroyed this county, yet they are not answerable to anybody.  I said yesterday that some of these councillors were ignorant and Deputy Tunney and Deputy Barrett objected to the use of that word. I take it that they objected to the use of that word because of its Irish connotation, which is insulting and because it could be considered as unparliamentary language.  This morning I looked up the word &ldquo;ignorant&rdquo; in the English Oxford Dictionary.  It means &ldquo;destitute of knowledge, either in general or with respect to a particular fact or subject, unknown, uninformed and unlearned&rdquo;.  It was in that context that I used it.</P>
      <P>If a person wishes to be elected in a certain area he must be familiar with that area.  We have let people go forward to represent us who do not care or know anything about what we want and there is often a doubt that, even if they did know all the facts of a situation, they would act in a proper way.

I hope that the people themselves will demand a higher standard from the county councillors whom they elect and that when these councillors are elected they will carry out the functions for which they are elected and will not act independently of the electorate but be answerable to them. That is the point which I am making and it is relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an honest attempt to remedy a situation unacceptable to the public in the past and will be welcomed by everybody. No time limit has been put on <Col N="716" /> delays in this Bill but the Minister mentions a procedure for specific examinations with a view to speeding up matters. Whether or not it is advisable to put a limit on time, delays can be discussed on Committee Stage but if an application cannot be reached and there is not enough time to discuss it properly it will go through by default.  That would not be a satisfactory situation for An Bord Pleanála.</P>

No communication is to be made between the chairman or the board members and members of the public, which is very important.  It is important that people who do not see notification of an application get an opportunity to discuss the case and lodge an objection if they think it is necessary and are not happy about the situation.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the vexatious and frivolous clauses are covered, with which Deputy Lenihan also agreed.  An opportunity is given to the board to write to somebody who is delaying the giving of information, or is being frivolous or vaxatious. If there is no reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is important to remember that it is usually those with money or who have many resources who are able to employ the experts to try to get the application through.  The ordinary person is not always able to afford to take on such people.  I hope that this fact is taken into consideration.  It is another important element in this Bill that in the past the ordinary objector could not engage senior counsel and planning experts, people whose job it is to steamroll through, or manipulate through, or keep putting in application after application.  It is only <Col N="717" /> people with money and time who can afford to have very expensive and longlasting applications.  Under the old system, many of the unsatisfactory housing estates were forced through in this manner. People had no opportunity to compete with them.  I would like to conclude by saying that there are 3,600 appeals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> Deputy Skelly <Col N="720" /> referred this morning to the disrespect felt now for politicians and the political system.  What is the doing to gain or restore respect if there is disrespect, with his type of behaviour and the remarks he has made?  Perhaps he says the same about the Members of this House.  However, with the other Members of my party, I supposed the amendment in the names of Deputies Molloy and Ahern.</P>
      <P>By this legislation the Minister is sacking the present board.  The Planning Act of 1963 was the first attempt to bring some semblance of planning into development. At the time we were at a reasonable stage of economic development. Deputy Skelly seems to think that county councillors decide on planning applications whereas this is a managerial or chief executive function.  A planning applications is submitted in the first instance to the local authority and the decision on whether to grant or refuse the application is made by the chief executive.  There follows then the appeals stage.  The 1963 Act provided that the Minister of the day should decide these appeals.  In some cases the junior Minister decided on them but the overall responsibility was vested in the Minister.  This arrangement did not work very well because of the heavy workload that it entailed for the Minister. There were very good decisions made in respect of planning particularly in regard to major developments, but it is not possible to please all of the people all of the time in an area such as planning.  Because of the numbers of applications coming before the Minister he could not continue to deal with all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was assigned to the Department in 1977 the planning board had begun their work.  I heard of the huge numbers of planning applications that had been awaiting the attention of the Minister before the board had come into operation.  This was not because the previous Minister had been lazy but simply because the day was not long enough for any Minister to run such a big Department and at the same time to familiarise himself with the various appeals and reports that were furnished to him.  The whole situation became unworkable.  It was only to be expected, therefore, that <Col N="721" /> a backlog would accrue.  In 1976 the Coalition Government set up the planning board, who were to be charged with the task of deciding on planning appeals. The relevant Act was agreed by both sides of the House.  There was no major criticism of it.  From what I was told of the situation that had existed before the coming into existence of the board, I could only be very grateful to the former Deputy Tully who as Minister introduced the legislation to set up the board.  Once the board began work, the backlog of appeals began to lessen.  Deputy Molloy went into detail on this.  By 1981-82, there had been quite an impact in so far as the backlog was concerned.  The fact that there has built up a backlog again does not mean that the board or individual members of it are to blame.  The problem is the lack of staffing.  There are not sufficient personnel on the staffing side to enable appeals to be prepared and put before the board any faster than is the present situation.  The only way, then, to deal with the delays is for the Government to sanction additional staff for the Department of the Environment to deal with this area.  It has been suggested that the board might recruit their own staff, but whether that would be a good move is another question.  Initially the board comprised six members.  During my time as Minister one of those went back to his original job.  He was only seconded to the board.  I had the vacancy filled and also appointed another member.  So far as I recall there were four places vacant on the board when I was appointed Minister.</P>
    <P>Regarding the manner in which the board deal with the files on planning appeals, they do not have to familiarise themselves collectively with every file. Individual members read different files and then, as Ministers would do at the Cabinet table, each member would produce the files he had read and bring his colleagues up to date on the situation so as to enable them to reach a decision. Perhaps it is good to have more people on the board.  This means that work can be dealt with more expeditiously.  Most important in the lead-up to that level is the staffing.  This Bill has no provision whatsoever to deal with the backlog so <Col N="722" /> long as there is no mention in it of more staffing.  In that respect the Bill is a total waste of time since it does not deal with the staff required to solve the existing problems, which cause all the delay, and it is futile for us to talk about politicising the board without taking any steps to deal with the immediate problem.  There are many more important measures that need to be dealt with instead of our wasting our time discussing a Bill designed to disband the present board without taking the necessary steps to deal with the major problem of the long delays and all that is involved because of those delays.</P>
    <P>We have been told how this board will be constituted.  Members of certain bodies will nominate the members of the board.  We can only hazard a guess as to what bodies they will be drawn from. This is allegedly the way in which the board will be removed out of the political arena.  I believe there are very few people who do not hold some form of political belief or who do not support some political party.  Irrespective of whether or not they vote they have leanings towards political parties.  It would be just too bad if they did not because if the majority did not have political leanings we would not have our present democratic system.</P>
    <P>With regard to political input and politicisation of the board and so forth, are we to believe these nominees nominated by these professional bodies will have no political leanings or preferences, do not involve themselves in or discuss politics, are not Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, or The Workers' Party?  Are we to believe they do not belong to any party, that they do not even think about politics though they live in a democracy?  I cannot see the relevance of this idea of putting in certain people who talk loudly about certain matters and who, apart from having some particular political beliefs and some political interest, will feel bound to represent the interest which nominated them.  It would be extraordinary if they could dissociate themselves completely from the interests in which they have been involved.</P>
    <P>I do not see that this is any improvement whatsoever.  Remember these people will not have been elected by any <Col N="723" /> electorate and it should be the right of the people generally who elect the Government and the right of that Government and the Minister responsible to appoint this board.  Who is better equipped than the Minister?  Who has more knowledge of the situation?  Who is capable of acquiring information about the different people he may contemplate putting on a board?  There are many channels through which he can get such knowledge.  But here he is not even going to have an opportunity of assessing the appointees.  Instead bodies of professionals will put forward names.  This is a very retrograde step particularly in relation to An Bord Pleanála because of the impact it has and its input into development, economic and otherwise.  It is very unwise to take this away from the elected representatives. Deputy Gene Fitzgerald suggested the Minister should withdraw the Bill not only because there is no urgency about it but because it will not deal with the major problem, namely, the long delays.  The average time for an appeal is ten to 12 days.  More inspectors are required and more staff to deal with these delays.  It is not a question of appointing a new board nominated by certain interests outside of the Government and the political parties.</P>
    <P>Delays cause serious problems.  They are very frustrating and costly.  Developers have decided against certain developments because of delays.  In one instance in my county delay was not caused by the board.  It was caused by local people who objected.  The particular development would have employed 350.  In fairness to the board they dealt with the matter as quickly as possible. The officials worked very hard.  Everybody except the objectors was quite satisfied. The appeal was heard and planning permission was granted.  The objectors were still dissatisfied and went to court.  The developers became so frustrated they pulled out and went to the Far East.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where delays have a serious effect.  I would itemise tourist development and industrial development. There is one quick way of creating <Col N="724" /> jobs.  Employment can be created faster in the construction industry than in any other industry.  The construction industry can start immediately whereas other developments take time to come on stream.  The construction industry absorbs more unemployed quicker than any other industry.  But the industry has been frustrated because of the delays, delays for which I have already given the reasons.  If the Minister has difficulty in recruiting qualified inspectors he can recruit qualified personnel on a temporary basis by secondment from elsewhere. That is quite feasible.  That is the way in which to deal with the backlog.  If he gets the Bill through he should let the incoming board start off with the backlog because of the serious lack of development which results in a lack of employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities are too slow in replying or giving their objections to submissions made by a person to the board. A number of local authorities have a habit of passing the buck regarding planning applications which are controversial. Their way of getting over this is to knock the application knowing that it will be appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  If the board grant the appeal they will get the blame.  Local authorities should deal with the applications before them on their merits.  They have ample opportunity to get all the information they need.  If they cannot acquire it within the two months that time can be extended.  There is no justification for kicking them up to An Bord Pleanála just because they do not want to be saddled with the blame for granting permissions which are controversial.</P>
    <P>A person who is refused an oral hearing heretofore had a right of appeal to the Minister of the day.  This did not cause undue delays.  There were instances where because the Minister might be better acquainted with the case he would grant an oral hearing.  Sometimes facts are brought out at such hearings which would not be otherwise.  This power should not be removed from the Minister. No Minister has ever abused this power by granting unnecessary oral hearings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> In some cases there is a long delay as regards the compilation of reports.  It takes a long time when an inspector has finished his investigation to put such reports on the file and submit them to the board for decision.  Perhaps something can be done in this area.  There is insufficient staff in the Department of the Environment to deal with the backlog and this is well known.  The Bill makes no provision for the recruitment of additional staff.</P>
    <P>The selection committee to select the chairman will comprise the President of the High Court, the secretary of the Department of the Environment, the chief engineering adviser in the Department of the Environment, the Chairman of An Taisce, the President of CIF and the President of ICTU.  I wonder why two are needed from the Department of the Environment.  I do not see the necessity for having any selection committee. The Government are fully capable of selecting a chairman for this or any other board.  There is no necessity for these fine gentlemen to select a chairman for this board.</P>
    <P>We see no necessity for this Bill being brought in at this time.  Any complaints I received during my time as Minister were always about delays.  This is due to lack of staff to furnish the necessary reports to the board in order to permit them to make decisions.  Until such time as extra staff are recruited there is no point in bringing in this Bill.  We can only conclude, as my colleagues have stated, that this is just a political exercise.  I regret to say that.</P>
    <P>If I could see some purpose in the Bill it would be acceptable, but the fundamental problem is not being dealt with. If it was, it would not be necessary to sack the board and appoint a new one. All the members of the board are not appointed on the same day or in the same year so vacancies arise from time to time. If some members are found wanting their positions could be filled.  There is no necessity to sack the board.</P>
    <P>Most people have political beliefs or leanings so I do not understand how the board can be taken out of the political arena.  I do not know of any case where <Col N="726" /> there was political interference on a scale of any consequence.  This Bill is totally unnecessary.  It is wasting the time of the House.  The Government should get on with the job of giving more staff to the board.  In that way the backlog will be dealt with as efficiently as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. As a person who is an elected member of a local authority I will give my experience as regards planning permission applications. I am proud to have been a member of Meath County Council since 1974 and I resent any allegations that a Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or Independent councillor in that county is an ass, a fool or stupid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only speak for Meath county.  The procedure there is that the councillors draw up the county development plan.  Members of the public who want to apply for planning permission make a formal application and that is dealt with by the county manager, as the granting of applications is a managerial function.  Should somebody not be happy with the decision they receive they can appeal that decision to An Bord Pleanála.  In County Meath all the councillors are constructive and there is no political interference with the county manager.  Certainly people have come to me concerning planning refusals; but during the 19 years I worked in a local authority I always found the honesty, trustworthiness and integrity of civil servants and local authority officials to be undoubted.  I have never seen any backroom dealing with officials in regard to planning.  It does not go on.  Public servants are above board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the decision to set up this new planning board and to take the election of members completely out of the political arena.  I know that the members who will be appointed will be people who vote at elections but there is a difference between a person who casts his vote and a person who acts as director of elections <Col N="727" /> or a staunch member of a party being appointed to the board.  The Opposition are criticising the Minister for taking this matter outside the political arena.  Has anybody in the Opposition stated the planning expertise of the members of the present board?  Matters of a very technical nature must be considered in the granting of planning permission.  The average member of the public probably thinks that such permissions generally are sought by individuals seeking permission for single house, but this is not the case. In my county there are massive housing applications as well as mining and industrial applications.  Members of this board should never have been appointed on the strength of membership of a political party but should have been planning experts.  The Minister has said that this will be a full-time job where people will do a good week's work for a decent week's pay.</P>
    <P>For too long in parts of Ireland local authorities have granted planning permission for new towns without any forward thinking as to the provision of schools, churches and shopping facilities. The Minister is right to ensure that members of this board will have a certain amount of planning expertise.  While a previous Minister increased the number of members of the board, the Opposition cannot deny that the backlog of work increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The major restriction affecting planning permission is that people are not allowed to build houses on national primary routes.  I would remind Deputy Molloy that in 1969 he, as Minister for Local Government, sent a directive to all local authorities to this effect, and I agree with his decision.  I have known members of my local authority who have tried to get that decision rescinded but no Minister has acceded to that request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While members of local authorities in some cases draw up county development plans, it is often county managers who have to grant planning permission in <Col N="728" /> accordance with the plan prepared by the county council.  It is the managers who must take the responsibility because the buck stops with them.</P>

Possibly that is the case, but I have no proof.  He must admit that most local authorities are overburdened with work. In my county about 2,500 planning applications are dealt with every year.</P>

      <P>The Opposition are deliberately playing politics with this matter.  They are like children who have lost their soothers and are crying for the henchmen they placed on the board.  It was the deliberate misuse of political appointments by previous Fianna Fáil Ministers which brought about the scrapping of this board.  No Government could tolerate the present situation.  I would accept it if the Opposition could state that 100 per cent or even 50 per cent of the board members have planning expertise. I know one man who is entitled to be a member because he is a qualified civil engineer and would have planning qualifications.  It is farcical to offer a job worth £18,000 to a director of elections. I hope the Opposition will continue to criticise my party's leader, the Minister for the Environment.  The Minister has public support behind him.  The man in the street, the majority of the public are saying: &ldquo;Good man Dick; well done, take politics out of planning&rdquo;.</P>

I was calling Deputy De Rossa as the tenth contributor to the debate.  He will be followed by Deputy Prendergast, Deputy Tunney, Deputy Dowling, a Deputy to be named by Fianna Fáil and then by a Fine Gael Deputy.

Apart from that, there is a situation in which we have had a member from the Government side and you are now about to bring in another speaker who is in favour of what the Government are doing, and yet you indicate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

You are in the invidious position that the Ceann Comhairle has ruled on this, but we must point out the unfairness of this position.

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incredible how much time we have lost in this debate in useless haggling.  There are precedents for Fianna Fáil supporting legislation before the House.  They supported the Coalition last week and the order of speakers was not raised at all.  I welcome the Bill, limited as its provisions are and restricted as it is.  It makes an attempt to de-politicise planning.  It is quite in order for any Deputy to support or oppose any measure before the House regardless of which side of the House he sits on, whether in Opposition or on the Government side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill de-politicises the appointment of the board.  It will speed up planning appeals.  I find it difficult to accept the Fianna Fáil amendment which seeks to deny a Second Reading for the Bill.  It is unreasonable and foolish because it will serve to harden the attitude of the public in the belief which many have that attempts are being made, behind closed doors, to ensure that political patronage will be maintained in relation to An Bord Pleanála.  The Fianna Fáil amendment has three paragraphs.  It <Col N="733" /> would seriously undermine procedures for physical planning in the country.  I have not heard yet from the Fianna Fáil benches their grounds for suggesting there would be serious undermining of existing procedures.  The Bill does not meet all the matters I would like to see in the Bill and my party will propose on Committee Stage an amendment to try to improve the procedures.  The existing procedures which Fianna Fáil are anxious to maintain need to be changed and updated.</P>
      <P>On the second point in relation to the repercussions on the standing, prestige and effectiveness of Government boards and State-sponsored bodies, I should like all members of State boards and bodies to be selected independently of Government Ministers.  I do not agree that the appointment of persons to State boards should be in the hands of a particular Minister or Government.  They should be appointed independently by an independent body on the basis of their expertise, their knowledge and their ability in the area to which they are appointed. We have had people appointed to various State bodies and semi-State bodies who had no obvious expertise for the boards to which they were appointed.</P>
      <P>The third point raised by the Fianna Fáil amendment is that the Bill pre-empts the deliberations of the Joint Committee on Building Land which under its Orders of Reference is required <i>inter alia</i> to examine the operations of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts.  I am not a member of that committee, but I assume the concern of that committee is to find ways to ensure that the price of land is controlled so that vast profits are not made when it is zoned or re-zoned for industrial development or housing development, and to ensure that there is an orderly development of the environment, and that any value which accrues as a result of re-zoning and inflated prices following re-zoning is fed back to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see that this Bill, which attempts to provide an independent or semi-independent system of appointing members to An Bord Pleanála, and to tighten up the appeal decision process, <Col N="734" /> can have any effect on the deliberations of the Committee on Building Land.  I have not yet heard in the contributions made by Fianna Fáil any justification for the point made in their amendment.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted by all sides of the House that there is growing public disquiet about the composition and working of the State planning body.  I said in the past and I repeat that the board should be disbanded.  Depending on what system of appointment is decided by the House, the members should be re-appointed if they are found to be suitable, and if they are nominated by the various groups and bodies designated in the Bill which may or may not be passed in the House.</P>
    <P>There is public disquiet, and there is a need to ensure, in the interests of politicians themselves, that there is no taint of jobbery or influence in any State body. Every effort should be made by this House to ensure that we distance ourselves from bodies set up to adjudicate on matters which do not have a direct political relevance.</P>
    <P>This board was set up initially to do precisely what Fianna Fáil are now objecting to, to de-politicise major planning decisions.  Because of the rumours and stories which surrounded the appointment of various members of the board over a period of years, it is now recognised that the system of appointment is not the right one.  The nature of the appointments made to the board by successive Governments&mdash;and I am not talking only about when Fianna Fáil were in office; previous Coalition Governments also appointed members to the board&mdash;has led to the widely held conviction that at least some members were chosen more for their party political affiliations than for any knowledge or expertise in planning and development.</P>
    <P>I make that point, and I should like to qualify it by saying that I do not know any of the members of the planning board.  I am echoing a view held by a vast number of people outside this House that the system of appointment is wrong and that it is open to abuse.  We should not allow that to continue.  If we allow it to continue and if Fianna Fáil succeed in preventing this Bill going through even <Col N="735" /> in its present state, we are perpetuating a situation in which Members of this House and politicians in general are held to be less than honest.  Having said that, I should like to dissociate myself from the remarks made by Deputy Skelly about city councillors and county councillors.  It was a deplorable attack on democratically elected members of local bodies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>A clear distinction must be drawn between democratically elected members of local councils, who have been put there by the electorate to make decisions on matters on which they have power to make decisions under the Local Government Acts, and the planning board or any other board appointed by a Minister and not answerable to anyone but themselves once they are appointed. That is why we are anxious that a new system should be developed to ensure that when people are being appointed the best possible people available are given the job, and that-they are above any suspicion whatsoever that they hold their positions because of some political affiliations, or that they are in any way open to political influence.</P>
      <P>On the question of the speed with which appeals are dealt with, at a recent meeting with the construction industry committee of the ICTU the point was made very strongly to us that there was an urgent need to clear up what they see as the planning mess which exists.  They made the point that the present backlog in the hearing of appeals by An Bord Pleanála and the uncertainty about the whole planning area were major factors inhibiting the revitalisation of the building industry.  We all know that in that industry there is very serious unemployment running around 40 per cent at the moment.  In Irish terms that is a disgrace, given the number of people who are in need of homes and in need of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Finglas in my own constituency people have been informed that the IDA have not sufficient industrial land to develop the region and provide jobs for <Col N="736" /> the population in the area.  The whole question of inter-relating the planning of an area and ensuring that there is coordination between the IDA who need industrial land the population who need housing and employment must be looked at.  The planning authorities at local level and the planning appeal board must be aware of the needs in various areas.</P>

Would the Minister agree that the banks and the ACC have been black guarding the farmers, whereas in 1978 they almost forced money on the same farmers.

      <P>I do not think strong or intemperate language will help the cause of farmers in difficulty.  We have to be prudent.  The attitude of bank managers varies from bank to bank.  During last week's Estimates debate I said I was very anxious that the banks give very sympathetic consideration to each applicant and I would like to see uniformity in the application of standards towards the individuals involved.  The Deputy spoke about the reduction of interest rates because the inflation rate has come down considerably.  It does not follow that interest rates will come down because interest rates are dictated almost entirely by external factors.  It is not something we can do much about.</P>

Could I further ask if the Minister is aware that there are many young children in these schools who are suffering from embarrassment because of this?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that perhaps one of the reasons for the figure being as low as 40 per cent is that many rural schools, particularly the smaller ones, consider the distribution to be excessive.  That is the reason, certainly in some of the western counties, why this scheme is not in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to introduce a revised system of grant aid under the farm modernisation scheme later in the year with the emphasis on basic livestock housing.  It will be open to farmers whose applications have been affected by the recent modifications to the scheme to make application at that stage for any works they intend to carry out provided that the investment proposed is eligible for grant aid under the revised scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that many farmers were forced to commence modernisation because they required buildings and particularly silage pits.  They were approached because they had an overall plan to commence work on these.  Those people should be considered. As I said yesterday, there are 400 in my county in financial difficulties as a result of this drastic action taken by the financial institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>

      <P>As I have said several times here during the past few weeks, it has been a condition of the scheme <Col N="751" /> always that one had to have prior written approval.  That is the only way in which there can be any type of organised building programme in the farm development section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, who comes from a farming background, should be realistic.  Will he not accept that in bringing about better conditions for farmers there should be retrospection in order to accommodate those farmers who work to an over-all plan? What the Government are doing in respect of this scheme is unfair.  In view of the small amount of money involved, particularly in the west and in the north-west, would the Minister not consider making the scheme retrospective?  What alternative has the Minister in mind?  Is he thinking, for instance, of people in the west and in the north-west being able to avail of drainage grants within the terms of the programme for western development?</P>

I think tomorrow is the deadline for these works and I should like to point out to the House that a fair amount of leeway has been given.  Some farmers have had approvals for two and two-and-a-half years and it is very difficult to have a structured type of grant system of payment unless one is sure of what is actually being done inside a relatively short time.

      <P>The western drainage scheme, which came into operation on 1 January 1979, provided for field drainage of 100,000 hectares.  Because of the very large number of applications received, it was extended to provide for an additional 50,000 hectares up to 31 December, 1986.  A number of applications at present on hands cannot be catered for within the limit of 150,000 hectares and consideration is being given to how best they can be dealt with.  An extension would, of course, involve the commitment of substantial additional resources from the Exchequer and would also require the approval of the EEC which meets 50 per cent of the cost.</P>

      <P>Applications registered up to 30 September 1981 are the only ones that can be catered for at present. There are a few major problems involved.  A survey was carried out in the last few months of 1982 to find out what kind of approvals were issued which had not been taken up.  It appears there will be 9,000 applications under the 150,000 hectare level that cannot be dealt with. There is enough money in the Exchequer at present to keep the drainage programme going until the end of this year. After that it will be necessary to review it with a view to seeking aid from Europe.</P>

      <P>The initial application to Brussels for 100,000 hectares was regarded as a good scheme.  In 1981 the Coalition had to go back for another 50,000 hectares.  That is almost gone now. There is a lot of drainage work being carried out but until such time as we reach the limit we cannot go back to Brussels.  I will look at the position at the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the grave dissatisfaction among farmers who submitted applications subsequent to June 1981?  They are most anxious to have these grants allocated in view of the fact that the inspectorate staff are marking out schemes for farmers who do not intend to go ahead with them.  Will he do what he can to see if applications from progressive farmers who want to go ahead with drainage schemes can be taken out of order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a dangerous precedent.  Part of the Deputy's argument is quite valid.  In recent times my Department asked farmers participating in this scheme to dig the main drain.  This would indicate their willingness to go ahead immediately. This has stopped the taking up of approvals without using them and as such has been successful.  Only 60 per cent of the schemes have been completed and paid for.  The other 40 per cent has to come in yet.</P>

      <P>This was mentioned before.  There are many farmers who received grants under this scheme and who now want to do more work.

      <P>Would the Minister agree that having spent money on the reclamation of land in the west of Ireland there is no extra lifestock on the land? Does the Minister agree that it might be desirable to consider incorporating the western drainage package into a comprehensive farm development plan which would take account of whether farmers are able to stock the land and whether they have utilised the land to the maximum possible in its present condition? Would the Minister not agree that we should consider whether the farming enterprise is deserving of that kind of investment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a big subject. There is no doubt that it would be beneficial if we could prove conclusively that money spent by the State resulted in extra production on farms.  It is difficult to get a combined scheme that would work on all fronts at the same time.  While one can argue that the western drainage scheme has not resulted in more livestock on the farms, we are poised for a reasonable increase and part of that will be due to the drainage of the wet lands.</P>

      <P>For obvious reasons, as I said in my previous reply, I have to wait until the scheme is taken up. I could not proceed otherwise to look for further aid.  I have the matter under review.  I sympathise with the problem in County Monaghan because it has been one of the better counties of uptake and because of that and because of the amount of land that has to be drained we could not have the entire programme concentrated in County Monaghan.  The other counties must get attention as well. I would like to see some drainage done in Galway as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

It is worth noting that one of the arguments against the moving of the Bill at this time is that it is felt too much of the time available this week is being given to it.  With the agreement of the Coalition Government and the Fianna Fáil Party in recent months, the House has put through the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, the <Col N="832" /> Finance Bill and the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, all of which were guillotined at one stage or another despite the fact that many Deputies were anxious to get in on them.</P>
      <P>This is a much more restrictive Bill.  It aims at dealing with two areas of planning law.  For that reason it should be welcomed. While we have reservations about it, one or two days on Committee Stage should be adequate to enable us to express our opinions.  If additional time is required it should be on Committee Stage where it will be necessary to introduce amendments.  As has already been said by Fianna Fáil Deputies, there are other areas which require urgent attention such as company law, family planning law, marital breakdown, illegitimacy and the question of rent tribunals. All of these are urgent matters which I have raised at one time or another over the past few months.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that I am just as anxious as anybody else to get a break from this place, I am quite willing to stay here until the end of July and to come back here on 1 September to deal with these matters.  If Fianna Fáil indicated to the Government that they would agree to shorten the summer break to the month of August to deal with these very urgent matters, we should consider extending this sitting to the end of July and come back on 1 September.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go into specific points in any detail because we are preparing a number of amendments, but there are a number of areas which need to be dealt with in the Bill and tightened up.  One comes under section 4 which seeks to have decisions made as quickly as possible. That is not good enough.  There should be a time limit on the period within which decisions should be made. Local authorities have to make decisions within a given period of time, and I see no reason why An Bord Pleanála should not also make their decisions within, say, four months.  That should be quite long enough for the board to take to make a decision on any application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important area needs to be dealt with is the question of deemed permission. So far as I know that is not in <Col N="833" /> the Bill, but the opportunity should be taken by the Minister to deal with it now. Where a local authority fail to notify applicants of a decision on a development the application is automatically granted. This interferes seriously with the rights of third party objectors.  I understand that in Britain the reverse is the case.  Where a local authority fail to notify applicants the application is deemed to have failed. I am not well enough up on planning law to know whether that is better than the present system.  Some protection should be included in this Bill and people who are claiming deemed permissions should be required to insert notices in the newspapers so that third parties would know what was going on and would be in a position to object to the permissions deemed to have been given.</P>
    <P>At the moment when a local planning authority intends to grant permission which would be in breach of the development plan for an area they have to put public notices in the newspapers.  I understand that An Bord Pleanála do not have to do that.  Where they intend to give permission to a developer which will be in breach of the development plan for an area they should be required to give notice of that in the newspapers so that people are made aware of what is going on.</P>
    <P>One of the sections of the Bill provides that the board should review its organisation and practices on a regular basis but does not indicate when that review should take place.  I believe such a review should be carried out at at least twoyearly intervals so as to ensure that they remain abreast of current thinking on planning and so on.</P>
    <P>There is no requirement on the board at the end of the year to publish a list of applications before them or the status of appeals.  It would be a good practice for them to issue at the end of the year the applications still before them, the applications they have dealt with and the status of any applications that still have to be dealt with.  It would be an incentive to be that bit more efficient.</P>
    <P>On the question of the procedures for the appointment of a chairperson, various bodies will be offered positions on <Col N="834" /> the committees which will recommend a chairperson to the Minister.  On that committee there should be representation from householder organisations such as ACRA and NATO.  These are the people who either benefit or suffer most from decisions made by the board.  They have a genuine interest in environmental development and they should be recognised. I know that on the board itself the Minister intends to have representatives from those organisations but in the appointment of the chairperson the Minister should give recognition to these bodies.</P>
    <P>I am not too happy with the right of the Minister to refuse to appoint candidates selected by different bodies.  That is an attempt to hold on &mdash; by the backdoor &mdash; to the right to select a person who might be more politically acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State shakes his head but the fact is that that power can be used in that way.  We are trying to get away from a situation where powers can be abused.  Another point about which I am not too happy is the right of the Minister to re-appoint sitting members.  I think there is no limit to the number of times which he can re-appoint a member.  That again is getting away from the stated purpose of the Bill &mdash; to depoliticise the establishment of this board.  I am not happy about the right to re-appoint sitting members without some limit on the number of times a Minister can exercise that right.</P>
    <P>Under section 16 the board can refuse an appeal if they feel it is vexatious.  The board should be required to explain their reasons for refusing the appeal and to put them in writing to the person making the appeal.  This power also applies in situations where an appeal is made and the grounds for the appeal is not forthcoming within two weeks.  It is very difficult to decide whether an appeal is vexatious or not.  It is a very unclear area.  The board should be required to put their grounds in writing.</P>
    <P>At present where people have got permission from a planning authority and are appealing against conditions attaching to the permission the whole application <Col N="835" /> is considered and they could lose the permission itself.  In this Bill the Minister seeks to bring about a situation where a person can appeal conditions attached to a permission without the board having the power to overturn the permission.  I could see that militating against local authorities who attempt to ensure proper development by adding conditions which, according to the strict letter of the law, they may not be entitled to do.  An example would be where they would insist that to get the permission a developer would have to, say, hand over £50,000 for the provision of a car park in the area. Developers would be reluctant to appeal against that condition at present in case the permission was lost completely.  The power given to the board under this Bill would enable developers to appeal against such conditions.  We might then be frustrating the efforts of local planning authorities to approve particular developments.</P>
    <P>We welcome the direction in which this Bill is moving.  We have reservations about some of its contents.  We believe it could have gone a lot further in distancing itself from the political arena, but Deputies who are concerned about the reputation of this House and of State boards should welcome this move.  For that reason I would urge those who are opposed to it to maintain their position that they object to certain sections but in reality we must accept that boards should be free and should be seen to be free from political interference.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that members of the board should be experts in the planning area.  There is nothing in the Bill which requires the appointment of people with expertise.  There is a civil servant mentioned and presumably he will have some expertise, but that is only one person.  It should be a requirement that at least some members of the board have expertise in the planning area.  I hope the Minister will be receptive to whatever amendments are brought forward on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to support this Bill I would like to make the following points.  This is a very timely move by the Government to democratise the position in relation to An Bord Pleanála. Interested members of the public will recall that the then Minister, Mr. Jim Tully, was responsible for setting up An Bord Pleanála as a means of depoliticising the situation which had prevailed up to then so that the whole question of planning and related matters might be seen to be manifestly above suspicion. However, because of subsequent events, the leader of my party, Deputy Spring, felt obliged to change the situation again because of the way the original spirit and intention of Mr. Tully's Act has been circumvented by Ministers of Fianna Fáil Governments when in power.</P>
      <P>I would like to make the following observations from a political perspective which I consider are important.  Because of our history as a subject people, there was a certain recognition and toleration of a kind of cap-touching attitude of subservience as a means of survival by our people in the past.  This is normal for a subject people.  A modern analogy is that common proverb among the blacks in America which says that you tell Smokey what Smokey wants to know.  That has been the attitude of subject peoples everywhere.  A corollary of that attitude seems to be that when people of that type have managed to throw off the yoke of oppression &mdash; and that is a common experience in other parts of the world today &mdash; and come into their own, they look after their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a tradition in this country since the foundation of the State, very sedulously fostered, that if you belong to one particular party it opens all doors.  It used to be said that the leader of one party went to America to study how Tammany Hall operated and came back and applied that philosophy in the Irish political spectrum.  The late and great Donnchadha O'Malley, from my own city, said on television in his typical, brashy, honest manner that all things being equal a Fianna Fáil man will get the job.  That <Col N="838" /> attitude became common.  That type of sentiment breeds a reaction of cynicism, disillusionment and resentment in ordinary, decent, concerned citizens because it is seen to be nothing but an extension of the abuse of power practised by our political masters when they operated from Dublin Castle and when they dominated this country.  In constitutional parliamentary democracy that kind of situation should not be tolerated because it manifests the type of nepotism and political patronage that can apply only in an almost totalitarian situation or a dictatorship.</P>
    <P>There are traditional areas of public life in this and all democracies where appointment on preferment in some of the professions, notably the Judiciary, is based on political persuasions.  That is very healthy because it builds in a safety valve of checks and balances.  Our Judiciary have been manifestly equitable in their conduct of affairs and have never been open to the criticism that they were partisan in a political context in their judgments.</P>
    <P>However, there are other institutions which do not enjoy the same level of respect, and I am referring particularly to An Bord Pleanála.  I want to make this quite clear: I do not know any member of the board and I am not saying that any one of them, or all of them, is not a worthy, admirable person.  What I am saying is that because of the manner of their appointment and the subsequent political controversy which that evoked, they, perhaps unfairly, have become tainted with the suspicion that they are in the pockets of one particular political party.</P>
    <P>That is not fair to the concept of objective institutional life here and certainly not fair to the members themselves. There are inherent, built-in disadvantages in that type of system.  People with eminent qualifications in that field might, <i>ipso facto</i>, be reluctant to go on such a board for fear of being deemed to be politically appointed rather than to have the necessary professional qualifications. It is not good that that perception of An Bord Pleanála exists at the moment and it does not help the image of the board if <Col N="839" /> people of a known political persuasion who have been refused planning permission by a local authority and opposed by residents' associations give, if the Chair will excuse the crude expression, a political Harvey Smith to the institutions of this State by being prepared to take bets that they will beat the local authorities and the residents' associations and will gain their planning permission, not on technical grounds.  That perpetuates the image of this body being in the pocket of one particular party.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that that body be put on the right track and be seen to be above any suspicion of political patronage or of nepotism.  It could be deemed very useful to belong to such a political party if one were interested, perhaps, in making plenty of money out of land deals, speculations and the like.  All the impassioned eloquence from the other side of the House &mdash; and I am being strictly objective and not descending into discussing personalities &mdash; will not make white black or day night.  The perceived image of An Bord Pleanála in recent times is that it is in the pocket of one political party and I blame that political party for the manner in which the board was constructed.  They left themselves wide open to that criticism, whether it is basically true or untrue.  What is significant is that the public image of the body is that it is politically corrupt or suspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I am the type of person, because of my training, to do so.  I <Col N="840" /> believe in telling facts and will present the facts when called to do so at the proper forum.</P>
      <P>I have said that I do not know any of the people on the board who are concerned. I am not saying in any way that any of them is other than above suspicion. What I am saying is that statements made outside that board would suggest that that is the known image of the board.  It is particularly important for us politicians &mdash; and we could do with an up-lift in our public image at the moment &mdash; that all the institutions of public life here should be seen to be run in a democratic, fair and responsible manner, open to this House.</P>
      <P>Dr. Johnson when talking about patriotism, which can be extended to politics, said that it is the last refuge of a scoundrel. That is very much the image of politicians at the moment and we are receiving a lot of unfair treatment from the media.  If we do not do something positive to correct what is seen to be an abuse of public trust, we leave ourselves open to that kind of criticism.  It is also of great significance in other ways at local authority level for those of us who are members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>The whole operation of planning appeals and compulsory purchase orders is totally archaic and outmoded.  For example, in the United States planning appeals and compulsory purchase orders can be got through in about six months, as against the years of tortuous investigation which arise here.  For instance, in my own city we were looking at land owned for centuries back.  The landlords were the Earls of Limerick, the Lords Glentworth, some of whom had gone to Spain and had not been in Limerick for the last century and a half.  We had to contact the heirs before we could get clearance to move in and build modern local authority houses.  We should bring that position up to date, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Limerick we have what is arguably, outside of Dublin, the finest extant example of Georgian building in Europe.  I am speaking about the Newtownpery area which was the great extension of our city in the late eighteenth century.  A preservation order has been placed on that <Col N="841" /> whole area which retains its original pristine Georgian character.  With what is going on, or alleged to be going on at present, somebody might move in on that land and, in spite of the unanimous opposition of every elected member of the city council and of the Limerick Corporation officials, defy that unanimous opposition if he had unfair access to somebody in An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>Equally, we have a unanimous policy followed by all elected members of all political persuasions that flats in Limerick city should be owner-occupied.  Everyone knows the abuse of flats where people move in and leave rubbish and dirt, the grass is left to grow and dirty curtains are left on the windows.  In order to stop that we insist, where possible, that each flat be owner-occupied so that it will retain a well-kept appearance.  In that area also we could be frustrated in our unanimous policy.  Our old city has a thousand years of continuous occupation, with a heritage second to none in Europe.  That could be put aside by a mercenary developer who thinks he has somebody in An Bord Pleanála in his back pocket.  This could happen in spite of the unanimous opposition of the local authorities and of the preservation order.  It is very important that any such planning authority be seen to be above suspicion, like Caesar's wife, having no taint.</P>
    <P>Perhaps An Bord Pleanála might be departmentalised to take account of some of the objections made here this morning in relation to delays with industrial type planning which might have the effect of retarding progress in the area of construction for factory development.  As a trade union official in my own area, I am very concerned with that aspect.  The construction industry should not in any way be held up.  It has been claimed by an American economist, Milton Friedland &mdash; of whom I would normally not be too loud in my quotation &mdash; that the construction industry is one of the great reflators of any economy.  I would be reluctant to delay any development which would speed up the building industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the tragic loss of one development in our region.  In <Col N="842" /> that case there were lost 250 highly-paid jobs in respect of which the dependency ratio was one to four or 1,000 depending on the planning permission being granted.  Because the planning permission was held up the jobs were lost.  We should insist on a built-in mechanism that would ensure that planning applications of that sort would be given priority and urgent treatment.  We should set up a department that would deal solely with such applications, thereby ensuring that there would not be undue delay.</P>
    <P>Every local authority member is aware of the blackguardism of builders who enter into bonds with local authorities and who promise to undertake all the works specified in those bonds but then move out of housing estates leaving them in a desperate condition.  Recently we saw a television programme about an estate that had been left in such a condition. That was not all that far from where we are now.  Obviously, residents are very aggrieved that builders be allowed play ducks and drakes with local authorities. The fault lies with the ponderous bureaucratic system in which we operate. Local authorities cannot move quickly or effectively enough to force builders to complete their contracts.  In one area in Limerick, 21 years elapsed before a green area was completed by the builders.  I am sure there are a number of similar situations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>By way of dealing with this problem I suggest that the board or some body be vested with the authority to tie into the bonds a mechanism whereby there would be a very heavy penalty imposed on any builder who would not fulfil the conditions of the bond.  The penalty that can be applied now is negligible.  Alternatively it could be part of local authority law that a builder would not be allowed contract again for any public authority until such time as every detail of a previous scheme in terms of environmental layout, structural defects and so on had been completed satisfactorily.  We had a case in Limerick recently where a threat on those lines proved very effective.  In that case there was a question of structural defects in what was otherwise a lovely estate.  When we informed the <Col N="843" /> builder concerned that it would be useful to him, in the event of his seeking another contract, if he completed the previous one, the defects were put right very quickly.  Some of us had been calling for years to have that situation rectified and it was only when the builder was interested in another contract that the defects were put right.  That is the kind of effective planning legislation we should have, thereby ensuring that builders are answerable to local authorities.</P>

      <P>That is the sole purpose in my rising to make a short contribution on the proposed legislation.  The previous two speakers expressed their concern for democracy.  Deputy Prendergast indicated that he wants this whole area democratised.  He is as mindful as I am of the character and nature of our democracy. This follows the line that at certain prescribed times candidates offer themselves to the public, advancing certain policies that are concerned with politics. There is a tradition of groupings of people who so far as they are concerned have a concept and a tradition of politics which is superior to others.  Other parties can equally contend and, as a result of that, at urban level, local level and national level, certain people are elected or selected to represent them in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> That is democracy as I see it.  I am surprised that, in so far as what is proposed here takes that away from this House, Deputy Prendergast could claim a great day for democracy.  We are the people who are responsible.  We are the people who are not protected by any unfair dismissals, not protected by any special redundancy payments, who must go out and meet the tribunal, often at a day's notice and give an account, if we have not already done so, of our stewardship, and the public have the right and the responsibility to dismiss us.  There is no better system that I know of.  We can go to other countries where that system of democracy does not obtain and where there is something which borders on this, where the dictator nominates certain people to make certain selections for him and those people will act ostensibly <i>pro bono publico</i> but we all know that they act to the dictates and requirements, expressed in one fashion or another, of the commissar.</P>
    <P>What do we advocate here?  Other Deputies and I have for the last two months been expressing in the corridors and elsewhere certain concern for our profession.  I have said on other platforms that I had the privilege and honour of being a civil servant, a school teacher and a headmaster and been associated with people who had callings in the same direction.  I have met as high, and possibly a higher, standard of integrity, honesty and behaviour among politicians than I have met elsewhere and I will retain my concern for the good name of politicians whether it is the Minister, Deputy Spring, Deputy Prendergast or Deputy Brian Lenihan until such time as I discover that any one has been guilty of something which does not warrant my confidence in him or her.  The Chair will appreciate it if in the matter of those listed, I now include a lady from both sides of the House and I select the Minister, Deputy Nuala Fennell and Deputy Eileen Lemass.  Why is it that we here now publicise that we should no longer have faith in ourselves?  Tá seanfhocal sa Ghaeilge: Is olc an t-éan a shalaíonn a nead féin.  That is as pertinent to us here <Col N="846" /> and our profession as it is to the feathered flock.</P>
    <P>If there are people among us who are abusing rights, responsibilities, powers or authorities, why do we not apply ourselves to having them removed from our midst?  Why should we destroy &mdash; I am again basing my comments here on the case made on that side of the House &mdash; what is vital, what is in the interests and tradition of what is best in democracy, as we know it, because we fear Deputy Prendergast's rumour: &ldquo;It is said that because someone is in there from Fianna Fáil you may not trust him on that board&rdquo;.  We give the converse of that.  He and Deputy McLoughlin, if you read their contributions, &mdash; and here I throw in Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Mac Giolla on television last night &mdash; interpret this legislation as being about getting rid of Fianna Fáil political influence.</P>

      <P>Fan go fóill.  I did not hear the Deputy mention Fine Gael or Labour so he will forgive me if I read it into his mind.  Because of what people think about Fianna Fáil this is necessary. Do we take it then that in respect of the new board, if it can be said of any man or woman, however efficient or competent, they have the taint of Fianna Fáil on them, they may not serve?  Do we take it it is proposed to have nobody with any connection direct or indirect with politicians? Do we take it nobody of that kind will serve?  How, in the name of heaven, is the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and his able junior Minister, assisted by their other servants, going to stretch out into the recesses of Irish society and get that peculiar being who is interested in politics &mdash; because if he is not interested he is not interested in the life of Ireland &mdash; but who has no interest whatsoever in any political party?  That is what this Bill claims it will do and that is what Deputy Prendergast and Deputy McLoughlin know it cannot do.  If they were honest and said to me that this Bill was about a new day that has dawned, Fine Gael and Labour have come into power, they are <Col N="847" /> entitled to have what used to be said here some time ago by an esteemed politician &ldquo;their hands on the loot&rdquo; and they can appoint their men or women.</P>

      <P>Consistency is what I am endeavouring to establish.  I will have no objection whatsoever to the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, coming in here and saying: &ldquo;I, as the person now on whom the responsibility lies, who has the authority and the power, propose appointing a new board and putting on it people who in my opinion are less addicted to Fianna Fáil and more neutral in the matter of politics and I am selecting them&rdquo;.  That is what he is going to do but he gives to it a facade that will, he thinks, satisfy rumour and duirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In endeavouring to demonstrate that, I am referring to how he proposes having these people selected.  Remember, all these people will not have the stain of political sin on them.  One will come from the professional classes.  What professions? Will it be an architect who may happen to know the Minister of State? Will it be a lawyer who perchance knows the Tánaiste?  Will it be an engineer who knows some other member of the Government?  Will it be a doctor?  The term professional people covers a very wide spectrum.  How will they carry out the inquisition to establish that it can never be imputed to him that he ever blemished his good name by having an association with Fine Gael, or Labour, <Col N="848" /> or The Workers' Party, or Fianna Fáil? Listening to Deputies who spoke before me, that is what must be removed from anyone serving on the board.  Deputies Prendergast and McLoughlin advocated this.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the fact that it was a former Member of the House, Mr. Tully, who established this board. As regards one appointment, the person was not selected because of his profession, interest in environmental or community development but rather he was appointed because the Minister at the time found in him a man who would represent the views of non-professional people.  I was a Member of the House and did not criticise the right of the Minister to appoint somebody who had an association with the Minister or the Labour Party in Navan.  To me he was an intelligent, respectable man and his political leanings were immaterial to me. While acting as a member of the board he made a contribution equal to that of anyone else.  If I had heard otherwise I would have informed the Minister.</P>
    <P>As regards the present members, Deputy McLoughlin excluded one of them from criticism.  He is a neighbour of mine and an engineer.  I do not know his party politics nor have I any wish to.  I have good friends who support Fine Gael and Labour.  That is immaterial.  It is what we do that is important.  To suggest that the board cannot be trusted, that there have been backhanders, that something was done which should not have been done or to suggest that by changing the personalities on the board we would automatically remove human frailties is hypocritical.</P>
    <P>The selection committee in their search for a suitable person must be aware that if a person has any political association he cannot be considered.  One group is the environmental group.  I an am environmentalist. Part of my responsibility is to have concern for the environment. Deputy Skelly spoke of his concern for the environment although he localised in so far as his concern was that there was a dump in front of his house.  There is another dump in part of the Deputy's <Col N="849" /> constituency in west Finglas which I would be glad to discover&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not credit the Deputy with ownership but with living there.  I envy him because it is a nice place to live.  If anyone cares to get a copy of the debate on the legislation dealing with the pro-life amendment they will see that Deputy Quinn and others on that side were very critical of a situation where a group of non-elected people would dare advocate anything to the country.  We were sitting, perhaps correctly, on a pedestal which says that elected people only should have that right.  Deputy Quinn was most vociferous in attacking any group which would dare work outside in pursuit of any legitimate exercise. Deputy Shatter made the case that they should not have the right.  Who were they to have a right?  I am sure I will listen to Deputy Shatter make a massive case for the involvement of an non-elected group to select people who will be qualified to serve on what is accepted on all sides as one of our most important boards.  How it fits, níl a fhios agam.  How he can wear one coat and while wearing it seem to pursue a line of democracy which disappears on the morrow is something I cannot understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Skelly said what he believed. He did not impress all his listeners.  I will not criticise him except to say that in so far as he was disrespectful to elected representatives I thought he was most unfair, unreasonable, illogical and undemocratic. The environmental group, whoever they may be, were not told that this legislation was being sold to us.  You buy it and the ghost of these organisations will come later on, look for powers of nomination and the Minister will accept <Col N="850" /> them.  This House will not have an opportunity of saying whether they should have the right to accept them or not.</P>
    <P>There will be a development group who will have power to nominate.  The Minister did not say who they are.  What groups are they?  Are we as politicians not concerned?  Have we no responsibility, powers or authority in the matter of development?  What development is it? Is it the development of Fine Gael or Labour?</P>
    <P>The last group are those interested in the community.  There is an inference there that elected representatives do not have an interest in the community or in development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I should be afraid or complimented but I will proceed.  I appeal to the House to consider the essence of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa's esteemed President went on TV last night and said that the interest Fianna Fáil had was to have friends in court who would help them to get planning permissions through An Bord Pleanála.  I resent and reject that and I am asking Deputy MacGiolla, when he makes his contribution, to exclude me and everybody else on this side, unless he has evidence.  When Deputy Quinn, the Minister of State, was a fellow member of mine on the planning committee of Dublin Corporation he declared an interest.  I am declaring no interest in what Deputy MacGiolla has said.  If he knows some member of this party who has an interest let him name that member here, but let him not engage in insinuations against all on this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The moment this new board have been established, consisting of people who are amenable to the ideologies of their good <Col N="851" /> friends in Labour or Fine Gael, similar charges will go across.  It would be highly useless to go searching for people, innocents abroad in the life of Ireland today, who would have no association with political parties.  I would go further and defy anybody here to go out into the community to get five people who would say they did not have an interest in Labour, or Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, or in The Workers' Party.  If they did not have such an interest they would not be fit to be on this board.  They would not know their business if they had gone through life without having made a decision about which party they think is the best one and without deciding to make one party act as an antidote to the rest of us.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister appoint his own people.  I will concede to him, as the elected Tánaiste, the right to appoint people who in his opinion are fit to serve on the board.  I would regret that he would be setting a precedent so that on the next change of Government, perhaps in a year or two or five years, there would be a Tánaiste who would be acting on precedent when he did the same thing.  It should be borne in mind in respect of appointments made by the Minister for Local Government, James Tully, that when the subsequent Fianna Fáil Government took over they did not jettison Deputy Tully's friend from Navan, Mr. McFadden, who later went to Offaly. Fianna Fáil retained those people for the duration of their appointments.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the sense of fair play Deputy Prendergast displayed before he rushed in here lending his name to this legislation.  He said he had not evidence of there being one thing against any member of An Bord Pleanála.  However, he is now prepared to lend his name to this.  I never had any responsibility for trade unionism.  I was a member of the Civil Service Clerical Officers' Association and of the TUI.  Apart from that, in my leisure time I have been a member of rugby, soccer and GAA teams and of athletic clubs, and I would always defend my colleagues.  If I discovered one of my colleagues was not entitled to that defence I would jettison him, but I would <Col N="852" /> not throw insult at him until I would have evidence of whatever charges had been made against him.</P>
    <P>We live in times of jealousy.  People will say &ldquo;If you were on the board would you not do it?&rdquo;.  We are underestimating ourselves as politicians, and, as long as we retain the traditional aptitudes, we have some hope for democracy, when bringing in the Minister for the Environment or his junior Minister we can say to them: &ldquo;You appointed those people.  We have evidence they have been guilty of some impropriety in the carrying out of the duties entrusted to them by this legislation, and we ask you to get rid of them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation the Tánaiste and any future Minister for the Environment can say: &ldquo;That fellow was appointed because he claimed he had an interest in the environment.  That lady was appointed by some professional groups. That man was appointed by a group who had an interest in development.  That person was selected by groups who claimed to have an interest in the community&rdquo;. How silly and ridiculous can we get? Those groups are not responsible to anybody.  Deputy Prendergast and Deputy Skelly know that in Ireland to day you can get a group to establish themselves as, say, the Rathdown Residents' Association, as a group which have a greater interest than anybody else in the preservation of bird life, or any other sort of life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have friendship with several members of An Taisce to the extent that I know that politically they would not satisfy the requirements of this legislation.  They would be excluded because one of them happens to vote Labour and another lady votes Fine Gael.  You work down and get the lowest common denominator, the person who votes nothing.  Such a person has no great contribution to make to democracy.  If the Deputy has someone in mind and I discover he or she knows Deputy Skelly under this legislation I will be claiming he or she is not fit for appointment after <Col N="853" /> Deputy Skelly's contribution to this debate.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, I had what I regard as fruitful conversations affecting another area with my colleagues, the chairman of Fine Gael and the chairman of the Labour Party, having accepted that the good name and reputation of politicians was not what it should be.  We were hoping to discover some formulae through which that might be improved, after the introduction of this legislation and having listened to the contributions of my colleagues, the politicians, I would defend the right of any politician on any side of the House.  He or she represents a group of people in a certain constituency who sent him or her here as their messenger, as their leader, as their voice. He or she commands the respect which is vital in a democracy.  What is proposed in this Bill is another step in downgrading politicians.  I will not use the word depoliticise.</P>
      <P>I would gladly concede to Deputy Prendergast the right to appoint somebody if he were Minister.  He would not appoint anybody who had only one qualification, that of being a member of his party.  I credit him with having the decency, the honesty and the sense of responsibility to ensure that the person also had the qualities, qualifications and personality required to make the vital decisions which are the responsibility of An Bord Pleanála.  I do not know why he would take that away from the leader of his own party and apparently take pleasure in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind Deputy Prendergast that his leader and others are on record as not having too much respect for people who are not elected. I refer to contributions made in the debate on the Bill to amend the Constitution. They had quite substantial backing from people outside the House.  I hope that view will be equally critical of something which is very vital and has to do with the making of millions as a result <Col N="854" /> of the rezoning of land.  According to what I hear people can become millionaires overnight.</P>
      <P>All these decisions are now being made the responsibility of people who never offered themselves for election to anything other than committees of their own associations.  There might be only six of them.  We do not know what qualifications they have.  The Minister did not tell us.  Is this the facade?  Is this the veneer? He does not have to put any veneer on it for me if he comes out and says boldly that he is doing it.  That is his entitlement. He should be honest.</P>
      <P>It is not enough for him to say: &ldquo;This is about Fianna Fáil hacks who are on An Bord Pleanála who are building up every member of the Fianna Fáil Party and who are swinging decisions&rdquo;.  I move about in the same areas as everybody else.  The only critism offered of An Bord Pleanála in my constituency is that they are dilatory, that people are awaiting decisions for weeks and months.  Deputy Prendergast made the point that that is not desirable, especially in the establishment of industries and the provision of employment.</P>
      <P>How will the Minister expedite decisions with his new formula?  There will be fewer members and there is an embargo on appointments in his Department.  He says he will expedite decisions.  The magic wand will change everything.  I do not know whether this matter was discussed by the respective parties and whether these questions were asked.  I am differentiating between that and telling Deputies: &ldquo;Go in there and save the party lads. Have a go at Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  There is more to this than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I am disappointed in Deputy Prendergast.  If I have succeeded in sewing one iota of doubt in his mind that his contribution lacked the normal comprehension I have come to expect from him, I hope he will apply himself in greater detail to the terms of this Bill.  I hope he will weigh carefully all the considerations and accept the reality, which is not the downgrading of Fianna Fáil or the friends or members of Fianna Fáil on An Bord Pleanála, but the downgrading of the rights, responsibilities and democratic <Col N="855" /> obligations of Deputy Prendergast and everybody else in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy in all the debate which has taken place yesterday and today to forget the reason why this Bill is before the House and the <i>rationale</i> behind it.  Until the Planning Act, 1976, was enacted, planning appeals from local authorities were dealt with by the Minister of the day.  They were dealt with by different Ministers in different Governments.</P>
      <P>During that period when these appeals were dealt with by way of ministerial decisions there was a growing public perception that in some way there was political interference in the planning process and that appeals were being decided or determined on grounds other than objective planning criteria.  I have no knowledge or inside information relating to that period to show whether or not that was an accurate interpretation of what was happening.  Prior to 1976 there was a very real and growing perception that this was the case, that objective planning criteria were not being applied in determining appeals on planning applications at ministerial level, and that they were subject to political influence and political interference.</P>
      <P>As a result the legislation in 1976 made provision for the establishment of An Bord Pleanála.  The theory behind the board was to ensure that the appellant procedures in the area of planning were distanced from the political process. They were seen to be isolated to a great extent from ministerial interference by the establishment of an independent board whose decisions could not and would not be affected by ministerial or political influence of any nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years after An Bord Pleanála was established the public perception of the board was that it was achieving that purpose, that it was comprised of independent individuals who were applying the provisions of the Planning Act in determining appeals.  Unfortunately the perception has changed over the past three years.  I have no information before me, just as I have no information <Col N="856" /> relating to the period prior to 1976, on which I can base any allegation that An Bord Pleanála at any stage made any decisions which were influenced by the political allegiances of members of the board.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that in the past three years, for whatever reason, there has been an ever-growing public perception such as existed prior to 1976, that in some way An Bord Pleanála has been politicised and that the independence of approach in the planning appeals process, which was seen by the general public to have been inaugurated after the passing of the 1976 legislation, has now been lost.  The public perception is now, as it was prior to 1976, that in some way or other there is political influence or interference involved in the decision-making process of the board.  I have no evidence Bord Pleanála since its inception and in recent years, that there has been such a political input, but the public perception that has developed in this area has resulted from the behaviour of Members of this House and the behaviour of Government.  In circumstances that were permitted by the legislation and circumstances that I believe are inappropriate, the Government have made appointments to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>The first occasion on which public concern was expressed about An Bord Pleanála and the possibilities of political interference with the board arose following appointments that were made to the board on 29 June 1981 by the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government.  Three members were appointed to the board on 29 June 1981 approximately, one day before the Coalition Government which won the June 1981 election took office.  I would not suggest that any of the three people appointed on that day did not necessarily have the qualifications to be members of An Bord Pleanála.  It may be that they were particularly qualified.  I simply do not know.  The problem is the public perception is that if Governments, on the day before they go out of office, start making appointments to bodies of this nature, there must be some political <Col N="857" /> reasons for doing so.  There is the start of the blame.  There is where lies the beginning of the public perception that An Bord Pleanála in some ways is not a body that makes decisions on objective planning criteria but that there is political interference in decision-making.  That public suspicion was bred by those appointments.</P>
    <P>If that was the only occasion on which appointments of that nature were made, the public worries about the politicisng of the board might have dissipated.  What did we again see?  On the 8 December 1982 we saw two further appointments made to An Bord Pleanála approximately three days before the then Fianna Fáil Government went out of office.  On two occasions within a period of less than 18 months two Fianna Fáil Governments leaving office managed to appoint five members to An Bord Pleanála.  The appointments on the 8 December 1982 were not required.  They were not necessitated by the retirement of any members from the board.  They resulted simply in an increased membership of the board. Those appointments led to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 11 December 1982 the contents of which have never been denied by the then Minister responsible for making the appointments.  <i>The Irish Times</i> in an article headed: &ldquo;Burke to appoint 3 board members&rdquo; said:</P>
    <P>Two more political appointments are being made to An Bord Pleanála, the highly sensitive planning appeals board.</P>
    <P>After referring to Mr. Justice Murnaghan's appointment as Chairman &mdash; and they certainly do not suggest that that was a political appointment &mdash; they go on to say:</P>
    <P>The two political appointments to the planning board at salaries of £17,000 a year &mdash; are being made by the outgoing Minister for the Environment, Mr. Burke.  One of the appointees is believed to be a Mr. Tony Lambert, a former salesman, who was brought into Mr. Burke's office last March to deal with his constituency work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> The other appointee is believed to have served as director of elections for Fianna Fáil in the recent general election.</P>
    <P>The name of the other appointee is also referred to in the article.  He was one Mr. Patrick Malone.</P>
    <P>It is that behaviour that has led to the public perception that An Bord Pleanála has been politicised.  Let us not mince words.  No outgoing Government should be in a position to make appointments of this nature or should seek to do so.  I would extend that comment to all Governments of all parties.  I am not claiming my own party over the years is in some way immune from criticism in this area or that we live in an atmosphere of political chastity.  We have been guilty. My own party has been guilty in years gone by of behavious that I certainly would not stand over as a Member of this House in other areas of appointments made.</P>
    <P>There were appointments made when the Coalition Government went out of office in 1977 which should not have been made.  That does not mean we go on with the system of political patronage.  There is a time when it has to be stopped.  There is a time when the public will not stand for it any longer and An Bord Pleanála, I would hope, is the first area in which we will introduce reforms of this nature. There is no doubt that the public perception as a result of the appointments made by the two outgoing Fianna Fáil Governments in 1981 and 1982 was that An Bord Pleanála had been politicised to a degree that was unacceptable.</P>
    <P>This legislation is to be welcomed in that it will mean that the board can no longer be the plaything of politicians who lose office.  It will mean that there are independent criteria upon which appointments are made to the board.  The membership of the board is delimited.  The selection of the chairman of the board is left to be made effectively by a group of people whose independence could not possibly be impugned.  The speaker prior to me tried to make fun of the criteria laid down for the selection committee for other members of the board.  This selection <Col N="859" /> committee is to be formed from various bodies whose terms are defined to a far greater degree than Deputy Tunney was prepared to state and are now clearly defined under section 7 of the Bill.  When these bodies are selected this House will have an opportunity to indicate approval or disapproval because a ministerial order must be laid before this House.  A motion can be proposed on foot of this order not to accept nominating bodies proposed by the Minister.  This House does retain its democratic control but once the nominating bodies are accepted and the board is appointed it is immune from the type of political interference in the area of appointees that we have seen on the part of two successive Fianna Fáil Governments in a short span of time.</P>
    <P>That is welcomed by the vast majority of people outside this House.  I find it quite extraordinary that Members of the Fianna Fáil Party should be fighting tooth and nail and should create the type of scenes we saw in the House yesterday evening so as to ensure that at some later stage, before appointments are made to An Bord Pleanála, if and when they ever return to Government, they first of all can determine a person's qualifications to be appointed to the board by examining their political pedigree first.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney seemed to think it would be an outrage to appoint members to An Bord Pleanála who have not yet theologically committed themselves to one of the four political parties represented in this House.  It may surprise him to know that there are many people who are no longer theologically committed to any party in this house and who, viewing the behaviour in this House yesterday, probably want to distance themselves even further from all of us.</P>
    <P>The provisions in this legislation will copperfasten the independence of An Bord Pleanála and will ensure that the board cannot be puffed up by the imposition of additional members by any Minister at any time, no matter what the circumstances.  It will do something which is badly needed: it will streamline the operations of the board and speed up the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> It was suggested by Fianna Fáil Members that this legislation was unnecessary and that nobody wanted it.  That is blatantly untrue.  There are something like 3,600 decisions pending before An Bord Pleanála at the moment.  The construction industry is crying out for more efficient procedures in determining appeals. There are many building projects which could provide much needed employment being held up because of the slowness of the decision-making process of that board.  On a smaller scale there are many small domestic projects which are held up by the extraordinary length of time it takes for An Bord Pleanála to make any decision.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of ensuring that there is no public suspicion about the manner in which planning appeals are dealt with, and to ensure that the public are properly satisfied that in determining appeals objective planning criteria are applied and that there is no political involvement, the establishment of the new board under this legislation is, I believe, an urgent necessity.  The new streamlined procedures provided for dealing with appeals under this Bill will provide a great deal of relief for many people and will be welcomed.  To that extent these measures are urgent.</P>
    <P>Both the speeches made yesterday and the behaviour of the Fianna Fáil Members did no credit to this House.  All that achieved was a further public view that Members appeared to be acting on the stage in the Gaiety Theatre rather than performing the function of legislators. The hysterics, shouting and walking out we saw yesterday by the party which feel there may not be sufficient time to debate this legislation, who are constantly calling for quorums, whose members deserted the benches and were not prepared to listen even to the speech made by their party spokesman on this legislation, this behaviour led to a demeaning of politicians. I heard Deputy Tunney waxing lyrical about this.  It is that type of behaviour which demeans politicians, which causes a loss of respect for politicians and which has led people to believe that Deputies are incapable of doing the job for which they were elected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> When I was first elected to this House, having studied law I was led to believe that the term &ldquo;political asylum&rdquo; was a term in the area of international law. Yesterday's performance gave the concept of &ldquo;political asylum&rdquo; a new meaning. The only difference between the political asylum the Opposition Party sought to turn this House into yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the context of the contributions made by Fianna Fáil Deputies yesterday I want to refer to one point which was repeated many times.  Deputy Molloy wept crocodile tears because this legislation is before the House but we do not have legislation to set up badly <Col N="862" /> needed rent tribunals.  That type of approach from that party is the ultimate in political cynicism.  When this House was debating the legislation to tackle the problem of rent restricted dwellings and the means of assessing new rents for persons living in rent restricted dwellings as a result of the Supreme Court decision, Fianna Fáil specifically refused to provide legislation setting up rents tribunals.  It was Fianna Fáil who published the original legislation and provided for all these matters to be dealt with by the district courts.  When this legislation was being debated here my colleagues and I pointed out all the problems that would arise in the implementation of that legislation, all the fears and worries of the many elderly people living in what were rent restricted dwellings and all the problems that would be created for them by the district courts dealing with this area.  On Committee Stage we tabled an amendment which provided comprehensive provisions for the establishment of rent tribunals.  I am intimately aware of what happened because I was one of those involved in drawing up the amendments to set up the rents tribunals.  I was in this House all day debating the need for rents tribunals. What happened?  Fianna Fáil did not want rent tribunals because they were unnecessary.  They said they were going to appoint a series of additional district justices to tackle this problem.  We were told the district courts were well able to deal with this problem.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear there is no sincerity of any nature whatsoever in the <Col N="863" /> approach of the Deputies opposite.  If there had been, rent tribunals would have been established by now and would have been part and parcel of the original legislation. The Fianna Fáil Party are responsible for all the misery and distress being caused to elderly people throughout this country who are now finding themselves for the first time in their lives before District Courts trying to have determined how much rent they should pay to landlords for properties in which they have lived for decades.  It is the ultimate in political cynicism to have Members opposite weeping crocodile tears on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little point in regurgitating many of the arguments which have taken place in this House, but I wish to return to the amendment which the party opposite have submitted.  In seeking to refuse the Second Reading of this Bill, their first ground is that the Second Reading of this Bill &mdash; presumably its passage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>...will seriously undermine the existing procedures for physical planning in this Country.</P>
      <P>That simply does not make sense.  There is nothing in this Bill which would in any way undermine any of the procedures for physical planning in this country.  All that this Bill is concerned with is ensuring that the independence of An Bord Pleanála is preserved.  Indeed, it would improve the process of procedures for physical planning by speeding up the appellant procedures. There is no logic in that objection.</P>
      <P>The next objection is that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>It will have serious repercussions on the standing, prestige and effectiveness of Government Boards and State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not make any sense, either.  I do not see how ensuring that a body like An Bord Pleanála is protected from political interference and from any party when <Col N="864" /> in Government putting their supporters into it as members jeopardises the standing and prestige of Government boards and State-sponsored bodies.  It is this type of legislation which can only enhance the prestige of Government boards and State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>The third objection stated is that in some way</P>
    <P>It pre-empts the deliberations of the Joint Committee on Building Land...</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Molloy saw fit to try to score some political points by introducing that as an objection, particularly as he is chairman of the Joint Committee on Building Land.  He knows as well as I do that in no way does this legislation affect or pre-empt any decisions of any nature which need to be made by the Joint Committee on Building Land.  It is entirely irrelevant to their deliberations.  The only portion of this Bill which could be in some way relevant are those aspects of the Bill which will speed up the appellant procedures and nobody could suggest that that is not a desirable result to achieve.  Certainly it is not likely, on any conceivable view of what the Joint Committee on Building Land might decide, that they are going to produce a recommendation to suggest that in future planning appeals should take far longer than they do at the moment.</P>
    <P>The objections raised in the amendment proposed by the Fianna Fáil Party to this legislation have no logical basis or relevance of any nature whatsoever.  This spurious argument which the Fianna Fáil Party have produced, the crocodile tears which have been shed suggesting that varieties of other areas have greater priority &mdash; areas all of which they themselves ignored &mdash; are an indication of the political cynicism of the party opposite in their rush, in particular in the context of rent tribunals, into this House to say anything, whatever is appropriate on any issue, even if it is the opposite of what they were saying in this House less than 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>That sort of approach no longer convinces the people outside this House and only results in this House being seen by <Col N="865" /> many of those who are not Members of it to be increasingly irrelevant in our legislative and governmental processes.  It would have been a far more sensible political approach for the Fianna Fáil Party to have welcomed this Bill and applauded the fact that the provisions in it ensure that the planning process, in the context of planning appeals, will no longer be open to the charge of political interference.  If the Members opposite are really serious about the other issues which they say have priority &mdash; and many of which I agree have priority, should be dealt with by this House and should have been tackled many years ago but never have been &mdash; they could have supported this legislation.  This Second Stage debate could have finished last night and the Bill could have seen its way through and out of this House well before the end of this week, to give Deputies an opportunity to tackle some of the other issues about which some of the Deputies opposite are so theoretically concerned.  But they showed no evidence of that concern during their period in office from March 1982 to November 1982.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt at all but that many of the Members on the other side of the House were reluctant to support the introduction of this Bill in the first instance.  We have no doubt but that it was brought before the House without getting any kind of clearance whatsoever from any of the major political parties making up the Coalition.  With such a shortage of legislation on the Government stocks at this time it was necessary to have a filler, as was earlier suggested, brought in here which would tie up the House for a considerable period of time, thereby giving some credit to the oftmentioned phrase of the Coalition Government that they would like to have a long run up to the recess and perhaps take this House late into July before closing down for the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt but that that is the reason this legislation has found its way into the House at this time.  It was found necessary to give 20½ hours and to offer a further five hours so that the time of the House would be taken up, thereby reducing <Col N="866" /> the amount of time which might be spent next week on the Adjournment Debate.  It is geared in that fashion so as to divert the attention of the Deputies and &mdash; worse still &mdash; of the general public outside away from matters of considerable importance to all and sundry outside this House, namely, wage agreements, public pay and the question of unemployment, to which the Government have not addressed themselves at all in this session of the House.</P>
    <P>We must oppose this legislation because it is fundamentally wrong and runs contrary to the traditions of this House going back to the foundation of this State.  It also runs contrary to the tradition as applied by the main Government party in their activities over the years.  There are quite a number of Fine Gael backbench Deputies &mdash; not so many from the Labour Party because there are not so many of them on the backbenches of the Labour Party, having almost all been successfully accommodated either here or abroad &mdash; who were totally unaware that this legislation was being promoted in this way, did not know what the provisions of the legislation were and what the implications and ramifications of that legislation might subsequently be. Like good party supporters and foot sloggers in the party interest, they will troop in behind their part-time Tánaiste, Tánaiste for the time being until the time can arrive when the major political party of the Coalition Government can ditch the Labour Party and do the job on their own.  They will troop in and put this legislation through the House by force of numbers.  It is not being done with a full heart and the full support and goodwill of their own party.</P>
    <P>It is as well that that be put on the record.  While we must take this stand it is necessary to point out to the general public that this Bill is being moved without any conviction whatsoever.  In case anybody is carried away by the fact that Deputy Shatter and his like come in supporting and promoting this legislation, one should begin to wonder about which party Deputy Shatter ought to belong to in this House.  He certainly takes an anti-conservative stance on most issues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> In fact, it is hard to understand how he finds a peaceful home in Fine Gael.  He would be better accommodated in the Labour Party, but of course it would not perhaps offer the best chance of personal aggrandizement for him in the hopes which he has entertained for so long of making it up the political ladder in the shortest possible time by joining Fine Gael because nobody else would have him.</P>
    <P>Perhaps his ideas, tendencies and attitude of mind suggest that he would be better placed with the Labour Party.  If Deputies Prendergast and McLoughlin and others like them could suffer his eternal interfering with their socialist ideas perhaps they could accommodate him in the party.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was not moved with any conviction.  Perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment is the person most responsible for its promotion but he did not impress either.  There was no indication of any commitment of purpose or of any dedication to the job on hand either by the Minister or by his Minister of State.  If this was such an important matter as to have to be rushed with indecent haste through the House before the summer recess, one would at least have expected the Minister to go to considerable lengths to convince the House and, more importantly, the general public of the great need for this legislation, but they failed to do so and were taken aback somewhat by our total rejection of the Bill.  Now they are whimpering and alleging that they are not getting fair play from this side.  Deputy Shatter suggests that we belong in a different institution.  I would remind the Deputy that he also is a Member of this institution and that any reflection he might make on it is a reflection on himself.  His comment is what leads to the cynicism that he so quickly refers to at every available opportunity.  The kind of comment he made, and in respect of which the Chair rightly had to take him <Col N="868" /> to task, is what brings a certain amount of discredit to the House and gives a bad impression to the general public so far as the workings of the House are concerned.</P>
      <P>We had an extraordinary speech from the Minister in introducing the Second Stage of the Bill.  It was extraordinary in its content, in the terms of the latitude taken and also in the carelessness of phrase in dealing with individuals and institutions.  The speech was full of innuendo and ambiguity and was not deserving of the Minister's efforts.  Normally, we would expect him to put together a good package in trying to sell something that he was convinced should be on the Statute Book.  His speech has led me to suspect that the heave was coming through the Minister and through his Minister of State from some other source and that the Minister's heart was not fully in the Bill.  The type of Second Stage speech to which we had to listen yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;represents the cavalier attitude of the Coalition to all types of legislation during the past few months.  It represents the cavalier fashion in which they are dealing with tradition in the House and, so far as this legislation is concerned, the tradition of the making of appointments to high office and to the accepted procedures and practices that have been part of this House for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech contained vague suggestions about decisions that might be taken in the future.  There were unclear references throughout the speech.  It is no more than a plethora of slurs and half remarks of a semi-derogratory nature about people who down through the years have served this State and its institutions. That sort of speech would almost lead one to believe that this is a vindictive piece of legislation.  One could almost go so far as to say that it is a punishmenttype of legislation and that the punishment had to be handed out to Fianna Fáil.  It would seem to be a question of <Col N="869" /> the Government saying to us that they will get their own back by way of legislation from now on.</P>
    <P>Is it because there is some organisation or group of people who are pressing the Labour Party to promote this type of legislation that the Bill is before us?  What is the reason for the Labour Party being prepared to go so far as to suggest that some of the people serving in high office are either incompetent or unprofessional or do not have the capacity to do what is demanded of them?  This has become a new feature of Labour Party tactics but I can see the reason for it.  They are locked in Government into the most anti-labour, anti-social and anti-working class measures that have ever been brought in against the Irish people.  They are locked into a package that they cannot get out of.  Perhaps I will remove the smile from the Tánaiste's face when I tell him that recently his new leader, the Taoiseach, remarked to a backbench Fine Gael Deputy, &ldquo;It does not matter what the Labour Party want or do not want; they cannot get out; they are locked in with us&rdquo;.  That is the reason this piece of legislation and others like it are being brought forward.  They are intended to direct the minds of the people away from those matters that concern them mostly at this time &mdash; unemployment, pay and the lack of social welfare benefits to meet the rising cost of living. These are the issues with which Labour should be concerned, but instead their alternative is to bring forward issues which are on the verge of liberalism. They are doing this in an effort to hold on to the sliding Labour vote.  That is why, too, that once in a while it is necessary for the Tánaiste to break loose from the shackles of the Taoiseach and to make reference either to abortion or to divorce or to something of that nature.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste is trying to keep the socialist attitude of Labour separate from the attitudes of their masters, Fine Gael.  Once something is said by the Tánaiste, it will be handed down as representing <Col N="870" /> his personal attitude and subsequently his new master will state that the matter is a personal one for the Tánaiste and that it will be discussed further at parliamentary level when the Government get around to thinking about it.  In the meantime, the Tánaiste's attitude is helping to keep the Labour Party independent and well left of the arch conservatives in Fine Gael.  Apart from the fact that the Government have no other legislation to bring forward at this time, that is one of the reasons for this Bill being before us now.  It is being put in as a filler so that we might not have a suitably long adjournment debate next week when we could decry the lack of effort on the part of the Government on a whole range of questions that are vastly more important for the people at this time.</P>
      <P>It is a piece of political Labour Party skullduggery as far as I am concerned and it will certainly bring down the Labour Party the next time they present themselves for election.  The Tánaiste's speech was quite amazing in many ways.  Here I want to emphasise something I said earlier. The Second Stage speech of a Minister is the considered opinion of the particular Minister and his Government.  It represents the basic view of the Government. The Minister's speech represents the Government's attitude.  In paragraph 2 the Minister said:</P>
      <P>On assuming office, I decided to press ahead with the general review of planning law....  However it quickly became apparent that the problem of delays in determining planning appeals and the growing backlog of appeals required urgent consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It became apparent to the Minister, seemingly for the first time, that there was a problem of delays in An Bord Pleanála.  What is new about that?  He went on to say that it became evident to him that there was increasing public concern about appointments to An Bord Pleanála.  These are rather strange statements in a Second Stage speech.  What evidence was brought to his attention? When he became aware did he call his officials together and ask them to do <Col N="871" /> something about it?  He became increasingly aware of public disquiet about public appointments to the board.  The delays were and are common knowledge.  I put it to the Minister that he was not made more aware about public disquiet but rather that he had to fulfil a base promise given to a section of his own party and he was trying to satisfy them that he was going to carry out reforms irrespective of whether or not the Fine Gael Party liked it.  It is well known in the corridors of this House that he did not have the support of some of the right wing members in the Fine Gael Party for this Bill.</P>
    <P>Later in that same paragraph he says he &ldquo;had no option but to decide that the review of planning law should focus attention initially on possible improvements in the method of appointment of members of the Board&rdquo;.  Now which were the more important?  The appointment of the members or the delays.  Which of the two would be of greater interest and greater concern to the public generally? Is it not the delays?  Does the Minister apply himself to the problems of delays? Not on your nanny.  He decides to deal with the appointments.  A diversionary tactic to get the greatest mileage possible in the public press, something to boost the falling spirits and falling votes of the Labour Party.  No reference to unemployment or pay or anything else.  No reference to rising prices and strikes.  The whole idea is to tie up the House between now and the recess so that there will only be a short adjournment debate in which there will not be time to castigate the Government as they should be castigated for their lack of policy and their lack of effort on these fundamental issues.  They will head then for Barresttstown Castle and there put together a package of anti-social and anti-traditional Labour Party policy.  That is what is wrong.  The Labour Party have sold their soul for a few State cars and the House will go into recess without having had an opportunity of discussing all the problems that should be discussed.  Again later the Minister said, speaking of An Bord Pleanála:</P>
    <P>In its early years, the new board <Col N="872" /> seems to have been reasonably successful in establishing for itself in the public mind the kind of independent image which is so necessary if decisions of the board are to be accepted.</P>
    <P>Then in 1976 a new Act was passed and the Minister is concerned that it did not go far enough to achieve its objective.  He said that in particular it left the appointment of ordinary members solely in the hands of the Minister.  This is all very important when we reflect on the two major items that struck the Minister on assuming office, the appointments and the delays.  The bulk of the speech, as to 90 per cent of it, is concerned with appointments.  Now the Minister's only concern here is the sacking of officials. That is what the Minister is about.  But this is not in the tradition of the Labour Party.  It is not the policy of the trade unions.  They would be anti-sacking anybody. The Minister is putting forward a new tactic so far as socialism is concerned: if one does not like the colour or the way one votes, the sack is the answer. That is the solution so far as the Tánaiste is concerned.</P>
    <P>Saying that the 1976 Act did not go far enough to achieve its objectives is casting a slur on the members of the board.  It suggests that they were not suitable and neither were they qualified.  The reason why they were neither suitable nor qualified is apparently because they were appointed by Fianna Fáil.  Later he said that the way in which the power had been used in recent times by the board had led to a widespread diminution in public confidence. Because, according to the Minister, the board were not using their powers in a particular way, they were incompetent.  But he suggests that he is not implying anything or making any reflection on the character or persons of the people appointed.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister read his script?  What else is he doing in virtually every page except reflecting on their competence and capacity to do the job properly?  If they were doing their job competently there would be no need to sack them.  The Minister implies that they are incompetent <Col N="873" /> and that is the reason why he is getting rid of them.  They were appointed by a Government of which he was not a part.  He is very concerned about the appointments.  That leads me to believe this Bill would not have been introduced at all were it not for the fact that it was the timing of the appointments that upset the Minister most.  He is concerned about the number of delays.  They increased over the years.  But his major concern is with the appointments to the board.  He is concerned because the board increased in number.  He will change all that.  He tried to relate the increased membership of the board to the increased number of delays.  I am sure it will be interpreted in the High Court subsequent to the Bill going on the Statute Book that the people appointed in the last few years were somehow responsible for the increase in the number of delays.  I am sure someone outside of this House will have something to say about that.</P>
    <P>What steps did the Minister take when he became aware of the delays?  Did he call in the board or the chairman to discuss the reason for the delays?  Did he ask the chairman if he had some problem with the appointments made by the previous Government?  Did he ask him if there was a relationship between the increased number of delays and the people appointed in the last 18 months? Did he get a written submission from the chairman?  Was it requested?  There is no suggestion in the Minister's statement that he sought, either orally or in written form, any submission from the board which suggests that it never entered his head to seek a remedy for the delays.  All he had in his mind was to get rid of the appointments made by Fianna Fáil.  We would have expected a Labour Minister concerned about employment and a person's right to hold a job until he is proven guilty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One is considered innocent until proven guilty.  It would be interesting if the Minister indicated to the House <Col N="874" /> the steps he took to deal with the events which became evident to him.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that the delays have caused difficulties.  I agree with that. Enormous sums of money have been lost, some indefinitely and some for shortterms. It all results in escalating costs for the developer.  The Minister is concerned that there should be a speedy result to the appeals before the board, and rightly so.  In the Minister's speech he said that the delays involved in the release of employment generating projects lengthened and caused him considerable concern. That leads me to wonder if he is guilty of using political influence with the existing board in suggesting that there is only one result to the appeals which would satisfy him and that is a positive result for the developer.  Is he suggesting that appeals should not be upheld and that he wants them to release willy-nilly all the outstanding appeals so as to enable what he considers to be much-needed employment to be created in the economy?</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the Minister paid any attention to what was written for him in his script.  His speech leads me to believe that there was only one instruction given to the officials in the Department. They were to divorce themselves from any problems in the board and were given a one sentence instruction &mdash; sack those Fianna Fáil hacks as quickly as possible and put a script in my hand that might make it seem plausible.</P>

      <P>I do not usually refer to a Minister's speech page by page because one can usually get the essence of his speech from the opening or closing remarks but this speech portrays a frame of mind which is very disturbing as regards his attitude to people.  In his speech the Minister referred to justice that might be seen to be done in the making of appointments from now on. He said they would not be based on political considerations.  I do not know what kind of world the Minister lives in or what kind of rarified air he breaths but I cannot see the justice in what he suggests we should do to people who are democratically and properly appointed to this board.</P>

      <P>There is no justice in it.

Whatever about the rarified air that often exists here I have yet to come across the type of atmosphere outside the House where we can get a truly non-political person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?  It is becoming virtually a crime to say one has a political affiliation and it is seen as making one unfit for high office.  That is the kind of <Col N="876" /> justice the Minister will apply &mdash; 1983 Labour style.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech will become prescribed reading for all kinds of political activists and those interested in political history: &ldquo;The board made good progress in the early years and then it declined.&rdquo; Wait for it &mdash; the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, those two hard working people in the past, dealt with the whole thing.  They only used a fraction of their valuable time.  At least I can say to the Minister that there is a veiled compliment there to a lot of good Fianna Fáil Ministers and their Parliamentary Secretaries. However, it was never intended and as far as I am concerned it was a direct assault on the individuals who are members of the board at present.  It is suggesting that members, because of their lack of attention to duty, their non-attendance to their office or because of their squandermania, somehow interfered with the process and caused the delays.  Unfortunately, in due course, subsequent to the passage of this legislation, I am sure the members of the board will defend themselves.  The chairman will defend his honour and good standing in the community over half a century which has been whittled away here by innuendo and ambiguity and half derogatory remarks about his lack of competence or capacity to deal either with the appeals before him or the administration of the board.  I am sure the inspectors will also take up the matter because they are the people who had to carry out the investigation work and prepare reports for the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister informed the House that the High Court judge or former judge will no longer be a suitable person and that his office will not be continued.  He suggested that there was difficulty in getting a suitable High Court judge to act as chairman.  When the Minister uses the privilege of this House to make that kind of veiled remark about a long-serving and well-respected member of the Judiciary he should at least make a casual comment as to the reason this person is not found suitable.  He does so at a later stage in another veiled comment on the whole question of the public service.  He says <Col N="877" /> that as a matter of principle he is not in favour of anybody who is over the age of 65 serving in any office paid from the public purse.  I am not saying that is not a fine principle but he refers to the age limit in regard to the fact that a judge of the High Court may continue to serve until he has reached the age of 72 and if a retired judge is serving he might be over the age of 70.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister really understood the implications of what he was saying.  The implication is that every judge administering justice who has passed his sixty-fifth year should also be sacked and his office terminated. That is the basic principle underlying the Minister's comment.  He is putting the Judiciary and others on notice that at some future date he will see to it that none of them can hold office after the age of 65.  I take that as a veiled slur on the Judiciary and I expect we will hear more about it in the near future.  It will be pursued in the House and the Judiciary will be whittled back to accommodate only those under 65.  If that policy is promoted during the lifetime of this Dáil and if half a dozen vacancies arise because of that action, I guarantee that the judges appointed will be good, strong Fine Gael supporters.  There is no response from the far side of the House because the tradition in that area of appointment is that it is a virtual preserve of the Fine Gael Party.  Need we go any further?</P>

      <P>The Minister cannot defend it.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with it.  If members of the Judiciary or An Bord Pleanála or Bord Fáilte or any other body must be appointed, it is up to the Government acting in a responsible fashion to make the appointments as they see fit.  Surely we do not want to turn this country into some sort of banana republic where all judges following their appointment would get what they can from their office until such time as there is a change in the <Col N="878" /> administration and they cease to hold office.  There has long been an acceptance by the general public that the Judiciary are above reproach, that their integrity is not in question irrespective of their political affiliations.  Why should the same criteria not apply to members of An Bord Pleanála whereby it would be accepted that irrespective of their political affiliation they would act in the best interests of fairplay, commonsense and justice?  Is that not normally what one would expect a Government to do?  If the Government make a poor choice, be it on their own heads.  It becomes self-evident and the dogs in the street can recognise it.  If they make a poor appointment of a judge, or a member of An Bord Pleanála or Irish Shipping&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it reflects on the Government.  That is the way democracy is run and should be allowed to run.</P>
      <P>In a speech riddled with ambiguity the Minister suggests that it is not proper for a High Court judge or anybody else to be appointed over the age of 65, but he says there is a great need to have persons with legal expertise on the board.  I do not know any better way of guaranteeing legal expertise than having on the board someone who has behind him or her long service in the Judiciary.  How does the Minister propose to satisfy that requirement which he says is so necessary?  He said that some direction in law is needed in An Bord Pleanála and it does not require any elucidation by me as to the areas where that might be necessary.  The Minister says it is necessary, but he cast a slur on the Judiciary <i>in toto</i>.  He told them he will look over their appointments and their terms of office.  Still, he says he would like to have the benefit of their advice.  This speech does nothing to enhance the reputation of the man who made it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will get down to some of the provisions we will have to consider in this debate.  Page five of the speech deals with the appointments of the chairman and members.  The new chairman, whoever he or she may be, will serve for seven <Col N="879" /> years.  I do not know if the Minister has considered the wisdom of that.  Outside this House this is regarded as being very unwise, for the obvious reason that when you appoint a chairman for a very long period you have to live with him and there is no guarantee that the chairman, who might be an excellent person on day one, will continue to be as excellent or competent for the full seven years.  There is no guarantee that the chairman, having been appointed, might not get a heart attack, God forbid, two weeks later and might not be replaced for the rest of the seven years.  He might get involved in some kind of activity.  Is the Minister suggesting to us that if things go wrong we would be back here again to find ways and means to dispose of the chairman? We must remember that times and attitudes change and a seven-year span is very long in a working man's life.  Who is to know that the chairman might not be reflecting the basic fundamental policies enunciated by this House?  He might have a totally different attitude to planning from that which would be acceptable to all sides of this House, but we would be stuck with him for seven years because the Minister says so.  It is an unwise provision and the Minister will have to change it.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the person who will be appointed, presumably by the Minister, will be selected by a group called a selection committee, all honourable men who, I presume, will spend long arduous hours considering the person most suitable to spend seven years of his or her life organising and running An Bord Pleanála.  The Minister told us that nobody will be excluded from putting her or his name forward or having a name put forward for the committee's consideration for appointment.</P>
    <P>That is not in keeping with the Minister's attitude at the start of his speech because if they have political affiliations, if they are well known party supporters or, as the Minister and some of his people would like to say, &ldquo;party hacks&rdquo; that would exclude them because the Minister might get lax and appoint one of his own, or worse still, one of ours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> I suppose that when the selection committee meet they will send forward a name to the Minister.  The Minister did not say it will be mandatory on him to accept that name.  The Minister might find the person would be totally unacceptable, for all sorts of reasons.  Therefore, I suppose the Minister would have the opportunity and the right to go back to the selection group and say: &ldquo;Get at it again, dig out a few more names&rdquo;.  Do not forget they will be from a very select group of people.  They will have to have legal experience and they will have to be competent to deal with a big administration and to be well aware of what is going on in the Legislature so that the application of their decisions broadly will be in accordance with what the Legislature would wish to happen.  He will have to be a unique person and the selection committee will earn their money.  According to the Minister, the chairman will have responsibility for the overall efficiency of the board and the allocation of business to the members.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that that kind of statement would be part of the Minister's Second Stage speech because it implies things that are not so.  That section of the Minister's speech implies that the existing board are not controlled in an efficient way and that there is no allocation of business among the members.  That is patently untrue because it is well known they were as efficient as they were allowed to be.</P>
    <P>In relation to the allocation of duties, anyone would expect that any chairman of the competence of the existing chairman would see that as a very minor function. Is this a new departure, suggesting in a Second Stage speech that there would be an allocation of briefs among the board members and that in some mysterious way, with a smaller number of members, this will speed up the appeals process?  Is anybody so naive as to suggest that that is the way is has been done?  We all know that the briefs are handed out to various inspectors and that the reports have to be considered by the board, singly or collectively.  To suggest that a smaller number of people, under 65 years of age, will suddenly bring about the disgl <Col N="881" /> appearance of the backlog of appeals is ridiculous.  It does not bear thinking about.</P>
    <P>We come to the four appointed members from persons who will be selected by groups and organisations throughout the country who will represent professional people, experienced in environmental works and development of various kinds and community interests.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has now come in to take his bit of stick.  Many people in the House and outside fully realise that this is Deputy Quinn's own personal thing and that he has made it certain that the Minister had to bring this into the House.  He did not read this speech because if he had he would never have allowed the Minister to make it.  It is riddled with ambiguities, half sentences, half truths and suggestions. Deputy Quinn is not recognised as the type of person to be involved in it.  He had nothing to do with the dubbing of this speech.</P>

      <P>One member will be nominated by each group but the telling phrase in the speech is that the nominating organisations will not be identified to the Members of the House or to the general public until after the Bill has been enacted.  That is a scandalous state of affairs.  Talk about going to the fair and buying a pig in a poke, this is the ultimate in ridiculousness.  You will have groups set up and they will nominate people to be appointed by the Minister and &ldquo;we will let you know later which groups they are&rdquo;.  I assume that the reason we will not be told now is because the Minister has an innate fear that it might go deadly astray with the general public if all the groups he has in mind were put to the <Col N="882" /> House at this time.  Has he in mind some organisations not yet widely known who are regionalised or perhaps only apply their way of life and thinking to one section of the community?  Has he in mind some organisations that he will have to ferret out during the recess which will be loaded with Fine Gael men and Labour men, so that the nominations coming from those organisations will have their affiliations right, and there will be no problem for the Minister and his Minister of State in appointing them in the sure knowledge that they came up through the structures the Minister is setting up.  I am quite sure there are Fine Gael and Labour-dominated organisations.  I am quite sure there are a few Fianna Fáildominated organisations.</P>

      <P>If the Minister were to name those organisations in the House now the lobbying would get underway in earnest.  That might not suit him.  While some of these organisations may represent a certain point of view, some of them are representative of a sectional type of interest and are not representative of the general public.  Some of these organisations may be local.  They may be located geographically in particular places and we could very well end up with an eastern-block-dominated Bord Pleanála. That would suit the Labour Party because that is where their little influence lies, diminishing certainly but there it lies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>He has already decided <Col N="883" /> who will be on the board.  The fact that he interrupts me in this fashion suggests that he is making very sure that the Labour Party will be accommodated on the board.  That is why he will not name the organisations he will ask for nominations for his consideration.  There is nothing in this legislation to suggest that once a person is nominated by the interested group the Minister has to accept him.  The Minister may decide that this person is a subversive, that while he is very knowledgeable, very experienced, very professional, with tremendous capacity and confidence, he is also the type of person who might manipulate the system to suit himself or his friends.  The Minister might consider that the person nominated was a little unscrupulous and had proved so.  He might consider that the person had a very narrow point of view on planning.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State who has dealt with planning in a professional way might say: &ldquo;that kind of guy does not suit me at all, Dick&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Well, we will not accept him,&rdquo; the Minister might say.  Back they will go to the organised groups again, and will they have a field day?  In due course they will ask the Minister to pay for these deliberations.  Mark my words well: when the lobbying starts in earnest in these organisations the person who is most vocal at meetings of these organisations who will be named by the Minister is not always the most suitable person to be a member of An Bord Pleanála.  These people are most vocal and they will manipulate the situation to get themselves nominated.  They are good at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not understand that it was my privilege to be a member of a planning authority for almost 17 years.  The people of west Mayo had confidence in me as a member of the planning authority.  I could talk to the Minister for a considerable length of time about planning at local level, but I do not think that would be appropriate here.  I hope the Minister will not continue to <Col N="884" /> treat this Bill in the flippant way he is hell bent on doing.  It changes the whole process of appointments and might well create a precedent which will back-fire and will not be for the common good.  It may be that selected vested interest groups will be dominating a very important institution dealing with planning applications and appeals worth hundreds of millions of pounds each year.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to suggest that, after the Bill has been enacted, he will find time, at some future date when he has had a closer look at the organisations to which he may apply for nominations, to put the names before the House.  If the Minister had done his homework properly, and if the Minister of State who is the power behind the Minister promoting this legislation had considered the implications, they would have gone further than putting this simple statement in the Minister's speech.  The two things which became apparent to the Minister after he resumed office were the delays and the appointments, and he felt he would have to give precedence to the appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people would think that he should have had a close look at the existing structure to see if it was possible to alternate and modify it to reduce the delays.  Nothing new is proposed in this legislation to reduce the delays.  The hope is that because we are to have a super chairman under 65 years of age, and there for seven years at enormous expense, he will have the super capacity, super professionalism and super administrative skills, and that this superman will take the existing structures and the existing inspectorate and wipe out in the shortest possible time the delays which have been suffered by the general public over a period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what qualifications the people who will sit on An Bord Pleanála in the future will have.  Basically that is wrong.  The Bill is weighted towards the professionals.  I have nothing against professionals.  The best of luck to them. They are educated.  They have reached a <Col N="885" /> level of competence and they are entitled to their professionalism.  The type of professional organisations which exist today, the environmental organisations, the kind which will be referred to later, and the development organisations, suggest to me that particular strata of society will now dominate the process of planning. The Minister owes it to the House to tell us whether the members of the board will be engineers, gynaecologists, geographers, geologists, nurses, teachers or whatever.  It is weighted towards the professional type of person.</P>

      <P>Since this discussion started not one person from the Government side of the House has had a hard word to say about the competence or the capacity of any of the present appointees to the board to fulfil the mandate they were given.  Not one.  It has not appeared in the public press.  It has not even been implied or suggested here that they were any less competent to deal with the business because of the job they held prior to their appointment.  The only sin they have committed is that they have stroked for Fianna Fáil on ballot papers for a number of years.  If the Minister of State or his hacks want to get rid of all the Fianna Fáil people in this country who hold office they will be a long time here but we are determined they will not be here long enough to get beyond this Bill. The Minister said he is satisfied that the board selected on the basis as outlined by him will have wide public acceptance. How can that little delicacy be achieved? Is not that acceptance only brought about by statements of confidence in the board from the Minister?  Is it not brought about further by the decisions they hand down? Is that not how the Judiciary have gained their acceptability over the years?  They do their duty and apply the law as interpreted by them and the people accept it. Is that not the whole basis of the judicial system?  Is it not a strange thing that a judge, when he is considering the most difficult decisions, when he is, in fact, considering the life and death of an individual, <Col N="886" /> has to rely on 12 men or women, good and true, and is it not an extraordinary thing that the life and death of an individual rests in the hands of 12 of that person's peers?  When a jury is called to deal with a matter of life and death I am sure the presiding judge does not go through the list and say: &ldquo;You are not professionally qualified&rdquo;.  He does not say: &ldquo;What environmental background have you?  What party background have you?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have been in a few courtrooms in my time and I have yet to hear any judge, when arraigning the members who are to serve on a jury, question their political affiliations despite the fact that on occasions some of the people in the dock were well known Fianna Fáil supporters.  Did the presiding judge decide on the competence of the 12 good men and true to decide on the person's fate, question them as to their affiliation and question them as to whether they would give fair play or justice in their deliberations?  He did not, because he took it that any man, even in an unpaid capacity, would look at the facts put before him, listen to the advice given and make a calculated decision as he saw it in justice.  That has been the whole fundamental of democracy in this country, but the Tánaiste does not see it that way.  He states emphatically in this document that a Fianna Fáil appointee cannot give a reasoned and just decision and for that reason he must seek an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know where he will get the chairman who will serve for seven years, under 65 years, with judicial experience and administrative skills, and where he will get the four people who have never had a political affiliation. Wide public acceptance is generated by the Minister and by the people who speak concerning An Bord Pleanála.  The ordinary people from whom we are led to believe a considerable number of the supporters of the Labour Party come will not be aware of the professional competence of the people being suggested by prescribed organisations who will meet in some back room and decide among themselves as to which of them will be put forward for the job.  I will guarantee that <Col N="887" /> the organisation that is putting forward the nominee will be quick to say: &ldquo;You are going in there.  We presume that you are going to protect our interests in there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many of the organisations that will be nominated by the Minister will have a particular point of view and that point of view in the past has not always been in conformity with the general point of view held by Seán Citizen.  Will the man in the street be aware of the names, the competence or even the organisations that are being referred to?  I would like to know what man in Blacksod, in Binghamstown or Belcarra will either be a member of, have knowledge of, be aware of the structure or know anything of the ideology of a lot of the organisations that are named here.  Perhaps the Minister of State will do a nationwide tour to enlighten the ordinary people as to who is deciding for them now.  At least when the appointees were put there by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or whatever, if you had a gripe against them you had a gripe against the Government that put them there and if you did not like the type of appointments the Government were taking you got your opportunity to do something about it every so many years &mdash; three or four times in the one year the way things are going.</P>
    <P>The next election cannot come soon enough whether it is three weeks or three years so that we can change this and bring back a bit of sanity into the democratic way of dealing with appointments in this country.  Is the Minister of State suggesting that this new system will be a cure for all ills and will be applied throughout the whole public service?  Does the Minister really understand a basic fundamental of democracy as I see it?  It is a policy which was promoted by my party and scuttled by the Coalition on a number of occasions. It is the policy of decentralisation. Does the Minister of State realise that the essence of democracy is that Sean Citizen fills his application form and can deal with the public official who makes a decision on his behalf?  Does the Minister understand that that is the basis of democracy, that ordinary people, by <Col N="888" /> good fortune or good education or by prospects offered by them in some way, find themselves in positions of authority and in positions of decision making on behalf of the rest of us, but in a real democracy, in a really decentralised democracy, you should be able to speak to and reason with the person who makes the decision on your application, whether it is for a driving licence, for planning permission or for the right to drive your car?  That is being denied.</P>
    <P>The pseudo-socialists of this House continually preach what socialism should be about.  This reinforces my point of view that this is a device being used by the Labour Party and by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment to move the minds of the public from matters which concern their pockets, their future, their welfare and the welfare of their children into talking about these liberalised things which have a relevance in their own place, but which should not be taking up the time of the House when 250,000 people, one in every five of the population, are unemployed. Not a single initiative has been taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>Every time this is referred to we have the age-old reply that Fianna Fáil did nothing about it and what are we talking about?  We are not in Government but that has not dawned on the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party.  There was a change of Government last December and they now have the responsibility to bring forward the policies to do something about this situation.  We are ready to take office and run the country.  That is what we are trying to do, but in the meantime, we would appreciate it if the Coalition did not put the ship of State so far off course that we could not retrieve the situation.</P>
    <P>This diversionary tactic is typical.  One of the most important changes that could have been made in An Bord Pleanála was that there should have been some access by the appellant to the inspector's report. That is not proposed or even suggested as a reform which might take place.  In a true democracy, in the Minister's true socialist State, that should have been a fundamental issue in the reform of An <Col N="889" /> Bord Pleanála.  The appellant could have seen from the report in what area the board were dissatisfied and he could see if there was a diversity of opinion between the inspector and the board.  It could be that the inspector wished to give the planning permission but the board said no for some reason, or maybe it was the reverse.  All this is being clouded and for what purpose we do not know.  That is a reform I would like to see brought about.  If that applicant had access to the report he could readjust his application to comply with the requirements of An Bord Pleanála.  This would be better than getting the standard reply from An Bord Pleanála &ldquo;The matter has been dealt with and we are not at liberty to give you any information.  Minister's Order, 1983&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These people will be whole-time and pensionable.  Where can we find the kind of people with job specifications laid down by the Minister?  They will be thinking twice about taking these positions now because it is on record that we are going to change this anyway.</P>

What kind of people will the Minister be able to conjure up to satisfy this wide criteria which he has set down as the basis for their appointment?  Will he be saying to them that once they are recommended by the ICA, Macra na Feirme, the IFA, Muintir na Tuaithe, An Taisce or any other environmental organisation, they will have to surrender their membership? Will they have to divest themselves of any interests they might have either in the organisation which is promoting them <Col N="890" /> or in their business interests that might stand to benefit in some roundabout way? Will members of planning authorities have to put on record, as was attempted a few years ago, a list of what they own or what their wives own, and what interests they might have?  Will the super administrators and super appointees who will be brought forward by the Labour Party and the Minister walk naked in the appeal corridors of An Bord Pleanála&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In his speech the Minister said the members will be concerned with the overall efficiency of the board and that they will take all possible steps to speed up the processing of appeals.  It is superfluous that that sentence should find its way into the Minister's speech.  I am sure the inspectors employed and paid from the public purse by An Bord Pleanála have done all in their power to keep up the pace of appeals.  It is rumoured that these inspectors who are being pilloried here and the board members have been at pains for quite a long time to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No public servant, whether he is an appointee or full-time, wants to be criticised in the public press and to see himself stripped of his dignity.  This will not encourage people to offer their services in the interests of the common good.  I am sure the inspectorate and the people working under them have a very different attitude to that being portrayed here.  I am sure they are very aggrieved at what is being said against them as if they were some kind of layabouts, not interested in their work and not doing their job properly. The word &ldquo;inefficiency&rdquo; appears in every other page in the Minister's speech. This is done deliberately to bring about a consensus of opinion that there is incompetency and inefficiency in the <Col N="891" /> board.  The person who wrote this speech has a real place in Irish democracy.</P>
    <P>How often has the chairman of the board, whether it is the existing chairman or the former chairman, been consulted?  How often has the Minister of State consulted the chairman of the existing board?  How many times has he availed of the opportunity to invite him to his office to say that he is concerned about the number of appeals which he was not clearing?  How often has he met the members of the board to see could he resolve some of their difficulties?  How often has the Minister refused assistance to the existing structure in a deliberate attempt to do it down so that he could get the public to accept what he has in mind for that board at this time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment <Col N="892" /> of this debate last evening, I was speaking about the Oireachtas Committee which reported on the CSET.  That committee made the following statement:</P>
      <P>The closure of the Tuam factory should take place only when alternative employment has been provided in the town.</P>
      <P>They went on to say:</P>
      <P>The committee recognises, however, from the State's point of view, not to say the interests of the workforce as well, that it makes no sense for the company to close a plant until alternative employment opportunities have come on stream.  The cost to the State of unemployment in terms of tax receipts forgone and unemployment benefits aid will usually exceed the deficit in the value of what the workforce produce and their wage.  Provided this condition is met, it is cheaper for the State to subvent the company to maintain its plant in temporary operation, rather than allowing its workers to go on the dole.</P>
      <P>This is a very important statement.  I point out to the Minister of State here present that Tuam area has at the moment a very high unemployment rate and we do not want to add, by closing down the Tuam sugar factory, a further thousand families to the unemployment figure of over 2,500 people in the greater Tuam area.  In fact, unemployment in County Galway has increased by 96.7 per cent from 1980 to 1983.  That is a frightening statistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much play was made in the debate of October 1981, when the Coalition Government of the time gave a year's reprieve to Tuam, of the promise that they were going to get the IDA to provide alternative employment when the Tuam factory would be allowed to close.  Even if Tuam gets a new industry, it will not be an alternative to the Tuam sugar factory; rather will it be a badly needed industry to cater for the large number of unemployed in the area.  Indeed, the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, writing an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i><Col N="893" /> dated Wednesday, 8 June 1983, referred to the IDA also and I quote:</P>
    <P>Perhaps in the heel of the hunt the IDA will have to be called in, but as of now I do not see that day as imminent.</P>
    <P>If there is no danger to Tuam in the mind of the Minister, why did he write that article and why does he state that the IDA may have to be called in?  Does the Minister have any special information which we do not have?  Would he please tell me when replying.</P>
    <P>The beet crop for 1982 in the Tuam area was worth £4.5 million.  There is no doubt but that if the Tuam factory goes, beet growing in the west of Ireland will cease.  The consequences of that will be a reduction in all tillage crops, more imports of animal feed and less money in the farmers' pockets.  If the factory closes, the turf-cutting operation of the company will cease.  The cost of closure to the Exchequer and the loss of 430 jobs will mean a loss of £2.2 million to the Exchequer in PAYE, PRSI and unemployment benefits.  In other words, it would cost twice as much to close down the Tuam sugar factory as to keep it open.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the Tuam factory has suffered discrimination.  The manager of the factory was removed and of the money invested between 1978 and 1982 &mdash; a figure of £46 million &mdash; only £750,000 was given to Tuam.  I understand &mdash; and the Minister might inform me if I am correct &mdash; that £19 million is to be spent on the other three factories. I also indicated last night that, of the £30 million advanced by the then Minister, Deputy Lenihan, in October 1982, not one penny was allocated to Tuam.</P>
    <P>The operating loss of £1.4 million which has been vetted by the head office of the Sugar Company should be seen very clearly in the context of £22 million lost by CSET last year.  We must ask where the other £20 million has been lost. It should be looked at in the context of the total borrowing of the State for this year &mdash; a figure of £1.7 billion.  Is it any wonder that people in the Tuam area and the west of Ireland say that, if this factory were in the east, its closure would not even be in question?  It is in the west and <Col N="894" /> we have this clear anti-western bias in the Government.</P>
    <P>In east Galway two projects are under review at present by the Government. One is the Tuam sugar factory and the other the proposed briquette factory at Derryfadda near Ballyforan which is the subject of a cost-benefit analysis.  Is there any other constituency which has two projects currently under review and examination?  We are greatly afraid in Galway East that we will suffer the loss of these two projects.  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, and on the other Minister in Galway, Deputy Donnellan, to fight hard against these cutbacks.  I call on all the Government Deputies in the west to come together and fight for what we are entitled to in East Galway.  Fair play is all that we are looking for.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of what the late Seán Lemass said when setting up the sugar factories in 1933, that we should not look at the point of view of the accountant only.  I am greatly afraid that the accountants and economists in the Coalition Government are looking at facts and figures all the time.  We in our party are very clear as to what we have said and our commitment to Tuam is also clear.  It was given in 1981 by our leader, Deputy Haughey, and our spokesman on agriculture, Deputy MacSharry.  When we got back to power in 1982 the then Minister for agriculture, Deputy Lenihan, stated very clearly that Tuam was to be an integral part of CSET.  He met a deputation from the workers' committee in Tuam, told them what he was doing and said that, if the acreage of beet and the rationalisation programme of the workers were implemented, that would be rewarded.  In October 1982 he advanced £30 million to CSET, but I again point out that Tuam was to be an integral part of that rationalisation plan and it would get its allocation of money from the CSET.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to look favourably on the Fianna Fáil commitment and honour it by maintaining Tuam sugar factory and the ancillary activities relating to Tuam.  I am reminded of what Deputy Connaughton said in the final <Col N="895" /> paragraph of his article which is headed &ldquo;Tuam needs a Fighting Chance&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>In regard to the workers in Tuam, they deserve my support whenever it can be of use and they will get it.</P>
    <P>I am asking him to declare here tonight that he will give that support.  There is a placard here under which the workers' committee marched when they had the rally in Tuam in 1981.  It states very clearly:</P>
    <P>Tuam workers protest.  Cromwell said &ldquo;To hell or to Connacht&rdquo;.  Now it is &ldquo;To hell with Connacht&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope that this evening the Minister of State will let us know that he and the Government have a commitment to the Tuam sugar factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity this evening of contributing to this debate.  So far the debate has been conducted in a mild and unemotional way which is what one would expect in the House of Parliament. It is my intention to continue in that vein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth repeating that the beet industry as a national industry is very important.  Therefore, it is imperative that we have an in-depth investigation of what has been happening in the industry in the past four to five years particularly and having regard to the fact that between them, the four sugar factories have sustained losses amounting to £22 million and after £30 million by way of equity capital or, in other words, taxpayers' money, was pumped in by the Government.  In such circumstances it is only reasonable to assume that a Government <Col N="896" /> who have any hope of bringing this country out of the mire would study closely what has been happening.  It is against that background that at the time the Government put in the £30 million they stipulated that a comprehensive review and plan would have to be forwarded to them by the company.  Such a condition was only reasonable in the circumstances. The subsequent report, in which the board of directors of the Sugar Company took the view that the Tuam factory should be axed, is one of the reasons for this debate here.</P>
    <P>As a farmer I understand the importance of the beet crop to every area, including the west.  Beet is a very useful crop in terms of cash and is one that is very suitable in terms of crop rotation.  If we look at the history of Tuam we must accept that for years the Sugar Company had in mind the closing of that factory. Their approach to the closure was inconspicuous in that they starved the factory of the capital that was needed to modernise it.  Irrespective of how the situation is presented, there has been a problem down through the years in respect of Tuam.  I agree with the workers' action committee that one of the reasons for Tuam not being cost competitive per ton of sugar is that the machinery was allowed to go to such a stage of disrepair.</P>
    <P>From about 1974 on beet acreage in the west decreased.  By 1980-81 it was very low, so one could only assume that if the farmers were not interested in growing beet it would be very difficult to sustain the beet industry in the area. However, for a variety of reasons, one of which was the threat of closure facing the factory, the situation changed dramatically in 1981.  The workers came together, as did the co-ordinating body made up of ACOT and others, and an all-out effort was made to increase the beet acreage. We have arrived at a situation in which there is an increase in this regard from about 4,500 acres to almost 8,500 acres of beet.  In addition, because of last year being a very good year from the point of view of good crops of beet with the resulting increase in income per acre, many farmers who for years had not bothered to grow beet changed their attitude.  The <Col N="897" /> techniques now are better.  There is less labour involved and the yields are better. Unfortunately, there was a problem in the spring of this year because of bad weather and this is likely to result in reduced yields compared with last year. However, the point is that there are a large number of farmers in the west who would find it profitable to grow beet. Although my land is not really suitable for beet growing I have grown beet in the past for the Tuam factory and I am doing so again this year.  Regardless of what argument there might be for maintaining the Tuam factory, if the local acreage of beet was not increasing the case of maintaining the factory would be much more difficult to sustain.</P>
    <P>My interest in the continuation of Tuam as a beet-processing centre is well known.  Deputy Kitt read extensively from an article that I wrote some weeks ago for a newspaper.  The people working in the other sugar factories as well as those involved in the spin-off industries will agree on the importance of the beet factory to an area and Tuam is no exception. However, in keeping with the situation applying to all other factories, because of the losses incurred by the Sugar Company as a whole it is vitally necessary to look closely at the operation of the entire industry and that is what this Government are doing.  I am making a very strong case to the Minister on the basis of the importance of considering the overall objective of this in-depth study.  Only a very small amount of the total loss of £22 million is attributable to Tuam.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances the loss-making situation in Tuam can be turned around.  This might entail the growing of more beet and also the more efficient use of labour and so on, but I am one of those people who does not believe in white elephants.  That is why I say that in certain conditions there is a place for the four beet factories.  I am talking of a situation in which the whole sugar industry would be revamped and its loss-making days over.</P>
    <P>It is important that I refer to some of what the Minister said last night because it appears that there are some people <Col N="898" /> here who believe that the Government have decided to close the Tuam factory. Last evening, the Minister said he had an open mind on the matter and that so far as the Government are concerned there is no commitment to close the factory.  In so far as the report to which I referred is concerned, the Government have before them a 64-page document that was presented to them by the Sugar Company. It would be remiss of them not to have regard to that document.  It was important they should look through this document. This is the first time this has been done to this degree.  The future of the farmers who grow beet must be assured. So must the future of the factories involved.  The Government are correct in ensuring there will be no hasty decisions. I make no apology to anyone.  Because of the implications for the nation it is important that every consideration should be given to the situation and every consideration so far as the Tuam situation is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the Government would take a very close look at the employment and social implications involved.  That is spelling it out.  The Minister has gone so far as to say he will visit the factory in the near future and assess the situation on the ground for himself.  He will talk to the staff and to the workers and to all the various groups who may wish to talk to him.  Obviously they will have very concrete proposals to make.  The Minister said full account will be taken of all sensible proposals put forward.  That is a reasonable commitment. There is no bias against Tuam.  I want to assure the workers of that.  In reference to what Deputy Kitt said about my saying I would give every possible support, that is exactly what I am doing. I am doing everything humanly possible to ensure that everyone involved will be treated with equity.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister spoke too soon when he congratulated Opposition speakers on keeping a cool head.  In my opinion the subject has not been treated as seriously as it deserves to be treated.  People have been moaning about the situation in the west of Ireland and the situation of the workers in Tuam. The west of Ireland should be wept about because of bad Government for a great many years.  Too long has the west suffered from a lack of interest by the Government.  They never sat down to analyse the problems of the west.  They never tried to solve them.  That is why there was no restructuring of the land and that is why our children found themselves homes in this city instead of in the west.  All that was fed to them was tedious rhetoric.  There were no economic plans. No real jobs were provided.  Nothing was done which might provide people with an income for themselves and their children.</P>
      <P>We are not the slightest bit impressed. No Fianna Fáil Deputy ever crossed the floor to vote for our economic policies for the west of Ireland.  Apparently, Fianna Fáil Deputies are under the misapprehension even today that the people of the west will take this tedious rhetoric instead of real jobs and an honest understanding of what their problems are.  A sum of £80 million was promised for Arigna.  But when Fianna Fáil got back into office they were afraid to meet the workers.  Nothing like £80 million was spent on Arigna and I wonder how Deputy O'Keeffe will vote tonight.  He says one thing in public and he does something else in private.</P>

      <P>With regard to the EEC, as far as sugar is concerned we would have over-production.  We consume roughly two-thirds of what we produce; the rest is sold on the world market. If we did not have the safety net of intervention and a guaranteed price we would be selling last year's harvest at £180 a ton instead of £440.  An increased acreage is no solution.  We must apply ourselves to the real problem and the real problem is our having to run down the factory in Tuam.  Deputies who are so concerned about Tuam did nothing to get the Sugar Company to modernise the Tuam plant. Over the years in which they were in office they failed to implement progressive policies in Tuam.  No effort was made to make Tuam competitive.  No investment was forthcoming to modernise the factory.  The workers in Tuam were used as political fodder.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the Sugar Company, they have their own problems.  While they got £30 million last year, the truth is that if they were a private company they would get 60 per cent grants.  They did not get that sort of grant over the years and so we cannot blame them too much.  The Minister and the Government are correct to look at loss-makers in the public sector. If I know the Government and their thinking Tuam will not be the first project to be axed in the interests of economy. There are far bigger losses being made on the east and south coasts.  Any Government which would sustain the loss-making of Irish Steel, Verolme, NET and so on and would consider closing for the sake of £2 million the Tuam plant would not have their priorities in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Government will decide that Tuam must be revitalised and retor <Col N="901" /> equipped even if it means some reduction in the workforce and sacrifices on the part of the farmers.  The factory could be made more viable than many of the projects Governments have sustained over the past few years.  At the end of the day the scare created by Fianna Fáil for political purposes, which will allow them to say that they kept the factory open or blame the Government if it is closed, will be seen for what it is.</P>
    <P>This motion should not be before the House.  ACP sugar is being processed in England.  Since we cannot increase our acreage and sell at the correct price why can we not ask the EEC to give us more ACP sugar?  We were getting 22,000 tons. We should get 1.5 million.  This would help to make our sugar industry more competitive.  We could request FEOGA assistance for the Tuam factory.  That might not fall on deaf ears.  Anyone who suggests that the Minister is adopting a hard line economic approach to this subject is entirely wrong and dishonest.</P>

That must be gone through by his officials and the Minister must then present a report to the Cabinet for decision.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time the shadow of a political axe has fallen over Tuam.  It is not the first time Fianna Fáil have failed to face reality.  The Minister said he was prepared to go to Tuam and meet the workers and management and see the position for himself prior to making a report to the Cabinet for a final decision.</P>
      <P>As a public representative I do not want to see the west treated as some kind of Indian reservation always looking for handouts from the Government.  We have people and representatives prepared to face reality in the eighties.  We have people of drive, initiative and motivation who will create success out of failure.</P>
      <P>Many losses have been sustained through the years.  No one has been fired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> No books were examined.  There were only vague talks with no final conclusions. Recently the Minister for Industry and Energy called in seven State-sponsored bodies and asked for a financial report to be given to him every quarter and for a five year projection.  That was long overdue.  He should be complimented on doing that.</P>
    <P>There has been a dispute about the amount of money which Tuam has lost. Is it £1.4 million or £2.5 million?  As a TD from a neighbouring county, constituents have told me that in order to save Tuam they grew beet.  These people would normally be involved in the dairy business. They grew the beet out a sense of pride and dedication and because they wanted to see the plant continue.  When they arrived at the Tuam plant they were often left waiting for a day or two before their beet was unloaded.  They saw trucks arriving from Carlow and other counties and this beet was unloaded before theirs. The management of the factory have a lot to answer for.  How can a manager in Carlow effectively manage a factory which is 100 miles away when he is not there to supervise the operation?  How can he be sure that farmers who have grown beet in order to keep the factory going are treated properly?</P>
    <P>I do not have access to the report before the Government but I assume it contains an economic analysis of what the Sugar Company deemed to be their position.  Over the years the Sugar Company have deliberately run down the Tuam plant.  The Fianna Fáil spokesmen have continually tried to suggest that Coalition Governments have done nothing for the west.  They would do well to remember that the victim of their verbal onslaughts has been the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  To the Swinford complex for mentally handicapped children the Minister has allocated £10.5 million.  Work is actively under way.  He has given a specific commitment for a new general hospital in my own town.</P>

      <P>That decision is implicit in their directive to the board of CSET when they told them to carry out their rationalisation plan which includes the closure of Tuam.  What we are now witnessing is the report back from CSET to the Government to consider putting money up to keep Tuam open.  There is one man who can keep Tuam open and that is Deputy Connaghton.  I have a lot of respect for him.  He is a good friend of mine but I must put him on the mat on this one because he is the one person who, backed by his colleagues from the west, can convince the Minister for Finance and the other Minister that the Tuam factory must remain open.  It is a political decision and therefore I must refer directly to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Connaughton.  The ideas contained in a recent article by the Minister as well as his contribution to this debate are a serious disappointment to anybody concerned about the threat to Tuam.  There is no point in enunciating the kind of hypocrisy contained in this article when the Minister who has responsibility for western development is the one person who should stand up and say he will not accept the closure of the Tuam factory. That is the only action which could keep it open.  We will congratulate him if he succeeds in keeping the factory open but if he does not we will hang it around his neck for the rest of his days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton wrote in this article that he lives and works in an area most affected by the threatened closure of the Tuam sugar factory and stated that he knows the people and their families who will suffer hardship as a consequence of this closure.  If the Minister feels like this, why did he not tell the House that he will not allow the Government to make the decision to close the Tuam <Col N="905" /> sugar factory?  Why did he not in his capacity as Minister with responsibility for western development tell the House that he would resign from this position if the Government proceeded with the decision?  How could he continue in that capacity if the decision is taken to close the factory?  Once that decision is taken we can throw the concept of western development to the winds.</P>
    <P>This is not just the closure of another factory; it is the closure of a way of life. It will signal the beginning of the closure of the tillage industry in Connacht.  This is the last strong food processing plant in Connacht.  We cannot and will not stand for such a decision.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister of State to cross the House and vote with us.</P>

I call on him and his colleagues to make it clear to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance that they will not accept a Government decision which will involve closure and that instead they want the extra £1.4 million necessary to keep the Tuam factory in operation.

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity of supporting this motion and I believe it is imperative that this motion should be debated before the recess.  When the Sugar Company was founded by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1933 our sugar imports were touching £1.5 million per annum.  Against this background and realising the tremendous overall economic effect that beet growing and the processing thereof could have on the life of the nation, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta were born.  Beet would be a cash crop for farmers, create new jobs and indirectly locate new business for a large number of other industries and, finally, make a contribution to our imports problems.</P>
      <P>Why was the sugar factory located in Tuam?  It was built there because of its central location in the Connacht region but above all because for geographical and historical reasons the west was Ireland's problem region.  The factory was set up in Tuam because the west was weak from 90 years of post-famine haemorrhage of its youth.  The purpose of setting up the factory was to stem the tide of emigration, to stimulate agricultural growth, to preserve people on the land by bringing into production the maximum amount of land possible and to create an economic base from which the west could develop and expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were sound social reasons and they are as relevant today as 50 years ago.  These reasons were recognised by the industrial father of the nation, the late Seán Lemass.  In July 1933 when Minister for Industry he stated in the Dáil that in no country in the world is beet an <Col N="907" /> economic proposition if you regard it from purely an accountancy point of view but there are several other points of view besides those of the accountant.  I would ask the Government and the Opposition to consider that statement made when CSET was born 50 years ago.  In 1982 over £90 million worth of sugar and over £20 million worth of animal feeds were manufactured which would otherwise have had to be imported.  This surely proves that the ambitious pioneers of 1933 were correct in their initial investment of £0.5 million of State equity.  The State in return has received many millions by way of company tax, dividends, PAYE, PRSI and VAT.  Tuam's contribution has been impeccable and important to the nation.</P>
    <P>Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta have been operating in Tuam for the past 50 years and in any assessment of the situation we must analyse the contribution of the workers and the farmers in the catchment areas during those years. Industrious farmers in the Tuam beet catchment area have grown over 0.5 million acres of beet in this time.  This is an annual contribution of over 10,000 acres to the sugar industry, despite the fact that farms in the west are smaller and more fragmented than in the rest of the country. The soil conditions are poorer and the climatic conditions are less favourable, our growing season is later and consequently our yield has to be lower in comparison with the rest of the country. Yet during the war years, particularly between 1940 and 1950, Tuam was ahead of the other factories in the amount of beet grown.</P>
    <P>That was a period when conditions on the land were similar throughout the country.  There was little mechanism on any farm and the horse and the farm family did most of the work.  The west made a major contribution to the operation of CSET during that developing period but the executive of CSET failed to recognise that contribution.  Their attitude and their actions during the years have clearly shown that there was an anti-Tuam bias in St Stephen's Green House, particularly in the last 15 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> At that time CSET decided to close down Tuam and to replace it with an alcohol manufacturing plant in which they would use the local potato raw material.  During the reign of Mr. A. J. F. O'Reilly as chief executive, he visited Tuam and called the staff together.  On learning from the manager of the Agricultural Services Division, Mr. Foley, that 10,000 acres of beet were available in the Tuam catchment area Mr. O'Reilly flabbergasted the staff when he told Mr. Foley to reduce the acreage to 7,000 immediately.  He said that it was then the policy of CSET to accept contracts from the bigger farmers, the bigger suppliers, and that the small western farmers who were growing only one or two acres of beet would not be entertained in future contract arrangements.</P>
    <P>Mr. Foley pointed out to the then genial Mr. O'Reilly that it was not possible to do that and Mr. O'Reilly replied that if it was not done immediately he would find himself back home in Donegal.  Was not that blatant discrimination against the Tuam factory and the small farmers of the west and the people of Connacht who had supported the factory in the previous number of years?  Is it any wonder that the acreage dropped in the intervening years.  All the good work done by Church, State and civic leaders promoting the growing of beet was thrown to the winds and destroyed by an arrogant executive in St Stephen's Green.  The blatant discrimination against Tuam over the years was acknowledged in a report by the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies, of which the Minister for Agriculture was a member.  I will quote from it:</P>
    <P>The company has restricted investment in the Tuam factory to a minimum and its capacity will not be enlarged under the current modernisation programme.</P>
    <P>Surely that is <i>de facto</i> discrimination against one of four units in CSET.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the Minister sat on that committee and that he had first-hand knowledge of the situation.  In 1983 there were 10,000 acres of beet available to the Tuam factory but the CSET executives would only allow the catchment area 8,500 acres.  Was that again not blatant discrimination and mismanagement of Tuam by the executives? Surely anybody with business acumen or knowledge would realise that if one unit of an enterprise was not going as well as the others it should be put into an economically viable position.  but Tuam was discriminated against.  We have lost 1,500 acres of beet in 1983 and goodness knows how low the yields will be after the bad spring.</P>
      <P>CSET were asked to develop a food processing industry which in the past 20 years swallowed their profits and reserves.  No aid was made available until 1982 when Fianna Fáil provided £30 million. The Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Lenihan, were responsible.  The lack of adequate funding is the primary reason for the losses affecting CSET since 1980 and that is the reason why the future of the Tuam factory is now in doubt.</P>
      <P>We can go back to look at the investment in Erin Foods and see the way it was mismanaged.  In 1976 Erin Foods bought a new potato grader at a cost of £100,000.  When the factory was closed down in 1978 that grader and the flake lines and other equipment in the Tuam factory were sold to Holland and erected there by engineers from CSET.  Now Ireland imports potato flakes from Holland and the rest of Europe at a major cost to the State.  Yet this Government are trying to tell us that the reason Tuam is in doubt is that the books have to be got right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Erin Foods complex in Tuam there are 15,000 square feet of empty space.  The geniuses in CSET wanted to set up an alcohol plant there 15 years ago.  Why is it they are not putting it into <Col N="910" /> the 15,000 square feet space available in the empty Erin Foods plant alongside the sugar factory?  Would that not be a proper type of economic investment for the western region?  In addition, there are 30,000 square feet of factory space available to the IDA by way of advance factories in Tuam.  At a meeting today which the worker's action committee, the Tuam Town Commissioners and the Tuam Chamber of Commerce had with the Tánaiste they were told it was impossible to expect any industry to be put into Tuam.  I would remind the Minister again, as a former member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee, that the committee recommended closure in Tuam only after suitable alternative employment would become available.  The Tánaiste emphatically told those workers in Tuam today that in the immediate future there is no prospect of alternative employment in the town.</P>
    <P>Here tonight we are debating a motion in respect of the closure of a factory which served that area for 50 years.  The workers in Tuam, or we as representatives of the area, have not had access to the plan that has been produced by the CSET executives.  The plan is now with the Minister for Agriculture, and I understand the Minister of State has seen it. An accompanying letter states that an initial investment of £1 million over three years, between now and 1986, would put Tuam into a viable situation.  Surely that is not too much to expect.  Would it not be only right to make that subvention available to allay the fears of the workers and the farmers in the Tuam catchment area?</P>
    <P>It has been accepted by the CSET executives and the workers' action committee, after consultations between both parties, that the operating loss for Tuam last year was £1.4 million.  Most of the sugar manufactured in Tuam, unlike in the other three factories, is packed there. Ninety per cent of the sugar packed in Tuam is worth at least £50 per tonne more than the corresponding amount of sugar in the other three factories.  I submit to the Government and to the Minister that a net operating loss for Tuam last year would be the equivalent of £1.4 <Col N="911" /> million less 16,000 tonnes of sugar produced at a reduced figure of £50 per tonne, leaving a net loss of £600,000, something over £½ million for Tuam last year.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out some other startling figures to the House.  It was stated in the House recently that it costs £425 per prisoner to keep criminals in jail for a week.  This is a total of over £21,000 per annum per prisoner.  It costs £10,000 on average, and even up to £15,000 in particular regions, to create an industrial job.  I submit to the Government that for an investment of £500,000 per annum for the 230 full-time workers and the 300 part-time workers in the Tuam sugar factory, they could keep this factory in production at an investment of £1,000 per worker per annum.  Surely it is economic lunacy to close down this factory when that modest investment from the State is needed to ensure its viability.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Government and the executive of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta to point out the reasons for the closing down of Min Fhéir Teoranta, for the closing down of the Gowla farm in 1980 with the loss of 60 jobs in County Galway, and furthermore the loss of grass meal production to the nation.  We also had the closing down of Erin Foods in Tuam.  Surely this is a withdrawal from the west by CSET and by the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, made long-winded statements showing his commitment to the Tuam sugar factory over the past few months. He penned his name to several articles in the <i>Tuam Herald</i> and the <i>Irish Independent.</i> I should like to quote from the <i>Tuam Herald</i> of 30 April where he said the final decision on the future of the Tuam factory would be a political one.  Yet my party are being accused of playing politics with the Tuam factory in putting down a motion like this.  Our commitment of 50 years is there and is evident for everybody to see.  In the <i>Tuam Herald</i> of 14 May in big bold headlines the Minister of State said that CSET bosses are incompetent, and that the management were <Col N="912" /> not up to the task and were incapable of running the affairs of this semi-State body.</P>

Tonight he is in Dáil Éireann and he can deliver his commitment to these workers who are here to witness the naked truth.  He represents them in this House and he can march through the lobby with his colleagues from the western region to show his solidarity with them by supporting this motion.  We can make it much easier for the Government.  They can withdraw their amendment and pass the Fianna Fáil motion unanimously to ensure the future of the Tuam sugar factory.  The choices are theirs.  Tonight is the time for positive action to preserve the economic life of Tuam, County Galway, and the west of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are over 10,000 people unemployed in County Galway.  In the town of Tuam with a population of 6,000, over 1,600 people are out of work.  Over <Col N="913" /> 30,000 people are unemployed west of the Shannon.  We are here tonight debating this motion because the Government are prepared to add another 500 people to that growing list.  Recently within five miles of Tuam one agricultural firm closed down with the loss of 15 jobs.  Ten miles up the road another firm closed down with the loss of 110 jobs.  Here we are with the future of Tuam at stake.</P>
    <P>It is the practice of CSET to sell all sugar produced at the four factories to a central division, the sugar sales, at head office.  An average price is used to credit the various sugar factories for their production. I want to ask the Minister: what bad debts are provided for in the accounts of CSET?  How many of these bad debts relate to the Tuam area and to the other factory areas?  Are there any provisions for bad debts in respect of companies owned or controlled by directors or former directors, or bad debts incurred by former directors through their trading with the various companies in the CSET group?  I am asking for categorical answers to these questions.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil policy over the past 50 years was the planning, programming, financing and building of the Tuam sugar factory.  It was built in record time and 700 people were employed in the building of that factory.  The commitment and policy were supported consistently by Fianna Fáil under Deputy MacSharry as Minister for Agriculture and when he was shadow-spokesman on Agriculture.  He gave a commitment to keeping Tuam open when it was under threat when the previous Coalition were in Government. On return to Government Deputy Lenihan as Minister for Agriculture provided £30 million of State equity and instructed that specific amounts of money should be spent in Tuam.  On the arrival of a second Coalition Government, within two years for the second time the Tuam factory was under threat.</P>
    <P>Last month our shadow-spokesman, Deputy Noonan, gave a firm commitment to keeping Tuam open permanently on the return of a Fianna Fáil Government. The Fianna Fáil contribution is permanent, ongoing and visible.  We are proud of that contribution and we will <Col N="914" /> continue our commitment on return to Government.  I am appealing tonight for a categorical assurance from the Minister in his winding up speech that the Tuam sugar factory will remain a permanent, ongoing and integral part of the operations of CSET.</P>

      <P>Like my colleagues I believe this debate is unnecessary at this time.  It is based on the assumption that the Government intend to close the Tuam factory.  Yesterday when the Minister was speaking in the House one could not help noticing the look of disappointment on the faces of the Opposition when he said he was examining the proposals and the documentation submitted to him by the Sugar Company, and that he would examine carefully every proposal and do everything possible to examine the situation with which he was presented. I have absolutely no doubt that the Minister will do this.  I am delighted to note that the Minister is visiting Tuam where he will see the situation for himself at first hand.  It is a very welcome step that the Minister is going to Tuam to examine the situation.</P>
      <P>We need all the industrial jobs we can get in the West of Ireland.  We cannot afford to lose any.  I have listened to Members of the Opposition talking about all the jobs that were lost.  One would imagine that only started in the last couple of months.  Most of the industries they talked about closed during their term of office and they did nothing about it, including Erin Foods and the grassmeal plant that the last speaker spoke at length about.  They were both closed under his Government and his voice was not heard in opposition to that.  It shows the sincerity of those people.  They have embarked on this campaign to try to stimulate their dwindling support in the west now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would like to remind the previous speaker that the Joint Oireachtas Committee of which he <Col N="915" /> spoke at length was a committee which had an overall Fianna Fáil majority under a Fianna Fáil chairman and it also recommended the closure of Tuam.  Where was the commitment of Fianna Fáil to Tuam then?</P>

      <P>One of the Deputy's colleagues, Deputy Hugh Byrne, has on numerous occasions called for the closure of Tuam.  These are the realities of the situation and the Opposition are trying to pretend that this Government are trying to close Tuam.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  For the last ten years under boards of management which by and large were appointed by Fianna Fáil no money has been put into improving the facilities at Tuam.  It has been starved of capital.  I would appeal to the Minister to examine the situation and even if it means that some loss making enterprises have to go at Tuam and that there has to be a reduction in staff levels &mdash; I am sure that Tuam is no exception and that like many of our other semi-State bodies it is overstaffed and that the output of work per labour unit in many cases is small.  The Minister should examine every aspect and see what can be done to cut the losses in Tuam and at the same time retain the factory there.</P>

As a former Minister I see those as a very suitable form of words meaning only one thing and that is that the Government will decide, if they have not already decided, to close the sugar beet processing factory at Tuam.  I hope I am wrong but I do not think so.  Deputies have said there was no necessity for this motion because the Government had not made any decision.  The Government manipulated a situation to force the board into a decision to close the factory and that is an established fact and has not been denied by the Government.</P>

      <P>That did not appear without some discussion whether in Barrestown or elsewhere.  I notice from the Minister's speech last night that he is trying to say he has an open mind, that he has not got a decision made, that the plan is the company's plan.  I quote from page 6 of his speech:</P>
      <P>It assumes that the company will have a future.  It recognises that there is considerable scope for further tightening up of the company's operations. It assumes &mdash; and this is the issue underlying the Opposition's motion &mdash; that the Tuam factory will be closed after the 1983-84 campaign in January next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Minister puts that into his speech means that that is the decision the Minister and the Government will take or have already taken.  I do not base my argument on just what the Minister said last night or throughout this debate. <Col N="917" /> It is clear from what happened the last time Fine Gael and Labour were in Government when the then Minister for Agriculture Deputy Dukes said clearly that the Government had decided to close Tuam and only deferred that decision for one year to allow the IDA to get alternative employment.  That is two years ago but it is clear from all of the statement from the Minister, from the Minister of State responsible for western development, the Deputies backing him up and the former Minister for Agriculture, now Minister for Finance, that there is no commitment within the ranks of Fine Gael and Labour to the Tuam factory.</P>
    <P>At a meeting in Tuam last Monday to which all the elected representatives of the area were invited we heard the county development officer state that it is very difficult for the various agencies in these areas to attract new jobs to the western region.  That is why the Government must do everything they can to protect the jobs that are there.  There is a commercial and a social aspect but there can be conflict between the two.  In this case both must be taken into account.  Many people from 1934 onwards have talked about the non-viability of Tuam.  Almost every report or study of the Sugar Company pointed to the necessity to close the Tuam factory.  It cannot be looked at in isolation. It must be looked at in the social as well as in the economic context.  Do this Government want the 1,000 families affected to leave their homes and their area and transfer to other parts of Ireland or go abroad?  If they transfer to other parts of Ireland will they not put further strain on the existing services in the areas to which they go &mdash; housing, education, health, employment and so on?  I am not surprised to find in this Dublin-dominated Government an attitude of bias. There is no doubt but that it exists now, and existed the last time the Coalition were in Government, albeit for a short period, and let us hope for a short period this time as well.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Labour Party in the Tuam area, small as it is, for arranging to meet the Deputy Prime Minister, who happens to be the Leader of the Labour <Col N="918" /> Party, to talk about the Tuam factory, but these people through their Fine Gael Deputies and their Minister of State could not meet the Minister for Agriculture. I see that Minister is going down there, and I am delighted because then he will see the necessity for this motion and for a commitment from both Fine Gael and Labour to that sugar factory. We hear a lot about white elephants in the west &mdash; there does not appear to be any white elephants anywhere else in the country &mdash; let it be the Tuam sugar factory or the Connacht Regional Airport. The total borrowings for this country this year will be in the region of £1,700 million between current and capital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No matter what argument there is about figures, the Tuam loss is £1.4 million, and the figure for the Connacht Regional Airport is £2.7 million. Half the money spent on that airport can be secured from EEC sources if this Government go to Brussels to look for it. Do these areas in the west get their fair share of that £1,700 million borrowed, regardless of the other thousands of millions of pounds that are spent?  I say no, and definitely not from a Fine Gael and Labour Government.  This Government's attitude to the west is well known. I was astonished to hear Deputy Kenny and Deputy McCartin talking about the commitment they got from the Minister for Health to Castlebar hospital.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; the policies of Government down through the years and asking why the people had to leave this <Col N="919" /> disadvantaged area, I have to ask him why he did not put pressure on his Government to pursue the decentralisation programme which Fianna Fáil put in operation.  We had got tenders and were ready to appoint contractors to transfer 800 people to the Tuam catchment area. What about arterial drainage in Deputy McCartin's constituency.  What about Ballyforan?  What about school transport? There is a definite bias against the west.  I want to say as clearly and as loudly as I can that this attitude to the west has caused serious damage to the initiative, both public and private, in the western region.  If the Government continue with these policies the logical conclusion will be that we might as well close down the west.</P>

      <P>Over the years through successive policies pursued by Fianna Fáil Governments we have stabilised the population in the west.  Our policies should continue to be geared towards a return of people to these regions and not restarting the exodus which took place over the last 100 years. I remember a few years ago under another Coalition Government when CIE were making substantial losses of £30 million.  What was to be done to save that money?  It was said that if we closed down the bus services, rail services and other CIE activity in the west that would solve all the problems, just as the closure of the Tuam factory will solve the Sugar Company's problems.  What has happened since then?  In the absence of those loss-making services in the west, CIE are now losing over £100 million, but not in the west.  We also have &mdash; and we do not hear it described as a white elephant &mdash; £80 million to £100 million being spent on the electrification of the Howth/Dublin railway line.  We support that but we also support Tuam and other development projects for the west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to avoid repeating the details surrounding the Tuam factory because there have been many important debates on it in this House, but I must not let this opportunity pass to pay a tribute to, to congratulate and to thank very sincerely the workers and farmers in that region.  When the case was being made by the previous Coalition Government to close the Tuam factory we appealed to the people in the area to make whatever efforts they could to ensure the viability of the Tuam factory. That they did, the workers by agreeing to rationalisation and productivity measures and the farmers by growing more beet.  The losses projected then are much lower now and can be eliminated with greater effort by all concerned and I know that commitment is there from the work force and the farmers.</P>
      <P>The loss for Tuam is £1.4 million and £22 million for the Sugar Company.  Let that £1.4 million be taken as £3 million, as the Minister said, but what of the other £17 million?  What are the proposals to save that £17 million?  Is this money being lost in Carlow, Thurles or Mallow?  What projects pursued by the Sugar Company make such losses?  Why are there not proposals from the Government or the board to deal with those losses?  It has to be the closure of the Tuam factory, the last flagship of the Sugar Company in the west.</P>
      <P>Social implications must be taken into account.  The Tuam factory and its future, or any other project in the west, should not be made a political issue.  It is not my wish to do so, but the policies pursued by this Coalition Government in relation to the west suggest that political decisions are being made by parties who do not command much of the popular support in those regions.  Shame on the Government for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, this Government's approach has destroyed the initiative of everybody living in the west and caused many problems as far as investment in the area is concerned.  Let the continuation of the Tuam factory be an example of this Government's commitment to the development of the west.  Nothing less will do. The Minister of State, Deputy Conure <Col N="921" /> naughton, said he wants the factory to continue.  In 1981 he made his maiden speech on a motion in my name in similar circumstances.  He is now Minister of State responsible for western development. He will work many a long hour, over many a long week, month and year to secure investment in the west that would be as valuable as the Tuam factory is to that area.  That is the reality, whether the Minister likes it or not.</P>
    <P>Government is about people.  There are 1,000 families dependent on the future of the Tuam factory.  If this Coalition Government care about people, particularly people who live in the most disadvantaged area of this country, they should think carefully and seriously before bringing the shutters down on the Tuam factory.  Not only will the people of Connacht resent what the Government are doing, but it will be an example to the community at large throughtout the length and breadth of the country of what the Government will do in circumstances such as this with regard to their futures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> I say to Deputies on the Fine Gael and Labour benches that it is not good enough to say, as the Minister, the Minister of State and their four other Deputies who spoke here tonight said, that they have no commitment to close the factory.  That is a very peculiar form of words.  It is much easier to say, as this party have said, in and out of Government, that we have, and always will have, a commitment to keep Tuam factory open.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Private Members' Business I was dealing with the dominance in certain areas of activity of the Labour Party.  I drew attention to certain aspects of the Minister's speech.  It was a document which was devised and concocted by his Department.  It was put into his hand and he was asked to deliver it. Very little screening was done by the Minister.  It is full of ambiguities and half suggestions of what might or might not happen in the future.  The Minister was dedicated to one area of activity only and that was to sack the board irrespective of the cost.  It did not matter to him what their qualifications were or that the Labour Party can normally be expected to show justice in dealing with the work force.  It did not matter that the normal practice before asking a person to relinquish their position is to give them an opportunity to make a case for themselves. It only mattered that these people were appointed by Fianna Fáil and because of some commitment he gave to a sectional interest in his party he had to bring in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a party in this House who would like to think they have a big political future.  They are small in number but they have designs on the sliding Labour Party vote.  It is to try and shore up the voting and electoral strength of the Labour Party that they find it necessary to bring forward these edge of liberaltype policies and so hopefully retain some support among their own types.  The Workers' Party have something else in mind.  It is interesting to note their actions in the House for the past two months. We have heard their exposé of Fianna Fáil and what we should or should not be doing as regards appointments to An Bord Pleanála.  I do not know what <Col N="930" /> philosophy Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa follow.  I do not know whether it is the Marxist or Trotskyite theory they follow.  It is amazing, because if they are real followers of Trotsky or if they follow the fundamentalism of Marx, they should be the people who should be promoting the fact that public representatives should be supreme in all matters concerning Government.  However, they want this done away with because it was done by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I should like to pose a question to those two either Trotskyite or Marxist supporters in this House: what political philosophy are they following and what real political objective are they following in the House at present?  Is it not strange that, irrespective of whether they are in the House, whatever their attitude to any Bill is they will get the best media and radio coverage for it particularly at the 6.30 p.m. News.  It seems strange that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is not more concerned about what is going on in that area as far as The Workers' Party are concerned.  We take no comfort in seeing The Workers' Party try to undermine the Labour Party.  They are both running for the same vote.</P>
    <P>The whole idea of this legislation is to divert the public's attention so the Government will not have to answer to the House for their lack of action in dealing with unemployment, pay and so on. People are to be nominated by selected groups which the Minister is not prepared to acquaint us with.  The Minister probably has to scurry around the organisations which have a majority of Fine Gael and Labour members.  They will probably put forward names with a fine Fine Gael or Labour label.  They will be the names acceptable to the Minister.  They will not be acceptable otherwise, particularly so if they have an affiliation to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Our attitude is entirely different. Governments are elected to govern.  It is their responsibility to appoint people as they see fit to the highest offices in the land.  If mistakes are made it is up to the public to show by their vote what they think of the appointments made by the Government.  The Minister's speech is a classic and will be prescribed reading in <Col N="931" /> some Department of Political Science in some university somewhere as an example of what should not be done by way of a Second Stage speech by a Minister who feels his responsibilities heavy on his shoulders.</P>
    <P>The new members of the board will be professionals.  How the Minister expects to appoint people with no political affiliations I do not know.  A judge with a man's life in his hands can put the onus of responsibility in the hands of twelve good men and true but the Minister says that Seán Citizen is not worthy to be considered for involvement in the Planning Board.  There will be no representation on the board of the attitude of the man in the street when the Minister has his way.  A string of degrees after a person's name does not necessarily mean he will have a practical attitude to anything, particularly planning.</P>
    <P>One member of the board is to be a civil servant nominated by the Minister from his Department.  While trying to get rid of people appointed by the Government, the Minister considers it obligatory to have one civil servant on the board. This leads me to be suspicious that this civil servant will be his messenger boy, carrying the Minister's dictate to the board and following whatever line of policy the Minister wishes to have implanted in the board.  Why bother picking a civil servant from his own Department unless the Minister has something in mind for that civil servant to do?  If the civil servant is carrying out his duties properly the only thing he can do is carry the wishes of his Minister to the board.  That will be his means of political influence.  He will shelve off his so-called political influence by having a selection committee pick a chairman for seven years.  He will shelve off his responsibility to do something by way of positive planning by supposedly waiting until some organisations with majority Fine Gael or Labour affiliations bring forward names to suit him.  Irrespective of whether that succeeds, he will not be left without an opportunity of influencing the decisions of the board because he will have a hand-picked civil servant on that board.  We would all like <Col N="932" /> to know the political affiliations of the civil servant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer Deputy Harte in one simple sentence.  It is well known that civil servants faithfully carry out the wishes of their master, the Minister.  That is what this civil servant will do.</P>
      <P>When the Minister assumed office two things came to his notice immediately, the delay in appeals and the appointments made by Fianna Fáil.  He did not call in the chairman or members of the board to see how he could help, to suggest what new avenues were available to him to improve the inspectorate or to give them a certain amount of computerisation to assist them.  Those matters could be left to another day.  He considered it more important to deal with the people who had been nominated by Fianna Fáil.  Not a single word about malpractice or undue or illegal influence was heard during this debate or elsewhere in regard to the board.  They had to be sacked simply because they were appointed by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole structure of the board is being changed.  Members were appointed for three years and if they were successful they continued in office.  If they were unsuccessful they could be let go.  Now the period of office is to be changed to five years.  How many changes of attitude have taken place during the past five years?  A man might become stale in that time and might not reflect what would be regarded as normal or acceptable policies which we would enunciate here.  It might not be the right thing to have a chairman hold office for seven years or a member for five years.  It is a cause of grave concern that the Minister is setting up a team in perpetuity and if they develop a strain <Col N="933" /> of attitude to a particular type of development there is no way that attitude can be changed, except through the Minister's civil servant.</P>
    <P>There was reference in the media to the question of political pull in some of the decisions made by An Bord Pleanála. I challenge the Minister to substantiate any of the remarks made in his speech. Can he show us any impropriety in the dealings of the board members with planning appeals?  If he can put on record one instance of political pull achieving the desired result, let him do so.  Let him put up or shut up.</P>
    <P>If there are delays the onus of responsibility is on the Minister to do something about it.  He has done nothing.  To suggest that there are a few sections at the end of the Bill that might help the situation is putting the cart before the horse.  If the Minister had been taking his responsibilities properly he would have dealt with the chairman and the board.  The Minister did not seek to find out whether they were willing to accept his directions and use new administrative skills or technology to improve matters.  He did not seek that information because he is hamstrung by the Government's embargo.  It is not possible to get reports through the board more quickly without increasing the inspectorate and giving them the necessary equipment.  The Minister is trying to convince the general public that the reason for the delays is the Fianna Fáil appointees.</P>
    <P>The Minister has incorporated in the Bill the compensation to be paid to the existing board members.  They receive a certain salary, as does the chairman.  The Minister and the Minister of State, with the obvious connivance of the Minister for Finance, are prepared to deal with wild abandon with the public purse in compensating these people by way of pension and gratuity subsequent to the enactment of the Bill.  The Minister would have been better employed in using this large sum of money to provide extra inspectors or better equipment to the board.</P>
    <P>We as members of local authorities, county councils, corporations and urban district councils, made development <Col N="934" /> plans and spent long tedious hours making plans.  Such councillors know the requirements of their regions better than anybody.  They have the inside knowledge that is necessary to provide a good development plan for their particular areas.  Who or what has been thwarting those rights of democratically elected representatives?  It has been those organised groups with sectional interests, the very people the Minister will utilise to send nominations to him of people who will supervise the most intricate appeals in the country.  If the councils were competent to develop plans for their particular areas why are they not qualified now to make nominations to the board?  Perhaps the Minister has in mind, now that he has taken the first steps, that there is incompetence and lack of capacity among county councillors and urban councillors in regard to their own development plans.  Maybe his civil servants will be appointed to redraw development plans throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  This Bill is nothing but a Department of the Environment device to take away power from the democratically elected representatives.</P>

      <P>Section 4 suggests that reviews will be carried out by the Minister's appointees.  I agree that reviews are necessary but if the Minister had been carrying out his responsibilities properly he would have these reviews.  Did he staff any review with the existing board and their chairman?  Did he have any review carried out at all except a review of the names of those appointed by Fianna Fáil? The Bill is badly timed, ill-conceived and ill-advised.  It cannot guarantee any of the so-called improvements it proposes. It shows the narrow introverted attitude of the Government, which is susceptible to Labour Party pressure, which has to be bought off regularly by trying to push anti-democratic legislation the likes of which the Minister and his supporters <Col N="935" /> have been trying to push on the people in the last couple of months.</P>

There is no justice in sacking somebody without giving him a chance to appeal.  The Minister is denying that fundamental right that a former member of his party, as Minister, put through this House so that workers would have an opportunity to defend themselves against unjust dismissal. I charge the Minister with the unjust dismissals of people who committed no crime and who have no case to answer.  It is unworthy of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear than An Bord Pleanála, set up in 1976, in some areas have not been as effective as they might have been.  We need an effective board to deal with planning throughout the country.  That is what the public want. The Bill has a twofold purpose &mdash; to try to ensure independence for the board, and in an area which is so important, to ensure that the board's procedure and administration will be handled expeditiously and fairly in a way that will make good business sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will make sense to people in many areas.  It will make good sense to <Col N="936" /> builders awaiting decisions to build houses and accordingly employ people. It will make sense to those who are waiting for permission to build simple extensions.  A more efficient board became necessary so that decisions would be arrived at quicker.  Recently, the Minister for the Environment in reply to a question told the House that in 1980 5,271 appeals were dealt with by the board.  That had decreased by 1981 to 4,059 and last year the number was 3,662. We understand that at present there are roughly 3,600 applications awaiting decisions.</P>
    <P>Consequently, without getting any further applications in the next year, the board will have all of last year's quota to get through.  This is entirely unsatisfactory. At present a person will make an application to a local authority.  The local authority have two months in which to come back with an answer, turning down or granting the application.  If the application is turned down or if somebody lodges an objection and it goes to An Bord Pleanála there is no time limit in which a decision has to be made.  We have the crazy situation up to last year when people were waiting from between eight and 12 months for their appeals to be decided.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister would bring in a statutory period of between four and six months in which an appeal would have to be decided so that people would know by the end of September whether their appeals had been granted.  At the moment they do not know whether it will be by September, November or well into the next year.  Meanwhile the cost of building materials and all associated items is escalating and the cost of the development becomes more exorbitant because of the lack of a time limit.</P>
    <P>Further criticism levelled at the board is that people find it difficult to get any information apart from the knowledge that the papers have been lodged, that they will be reviewed by the board and that decisions will be communicated in due course.  This is gravely unsatisfactory and I had hoped the Minister would have put a deadline on decisions by the board. Some of his other proposals in relation to <Col N="937" /> the hearing of appeals and the rights of persons appealing decisions, or the rights of people objecting, may quicken up the process.  Another thing that may quicken up the process is the recent decision of the Department to approve four additional inspectors.  I wonder have they commenced work in An Bord Pleanála. They should be working away for the board trying to reduce the backlog.  Over the coming months if the number of appeals being processed monthly does not increase, the Minister should exercise his right under section 4 (2) and call in the board and ask why these appeals are not being dealt with more expeditiously.</P>
    <P>The general duties of the board are defined in section 4 (1) (a) as follows:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the Board to ensure that appeals, references and other matters with which it is concerned are disposed of as expeditiously as may be and, for that purpose to take all such steps as are open to it to ensure that, in so far as is practicable, there are no avoidable delays at any stage in the consideration of such appeals, references and other matters.</P>
    <P>I presume that up to this their duties were along the same lines.  There have been many comments about the board but I have had no complaints &mdash; apart from one incident which I will mention in a moment &mdash; about misconduct or irregularities on the part of the board over the past few years.  There is the real problem of the delays.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Dún Laoghaire an application was made in respect of the proposed development of Roche's Hill, Killiney.  It was turned down by Dún Laoghaire Corporation on the grounds that it was totally inconsistent with the zoning of the area.  Most of the locals, all the councillors and I think most of the public representatives hope the area will be left as it is.  Since then the application has gone to An Bord Pleanála and it leaped from somewhere around 3,000 on the application list up to an oral hearing next week.  I do not know how that happened but it seems to be inconsistent with what has been going on up to now.  Perhaps they have made up a tremendous <Col N="938" /> amount of ground in recent weeks and are now almost up to date, but I doubt that.</P>
    <P>Obviously I hope that any applications upon which people are waiting and where money is outstanding in relation to the purchase of land, and where houses are needed, decisions will be given quickly. There are other cases where some poor individuals have been saving up for an extension and somebody else, out of jealousy or otherwise, has objected.  In one case in my own constituency a person has been waiting for eight or ten months for a final permission, which I presume will come.  The problem is that, in the meantime, the cost of building that extension has escalated by 25 per cent or 30 per cent, and it may now be beyond the person's means.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at these cases to see exactly why these delays are occurring. They are probably due to a combination of circumstances.  Perhaps there are not sufficient staff or inspectors or administrators.  It is important that these areas are looked at immediately.  Over the next few months the Minister should find out whether the number of appeals being dealt with each month has increased.  On a rough calculation at the moment they are dealing with 300 or so a month.  With 3,600 outstanding it should take quite a while to eat into that backlog.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I hope he will confirm that the appeals going in are taking their place at the bottom of the queue, and that those which are in the longest are dealt with as soon as possible. If not, many innocent people will be affected.  I hope the Minister will take note of what I have said about the appeals.  The number dealt with has fallen, even though apparently more staff are employed.</P>
    <P>In the autumn the Minister may be able to indicate that progress has been made. It appears that some staff from his own Department will have to stay with the board for quite some time to clear the backlog.  A person should not be asked to wait longer than about six months from the time he first makes application to the final appeal decision by An Bord <Col N="939" /> Pleanála.  Unfortunately that is not the case at present.</P>
    <P>On the question of the inspectors' reports it appears from section 13 that only limited information will be made available.  In England inspectors' reports are released in bound volumes and various decisions and precedents can be looked at and used as references.  I hope a certain number of reports will be released here for reference purposes.</P>
    <P>Various groups will be asked to make recommendations for nominations to the new board.  We all hope that the people appointed to the board will be efficient and effective and get the job done.  If they do the job, their political affiliations are not important.  From the point of view of the public the important thing is that the planning appeals are going through and are being dealt with expeditiously and without undue ceremony.</P>
    <P>People nominated to the board should have a commonsense attitude to planning, to the building industry and to development.  They should be good administrators.  In some parts of the public service the problem is that we get ourselves tied up in paper work, in bureaucracy and in delays.  We get ourselves tied in trying to get answers and decisions.  I hope that whoever is appointed, we will have an even more effective board.  I do not know whether they need more power or more nudging to come up with decisions.  A statutory time limit would be the ideal.  The Minister may have some points to make as to why he did not go that far this time.  If he has, I would like to hear them.  It is important that appeals are not delayed unduly.</P>
    <P>Section 17 strikes me as being slightly peculiar.  If appeals are not in writing the board can ask the reasons for the appeal, and this could lead to a waste of time and money.  In my view this section should be rejected.  Some members of local authorities are concerned about section 19 which deals with orders the board may make.  There is a line over which the board should not step.  If the planning authority have fully discussed zoning in a certain area and have reached a decision, <Col N="940" /> the board should not overturn that decision because the local authority know the local area better than the members of the board or the inspectors who may be looking at documents and they may not know the situation at first hand.  Only in very exceptional circumstances should the board overturn the decision of the local authority.  It appears from section 19 that the board can overturn decisions or even go further and make orders which the local authority will have to carry out.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see vexatious appeals will be dealt with as they should, but without denying the people involved, particularly residents' associations, their rights in raising objections and expressing their point of view.</P>
    <P>We should take another look at the operation of An Bord Pleanála.  I am very concerned about the inordinate delays in the decision-making process.  I do not think the fault rests with any one person; it is a combination of circumstances.  I hope a code of practice and a plan of campaign are adopted by the board so that there will not be very long delays in dealing with appeals.  Under section 4 (2) the Minister can direct the board to review their organisation, systems and procedures in relation to appeals and other matters.  If appeals have been with the board for an inordinate length of time I hope the Minister will be able to find out why there have been such delays. Appeals should be dealt with on a first come first served basis.  It should not be possible for someone to leap-frog the queue because he knows someone with influence.</P>
    <P>The public must have confidence in the board.  They should know that irrespective of whether their application is big or small, it will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.  There should not be a delay longer than six months from the time the first application is made to the local authority.  Nobody should have to wait ten, 12 or 14 months.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind what I have said with a view to ensuring that the appeals are dealt with promptly so that if he is asked in a few months' time how many appeals are outstanding, he will not say there is still a year's work to be tacselve <Col N="941" /> kled.  The problem is that the number of applications has built up over a period of time and the situation has got out of hand.  I hope the extra inspectors will help to reduce the number of appeals. Some of the sections in this Bill will go some way towards reducing these delays.</P>

He also wants to see attention given to the work of the inspectors to help them get on with their job.  In that respect he is more direct and more to the point than the Minister has been.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn pointed out clearly that the Minister jumped in to attack the board but left aside a question of dealing with the very urgent matter of getting appeals heard and making the system more efficient.  Deputy Cosgrave has been quite skilful in highlighting a positive point which needs to be tackled by avoiding reference to the board or its constitution.  He made it clear that what is needed is attention to the work which has to be done and he hopes this problem will be tackled expeditiously.  He does not think people are very concerned about the board but they are concerned about having appeals dealt with expeditiously. In putting his views here tonight, he has done a service to his side of the House because this Bill must be exposed for what it is.  This is not the only Bill of this type; later I will point to another one which is equally shameful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to something Deputy Shatter said earlier.  I object to his remarks about the mental institution in Dundrum.  I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on asking him to withdraw the <Col N="942" /> remarks, which he subsequently did following objections from various members of the House, particularly from this side. In so far as his remarks refer to the House, I object to the mention of one of our institutions for the mentally ill in this manner.  I wish to put that on the record as one who has visited that institution to meet the patients who are there and those who work there.  It was scandalous and I am glad that for one reason or another the remark was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I fully support the motion in the names of Deputies Molloy and Ahern to delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann refuses a Second Reading to the Local Government Planning and Development Bill 1983 &mdash; on three specific and very clear grounds.</P>
    <P>My own experience of An Bord Pleanála is very much at arms length.  As an ordinary representative I seek an oral hearing for a constituent or groups of constituents in the normal way.  I do not know any member of the board and have no association whatsoever with them.  I deal with them in the normal way as a T.D., as I deal necessarily with many bodies and boards.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the reason for having this Bill and for the mad rush at this time to have it passed in a hurry. One could say that the whole process of review is very necessary and desirable and is something which should be going on in the House and for this reason alone it is desirable to have a Bill which reviews the present board's position and looks at its future.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Molloy has pointed out, we have the work of the Joint Committee on Building Land whose terms of reference include looking at the question covered in this Bill &mdash; the operation of the board &mdash; and we will have views to put forward in that respect.  The logical approach would be to consider all the aspects maturely and responsibly and to proceed from there.  But why this terrible rush now?  We know from what our Whip has said that the Minister for the Environment and the Government Whip were not in a rush last week in relation to this Bill and suddenly everything changed at <Col N="943" /> the end of the week, resulting in a mad rush to have it through before the recess. The sudden change of emphasis and direction makes me a little suspicious and makes me ask who is looking for such a change in such a great hurry?</P>
    <P>We know from what has been said in the House and from reading the Minister's speech that there is no direct proof or direct suggestion of any malpractice on the part of the board.  The Minister has not said that he is unhappy with the board or with the members in the way in which they were working and has specific evidence of this to put before the House, so it is not for any special such reason that there is this great urgency.  I have to ask, is there someone behind the scenes? I have listened to various Deputies questioning the sudden change of emphasis. They wonder if it is a policy of a member of the Labour Party to appease someone in particular, or if it is a special policy of the Fine Gael Party.  If it were any of these, surely the Bill would be presented in the normal way.  I suspect that there is somebody with power and emphasis behind the scenes who is aggrieved at the activities of An Bord Pleanála, who perhaps has not got the anticipated results from it.</P>
    <P>Who could have such power to change dramatically the direction of the business of the House which was clearly taking a certain line up to the recess.  Who else is there?  I thought about this and realised that recently a close relative of the Minister for Education, chairman of Fine Gael Centre Policy Committee, was involved in an attempt to purchase a number of small farms in County Leitrim at relatively low prices, with a view to joining them together to go into afforestation. There is no harm in that.  This is a free country and anyone is free to become involved in any chosen association.</P>
    <P>A special programme was done recently by the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; team on this matter.  Our spokesman on Agriculture referred to it at some length in a speech which he gave on 16 June 1983. His great concern was that subsequent to this event, perhaps by coincidence &mdash; but <Col N="944" /> certainly it is a coincidence which one must question &mdash; the Coalition Government have curtailed the power and authority of the Land Commission to intervene in land purchase by stopping all compulsory purchasing and by removing the necessity for notification to the Land Commission of the sale of land. One must ask if the Commissioners of the Land Commission will be the next to be axed.</P>
    <P>Speaking about this on 16 June, our spokesman said, in relation to the Minister for Agriculture, that he seemed prepared to adopt a completely <i>laissez-faire</i> approach without adequate safeguards. He talked about the opening up of the land market to EEC citizens which would take place without those safeguards and that the Minister's approach would be applauded by the monied interests with the fat cheque books, the speculators who invest in land.  It will be a cause of concern and frustration to the progressive farmers, the small farmers, and young people who want to get their chance on the land.  He said that contact with the Donnybrook set who dominate the Fine Gael Party now leads a Minister from Waterford to describe the Fianna Fáil spokesman, who is sincerely and genuinely concerned with the future with our young progressive farmers, as a backwoods man.  He said that not very long ago &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; had a programme about the attempts of the husband of the Minister for Education to acquire a number of small farms in county Leitrim for private forest redevelopment against the opposition of both the local farmers and the Land Commission.  He said that showed very clearly that the dangers of which he warned were real ones.  He talked further about land policy and abhored the fact that the wings of the Land Commission were being clipped in relation to such situations and their powers reduced.  This is one of the chief architects of Government policy, chairman of the Fine Gael policy, committee.  I read in todays <i>Irish Press</i>, 29 June 1983 that he is also in conflict with an Bord Pleanála. The heading is &ldquo;Husband of Minister in Planning Row&rdquo;.  Here Mr. Hussey is challenging the decision of the board to grant <Col N="945" /> approval for the building of a house at the rere of No. 31, Temple Road, Dublin. Mr. Hussey lives in No. 29 Temple Road. Again, I do not deny him the right to challenge a decision or be upset by somebody intending to build a house in the back garden of neighbouring house. Everyone should have the right to object. However, here An Bord Pleanála had given their decision and that decision is being challenged.</P>
    <P>Is there a relationship again between the Fine Gael think-tank policy people and the sudden decision last week to clip the wings of An Bord Pleanála?  That must be looked into.  That presents the Leader of the Labour Party in a somewhat different light in the context of the changes which are taking place here.</P>

      <P>If there has been any wrongdoing on the part of the board, the Minister should put the evidence before the House and thereby stop the malicious innuendo.  Mr. Justice Pringle who was appointed chairman of the board by the Coalition in 1977 said in a press statement as published in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 26 May 1983 that the failure to replace key staff attached to the board was a major factor in the backlog of planning appeals.  He said that the planning inspectors are the <Col N="947" /> key people in the working of the board and that their numbers were cut considerably. He went on to say that the board had been pressing the Department for a long time to have the number of inspectors increased so as to be able to deal with appeals.  That is the evidence of an independent member of the Judiciary who spelled out clearly what the problems are in relation to the work that Deputy Cosgrave says should be done. That is the sort of independent evidence to which the Minister should address himself. We must be thankful that members of the Judiciary are independent and therefore cannot be got at by this Government.  That is one of the safeguards with which our Constitution provides us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that the public perception of An Bord Pleanála is bad.  What does he mean by this?  I deal with a great number of people in my constituency and the only problems I encounter there in regard to planning are problems of getting results one way or another.  People are anxious to have quick decisions so that they know where they stand.  The Minister went on in a number of other ways to repeat the allegation that the public perception of the board is bad.  He said that the circumstances surrounding the appointments and especially their timing could have no other effect than seriously to detract from the public perception of the board as an independent and unbaiased tribunal.  He went on to say that the objective of the board is to provide for a system which will ensure that in the future justice is seen to be done.  Is the Minister suggesting that justice is not done or not seen to be done so far as the board are concerned?  That is a far more important question.  The Minister of the day is the one to decide whether a board are doing their job with integrity and in an honourable way.  Decisions as to whether to fire a board must not be made solely on what is the perception of someone somewhere who may not be aware of the facts.  For instance, we would hardly sack all the judges at the suggestion from someone that they were making wrong decisions or because in some respect <Col N="948" /> there is a wrong perception of them on the part of the public.  There are plenty of misconceptions about decisions made by the Judiciary.  There are areas also about which one would be concerned but it is our duty as Members of this House to stand by those institutions which are so important to democracy and to explain to people that their views are misconceived. When a justice is determining a case he takes into consideration a good deal more than what one reads perhaps in the morning paper.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is convinced that any board for which he has responsibility are acting honourably, he must, in accordance with his responsibility, defend that board.  A Minister's first step is not to be in conflict with a board but to emphasise the positive.  In this case we have nothing but innuendo from the Minister and a move to dispose of the chairman and members of the board.</P>
    <P>The 1976 Act provides that the chairman of the board must be either a High Court judge or a former judge.  In this context I should like to refer to a speech made by the Attorney General yesterday and which was reported in the <i>Evening Press</i> for that day.  The Attorney General referred during that speech to the independence and the incorruptibility of the Judiciary.  We may well ask if the Attorney General is in the same Government as the one of which the Minister is a Member.  The Attorney General is right in his praise of the Judiciary.  They are independent and as we have witnessed in practice, they have been incorruptible. They are the one group to whom we can look constitutionally for total independence irrespective of the fact that in their earlier backgrounds and careers they may have been affiliated to one party or another.  The history and the practice has been, however, that once appointed to the Bench they are constitutionally independent and remain so.  To their credit that is the way they have behaved and that is the way they have been seen to behave.</P>
    <P>Here the Minister suggests there must be something wrong with the chairman, who happens to be a High Court judge. I warn the Minister that the chairman's <Col N="949" /> incorruptibility and his independence as a member of the Judiciary is a very important element in such an important body. It means that people in the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and the Fianna Fáil Party can all look to that body and say that there is a chairman who is constitutionally outside and beyond interference.  That has been the history and the practice so far.  Everyone can have complete confidence in the board and it is very important that people can have complete confidence in it.  The kernel of the arguments of other speakers has been whom can we have at the head of the board in whom we can place complete confidence.  The Act gives us a member of the Judiciary.  There may be problems in getting members of the Judiciary appointed, but if there are not sufficient members from whom to appoint that problem can be tackled in another way.</P>
    <P>For quite a number of years I studied public administration and it is accepted by all that one of the outstanding examples we have to proffer is the fact that our Judiciary have remained independent and incorruptible.  There is no better source to give the Minister than his own Attorney General, who advises on question of law, on the right choices to make and the right direction to take.  The Minister talked about legal advice and said legal advice could be got in other ways. Of course it could.  Everybody knows that.  That was a little diversionary tactic and as such it is an insult to the intelligence of people on this side of the House. Anyone can get independent legal advice.  Here we are talking about someone in the position of chairman, someone independent and clearly seen to be independent, and what better person than a member of the Judiciary.  When tragedies strike, such as the Stardust or the <i>Betelgeuse</i>, to whom do we look as totally independent to investigate those tragedies, someone whom people can see is not a pal of the Minister or of the Leader of the Opposition?  We look very quickly to the Judiciary.  The Minister will learn this in time.  If one wants someone clearly seen to be independent a member of the Judiciary, as prescribed in the Act, is the <Col N="950" /> kind of person whom people will accept. Presumably there is collective support for this Bill on the part of the Coalition and the Coalition must decide whether or not it accepts the total independence of the Judiciary.  We must be quite clear about that.  If we accept that independence is essential, then this is the only group who have the full support of all political parties without hesitation and without question.</P>
    <P>The position of the Judiciary is being questioned here by the Minister.  That is why I felt compelled to contribute to the debate.  I am concerned about how these decisions are made, why they are made so precipitously and why this is all being done before the recess without proper time for consultation, consideration and discussion.  In my view the Judiciary should continue to provide the chairman as one who is constitutionally independent. Perhaps the Minister would get the advice of his Attorney General on this matter and we might then reconsider what he proposes here.</P>
    <P>As spokesman on Justice, I resent the insinuation that the Judiciary are not seen to be independent or above corruption. I resent the innuendo and I call on the Minister to withdraw his remark.  He has shown a disregard for the Judiciary, a disregard which can only undermine the members of the Judiciary.  That is something about which we must all be very deeply concerned.  This is not the only case in which the Coalition Government for party political purposes has set aside a statutorily appointed board.  Last year on Act was passed setting up the National Community Development Agency.  It was required to get under way before the end of the year and to report.  This it did. Now the Coalition are doing away with the National Community Development Agency.  Their work has shamefully been stopped.  At the time of the passing of the Act the Minister was empowered to add by regulation an extra two or three people.  That would seem to be a reasonable provision.  That was not sufficient for this Coalition Government.  They did away with the whole board.</P>
    <P>There was a budget of £2.25 million to deal with poverty and social deprivation. <Col N="951" /> Poverty and social deprivation can continue so far as this Coalition Government are concerned.  There are smaller signs in other areas.  Perhaps the Coalition will come back later with another Bill like this one to deal with poverty and social deprivation. Where they will get their membership I do not know, because the members have gone from the various bodies. In the meantime those who would have benefited from the operations of this board are left unaided and told that there will be another board later on</P>
    <P>That will have repercussions for the Coalition.  The chairman of the board was a distinguished man who served the country well.  He was the chairman of Gorta, Mr. Joe McGough.  The vice-chairman is the chairman of the National Federation of Social Services Councils.  There was no political association or affiliation involved but obviously the Coalition want to put in other people who have a special association to suit their own interests. A staff representative was appointed.  Mr. Patrick Doherty, the director of the North Western Centre for Learning and Development in Derry, made a great contribution in this area. There was a lecturer from the Department of Social Science in UCD and also the national secretary of Muintir na Tíre. The president was invited to come but because of commitments he was uanable to attend and the national secretary took his place.  There was a representative from the Departments of the Environment and Health, from community services, home helps, AnCO, Mercy Simms representing the Church of Ireland Social Services Committee, Sister Eucharia from Waterford, a voluntary social worker, Mr. Twomey from the Council for the Aged and the Society of St. Vincent De Paul.  These are people involved in the area of community development.</P>
    <P>This will mean another Bill will come before the House to frustrate the normal development which has taken place.  We are not dealing with an isolated incident. It is one of a number which are taking place behind the scenes.  Doubtless there will be others.  The Coalition in their <Col N="952" /> machiavellian way are butchering these boards in an unprecedented fashion. Ministers making appointments to boards should look for people with ability and something special to offer.  It can be difficult enough to get people with good experience and ability.  Very often they have other commitments and it is difficult to get them to give up their time and go to these boards.  How will they feel in future when they see what the Government did with An Bord Pleanála and with the National Community Development Agency?  They will be very reluctant to become involved.</P>
    <P>There were people on boards I was involved with who came from Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil backgrounds. There were also people who had no known political affiliations.  The Minister should be looking for people with experience who are involved in the life of the community.  How can they serve on State boards when they know that an incoming Government can let them go? The normal procedure was that members served out their full term.  If they were making a special contribution and wished to remain they were usually reappointed but if there were other people who were anxious to make a contribution and a board member's term was up it was a question of reappointment.  No-one really minds if they are not reappointed after they have served a term because they know that it is up to the Minister of the day to appoint someone else in their place.  However, if on the change of Government they find they are thrown on the sideline what will people say?  Will questions not be asked about what was wrong with them?  Were they doing something odd?  Anyone reading the Minister's speech would have to be very concerned about the innuendo contained in it.  It will reflect adversely on the present members of the board.  I am sure they are sensitive about that.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not worried about casting a slur on these people.  It is not sufficient to engage in this kind of innuendo and then back away and say you did not say anything specific about anybody.  The Minister is doing a disservice not just to this board or the National Community <Col N="953" /> Development Agency but to all other boards.  These are only two of all the bodies which give assistance to the State and perform valuable tasks on behalf of the State.  When individual members retire from the board the Minister would have an opportunity to appoint whoever he liked.  We all know that every week members of boards come to the end of their term of office.  Why was the Minister so greedy?  I am sure that there are many vacancies before the Cabinet at present waiting to be filled.  Next week there will be new ones and so on.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell us when replying why he did this.  His reasons so far do not satisfy me.  He probably does not realise how great a disservice he is doing these boards.  This is not the sole precedent.  There is another in the background waiting for similar treatment which has been mentioned by his colleague &mdash; it strikes me now that he is also a Labour Party colleague &mdash; Deputy Desmond. It is being done under the direction of the Taoiseach.  As I said, this is not an isolated incident.  It is being accompanied by similar activities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I appreciate that you and everybody else have had a fairly arduous day and that the matter I intend to discuss is not one which will create any great controversy.  I am hoping that in the time available to me and my colleague, the Minister of State, we will confirm that a mistake has been made in the matter of moneys which might have <Col N="954" /> gone to the 60 or so sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>For the past decade the State has given token financial recognition to these national sporting organisations for the tremendous work they do.  The word &ldquo;sport&rdquo; detracts from the importance of that work.  For me there is no more important work that can be done.  In other countries so much importance is attached to it that all this work is nationalised and colossal amounts of money are provided for it every year so that young and not so young men and women are able to employ their spare time gainfully in physical education.</P>
    <P>We are blessed in this country because we are unique in that the promoters and organisers of this vital work operate on a voluntary basis.  This is the highest form of patriotism.  It could be argued that it is true Christianity because these people look after their neighbours' children.  In the GAA and the various organisations catering for soccer, tennis, basketball and swimming we have a corps of people who are prepared to give up their spare time so that others can benefit.</P>
    <P>All the Government have been asked to do is to give token financial recognition which does no more than fill in the gap which remains when these good people have applied themselves to raising funds. The State's contribution has been insignificant. Even though the scheme of grants has been operating for the past ten years the total amount involved has not yet reached £0.5 million.</P>
    <P>The National Community Games cater for the interests of 500,000 young people all year round and the total grant they received last year was a mere £25,000. This organisation enables young people, North and South, to join together in active pursuit of physical exercise and recreation.  This year their grant is to be reduced by 10 per cent and they will receive only £22,000.  This is the figure which the Minister for Justice gave as representing the cost of keeping one prisoner in Mountjoy.  It is worth pondering on our sense of values.  The GAA receive about £35,000 and the organisation catering for soccer receive about £20,000.</P>
    <P>Day after day there are men and <Col N="955" /> women all over the country who are prepared to leave their own homes to attend to the needs of their own and their neighbours' children.  They thereby participate in excellent community work for which they are the better and they do not expect payment.  However, they have become accustomed to national recognition of their good work.  We know that money is scarce and that scarcity was heralded by our Government.  During my period as Minister of State with responsibility for youth and sport and during the terms of my successors, Deputies GeogheganQuinn and Keating, it was possible to raise these grants by an average of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>In November last year when our Government were preparing the Estimates they provided for an increase of only 1 per cent because of the difficulties at the time.  However miserable or inadequate it was, that provision was made. The amount provided last year was £694,000, including the large grant of £200,000 to Cospóir.  The proposed increase of 1 per cent would have raised the total amount to £700,000 but it has been reduced instead to £609,000 due to the reduction of 10 per cent imposed by this Government.  These 62 organisations catering for athletics, handball, boxing, community games and other sports have suffered as a result.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether in your younger days you ever played cards, a Cheann Comhairle.  I started playing cards with my late father and my mother, who is alive, and we used to play penny &ldquo;25&rdquo;. When we had finished, and I had lost, my father, the Lord have mercy on him, would give me a very telling lesson in economics.  He would say: &ldquo;Now, Jim, you have paid out a penny to each of us, that is fourpence, but you must remember you have also lost another fourpence by not winning, so your total loss is eightpence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is very wise to ponder that, especially in this case.  We have reduced aid to the Community Games who last year got a grant of £25,000 and who this year should have been getting another 10 per cent. We have docked them £2,000, so their <Col N="956" /> total loss is £4,000.  If we had given them only 1 per cent that loss would have been reduced and apart from everything else the psychological reaction would not have been as it is because they would not have got what I regard as a kick in the teeth which a 10 per cent reduction, inadvertently, signifies.</P>
    <P>The total provision for Youth and Sport was £1.9 million.  There was a segregation of Youth from Sport &mdash; Youth went to the Department of Labour.  They did not suffer because they got more than 1 per cent.  The youth organisations are very happy.</P>
    <P>I was happy to share a platform with the Minister with responsibility for Youth, Deputy George Birmingham, and I complimented him because he was able to get this increase.  I did not know then that on the following day I would learn the sad news that whereas the Youth grant went up, the Sports grant went down by 10 per cent.  In the bureaucratic arrangement for the transfer of moneys between the Departments of Education and Labour, the eye of the Minister responsible for Sport, I will not say was wiped, but it was not wide open enough to see where the money was going.</P>
    <P>The initial provision was there.  We are sometimes reminded that this Government inherited the provisional Estimates prepared by the Fianna Fáil Government. We are always told that, when an Estimate did not fit the bill or meet requirements.  This budget was prepared by our Government.  The figures are there to show that there should have been a 1 per cent increase for all sporting organisations.  In fact there is a 10 per cent decrease by this Government.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to indicate to me why that money disappeared.  I hope it will be discovered how it disappeared and that, having discovered the institutional or bureaucratic mistake that occurred, the Minister will apply himself to recovering it so that sporting organisations will at least be able to acknowledge that they are not being rebuffed, as they are led to believe they were.  The Minister of State has been meeting them and I am sure he <Col N="957" /> is aware of the disappointment and annoyance they felt.</P>
    <P>Supposing all these great patriotic people were to withdraw from the 62 organisations tomorrow, what would happen?  I realise they have not the same clout as trade unions, that they cannot stop planes from flying or milk from being delivered to creameries, or stand out in the middle of roads and interfere with the economic life of the country, but that is a virtue and we should not take advantage of their high sense of patriotism and generosity because we know they will not do it.  We should not force them even to contemplate it.  Rather should we discover where the £100,000 went.</P>
    <P>The budget for the Department of Education is £900 million and it is not too much to look for and to provide the allocation for these organisations, inadequate and miserable as it was, as prepared by our Government.  However, it is 11 per cent to 12 per cent in excess of what they have got.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prejudice the case or to labour the point.  I know these great people would not wish me to do it but I know that the temper and mood of these organisations has been disheartened and will militate against the advancement made under successive Governments in the last decade.  I do not require the 20 minutes that you indicated I had because I do not propose to say anything more. The Minister of State, I know, will accept that at least an increase of 1 per cent was provided for and the fact is that there was a decrease of 10 per cent.  Therefore, the money must have strayed away from the fund the Minister of State should have had to give to these great organisations. I hope the Minister will carry out an inquiry in the Department to see where it went and to try to restore it to its rightful place.  This would give to these 62 organisations the minimum recognition they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed) Donal Creed">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank Deputy Tunney for raising this matter because any kind of discussion on sport or of any promotional activity of this kind is necessary to try to emphasise the <Col N="958" /> importance of sport.  That may not have been Deputy Tunney's intention but it is important to try to promote interest in sport generally.  I do not disagree with Deputy Tunney's tributes to the sporting organisations and particularly the people who give their time voluntarily to promote games, particularly among our young people.  As he said, they are doing an extremely good job, they are the present-day patriots.  During my term of office I will be able to give them all the support possible.</P>
      <P>First of all I want to put on the record the grant aid given to sporting organisations. Government support for sport has been available now for about 13 years and during that period considerable developments have occurred in all aspects of sport.  It would be my desire to provide substantially increased funding for sport at all levels in the current year but we are all aware that the country is in the grip of a serious recession.</P>
      <P>The global situation in regard to the State's finances, the major errors which occurred in the handling of the economy from the latter part of the seventies and the measures which the Government have adopted &mdash; unpalatable as they may be in the short-term, but essential as a first step towards bringing about a gradual improvement in the State's finances and eliminating the current budget deficit on a phased basis &mdash; these were clearly outlined in the Financial Statement of the Minister for Finance on 9 February last when he introduced the 1983 budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Control of public expenditure is a vital component of the Government's policy. In exercising this control the Government found it necessary to make adjustments in expenditure in the case of a wide range of State services.  The provision in subhead G.3 of Vote 28 is £619,000 in 1983, and represents a decrease of £76,000 on the out-turn for 1982.  In this connection I should also draw attention, however, to the increased provision in subhead D.10 of the same Vote for grants to voluntary sports organisations towards the employment of development officers, and to an increase of £40,000 to vocational education committees for their youth and sport funds.  I have increased <Col N="959" /> the grant payable to the Olympic Council of Ireland to £100,000 this year, an increase of £25,000, in recognition of the importance of this pre-Olympic year to the preparation of athletes for the 1984 Olympic Games.  Of the 61 national governing bodies of sport which receive grant-aid, 22 are affiliated to the Olympic Council of Ireland and those organisations who have athletes of potential Olympic calibre will benefit from the increased grant to the Olympic Council.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that anything like enough support or grant aid.  I would love to be in a position to quadruple that amount of money.  I understand the difficulties and the problems.  I understand the expense involved.  I have had a number of meetings with those people and in my opinion this does not meet the demand but in the present economic climate I have no magic wand to get money and I cannot achieve the miracle of the loaves and fishes.  I have no means at my disposal to increase that grant.</P>
    <P>The importance of providing our athletes with proper training for the Olympic Games must not be under-estimated. Success at the Olympic Games not only brings prestige to a country but also serves as a source of national pride which reaps beneficial results throughout society and has repercussions far beyond the radius of the winners' immediate environment. Gifted athletes raise community morale and inspire both young and old to participate in sport.  There is evidence that the youth of the nation will try to emulate their heroes and for this reason there is ample justification for singling out the Olympic Council of Ireland for increased grant aid in these difficult and stringent times.</P>
    <P>As already stated, I have been successful in achieving an increase in the youth and sport fund to vocational education committees &mdash; from £660,000 in 1982 to £700,000 in the current year.  This fund is allocated to the vocational education committees to enable them to respond to the needs of youth and sports bodies and organisations at local level.  This is a very important aspect of funding for sport and should not be overlooked when considering <Col N="960" /> the provision in this area.  Without support for local enterprise in sport, the national organisations cannot develop and it will be open to the clubs affiliated to National Governing Bodies of Sport to seek assistance from this fund from their local Vocational Education Committees.</P>
    <P>In order to maximise the value of this sum of £700,000, I have decided to allocate it under a number of different headings: firstly each Vocational Education Committee will receive a youth and sport grant for the purpose of initiating programmes in sports leadership, organising courses in coaching, sports administration or any other aspect of sport if there is a perceived need within the locality, purchasing sports equipment for community usage, giving grants to local sports bodies and organisations for special projects, etc.</P>
    <P>Secondly, grants will be available for the provision, replacement or renewal of equipment in outdoor education centres. Outdoor Education is a very important aspect of youth development and the equipment which will be available at the centres will enable all groups who attend courses to participate, irrespective of whether or not they are in a position to purchase their own equipment.</P>
    <P>I have also made provision for a scheme of grants to assist special projects in disadvantaged areas, and for special grant aid to be paid to County Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education Committees for the development of youth services.  These latter areas have been identified as requiring special attention in this area and I am happy to be in a position to respond to the need.</P>
    <P>An additional amount of £80,000 provided towards the employment of development officers in sport and community organisation will mean that a sports body which has appointed a development officer under this scheme will get an increase of £2,000 in the grant this year.  The House will be aware that Cospóir, The National Sports Council, acts on behalf of the Government to promote initiatives and innovative measures in regard to the development of sport and physical recreation as leisure pursuits.  The sports <Col N="961" /> council has a particular role to play in promoting the concept of Sport for All among all sections, levels, age groups in our society.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that the Sports Council by combining ingenuity and good economy, has produced an excellent sport for all programme.  On the one hand the sports council is promoting the general theme of sport and the older person during the year and has been given very valuable assistance, on a voluntary basis, by the sports organisations, the sports advisory bodies under the vocational education committees and by many individual persons involved in sport and physical recreation.</P>
    <P>At the younger end of the scale, we have seen the introduction of a sport for all day in all our national schools on 31 May which, I am assured by teachers and Cospóir, was a huge success, and which, indeed, is a great tribute to our selfless national teachers who organised the day's events.  On that day I visited some of the schools in this city and I was very pleased to see voluntary organisations, teachers and parents combining in celebrating that sport for all day.</P>
    <P>With limited means, Cospóir has many promotions in the pipeline this year.  The sports council will for instance be specially promoting bowling, badminton, mini-sports, sailing for young people, a bike week with RTE Radio 2, and is giving assistance to the now famous Dublin Marathon, An Óige walk day and other events of this nature.  Under its auspices many enterprising local programmes have been planned by the sports advisory bodies which act under the aegis of the vocational education committees. The major Conference on Recreational Facilities for our Young People held by the County Cork Sports Advisory Body and the important seminars on sports injuries held by Counties Cavan and Mayo Sports Advisory Bodies are but examples of the fine work being done, albeit with limited budgets.  I would like to take this opportunity to publicly express my appreciation of the great work being done by Cospóir and through the sports advisory bodies and the vocational education committees in developing <Col N="962" /> sport for all throughout the country for the general good of our citizens and our young people in particular.  In doing so, I am furthermore conscious that the members of Cospóir and the sports advisory bodies are all working together in a purely voluntary capacity for the good of their country, they being also, of course, representative of the wide and varied spectrum of sporting activity.</P>
    <P>I accept the point made by Deputy Tunney that it is very important psychologically and otherwise that those organisations and those people who give their time to these activities should know in advance what the grant aid will be so that they can budget for whatever programme they have in mind.  I have said before that I believe a more favourable and more regular funding mechanism must be introduced to provide the necessary financial aid for those good people who are making such a very valuable and necessary contribution towards the development of sport generally.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Tunney in paying tribute to all those people who are playing such an important role.  The Deputy mentioned the cost of keeping people in institutions.  He mentioned prisoners.  I accept what he said 100 per cent.  Young people who are involved in games do not get involved in anti-social behaviour. They grow up to be good citizens.  We should provide an incentive for young people to get away from the drugs scene, the glue sniffing, the vandalism and the violence which are so unnecessary.  I do not want to see a Minister with responsibility for sport taking over completely with a grant aid.  Side by side with whatever grant aid is available I want to promote community involvement and community spirit.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>The information sought in respect of applications under the Married Women (Maintenance in Case of Desertion) Act, 1886 is not available because separate statistics relating to such applications were not compiled in the District Court.  That Act was repealed by the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, which came into operation on 6 May 1976.</P>
    <P>Annual statistics in respect of maintenance and barring applications have been kept only since the year which commenced on 1 August 1978.</P>
    <P>The figures for applications made to the Provincial District Courts for Protection Orders under the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, during the year ended 31 July 1982, are not yet available.  The information will be supplied to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The District Court did not have jurisdiction under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, until the commencement of the Courts Act, 1981, on 12 May 1982.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is vast duplication of work or that there is a waste of public funds in the present administration of the schemes of new house grants and house improvement grants.  Local authority inspections do not necessarily coincide with inspections for housing grants purposes and do not cover all grant applications.  There are, however, certain advantages associated with devolution such as making the service more accessible to the general public. There are difficulties in the way of devolution relating mainly to costs, linkages with associated national schemes, staffing problems and also certain criteria of eligibility.  I am having an examination made of these difficulties to see if a solution can be found.</P>

      <P>The person in question is awaiting fixed appliance orthodontic treatment.  This treatment is carried out by orthodontists in private practice on behalf of the health boards and in normal circumstances treatment of the cases in question would now be in progress.  However, the Department of Health have been endeavouring for nearly two years to get agreement with the private orthodontists on a scale of charges for the treatment and in the absence of agreement the issue of authorisations to proceed with treatments was suspended.  As a result of recent discussions with the private orthodontists I am hopeful that agreement will shortly be reached so that treatments can again be proceeded with.</P>
      <P>Applications will be invited soon for a new full-time post of consultant orthodontist for the Western Health Board. The filling of this post should greatly reduce the waiting period for orthodontic treatment in the area.</P>

    <P>However, an applicant for unemployment benefit must also be genuinely seeking work to satisfy the condition of being available for work.  During the course of <Col N="778" /> inquiries the person concerned stated that he was not looking for work but was awaiting seasonal work only when it became available.  His claim was accordingly disallowed on the grounds that he was not available for work.</P>
    <P>He appealed against the disallowance but following an oral hearing of his case on 17 May 1983 at which he attended an appeals officer upheld the disallowance.</P>
    <P>He continued to sign as unemployed and his case was reviewed from 18 May 1983.  Following the completion of further inquiries his claim was again disallowed on the grounds that the was not available for work.  He has not appealed against the decision to date.</P>

      <P>Official estimates of the labour force (i.e. persons at work and persons out of work) are compiled in respect of mid-April of each year.  The following table shows the labour force and the number of persons out of work for the period since 1957; the figures are in thousands.  The estimated number of persons out of work is also shown expressed as a percentage of the total labour force.</P>

    <P>Note:</P>
    <P>(1)  Figures for 1961, 1966 and 1971 are based on the census of population taken in those years. For other years prior to 1971 trend indicators were used to interpolate for non-census years.</P>
    <P>(2)  A new series, commencing with 1975, was introduced in 1980.  This series is not directly comparable with the earlier one and it has not as yet proved possible to link the two series through the 1972-74 period.  The new series derived basically from the 1975, 1977 and 1979 labour force surveys and trend indicators were used to interpolate the 1976 and 1978 figures. The results of an analysis of a 5 per cent sample of 1981 census of population returns were adjusted to allow as far as possible for differences between census and labour force survey methodology and used in conjunction with available indicators to prepare comparable 1981 estimates.  Trend indicators were then used to interpolate the 1980 figures and provide estimates for 1982.</P>
    <P>(3)  The 1980-82 estimates are provisional pending the final results of the 1981 census of population and the results of the 1983 labour force survey which is presently being undertaken.</P>
    <P>(4)  Persons not yet at work having left full time education are excluded from the table.</P>

      <P>Direct information on migration, outwards or inwards, is not available.  The only reliable estimates of migration flows are those for net migration between successive censuses of population. The estimates for these periods are compiled by relating intercensal population changes to data for births and deaths in the same periods.  All available indicators are used to derive annual estimates constrained by the requirement for consistency with such intercensal estimates as are available.</P>
      <P>The following table gives an estimate of the population at mid-April for each year from 1957 to 1982 and an estimate of net migration in the following 12-month period; the figures are in thousands. The estimated net migration is also expressed as a percentage of the starting population.</P>

      <P>As only drivers and front seat passengers in certain cars, station-wagons and light goods vehicles are obliged to wear seat-belts, it is assumed that the Deputy's question refers to fatalities among these categories of road users only.  Although detailed road accident statistics for 1982 are not yet available, I understand from An Foras Forbartha that 533 persons were killed in road accidents in 1982.  Of these, 144 were drivers of whom 85 or 59 per cent are recorded as not wearing seat belts.  Sixty-six front seat passengers were killed, of whom 39 or 59 per cent are recorded as not wearing seat belts.</P>

      <P>There is no accepted comparision for pay purposes between TDs and Senators and ranks in the public service.</P>
      <P>The annual allowance payable at present to a TD, £13,802, lies within the salary scale for the civil service grade of assistant principal, £12,721 to £15,107. The annual allowance payable at present to a Senator, £7,619, lies within the salary scale for the civil service grade of executive officer, £5,417 to £10,533.  It might be added in this regard that the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, who carried out a survey of the hours of work and other occupations of parliamentarians in connection with their 1972 report, concluded that it was not appropriate for them, in proposing the level of allowance for Senators, to proceed on the basis of unqualified comparisions with full-time occupations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is relevant, as regards level of remuneration, to add that the phased increases provided for in the Public Service pay agreement of December 1981, 2 per cent (or £4 a week, whichever is the greater) from 1 December 1981, 6 per cent from 1 March 1982 and 5 per cent from 1 January 1983, were applied to the salaries of the civil service grades referred to; they have not been applied to the allowances of TDs and Senators.  Had they <Col N="795" /> been, the annual allowance payable to a TD would now be £15,669 which lies between the maximum of the scale for assistant principal and the minimum (£16,370) of the scale for principal.  A Senator would now receive £8,713 which lies within the scales for a number of general civil service grades i.e. administrative officers, executive officer and staff officer.</P>

However, I wish to assure the Deputy that, within these constraints, it is my intention to have the office of Ombudsman established as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As regards the cost of the office of Ombudsman the Ombudsman Act, 1980 provides that the person appointed as Ombudsman be paid a salary equivalent to that of a High Court Judge.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that it is necessary to use the Naval Service as an aid to the civil power in the enforcement of statutory salmon conservation measures at sea and that the action taken by the Naval Service to that end is justified. In 1983 Naval patrols are covering all salmon fishing areas on a rota basis in so far as resources permit.</P>
      <P>Salmon conservation measures are designed to safeguard the future of our badly depleted salmon stocks in the interests of Irish fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the reason no allowance is made for the number of children in a family when considering eligibility for hospital service cards; when he will be in a position to do so; if he accepts that a married couple with five children are not in the same position financially as a couple with no family if they both have the same income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The persons who are entitled to hospital services cards are those whose incomes in the year ended 5 April, 1983 were less than £11,000.  These cards refer principally to entitlement to free hospital consultant services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criterion of eligibility for a hospital services card is income.  Acceptable evidence of income can be made available in documentation which is routinely provided for income tax purposes.  It was not practicable, when these eligibility arrangements were being introduced, to include other criteria of eligibility, such as the number of dependant children in a family, because of the major administrative <Col N="813" /> burden which would be imposed on the staffs of health boards and hospitals in establishing the accuracy of this information.  However, it has been provided that a hospital services card may be issued to a person with income over the limit if it is established that the required services cannot be provided without undue hardship.  The number of dependants is taken into account in deciding whether hardship might arise.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the hospital services card relates mainly to eligibility for free hospital consultant services.  All persons, whether they are eligible for hospital services cards or not, are entitled to hospital services in public wards without charge by the hospital.  Persons who may be liable for consultant charges can, and in most cases do, provide for payment of these charges through membership of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  I accept that a married couple with five children may not be in the same position financially as a couple with no family if they both have the same income. I am having the entire subject of hospital eligibility arrangements reviewed.  The matters which are raised in this question will be included in this review.</P>

      <P>The person concerned did not satisfy the contribution condition for receipt of unemployment benefit when he claimed on 7 February 1983 and the matter was referred to a social welfare officer to pursue the non payment of contributions. Inquiries are still being made in the case but pending the completion of investigations the non-paid contributions were recently treated as paid for the purpose of his unemployment benefit claim and payment at £27.80 weekly has been allowed.</P>

Consequently, this can result in the combined total of the contributory and non-contributory pensions paid to a husband and wife being greater than the amount of contributory pension, including adult dependant's allowance, paid to a husband where his wife has not claimed or is not entitled to a higher rate of non-contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned is in receipt of old age contributory pension since 7 October 1977.  His rate of pension included an adult dependant's allowance in respect of his wife, the current rate of <Col N="825" /> which is £30.05 per week where the dependant is of age 66 years or over.  His wife claimed a non-contributory old age pension on 11 February 1983 and following an investigation of the couple's means this was awarded to her at the maximum rate of £34.45 per week with effect from the date of claim.  Unfortunately, she died before any payment of the non-contributory pension was made but arrears of £44 being the amount of the non-contributory old age pension payable from 11 February 1983 up to her death on 21 April, less the amount of the adult dependant allowance paid in respect of her during this period, were issued to her husband by payable order on 20 June 1983.</P>

      <P>An application for free electricity allowance in this case was disallowed in March 1983 on the grounds that the person concerned had not reached 66 years of age.  In the light of the evidence regarding his date of birth which was recently furnished by the Deputy, the application has now been approved.  The ESB have been instructed to apply the allowance to his electricity account form the May-June 1983 billing period onwards.</P>

      <P>Following the completion of inquiries to ascertain why the person concerned did not register with National Manpower Service, her unemployment benefit claim was disallowed from 3 March 1983 on the grounds that she was not available for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing of her <Col N="826" /> appeal on 10 May 1983.  However, the appeals officer upheld the disallowance of her case.</P>
    <P>She continued to sign as unemployed and her case was reviewed.  A deciding officer was satisfied that she was making genuine efforts to find work and that she fulfilled the condition of being available for work from 12 May 1983.  Her claim was allowed at the weekly rate of £30.50 from 12 May 1983 to 6 June 1983 after which she is known to have resumed work.</P>
    <P>She is being written to and asked to call to her local office for payment of the arrears due to her.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been paid widow's non-contributory pension at the rate of £33.80 per week with effect from 25 February 1983.  This was the maximum personal rate of pension payable to a widow under 66 years of age.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the budget provisions this rate will be increased to £37.85 per week with effect from 1 July 1983.  A supplementary pension order book for the amount of the increase has been issued to the post office of payment for collection by her.</P>
      <P>Her entitlement to a widow's contributory pension is at present being examined. A decision on this will be issued when inquiries have been completed.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Garda authorities have informed me that they do not consider that the provision of a Garda station at Orwell Park would be warranted.  They report that foot and mobile patrols from Rathfarnham station operate in the Orwell Park area to the maximum extent possible having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services.  There has been a substantial increase in Garda strength at Rathfarnham station over the past 12 months and two additional gardaí are being assigned there on 1 July.  The extra manpower has enabled the local Garda to operate improved patrolling arrangements for all areas of the Rathfarnham Garda sub-district, and the question of further improvements in the Garda service there will be considered according as additional manpower becomes available for assignment.</P>
