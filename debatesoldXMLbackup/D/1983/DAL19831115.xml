    <P>1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, made it clear during his discussions with her that the British view was that, if a milk levy was introduced, Britain would strongly oppose exemptions from the levy for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is satisfied that the recommendations on the super-levy put forward by the Greek Minister for State at the Foreign Office, Mr. Grigoris Varfis, reflect accurately his press conference on his Greek visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subjects on which the Prime Minister and I exchanged views during our recent meeting are outlined in my statement to the House on 8 November.  As I said then, the paper put forward by the Greek Presidency recognises the existence of a special Irish problem.  However, the Presidency's proposal to deal with this problem is not in its present form acceptable to the Government.  We shall, <Col N="2166" /> therefore, be seeking a derogation from the four-year super-levy proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that section of the answer which deals with Question No. 1, does the Taoiseach recall having said, after the Summit meeting with Mrs. Thatcher, that he had explained very clearly our position on the super-levy but is it not the reality that he cut no ice with her on this subject as is evident from the special hostility shown later in the week by the British Government to our agricultural interests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For obvious reasons I do not propose to go into the negotiations in any detail but there are a number of further meetings to take place before the Athens Summit at which the matter will be decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not have done a far better job of work in London if he had left Mrs. Thatcher in no doubt that Ireland would oppose the super-levy, using the veto if necessary, instead of merely, as he has said, explaining fully our position to her?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to the British Prime Minister, as I explained to other Governments, that the application of the super-levy to Ireland is unacceptable to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, in relation to Question No. 1, would the Taoiseach agree that it is very difficult to create good relations with our nearest neighbour when, apart altogether from the Northern Ireland question, they attack our vital national interest?  Would he agree also that one would not find such hostility in respect of a vital national interest between, for example, the Nordic and the Benelux countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very good question. Are you not allowing the Taoiseach to answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2167" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Argument is not in order at Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 2, in view of the fact that the present Greek proposals on the super-levy are totally unacceptable to Ireland, would the Taoiseach agree that he overestimated the extent to which he won Greek support for Ireland's position on this matter? Would he agree also that his statement that Mr. Papandreou had said that his Government understood fully the problems faced by Ireland in terms of the present proposal and understood our just demands was somewhat misleading?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the Deputy must distinguish between the position of the Greek Government as one of ten Governments and the position of the Presidency in putting forward a compromise proposal at a particular stage in the negotiations, taking account of the potential reaction of the people to those proposals.  From his own experience, the Deputy will recognise that they are distinct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On his return home did the Taoiseach not exaggerate greatly the importance of the meeting he had with the Greek Prime Minister and the Greek Minister for State at the Foreign Office in relation to the super-levy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was most careful not to overstate anything.  It would be undesirable to do so in discussions of this kind. The Presidency proposal contains two ingredients which are of great importance from our point of view.  One is the proposal that the super-levy be for a limited period, that it be subject to review even before the end of that period, as distinct from the situation before then when it was spoken of as being of indefinite duration. Obviously, the limited period proposal is helpful to us in the context of seeking a derogation because a derogation is easier to conceive of for a limited than for an indefinite period.  The other element in the proposal which is of great value to us, is the recognition that there <Col N="2168" /> is a special Irish problem in this matter, not a problem affecting a number of countries but a special Irish problem.  The solution suggested as a compromise at this stage is not acceptable to us.  Perhaps one would not expect that at this stage in the negotiations one would have reached the point where proposals to meet our situation would have been put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that we cannot expect any support from the British Government in protecting our vital national interest so far as the introduction of the super-levy is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not prejudge what the attitude of any Government will be in Athens on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that since his meeting with Mrs. Thatcher all public statements from representatives of the British Government indicate that we cannot expect any support from them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What arrangements has the Taoiseach made to meet the remaining Heads of State of member countries before the Athens Summit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make such arrangements to meet Heads of State as may seem appropriate at any particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that he gave a commitment that he would meet all Heads of State of member countries before the Athens meeting to make sure that he had an opportunity of putting our point of view to them with regard to the implications of the introduction of the super-levy for this country?  Would the Taoiseach continue to guarantee to us here that he is prepared to meet all other Heads of State before the Athens meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I never gave any such <Col N="2169" /> guarantee to meet all Heads of Government, not State.  I said I would take such steps as seemed appropriate to meet Heads of Government.  I have done so and am doing so.  At no stage did I say that I would meet all of them or seek to meet all of them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when a telephone service will be provided for a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11 as the reply to a previous parliamentary question in July 1982 stated that service would be provided in about one year.</P>

      <P>There is meter recording equipment in the local telephone exchange for every automatic telephone exchange line.  I assume, therefore, that what the Deputy has in mind is the fitting of meters in subscribers' premises.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to supply meters in all subscribers' premises.  These meters are costly and many subscribers may not wish to have them in view of the costs involved.  Suitable home meters are expected to be available shortly as an optional extra for all those who wish to rent them.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is widespread concern in the community as to the accuracy of telephone bills and accounts?  Furthermore, in order to avoid either his Department or An Bord Telecom incurring the additional expense of having to investigate regularly the accuracy of such accounts, would he not agree that it would be desirable, as a matter of practice, that all future telephones supplied would automatically have a registering or meter system in-built from which the telephone user could ascertain the number of calls made and which could correspond with a similar system at the exchange in order to eliminate the continuous problems arising in this area?</P>

I might tell the Deputy, <Col N="2173" /> for his information, that meters will be available from the end of this month.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Not all of us find standing Ministers intimidating.  Can the Minister indicate whether the Department will accept the readings of such meters as accurately reflecting the number of telephone calls so that, in the event of a dispute arising as to the accuracy of an account the Department will accept the number of telephone calls having been <Col N="2174" /> made as those registered on such a meter?  Furthermore, would the Minister not agree that this type of recording device should be built into the telephones that subscribers use and that there should not be additional charges for merely trying to ensure that one has an accurate record of the number of telephone calls made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, there is a charge for the equipment and that charge will remain unless some new decision is taken when the new board take over on 1 January next.  Secondly, the reading of the meter will be accepted by the Department provided there has been no interference with the meter.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the type of meter about which he is talking would be of little or no use to the subscriber?  Would the Minister not examine the possibility of having the type of meter issued to subscribers&mdash;a meter that will have a print-out, that will bear the date, the name of the person to whom the call was made, to whatever number it may have been and also the charge for that call?  That is the sort of information that subscribers need.  Otherwise the extreme wave of unrest obtaining with regard to charging for Post Office accounts will continue.  What I am endeavouring to point out to the Minister is that the type of meter about which we are now talking is inadequate before it is issued.</P>

The equipment metering his calls was checked and a letter was sent to him on 30 May 1983 informing him that there was no evidence of any technical fault and maintaining the account. The matter has been reviewed but no reason is seen to modify the account. Separately, the subscriber reported that his phone had been out of order for a period in October-November 1982 &mdash; not 1983 as stated by the Deputy &mdash; and a rebate for the period he was without service is being arranged.</P>

      <P>I am so aware.</P>
      <P>For the current telephone development programme it was necessary to acquire some 500 sites throughout the country for telephone exchange buildings, staff, stores, training, etc.  In Limerick, a site at Roxboro was bought for use for development primarily as a depot for staff and as a training centre. The normal practice of requiring completion of legal formalities to be subject to receipt of planning approval was not insisted on because the Department had reason to believe that planning permission for use of the site as a training centre, at least, would be forthcoming and because the owner of the site was not prepared to wait.</P>
      <P>Later, when the county council indicated that permission for an engineering depot would not be forthcoming for the Roxboro property, an alternative site for this purpose was obtained.  Because of restrictions on capital spending on buildings, it has not been possible to proceed with development of the second site which, incidentally, was later exchanged for another site offered by Shannon Free Airport Development Company.</P>
      <P>The training needs have been met in the meantime by a separate development on an existing site.  The disposal of the Roxboro property, in which Limerick Corporation have expressed an interest, is now being pursued.</P>

The complainant, if any, is normally advised of the result of such investigations and other appropriate action, including the question of legal proceedings, and the need to advise the Government or other members of the Government who may be concerned is considered, depending on the circumstances in each case.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, a complaint of unauthorised interception of a telephone call was received from the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  My information is that treatment of the case subsequently was in conformity with normal practice.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to answer the question which I have put to him here by way of this Parliamentary Question, which is if he will confirm that officers of his Department represented, in the presence of witnesses, that their inquiry would be confidential to his Department?  Would the Minister state whether that is so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained in my reply that all investigations of this kind are carried out on a confidential basis.  This one was no exception. <Col N="2192" /> However, to interpret this as meaning that nobody outside the Department would be advised of the result of such investigations would be quite wrong.  If, for example, an investigation reveals evidence that a breach of the law may have been involved, the Director of Public Prosecutions would have to be consulted. When an inquiry is initiated as a result of a complaint, obviously the complainant would be entitled to know the action taken.  The Deputy must be aware, too, that my Department form part of an executive arm of Government and the Government have corporate responsibility, that the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs are both members of the Government and that no Minister operates in isolation from Government as a whole or from other Ministers who may be concerned with particular matters arising from time to time.</P>

A reconciliation statement was normally prepared quarterly to explain these discrepancies.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may recall, the telephone billing system was seriously disrupted during 1981 and 1982 following the two prolonged strikes in 1978 and 1979.  All available staff resources were concentrated on collection of revenue due and dealing with subscriber queries and complaints.  As a result, work on reconciling the discrepancies was not attended to and the differences between receipts from kiosks and recorded metered user in those years do not therefore reflect the true position.  The standard reconciliation procedures have been fully restored since early this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday last I <Col N="2339" /> spoke about the drug problem in Ireland and particularly in Dublin.  It has got out of hand.  In the few minutes at my disposal then, I echoed Deputy Briscoe's demand that capital punishment be re-introduced for drug pushers, particularly heroin pushers.  I will take up that matter later.</P>
      <P>First of all, I want to express my concern and horror at the absence of law and order throughout the State.  There is no doubt in the minds of ordinary people that the absence of law and order is the biggest problem confronting the country, on a par with the economy and unemployment. The unemployment problem is one that no Government can attack successfully; that of law and order should be and must be solved.  Indeed, it is the responsibility of successive Governments to provide a state of law and order for the people, and its absence is a direct indictment of previous Governments who have failed to provide protection for the people.  Every county in Ireland, perhaps with the exception of deeply rural ones, has watched the inexorable increase in crime in the last 15 years and now the problem has got out of hand in most of the country.  We are fighting only a rearguard action against it.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Government must declare war on criminals.  I am afraid we have gone soft, and the blame can be laid on politicians and the Judiciary.  For many years Ireland was a relatively peaceful backwater from the point of view of crime.  Now it has been turned into a haven for criminals.  In Dublin crime is the biggest, indeed the only growth business, and throughout the country it has got out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hears alarming stories of prostitution, vice and protection rackets in Grafton Street, O'Connell Street and throughout the whole of the centre city. Can we as a nation accept that?  The only way in which we can curb that, stamp it out, is by declaring war on criminals, whether subversives or common or garden criminals.  War must be declared on them.  Terror tactics must be adopted in the shape of appropriate sentences and other tough measures.  Last week while <Col N="2340" /> canvassing in Dublin I witnessed the appalling spectacle when I called at doors of people cowering behind them in fear. This is totally unacceptable.  I heard stories of elderly ladies locking themselves in from 3 p.m. on winter days.</P>
    <P>This is a total indictment of successive Governments.  There is lack of effective measures and this has been so in recent years.  We must re-introduce the deterrents which have been dropped.  It is that dropping of them that has brought us to this terrible pitch.  Some Deputies have said this is because of the absence of discipline in homes.  That is true to a certain extent but it applies not only to homes but in schools and the courts.</P>
    <P>Deputies suggested that parents should be made answerable for the crimes of their children.  I am not so sure that is a good suggestion because in very many cases parents are helpless when it comes to enforcing discipline.  I believe it is in the schools discipline is required.  Several years ago corporal punishment was abolished in the schools with the result that some of the schools can now be described as blackboard jungles.  As a result the children from these schools as they progress through life turn to vandalism and crime.  The situation is a very serious one. The amount of money being lost to the Exchequer as a result of crime, be it ordinary crime or subversive crime, is quite horrifying.  These millions of pounds could be used to provide employment for the thousands of children leaving school every year.  We just cannot afford crime.  The only way we can tackle the problem is by getting to grips with it. To get to grips with it we need strong government.  The people demand that. They do not expect economic miracles or to see the unemployment situation dramatically altered.  The great majority are law-abiding people and they demand and expect a reasonable level of law and order.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say I believe we are fighting a losing battle.  I believe the battle might well be considered very extreme and right wing but I make no apology for that because I believe it is the liberal influence permeating Irish society today which is largely responsible for the <Col N="2341" /> absence of law and order.  Why should we live in such an unreal world?  There are so many liberal influences in society today and so many civil rights organisations that they have obviously made their mark.  While I commend many of these for their compassion they are in my opinion living in an unreal world.  Crime exists and evil exists.  These people have their own high principles and they refuse to believe others will engage in crime and so they think it is right to have this liberal approach.  Why are they so liberal?  Why take this contradictory attitude towards sentences?  It passes my understanding. It also passes the understanding of the man-in-the-street.  There should be mandatory sentences for crimes of violence. Some of the sentences imposed in our courts are inexplicable.</P>
    <P>I would like now to contrast the situation in Northern Ireland with that in the Republic.  I lived seven miles from the Border.  I have worked in Northern Ireland for the last seven years and I would like now to take this opportunity to dispel the notion that life in Northern Ireland is horrific and one goes in terror of one's life when one crosses the Border. That is not the case.  If one leaves out what is euphemistically called &ldquo;political crime&rdquo; the level of ordinary crime in the North is far lower than that in the South. Last year in Newry, a county town, in a catchment area of 45,000 people, 221 were charged with crimes ranging from simple drunkenness to burglary.  In a comparable area in Dundalk, with a catchment area of 45,000 people, 559 were charged in Dundalk court.  That is a horrific indictment of the level of criminal activity in the South and in my own area in particular.  It should dispel the notion many have in the South that living in the North is highly dangerous.</P>
    <P>With regard to jails, I said on an earlier occasion here that if we need jails in every county we should build them.  I am sure we could find the money.  If we could build a residence for the Irish Ambassador in Peking at a cost of £600,000 surely we could find the money to build jails.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say there is a building programme into 1987. There is a demand for more jails today. <Col N="2342" /> If prisoners have to be housed two and three to a cell, so be it.  They have transgressed against society.  I am interested in the victims.  I am not particularly interested in the criminals.  I believe conditions in too many of our jails are too luxurious.  Previous speakers have referred to some jails as hotels.  I do not regard these conditions as necessary.  The old fashioned concept was that, while prisoners were not abused, the going was tough and the result was that, at the end of their sentences, they came out with a firm resolve they would never go back again.  There is no need for luxurious jails.  We need more jails and we need not spend tremendous sums providing them.</P>
    <P>With regard to police methods, I support the Garda Síochána.  We have a police force of which we can be very proud.  It bears comparison with any police force in Western Europe.  However, since the force became mechanised I do not think it has been as effective. Night patrols seem to have disappeared. Some 20 or 25 years ago such patrols were a common feature of every town and the level of crime 20 or 25 years ago was very low.  I believe it is the absence of these patrols that is responsible for the upsurge in criminal activity.  No matter how sophisticated methods may become they can never replace the effectiveness or, indeed, the deterrent value of the policeman on the beat.  I would call for more policemen on the beat at night.  We need more foot patrols.  They were effective in the past.  The presence of such patrols gives people a sense of security.</P>
    <P>I listened to lawyer Deputies speaking here last week.  I listened particularly to one brilliant young man who was extremely eloquent but, in my opinion, spoke ambiguously.  Lawyers seem to me to be preoccupied, despite their protestations to the contrary, with the rights of the accused.  While that is desirable I believe they have gone too far and I hope they will not do too much nit-picking with this Bill.  I approve of the Bill and I hope it will have an unopposed passage.</P>
    <P>Some lawyer Deputies voiced disquiet over section 16.  I agree with section 16 which decrees that a man charged with a <Col N="2343" /> criminal offence will have to indicate what his likely defence will be.  It is reasonable and desirable that he should do so when he is brought into custody rather than have a lawyer concoct a cock-and-bull story for him.  It is an acceptable part of the Bill.  Naturally nobody wants to see the emergence of a police State, but the Irish people need and demand strong protection and they must get it from the Minister for Justice, the Government and the Judiciary.  Sentences must be imposed which are appropriate to the crime instead of the widely differing sentences which some eminent judges have been imposing.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his initiative in introducing this Bill.  It does not go far enough but it is a fair effort in his first year in office.  I hope that each year he will introduce more beneficial measures so that when he leaves office the law and order situation will be such that people will be able to live in peace with a reasonable degree of comfort, free from the threat posed to them by criminal elements.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to another form of crime which is prevalent in Dundalk and the Border area.  We suffer badly from the subversive activities of the IRA and the INLA factions who are extremely active at present in Dundalk. The van used in the recent Strabane bombing was stolen at gunpoint from a young man who had bought the van only one month previously.  These mobsters, cowardly thugs with guns, called at his door while he was watching television and took the van, depriving him of his livelihood.  More seriously, they later took the lives of three policemen in Strabane. Last year my own van was stolen by the Provisional IRA and was found two months later by the police, with new number plates and having been resprayed, in an area of County Louth close to Crossmaglen.  That van was to be used to kill somebody or to rob some unfortunate person.  Only last week, 100 yards from my home, an elderly lady and her family of five were held at gunpoint for two hours by thugs of the IRA.  The family are in the electronics and telecommunications <Col N="2344" /> business and £30,000 worth of equipment was stolen from them, as well as their van and cars.  The vehicles were later discovered in South Armagh but the equipment was gone and the insurers refused to pay because of the subversive activity involved.  The family employ eight people and they will almost certainly go out of business because of the IRA activity in Dundalk.  There are many instances of such activity, such as knee-cappings.  We have a large unwelcome crowd of people from the North of Ireland who have fled over the Border seeking shelter here.  In many cases these people should be rounded up and sent back to face charges in the North.</P>
    <P>I have given an example of the kind of subversive crime that is peculiar to the Dundalk region and I am asking the Minister of State to convey to the Minister that we need more police protection in Dundalk.  The town has been dubbed &ldquo;El Paso&rdquo; and we resent that title because it has injured us economically.  We have had no investment since the outbreak of the troubles, yet ours is the biggest town in the country.  There is no doubt that some of the criticism of Dundalk is justified. We suffer from cross-Border criminal activity and for many years I have been asking for more police protection. Dundalk has the highest rate of criminal activity outside Dublin and, possibly, Limerick.  I hope we will get more police in the next few months in order to protect us against these thugs.</P>
    <P>One area not covered in the Bill is that of murder.  I have very strong views on murder.  For many years it was considered the ultimate crime but the pendulum has swung and the crime of murder has been downgraded.  It is no longer even a nine-day wonder and deterrents must be provided in order to protect people from thugs, mobsters and gangsters.  The three most recent murders have involved women, a twenty-year-old girl in Ennis who received 42 stab wounds from some animal, a 64-year-old lady in Drogheda who was strangled for a £10 note while coming from a whist drive and a lady in Wexford.  The weaker sex and society in general must be protected and I call for the re-introduction of hanging, not as a <Col N="2345" /> form of retribution but as a deterrent.  I accept that hanging is not totally a deterrent but it is a partial deterrent.  In my town I am considered to be a reasonably affable man.  I would not kill a mouse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I would shed a tear for anyone who might have to pay the ultimate penalty but my concern is for the victims of such crimes.  Even in terms of a partial deterrent, society is owed the protection of the death penalty.  Perhaps Deputy Andrews is familiar with people in Brazil and such places but even wild jungle tribes in that part of the world have their own code of conduct.  The death penalty should be re-introduced here for the crime of first-degree murder. However, I do not believe that will happen, having regard to the strength of the liberal influence in this House.  I am confident, though, that my opinion would be echoed by the man in the street.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on having the initiative to bring in these measures. He is proving to be the outstanding member of the Government.  He is a strong-willed man.  This Bill represents the first step in the fight against crime and in restoring some level of protection to our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard some of the speeches made already on this Bill, I am glad we are a neutral nation.  What might we do if we had the nuclear bomb? Some of the speakers who have addressed themselves to the question of law and order scare me to hell.  The glib manner in which they speak about the reintroduction of capital punishment horrifies me.  If some of those Deputies were some day, by some accident, to be appointed to the Department of Defence with responsibility for Pershing and Cruise Missiles, arms which I hope we will never have but which are now near enough to us, one can only shudder at the thought of the sort of insane actions that they might become involved in.  The lack of reason, of argument and of simple <Col N="2346" /> logic in their contributions frightens me but there are elements in this Bill that frighten me, too.  Like most other people here I am anxious that the safety of all our citizens be secured, that our citizens be protected against the professional criminal and against the thugs who roam our streets preying on old and defenceless men and women.  Together with other speakers whom Deputy McGahon may regard as liberal, I do not consider this Bill to address the underlying causes of crime other than such crimes as drug pushing and so on.  I refer to poverty, unemployment and lack of educational possibilities for many thousands of people.  There are thousands of bright young men who have not had the opportunity of working a day in their lives. They are on the streets wondering how to fill in their days.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inevitable that such young people whose energy the State has ignored and whose talents the State are allowing to rot, lose their pride. In saying that I am not making any excuse for crimes of violence but I recognise the underlying causes.</P>
      <P>Many years ago one could walk with impunity through the streets of Dublin. He would know that he was safe.  We did not need to have gardaí on the streets then but today it is not safe to walk those same streets.</P>
      <P>While I welcome much of this Bill, there are elements in it to which I object strongly.  I assure Deputy David Andrews and Deputy Shatter that they are not alone in their opposition to a number of sections of the Bill.  I assure Deputy D. Andrews particularly that one is not treading a lonely path in objecting to some of the proposals contained in the Bill, proposals which are retrogressive and which set us back many years in terms of liberty and freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an imperative and urgent need for giving the Garda extra power to deal with the increasing level of professional crime.  Those elements in our society who are destroying our young people with <Col N="2347" /> drugs, who are supplying them with such weapons of destruction as hand revolvers and machine guns and who are renting guns to people for the purpose of bank raids, must be dealt with.  I include also in this group the armed gangsters and the cowardly thugs who prey on the old and the defenceless.  That sort of criminal is not entitled to the protection of this House.  When caught, such people should be dealt with severely by the courts.  I would have no objection to these thugs being locked up indefinitely.</P>
    <P>In so far as this Bill addresses that question, I welcome it.  In a personal capacity I have observed always the strict rule of never interfering with the Garda in the course of their legitimate duty. Even when on occasion I felt that commonsense might prevail as a result of my personal intervention, I avoided intervening. The law must be upheld but I would remind the Garda that they are not the masters of the people and never should be allowed to become masters of the people.  The Garda are the servants of the people and must win their respect. The Garda are paid by the State to perform specific duties.  They must fulfil those duties to the utmost of their ability. Generally that is the case but there are occasions when individual members of the Force fail in that responsibility.  By their actions, the Garda must be seen to act on behalf of the people, rich and poor, young and old.  They cannot win the support and confidence of the people if they act, as was reported to me, by a young constituent on Saturday last.  I asked him to put down in writing what had happened.  This is what he wrote:</P>
    <P>Mr. Andrews, T.D.</P>
    <P>On Saturday, 5.11.83, I attended a twenty-first birthday party in the Elphin Hotel, Dún Laoghaire and, coming home, I got a lift to the Montrose Hotel.</P>
    <P>When walking up Fosters Avenue, hitching a lift, I was stopped by a Garda patrol car.  There were three guards in the car.  They asked me direct questions: who was I, who with, where was I going, my name, address and age. <Col N="2348" /> Then they offered me a lift which I gladly accepted.  When we got to Goatstown we should have turned left but turned right for town.  I queried this and got a thump and was to speak questions only when I was spoken to.</P>
    <P>I am reading the letter just as it was written.</P>
    <P>They took me to a terrace off South Circular Road and stopped the car. Two of the guards got out.  The other said he wanted to keep out of it.  They dragged me out of the car and it was then they beat me up, boxing and kicking me.  They provoked me to hit them back but I would not and they hit me more.  They put me back into the car and, as I got in, I put blood on the shirt of the other guard.  Then he started hitting me on the head.</P>
    <P>They brought me to Ranelagh and put me out of the car.  In Ranelagh I got a taxi home and informed my dad of the happenings.</P>
    <P>The following night, Sunday 6th, I went to Vincents Hospital and got a check-up.</P>
    <P>Please give this your full attention.</P>
    <P>I have given that matter my urgent attention. I have written to the Minister for Justice and the Commissioner of the Garda bringing the name and address of this person to their attention.</P>
    <P>If we are to give the Garda increased powers, if we are to support them in the course of their duty it must be said that we cannot support the action that happened in that case.  That young man was never in contact with the Garda before. I have known his family for more than 20 years.  None of his family has ever been in trouble before.  None of his family had anything but respect for the law and the Garda before.  But what respect could they have after that occurrence?  Assuming, as I must, that there is no other explanation &mdash; because this young man is no thug, no criminal, no trouble-maker &mdash;the gardaí responsible have failed in their duty.  I demand that they be identified and brought before the courts, not just for assault but for kidnapping a citizen. That is a legitimate and just demand, <Col N="2349" /> particularly bearing in mind the situation in which we are passing a Bill with grave implications for the civil liberties of all innocent and law-abiding people.</P>
    <P>Frankly, the massive general powers this Bill gives the Garda worry me, that these powers may be used on innocent people who, by some accident, happen to be in the vicinity of some event. Over-reaction will result in a situation such as we have in the North where large segments of the community there have been alienated from the forces of law and order because many members of those forces have abused their authority.  The same is likely to happen &mdash; that those powers may well be abused &mdash; as they have already even without them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept the bona fide amendment suggestions of Deputies D. Andrews and Shatter, two highly qualified lawyers who could not be accused of being radical, liberal, anti-law or anything else but rather pro-justice, pro-commonsense.  Both made splendid contributions to the debate.  I endorse everything they said and suggested.</P>
    <P>In difficult times when the morale of a nation is at a low ebb Parliament and Government must give a lead and that lead must be forward; we must not allow ourselves to be stampeded by the forces of reaction without any reference to experiences in the past&mdash;the heavy gang, the dubious nature of some of the evidence in the Sallins trial, the evidence produced by <i>Magill</i>, and names named in <i>Magill</i>, of people responsible for the beating up of Osgur Breathnach, Nicky Kelly and Brian McNally and no response from us.  I have no brief for any of those three people, none whatsoever.  But, if their liberty and freedom is obviously abused in the way it was, then justice must be done and must be seen to be done.  In the case of Nicky Kelly there is a very good case to be made to the Court of Human Rights.  I hope the friends and supporters of Mr. Kelly take that course. In relation to this issue I might refer to <i>Magill</i> magazine of September in which an article appeared entitled &ldquo;The Seeds of a Police State&rdquo; and in which compelling evidence was put forward that Osgur Breathnach, Nicky Kelly and Brian <Col N="2350" /> McNally were ill treated by members of the Garda.  Evidence was put forward in the article that not alone did a significant number of gardaí perjure themselves in the subsequent trial but that there was a conspiracy on the part of certain gardaí to commit perjury.  The article pointed out that there was no investigation of any kind into the evidence that the three above-mentioned were beaten up by the Garda nor into the fact that there was evidence of conspiracy among the Garda to commit perjury.  Also no safeguards were introduced to ensure that nothing of this sort would happen again.</P>
    <P>We have now this Bill before the House.  We have been promised an appeals procedure.  That appeals procedure should have been put before the House before, and not after, the passage of this Bill.  We are now talking in a vacuum.  We do not know what type of appeals procedure we shall have.  It does not bode well for the future that this Bill is before the House without any reference to what the appeals procedure will be and who will be responsible therefor.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into detail about the various sections.  There has been reference already to section 3(2), section 15 and elements of sections 14 and 16.  All the objections thereto are on the record of the House.  I support those reservations and hope the Minister will ensure that they are dealt with.</P>
    <P>In principle, most of the measures in this Bill are welcomed by me because they are directed at the hard core criminal elements which have developed in our society over the past ten or 15 years. These criminals appear to be getting stronger, to have less fear of using weapons and do not have any conscience about attacking elderly people living alone. Deputy McGahon mentioned that when canvassing in a by-election, when he knocked at houses the doors were opened and there were two or three chains showing. Old people are living in fear.  This crime problem will have to be tackled by the Garda openly and honestly.  We too will have to address ourselves to this problem.  I fully support the Minister's aggressive attitude to law breakers and I hope another Minister will address himself <Col N="2351" /> to the underlying causes of these problems.  I hope, too, a Minister will deal with unemployment which is the single biggest factor causing the rise in crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in general, but like other Deputies I have reservations about certain sections which I will deal with on Committee Stage.  I have a particular interest in this area because I am vice-chairman of the committee of this House dealing with crime, lawlessness and vandalism.  I recognise the Minister's commitment in this area and congratulate him for bringing the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>This is an enormous problem facing the community and we have to strive to deal with it.  There is no point in being self-defeatist and creating monsters but it is very important that we get this Bill through the House in a balanced and representative way.  I recognise the Minister's commitment to deal with this problem and we must leave no stone unturned in solving this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussing this Bill I do not want to be unfair to anybody; I want to be constructive.  Nonetheless, it is the responsibility of every Deputy to put on the record of this House his genuine fears and concerns about this powerful legislation. We must ensure that in dealing with criminals we are not hurting innocent people or placing unnecessary impositions on other citizens.  Passing legislation to deal with crime and specifying procedures and penalties is, of course, the responsibility of this House but legislation on its own will not solve the problem. We must, therefore, be careful not to believe that once the Criminal Justice Bill passes through this House, amended or otherwise, we will have dealt with the problem of crime because there is still a tremendous uphill fight ahead of us.  On the contrary, we must follow up the legislation by taking action to ensure the proper management, deployment and effectiveness of the Garda force, the Department of Justice, the courts and all those involved in the fight against crime, whether it be organised crime or otherwise. <Col N="2352" /> Neither must we allow ourselves be led down a road which argues that more severe laws &mdash; and more severe laws only &mdash; will deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>In this regard the weight one would like to give to the representative of the Garda body is somewhat reduced since they confine their comments to seeking more powers only.  They do not comment on their own effectiveness, not unnaturally, but this indicates a certain concern about their own position when what we want to redress is the imposition on thousands of citizens who pay legislators, gardaí and other public servants to perform certain functions to protect them from criminals, but who have to suffer. The crime situation is at such an epidemic level that self-interest, or the interest of any particular section, must take a back seat.  The interest of the community must be our immediate concern at this time.</P>
    <P>I would like to read into the record a letter I received from ten priests and seven nuns in Dublin and the country on the subject of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1983:</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Mitchell,</P>
    <P>We are writing to express our concern at the proposed Criminal Justice Bill.  We believe that good Community-Gardaí relations play a vital role in the task of combating crime.  This Bill, as it stands, will lead to a serious deterioration in such relations and ultimately, we believe, will lead to increased resentment and frustration and thereby to an increase in the violence which accompanies some crime.</P>
    <P>While others have expressed apprehension at the Bill's fundamental challenge to our legal and criminal detection procedures, which we fully share, we restrict ourselves to its effect on Community-Gardaí relations in deprived areas.  The Bill covers a wide variety of offences, including misdemeanours such as petty theft and shoplifting. While we share the community's concern at the escalation of serious crime, the Bill's application to offences of a minor nature will only <Col N="2353" /> lead to increased resentment in many cases.  Indeed it can be used against persons not involved in crime but who simply live in an area with a high crime rate.  For example, any person in such an area who is in possession of property or money is liable to be detained by a garda who does not have to inform him or her of the basis of his suspicions, for a period of up to twenty hours. There is nothing to prevent such a person being repeatedly detained, even on successive days, for investigation of different crimes that have occurred in his neighbourhood.  This, we believe to be unacceptable.  As the Bill will lead to increased emphasis on information gathering, in the effort to combat crime, there is a real possibility of deliberate, or even quite unintentional harassment of persons not now involved in serious crime.  Under the Offences Against the State Act, only one person in ten who is detained is subsequently charged.  Any such extension to the population at large will result, especially in deprived areas in increased frustration, anger and resentment, and this we believe, will lead to an increase in violent crime.</P>
    <P>The action of the few is unfair to the gardaí who want to do their jobs well.  We believe that a certain number of gardaí abuse their authority.  This abuse undermines all the good work in building Community relations in which many other Gardaí are engaged.  For example, some Gardaí &ldquo;invite&rdquo; people, particularly young people, to come to the station to answer questions. If the person does not know of his right to refuse, or fearing the consequences of doing so, then he is in effect being detained involuntarily, which is at present a denial of his rights. In some cases, verbal and even physical abuse is applied.  And we have reason to believe that false testimony in court is sometimes used to obtain convictions, (for example, in relation to what occurred during questioning).  While we insist that only a small number of gardaí are involved, their actions are not unknown to many other gardaí who by their silence must share responsibility. <Col N="2354" /> In such circumstances, the extension of police powers, without inbuilt and compulsory safeguards will only lead to a further deterioration of Community-Gardaí relations.  There will result a pressure on the Garda to use their powers to their fullest possible interpretation, which is not the intention of the Minister (whose concern with serious crime we acknowledge), and which has already occurred with the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
    <P>On these grounds we believe that this Bill will lead to a serious deterioration of Community relations which is essential to the maintenance of law and order.</P>
    <P>I do not share all the fears they have expressed, but I share some of them.  It is frightening that leaders of the community &mdash; and there are many, and there are some in this House &mdash; have certain fears and misgivings about a minority, thankfully only a minority, who bring into question the integrity of the Garda force and who might have used laws and procedures in such a way as to hinder us from giving the power we might otherwise like to.</P>
    <P>The other side of the problem is that when great community assistance of and trust in the Garda is needed as never before, a small number of gardaí are undermining confidence in their colleagues by alienating the community from their actions.  I can give a number of examples in regard to this, some of which I have had investigated.  It is not in the interest of the Garda Representative Body to protect those members of the force who so act or to indulge in politics or political actions.  That body have a legitimate role which is recognised, but they should not risk the great gains they have made by taking that recognition for granted and by undermining themselves. The community want action against all criminals whether in uniform or not and regardless of to whom they happened to be related.  I am dwelling on this because the Garda Representative Body appear to want to deny the existence of defaulting gardaí.  In any body of 11,000 people it is only consistent with the law of averages <Col N="2355" /> that there will be defaulters.  If the gardaí would recognise this publicly as they do in private they could get on with the job of fulfilling the duties of the Garda force without having to divert their energies and attention to areas and problems which are self-evident.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about the lack of morale within the senior ranks of the Garda.  A problem seems to be that some senior officers are not being heeded by more junior officers and this appears to be widespread.  If we are serious about dealing with crime and introducing criminal justice in this House, then we want checks and balances.  We must tell a superintendent that he has that power and he must use it and be responsible for using it.  It is time to stop tolerating shabby standards.  If we give a uniformed, disciplined force the sort of powers we have given them and are now adding to those powers, we must ensure that there is a clear line of command and answerability for those powers.</P>
    <P>Leaving this subject, I want to be associated with the Minister's high praise of the Garda generally.  However, the vast majority of the gardaí must join with the rest of us in weeding out that minority of gardaí who are beginning to get a bad name for the force.  We must bring to their notice that we will have to do something to sort out the problems in this if they do not act themselves.  To that minority of gardaí to whom I have referred we must say that we expect better standards.  We must say to the vast majority of gardaí that they must not accept low standards.  We want our high praise for the Garda force to continue to be justified, but it cannot be continued blindly.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in supporting tough legislation.  We must ensure that we do what we were elected to do, that is, serve the public interest.  I will deal with the various sections of the Bill on Committee Stage.  Any sections which could give rise to pressure on innocent citizens must be put under the microscope and must have a time limit on their existence as law so that this House can examine their effect and desirability at an appropriate time. <Col N="2356" /> Other checks and balances are necessary. The Garda Commissioner should be required to report at least annually to the Dáil Committee on crime, lawlessness and vandalism on the use of powers given.  For example, the UK Police and Criminal Evidence Bill provides that annual reports to be made by chief constables should contain information about searches.  Those who conduct searches must record, where practicable, the fact that they have carried out such searches and a report must be made to their complaints authorities about these searches. A requirement in this country for such records to be kept about detention, finger-printing and photographing would be appropriate.  An annual report including those details could then be provided for a Dáil committee who could examine the commissioner on any matters which they might believe to be a cause for concern.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to deal with the views of the House shabbily.  This is not a Fianna Fáil, Labour or Fine Gael Bill; it is one in which we are all interested. Let us have the benefit of our collective wisdom in trying to solve the problem now, trying to build in democratic checks and balances and to ensure that those given the power are answerable to the people through their elected representatives. One way to do that would be to require that instances of detention, photographing and fingerprinting be recorded and that an annual report be compiled of the number of incidents and the circumstances and that this report be the subject of a report by the Garda Commissioner who, I want to say, is doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>With regard to destruction of fingerprints and palm prints, it should be made a serious matter of discipline for any member of the force to obstruct the destruction of these where there is a requirement in law that they be destroyed.  We should put the onus on the gardaí themselves to ensure that where records of finger-printing, palm printing and photographing of suspects must be destroyed they are required under pain of discipline to ensure that they are destroyed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2357" /> The severity of certain sections of this Bill on top of laws already in existence and added to certain community fears must give us cause to ensure that a proper independent complaints body entirely outside the Garda force, without uniform and with clear terms of reference and objectives, is created.  Every complaint should not be a federal case and for relatively minor offences relatively minor corrective action should apply.  For reasons already stated it is essential that other cases be dealt with in a meaningful way.  A cosmetic exercise will not suffice. I know of occasions where quite scandalous actions taken by this very small minority of gardaí to whom I have referred were investigated.  People have telephoned me at 1.15 a.m. and got me out of bed to give me details of the incidents which, without any doubt, occurred.  In some cases they verified the instances.  In one case a television set was taken from a house and kept for a year. When an investigating officer comes these people become fearful of court action and involvement with the Garda. They see a uniform and become terrified and instead of going through with the investigation they are very reticent about signing statements and reluctant to become involved in case they become identified with the case.  They become fearful of the people who are supposed to be protecting them from fear.  For that reason in creating an independent complaints body we must ensure that they are not a uniformed body, that they are not answerable to the Garda, that they are given clear terms of reference and that people will not be fearful and will be assured that if they have a genuine complaint that complaint will be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>There is no point in trying to pretend that the present system works; it does not.  Even if people pursue the matter they meet with so many obstacles that it is virtually impossible to nail the minority who are committing these offences and when others see them getting away with it that can have dire consequences.  We must ensure that that does not happen. The passing of the Final Stages of this Bill should be made dependent on the introduction of details before this House <Col N="2358" /> of an independent complaints body which will ensure that the criminals will suffer and that the innocent will have nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>At a public meeting in my constituency, to which was invited the present Taoiseach, then Leader of the Opposition, the public were asked for comments. There were some comments on the economy and local issues, but by far the largest single issue raised was crime, with people mentioning the problems facing their wives and daughters.  That meeting took place in Crumlin which is not the worst area, being relatively quiet. The largest meeting I ever attended was in Rialto, also in my constituency, where a tannoy public address system had to be employed.  So many people attended because they were worried about crime statistics.</P>
    <P>There is no point in our decrying every section of this Bill.  We need tough, urgent action, but that must be combined with the necessary balances for the protection of the people whom we serve. Sixty per cent of crime is committed in Dublin and we have 30 per cent of the Garda force.  These figures were given to the crime committee by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  Are the Garda force being deployed on a basis developed in the twenties, thirties or forties or even when the DMP were in existence? Is it not time we examined the proper deployment and use of the Garda?  In this new committee we must examine the whole structure of management of the Garda force and also Garda training.  This training is not properly orientated towards the epicentre of crime.  One third of all crimes are committed by persons under 17 years of age. There are certain social problems, injustice and underprivilege.  I happen to come from an underprivileged background and it is a slight on those involved to say that they are the only people committing crime.  That is not the case.  Problems associated with drug addiction and drug pushing are present throughout the community, in rural areas and in Dublin. People are being led into crime to pay for their drug habits.  There are economic factors behind the problem, but they will <Col N="2359" /> have to be dealt with separately.  Underprivileged people do not beat up old ladies for the hell of it.  There are reasons for doing this.  However, quite privileged people are beating up old ladies for the hell of it.  This is because we have allowed organised crime, particularly in the area of drug pushing, to grab hold of our young population, the fastest growing young population in western Europe. They are being turned into criminals to pay for a habit which is forced upon them.</P>
    <P>A senior Garda officer told us at a meeting of a recent committee that a central Dublin hotel are now advising their clients not to go into the streets after 9 p.m.  That was very devastating news. We are trying to promote tourism and a notable hotel finds it necessary to give their visitors this warning.  Action is necessary and it must be taken.  As part of the fight against that situation there are sections of this Bill which are highly commendable, provided that they are not defeated by other sections.</P>
    <P>There is a vagueness in the way certain sections are couched.  For example, in section 3 the Minister refers to checks which are made.  We will have to have a precise understanding of the meaning of such general terms before we pass this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word of commendation for the Association of Garda Sergeants' and Inspectors who have taken time to hold seminars for discussion on the problems facing the community.  That is an approach which other Garda representative bodies might follow.  I am becoming concerned about the number of people being recruited to the Garda force.  The information given to the House is that Templemore Training College is full and that we are recruiting 500 more and so on.  We have at present 11,000 gardaí and may get to the stage where there are too many.  There must be an upper limit to the number of recruits.  There should be a policy decision on that.  The House must know the optimum number and be able to expect that number to deal with the problems which they face.  That is not unreasonable.  After all, every year we pass Votes on Garda salaries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2360" /> I hope that the Minister will give attention to the places of detention.  I know that there will be more of these available this year than last year.  One does not like people being detained or losing their liberty, but there are few alternatives in many cases.  Many are causing old people to remain detained in their homes for most of the day through fear.</P>
    <P>We must solve the problem of overcrowding in our prisons.  We must be able to tell these people that we make the law and if they break it they will be sentenced and detained accordingly.  At the moment we are making a laugh of ourselves if we pass legislation and give all sorts of powers to people which they can use selectively and we do not have the follow-up situation of detention.  There has been a great improvement in the number of detention places this year but until we can contain in prison those whom our laws and Judiciary determine should be detained then we do not have a sufficient number of detention places.  It is silly, negligent and irresponsible of us to continue to allow people who have been sentenced for crime after crime to be released from prison at an early date.</P>
    <P>If we examine the trend of crime in recent years we will see that there is a more serious and violent crime creeping into our society.  That is a sad thing.  The penalties for this type of jungle approach must be severe and the more violent the crime the more determined should be the deterrent.  We must not be too critical or too fearful to introduce the necessary tough measures but let us not also defeat ourselves by introducing measures which in the long run will defeat what we set out to achieve.</P>

B'fhéidir mar sin nach mbeidh mé in ann dul isteach sna pointí go léir a bhí i gceist agam ach tá mé cinnte im'aigne féin go mbeidh mé in ann tagairt do rudaí áirithe a bhaineann leis an gceist seo agus atá i mo thuairimse níos tábhachtaí ná rud ar bith eile a tháinig os comhair an Tíseo le fada.  Le roinnt bliain anuas, mar a thuigeann gach éinne anseo, tá law and order, mar a thugtar air, ag <Col N="2361" /> titim as a chéile.  Tuigimid go léir, ár iar Rialtas agus an Rialtas atá istigh, go raibh sé thar am rud éigin a dhéanamh, sin nó nach mbeadh rud ar bith fágtha.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to address myself to the Bill and certain aspects of it.  As happens to most Members, certain points will be highlighted and Deputies will address themselves to what they regard as being pertinent to the legislation before us.  We are happy that we all enjoy a certain freedom in respect of this debate, in that the Government that went out of office last November, and the new Government, are at one in regard to the need that exists to up-date the legislation. I should like to give my wholehearted welcome to the legislation before us.  I am not doing that as a licence to attack forthwith everything that is in it but I am pleased that measures I would have advocated within my party and in public are in the legislation.  Perhaps I will have some regrets that the proposals in the legislation may not go far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that for many years, unfortunately, there has been very little law, justice or order for the vast majority of our people.  They are the people about whom I am concerned.  When we talk about law and order and justice I do not see it as something that comes to a person when he or she has had an opportunity of pursuing it in a court of law.  In accepting the fact that it is only there one gets it, we are being lulled into a situation where we think it is the only place and that only a gowned judge, having listened to presentations by similarly gowned people pursuing an exercise in discussions in law, jurisprudence and so on, can establish a person's rights.  We are all born with that right and the entitlement of anybody in a democratic state is that he or she will have fair play.  There should not be any need for a person to pursue it in the fashion that has become acceptable nowadays.  I must repeat my criticism, my cynicism of the whole legal process here. Without wanting to alarm the House, or my colleagues, I must state that I am absolutely convinced that the legal process we have established here and which we attempt to perpetuate is no longer on because we cannot afford it.  It is not <Col N="2362" /> because we cannot afford it that I put the question mark behind it but because I have grave doubts as to whether it is necessary.</P>
    <P>We all know that there are people who are earning fortunes from taking to themselves legislation which has been passed here and throwing it from one to the other anxious to discover what we had intended.  As laymen we know the spirit, the sense and reasonableness of what we do and I do not think it should be necessary &mdash; I am convinced we can no longer guarantee the situation &mdash; for people to amass fortunes out of studying and pursuing legislation in the fashion that exists today.</P>
    <P>Before coming to the House I made some inquiries about the amount of money paid in respect of criminal legal aid and civil legal aid.  That money, paid by the Government to legal people so that they can pursue what they regard to be a citizen's legal rights, comes from the only pocket that pays for anything here, the pocket of the worker.  I have been informed that in respect of 1983 a sum of £1.85 million has already been paid, while for 1982 a sum of £1.179 million was paid for criminal legal aid.  In respect of civil legal aid the sum for 1983 was £1.305 million and for 1982 it was £1.198 million, almost £6 million in two years. We must remember that the bulk of that money came out of the pockets of those paying PAYE.  We know the majority of our people contribute PAYE and we also know that a majority of these people are suffering from all the injuries that have been done.  They must now pay £6 million so that legal men can benefit from what they regard as the pursuit of the rights of the citizen.  It is a luxury that we can no longer afford.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the right to silence.  Legal men tell me that is a fundamental right.  I do not accept that it is.  I would again remind the House that I speak entirely as a layman believing that the Lord, in distributing commonsense and wisdom, gave me the same right to base my views on the small quota which was given to me.  How can one contend that somebody who is seen to <Col N="2363" /> have attacked an old lady and submitted her to the most vile type of personal injury, and he or she having been brought to the local Garda station, has a right to be silent if questioned?</P>
    <P>How can we accept that that wrongdoer has that right?  If there are Members here who believe it I will be listening carefully and anxiously for a demonstration of how that right occurs.  On the contrary, I think there is an obligation on that person to answer immediately for what he or she has done.  I do not accept that the legal process is about defying anybody to prove that anybody else has been guilty of anything.  Perhaps that is what the legal men will contend.  That is a very remunerative principle for them to uphold because if they can establish that the accused has a fundamental right to remain silent they will argue the next step.  The accused does not have to think about remaining silent if somebody is paid to speak for him.  Enter the legal man.</P>
    <P>Can we afford to accept what is claimed as a fundamental right, but which is rejected by me as being nothing but the safeguarding of a situation in which people who will establish that they are qualified in this science or this art of what justice is about are guaranteeing they will get well paid for speaking on behalf of an accused person?</P>

I am not attacking any Member of the House.  I am asking those who would come in to defend this principle to demonstrate how it can be justified. I am indicating unashamedly and without making any apologies to anybody <Col N="2364" /> that it appears to me that it is a worthwhile professional pursuit to try to retain what is called the right to silence when it can yield such a harvest to the profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Chair is wrong but I got the impression that the Deputy was arguing that certain people might say that an accused person was entitled to the right to silence and that the person, knowing he had that right, would have to get somebody else to speak for him and that that somebody else would have to be paid.  Perhaps the Deputy did not intend that but if the Deputy conveyed that impression it would not be a very nice impression.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what I want to convey.  I am charging the legal profession with having a vested interest in defending the right to silence.  I am talking about State moneys paid to legal people and, if they do not have it already, it is a temptation that they as humans might have.  We all know that in every profession it is understandable that each guards his own.  I am trying to agitate the minds of those here who are members of that esteemed profession so that they will tell me if I am wrong.  I am presenting the case as I see it, not against any Member of the House who is in the legal profession. I am making this case against the legal profession.</P>

      <P>If a person were to argue that a person had the right to remain silent and that the argument in favour of that was to secure the right to talk for him for which there would be remuneration, that would not be a very worthy object.

      <P>The Chair has an advantage over me in many ways, particularly in legal matters.  In this part of my contribution on the Criminal Justice Bill I am attacking a provision which is vital to the entire Bill by expressing my doubts in respect of its effects on the whole legal <Col N="2365" /> process.  In so far as the Bill refers to that I should be at liberty, without being offensive to anybody.  Mar a deireann an seanfhocal, &ldquo;Bíonn an fhírinne searbh,&rdquo; and I cannot make apologies to anybody if I am, as it appears to me, speaking the truth.  In debate here anybody who may feel offended by any statement I may make, or charges I may bring forward, can come along and defend himself against it.  That is what debate is all about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  I reject that only the wealthy should dominate the legal process, and that is the position here at the moment. The legal process at the moment, unlike most other professions, is dominated almost entirely by people of the upper middle class.  I do not think that is a luxury we can afford any longer.  One must have reservations about it.  To answer the question put to me, when I read of people becoming solicitors or being called to the Bar, I have not read of many people with addresses in Ballyfermot or in the centre of the city or in Finglas or in Coolock or in Donnycarney being called, albeit they are people who pay for the education.  Let us be open and frank about it.  Is there an acceptance that only the middle class and the so-called upper middle class are entitled to interpret that which is best for what they describe as the lower classes?  I have spoken briefly on this before.  It is related to what is real justice.  Can we any longer defend a situation which deprives the sons or daughters of those who pay, the people out of whose taxation the money comes?  Everything connected with law at the moment is paid for out of public funds, yet we continue to exclude from it the offspring of those who pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, asked if I do not hold that a poor person should have the same rights in the matter of his entitlement under the law as a rich person.  Of course I do, but I do not agree that this should be as expensive or prohibitive as it is today.  I want to see the <Col N="2366" /> people who are measuring this out doing it at a rate and a price which is within their competence to pay.  Now we get the other side of the coin that automatically excludes them from the payment of the massive amounts which go to the legal profession.  We often hear criticism of the politicians who are supposed to give a good example and who are criticised because they do not do this, that, or the other.  We do not set ourselves up as supremos in law and justice.  The legal profession do.</P>

      <P>Yes, £13,000.  I could understand my colleague's eloquence were he a member of some other stratum of the legal profession.  He could earn that in a couple of months.  I have enough faith in him, knowing what other people earn, to believe that he could earn it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I tried to establish that the citizen has a right to law and order and justice, ideally without ever having to darken a court of law.  We know that is not possible at the moment.  What we want to get now is a picture of his reaction to what that court of law in its interpretation does for him.  I shall not identify the court or the learned justice but I am aware of two cases in the last six months which I want to put on record.  In one case a person accused was convicted of driving a motor vehicle in such fashion that it led to the death of a number of young people.  He was given a suspended sentence.  That is one side of the scale.  I know another case where a man was brought before the District Court accused of being an accomplice in the stealing of a small quantity of ham and bread.  The district justice, interpreting the law as he understood it, fined him £10.  His legal adviser told him he had been badly done by and he should take his case to the Circuit Court.  Conviction would affect him in his employment.  Now the legal adviser was being paid by the accused.  The case was taken to the Circuit Court and the learned judge there sentenced the man to 12 months in Mountjoy.  That is fact.  It is not rumour. <Col N="2367" /> Worse still, the man lost his employment and has been waiting for the last seven or eight months for the forces of law and order to bring him to Mountjoy.  I made some inquiries.  First, I wanted the case quashed or, secondly, I wanted the man brought before some court so that this appallingly bad case could be corrected or dropped.  That has not happened.  How could he have any respect for law and order?  How could he have any respect for this Criminal Justice Bill?  How could he have any respect for the legal structures as he sees them?  We get this imbalance. If the input into the whole legal system was one that copperfastened and led to absolute decisions, decisions that would not vary from court to court, there would be no argument.  When, however, the system is one that permits a person sitting in judgment to pass judgment in accordance with his prevailing moods I do not see how or why we should be so concerned for its preservation.  It is well known that what happens in our courts is more akin to Bingo than to the pursuit of any perfect science.  Who is defending you and if he knows how to circumvent or appeal to the person sitting in judgment governs the sentence one will get. That is well known.</P>
    <P>That system was inherited by us.  It may have been an appropriate system in years gone by when people who stole the landlord's sheep were sentenced to death.  We live in more enlightened days.  We do not have any fears like that.  Simultaneously we have this investment from the public sector and the private sector into the perpetuation of a system which, to me, is gravely irrelevant to needs and which is not bringing to it the esteem, respect and honour it should command.  I regard this section as more important than any other section.  Before I leave the right to silence, which is treated only very mildly, the right to silence is still there except that under this Bill the learned justice can have regard to it and put his or her interpretation on the reasons why someone elects to remain silent.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Garda and the part they must play.  I received today two letters and although they have different <Col N="2368" /> headings it seems that they emanated from the same source.  One bears an address in Sherrard Street and the other is from the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, signed by five Reverend Fathers and seven Reverend Sisters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first document is <Col N="2369" /> from the Conference of Major Religious Superiors (Ireland), CMRS Secretariat, Milltown Park, Dublin 6 and it is signed on behalf of Joseph Dargan, S.J., Sister Jordana Roche, Sister Lucy Troy, Sister Pauline Lawlor, Father John O'Donnell, Sister Cora Ferriter, Sister Nellie Curtin, Father William McGonagle, Sister Stanislaus Kennedy, Father Michael Mernagh and Father Michael Kane.  While I have responded to your suggestion by reading out that information, I will confine myself to part of the document.  The sixth paragraph states:</P>
      <P>The abolition of the &ldquo;right to silence&rdquo; in Section 15.2 gives extraordinary powers to every Garda.  If a theft has taken place, anybody with anything in hand or pocket may need an explanation for having anything if a Garda believes he has reasonable grounds for making an enquiry.</P>
      <P>I have looked at the legislation and I do not think it is proposed to remove in its entirety the right to silence.  There is reference to it but I do not think the abolition of the right to silence can be contended. The following paragraph states:</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to deal with professional criminals.  As the Bill stands, Youth Workers and Social Workers may be subject to pressure to give information about clients if a Garda had &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; for suspecting that they were accessories after the fact in a case of suspected juvenile theft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all due respect, if these good people think that is the only matter in the proposed legislation to which they should apply their undoubted abilities, mental and otherwise, it reflects very poorly on their knowledge of what is happening in the world.  There is reference to their concern about faith and justice.  If some unenlightened or poorly instructed member of the Garda were to vent on me the slings and arrows of his outrageous preparation for his profession to the extent that I would be required to go a Garda station and answer questions, as a Christian I would be happy to do it if I were contributing to their endeavours to discover <Col N="2370" /> wrongdoers.  What of all the innocent people who are suffering as I speak, people whose homes have been broken into, who are being attacked, the young and old people who are afraid to go out in the streets, drive their cars, attend football matches and go about their normal pursuits lest they be set upon by the people in our society who have no respect for them or anything else?</P>
    <P>It is impossible in respect of any profession to guarantee 100 per cent suitability. There is no human institution where that obtains.  It does not obtain in the Oireachtas, the medical or teaching professions or any other profession.  We can pursue as far as possible the methods of examination and interview in the hope that ultimately we will have the type of person who is suitable for the purpose.  If what is contended here is that until such time as we can guarantee the perfect being operating as a member of the Garda there is an obligation on the State to continue to pay the moneys until we reach that stage, it is a premise as fallacious as my wanting to step up to the moon.  It cannot be done.  I am not condoning malpractice by any member of the Garda, just as I would not condone the malpractice of any Member of this House or of my teaching profession, but we must accept that the law is being administered by human beings and that means that somebody will overstep his rights.  I was engaged in work in the community for a long time before coming here and down through the years I have heard charges made against members of the Garda, but in most cases these allegations were unfounded.</P>
    <P>I move now to the second document which is headed with the address, 26 Upper Sherrard Street, Dublin 1 and signed by the following: Father Peter McVerry, Father Bill McKenna, Father Denis Carroll, Sister Claude McDonald, Sister Catherine Prendergast, Father Frank O'Leary, Father Seán Healy, Sister Brigid Reynolds, Sister Joanna O'Connor, Father Peter Lemass, Father Desmond McCarthy, Father Barry Murphy, Father Austin Flannery, Sister Genevieve Kilbane, Sister Brigid O'Flanagan, Father Martin Daly and Sister <Col N="2371" /> Leo Hackett.  I propose to quote briefly from this document.  In paragraph 3 these people say:</P>
    <P>The action of the few is unfair to the gardaí who want to do their jobs well. We believe that a certain small number of gardaí abuse their authority.</P>
    <P>Presumably one believes only if one has some proof for the belief.  If the people who signed this document have evidence to substantiate this claim they are bound morally to put that evidence before the appropriate authority.  On any occasion on which a constituent has come to me to make an allegation which reflected on a member of the local Garda, I went to the Garda station to have the matter examined. In my 13 or 14 years in public life I have only had occasion to do so four or five times but in any such case I would go to the superior officer of the member concerned.  I would not castigate the whole <i>corpus</i> of any profession for the misdemeanours of a small number within that profession.  If we have information that reflects on any individual within the Garda Síochána we should convey that information to the appropriate authority. Instead of investigating amounts of money which are not available to us in any case, we would do well to investigate any such allegation against the Garda. Another sentence in this paragraph which appals me is:</P>
    <P>In some cases, verbal and even physical abuse is applied.</P>
    <P>That is a statement and if those good people are so aware, to whom have they conveyed that information?  What action have they taken in regard to it?  Did they go public on it before the arrival of this piece of legislation in the House?  These good Fathers and good Sisters are social workers, people who would be qualified to tell the rest of us how we should behave morally, but they must be asked what action they have taken in this instance. These are the sort of allegations that tend to worsen the existing provision.  Further in the paragraph there is the following sentence:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2372" /> while we insist that only a small number of gardaí are involved, their actions are not unknown to many other gardaí who by their silence must share responsibility.</P>
    <P>I am assuming that this document is not bogus but it is one of the most useless pieces of paper that I have ever come across.  What is even worse is that it emanates from people who are leaders in our society.  I am frightened that we have reached such a point.  The attitude of dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean leí, is one that only makes matters worse?  However, I am sure we will hear more about those two illustrious documents.</P>
    <P>In passing I should like to say that I am at a loss to know how those two documents could be delivered to me and, I presume, to every other Member of the House without their bearing the normal postmark and without having conformed with the normal process that obtains here in relation to the distribution of literature.</P>
    <P>Any reservation I have in regard to this Bill will not be voiced here because I would not wish the House to deduct from any such expression any hint that I do not agree with the need for the introduction of measures that will guarantee to our citizens their rights.  These are rights which ideally the citizens should not have to pay for or have to fight for in any court of law.  Following on that, while referring to my own constituency, it is not my intention to treat of the many problems that exist there as well as in every other constituency.</P>
    <P>In the matter of what we are doing for our people, we have legislation which guarantees our people a continuous transport system and CIE are required, under statute, to provide that service.  In deference to that responsibility, that commitment, we know that CIE supply a service all over the country, even up mountainsides, into small villages where people live and claim their right to that service.  I agree entirely with that.  Simultaneous with that statutory requirement there is the requirement obtaining in respect of the Garda, the Department of Justice, law and order, that any citizen <Col N="2373" /> should be entitled to go about his or her business and avail of the services provided.</P>
    <P>I might remind the House that in a certain part of my constituency for the past 12 months there have been people, young, old, infirm, others, with a need of that service.  Yet, they cannot have that service after 9 o'clock in the evening.  I accept that it could be demonstrated that, on occasion, the crews of the CIE buses may have been attacked but, for that reason, those people have been denied that service for the past 12 months.  Notwithstanding the two institutions which have been established we cannot provide that service to which they are entitled. Yet we expect these people to contribute to the establishment and maintenance of all these institutions which control them, over which they have little control, to pay and be amenable to the laws.  CIE maintain that staff are not too happy about going into that area, that they will go provided they are accompanied occasionally by members of the Garda.  Members of the Garda say they are happy to do that if CIE will co-operate with them by indicating when they are needed.</P>
    <P>The three other public representatives of the area and I, local representatives, local community leaders have been endeavouring for the last 12 months to get that simple, essential service provided for those people but we have failed.  Originally the service was discontinued because people who should be amenable to this legislation were not brought to justice.  I attended a public meeting in this connection some months ago.  At that meeting a young man stood up and said: &ldquo;Provided this, we will allow the buses back.&rdquo;  They presumed to establish conditions on which buses would be allowed back into a certain part of the constituency. I spoke at that meeting, as I am speaking here, and said that neither they nor anybody else had any right, and that CIE did not have any right, to deny the people the service to which they were entitled, that they were not CIE or Garda buses, that they were the people's buses. But it would appear to the law-abiding people in West Finglas that they are being denied that service because a handful of <Col N="2374" /> young people have said it will not be provided.  What respect can those people have for us or for this great legal process that we do so much to safeguard and honour?</P>
    <P>I had occasion to write to the Minister for Justice on this matter.  I brought in deputations and delegations.  I know it is not entirely his function, but if CIE are prepared to provide a service conditional on their having constant or occasional accompaniment by the Garda, then it should be done.  The Garda should then apply themselves to searching out the people, whoever they are, who would take onto themselves the right to deny that service to the rest of the people.  If we do that there will be some hope.  If we do, as far as the people of that area are concerned, we may have some hope of restoring the faith they have always had in and the respect for our institutions of State.</P>
    <P>Social workers and others tell me we are not doing sufficient for the wrongdoer. Lest anybody listening to me, or reading my remarks might think I am devoid of sensitivity in the matter of wrongdoers, I should put on record that, from my earliest years, I have been involved in social clubs, in social work. Later I was a member of the visiting committee of St. Patrick's Institution and have endeavoured throughout my life time to help the needy in every way.  But, in doing so, I have discovered, and not just now, that as long as one continues to help the needy by giving him or her everything he or she claims they need, there will be problems.  Sooner or later one must be seen to introduce deterrents. As Minister of State at the Department of Education I remember having to suffer a certain amount of attack &mdash; I might say from members of the present Government &mdash; because I had been associated with a project which would accommodate young people in Loughan House.  There were then lobbies representative of political, social workers and others contending the terrible thing it was to bring a boy of 18 or 19 years of age from Dublin up to Loughan House in Cavan, that he would not have an opportunity of having the visits he might were he nearer <Col N="2375" /> home.  I did not accept that contention. If there was need to safeguard the public who were being attacked by that boy, that should be done.  There were the guarantees that, while he was in Loughan House, the matters of education, recreation, the needs of any young man were being provided in every way, except that they were provided at a point some distance from the city of Dublin.  I am happy to note that the present Government subsequently changed their minds in respect of Loughan House.</P>
    <P>I was working then also on plans for the establishment of a school of detention at Lusk, Co. Dublin.  That school has been built.  I was happy to be associated with it but I would remind the House that it was built at a cost in excess of £2,500,000, and that to look after the needs of 35 people.  In my constituency at present there are little children attending a primary school in which there are classes of 50 &mdash; one teacher endeavouring to look after 50 students.  There is a varying student-teacher ratio with other classes of 45, others 40.  These are all children doing what is required of them and who are dependent on the education they receive there for the rest of their lives.  Were more money spent on the provision of educational and recreational facilities at that level, apart from other considerations, there would not be any need for Áras Mhuire.  It appears to members of the public that the wrongdoer is going to be looked after but if you are one of the silent, disciplined, amenable majority, you will be taken for granted.  Those people are no longer anxious to be taken for granted and this House should appreciate that and the best way to help them is to implement this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some months ago I took issue with the Minister when he introduced, with a great deal of publicity and with Government spokesmen doing a John the Baptist on it for about two months before it was introduced, the Criminal Justice Bill. Under that legislation, instead of putting people in prison, they would be doing worthwhile community work.  At that time I told the Minister he was only codding <Col N="2376" /> the House.  I said, and it is on the record, that I did not see any of the proposed measures being implemented before the end of the year.  The end of the year is almost with us and I have not yet heard of any such measure being introduced, nor have I heard of any of the officers needed to implement these measures being appointed.  I realise there was no provision in the Estimates for their appointment.  My main criticism of the Minister is that he gave a wrong impression as to the urgency with which he would introduce this legislation.  That does not help us maintain the image which is essential if we are to uphold law and order.</P>
    <P>I will conclude as I started, that is, dealing with the freedoms which this legislation would allegedly take from an innocent person.  I am asking that innocent person, in the interest of his neighbour, if necessary to suffer that temporary loss of freedom so that the rest of the community can rest in peace and harmony. People might say &ldquo;Tunney is over-simplifying the problem&rdquo; but I do not think I am.  I am not asking anybody to do what I would not be prepared to do.  If all came to all, is there anybody here who would not be prepared to spend &mdash; and this is a remote proposition &mdash; half an hour in a Garda barracks answering questions if he was convinced that, as a result, his children, his wife or his mother would not be attacked, raped, killed or robbed?  Is there anybody here who would say that in deference to our airy fairy regard to this fundamental right to silence, to the right of the wrongdoer to refuse to answer questions, that we should ask the people to suffer further the personal injuries and financial strain that is their woeful lot at the moment?  If there is, I would not like to be him when he is called to answer to the people at the next election.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tunney is a person for whom I have great respect.  He indicated that he received this Bill with full support and this his reservations he would keep to himself.  If he had reservations on the Bill, I would have thought it appropriate for him to have spelled <Col N="2377" /> them out.  There is nothing wrong in doing that.  Our function here is to approve what is right, pass comment on what one has reservations about and, hopefully, seek to achieve improvements.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tunney referred to a number of communications he received from two organisations.  He has not gone through the complete gamut of circularised material to Members of the House on the subject of this Bill.  There have been many others and, no doubt, before discussion is completed, more will come to us.  We have to look at them and examine the submissions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Taylor will understand my intervention, but in my contribution I said I had reservations but that lest they detract from the main purpose of my contribution, I would not express them now.  The Deputy knows that on Committee and other Stages those reservations can be expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did hear Deputy Tunney say that but I could not agree that the fact that he would mention his reservations would in any way detract from the Bill.  On the contrary they would give force and effect to the Bill by pointing out all aspects of it.  While I broadly welcome the Bill, like Deputy Tunney, I intend to give vent to such reservations as I have in the hope that the Minister will take note of them and perhaps consider introducing amendments that would improve this measure.</P>
      <P>This Bill is looked at in two ways, and could be expressed from the two extreme points of view as follows.  On the one hand, a spokesman for the Irish Council for Civil Liberties as reported in the <i>Evening Press</i> of 19 October 1983 condemned this Bill as a gross invasion of the liberty of the individual.  On the other hand, the Minister for Justice in his speech to the Fine Gael Árd Fheis on 21 October 1983 defended any such invasion in the Bill as the price that must be paid if society is to be afforded adequate protection against crime.  Those appear to be the two extreme positions and we must examine them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2378" /> The Minister for Justice indicated that the Bill must be accepted as the price that must be paid if society is to be afforded adequate protection against crime.  The first question we must look at is: might the price be too high?  The second question is: having paid the price, is the Bill going to deliver the goods?  Any customer paying a price is entitled to expect that he will receive delivery of the goods in exchange.</P>
    <P>Any Member of this House will agree that the crime situation here throughout the constituencies gives rise to very serious concern. There is an appalling array of mugging, break-ins, drugs, violence, attacks on old people, stealing of cars and the whole gamut of the criminal law books are exploited in full by the criminal fraternity.  Something must be done about that situation.  It is often put forward that social problems give rise to this recent spate &mdash; in the last decade &mdash; of criminal activity, and of course social deprivation is a major factor in the criminal situation at present.  We must tackle the question of social deprivation, but I do not suggest that we have not to tackle the level of criminal activity until the social deprivation problem has been solved, nor do I suggest, because I know it to be untrue, that all or even most criminal activity is a consequence of social deprivation.  We must bear in mind a number of factors when we examine the form and direction of this Bill and its likely effect on the level of crime.  For example, the prison system is already fully extended.  We have enforced early release of prisoners.  The question arises: will the measures in this Bill bring about a higher control of criminals?  Will there be more arrests as a result of this Bill? Will a greater number of dangerous criminals be put away as a result of the Bill? There is considerable doubt about that, and the problems in the expansion of criminal activity have not on the whole been due to difficulties on the part of the Garda in securing convictions or in having a lack of powers.</P>
    <P>I would wish that we would have a situation that would enable the Garda to be available as a police presence particularly <Col N="2379" /> in densely populated areas of our cities and counties.  Years ago gardaí on the beat were a regular and reassuring sight for the residents and were a discouraging warning factor to would-be criminals.  Nowadays, unfortunately, the concept of a garda on the beat is virtually at an end; an occasional perhaps motorised sweep through an estate is all that can be expected and many estates do not have that.  Therefore, while I do not say that the giving of increased powers and increased sentences are not essential and necessary in many instances, I have grave doubts about whether they will deliver the goods on what we require here.  Legal history has shown that even savage sentences did not act as an adequate deterrent in the prevention of crime.  Little more than a hundred years ago the death penalty was imposed for stealing.  Not much more than 100 years ago &mdash; fairly recent legal history &mdash; there were cases of hanging for stealing sheep and a youth was hanged for stealing some food, yet in those days the crime wave was quite unabated.  Therefore, the level of punishment of itself is not necessarily a guarantee that the rate or extent of crime will be controlled.</P>
    <P>The question then arises of bringing in provision for increased sentences as this Bill does, for example, in cases of car stealing which is a very serious problem that we must contend with particularly in Dublin city and county.  It is not just a matter of car stealing; it is what follows from it with people being maimed and injured and cars being driven at break-neck speed.  In my constituency recently a stolen car was driven around a compound area at break-neck speed with a Garda patrol car in pursuit and innocent bystandards and citizens flying in all directions trying to get out of the way. Nothing in this Bill will help in that kind of situation.  The Garda should have power to put down mats to trap these stolen cars.</P>
    <P>In my constituency &mdash; not that I am highlighting my constituency; I am sure such incidents occur everywhere &mdash; I had a telephone call at 12 o'clock one night from a woman who told me she was alone <Col N="2380" /> in a house with a young child and a gang of about 20 youths had surrounded her house and were hurling not only abuse but stones at it.  She was terrified.  She told me she had sent for the Garda three-quarters of an hour previously but so far nobody had arrived.  Therefore, it is not a matter of increasing powers or improving the evidential position; increased Garda presence in the estates is the primary requirement.  There may be financial difficulties about doing that and acquiring the resources for it to be done, but I have grave doubts that putting forward this measure and suggesting that altering the balance of evidential proofs necessary in criminal prosecutions or some of the other measures in this Bill will be sufficient to resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains many worthwhile provisions on the question of bail &mdash; for example, that consecutive sentences must apply for crimes committed while on bail.  I welcome that.  There has been a great deal of public disquiet about the number of notorious cases where it has proved possible for major criminals to jump bail.  They seem to be in a position to do that on occasion.  That is serious. Bail arrangements ought to be so structured and organised that it ought not be possible to jump bail.  Greater care should be exercised than perhaps is being exercised at present, by some of the courts at any rate, in granting bail or in the type of bail granted.  It is of serious concern that major criminals should be seen by the public to be in the position to run away from their liability to face trial. One case came to my notice of a slightly mentally defective man who was charged with slashing at a child with a razor.  This man was of no fixed address but for some incomprehensible reason he was able to get out on bail, leaving the inhabitants of the estate on which he had committed his depredation in a state of absolute fear and terror for their children.  One hesitates to retain in custody a person who has not been as yet convicted of a crime and that aspect must also not be overlooked. The system has worked fairly well on the whole but there have been some serious lapses on the question of bail.  Some guidelines should be necessary <Col N="2381" /> in a Criminal Justice Bill to tighten up the situation, particularly where possible danger to the community would be concerned or in the case of serious crime.</P>
    <P>The question of sentencing is dealt with here.  I agree with the maximum sentence for car stealing being increased.  It is right, proper and necessary.  However, in convictions which have taken place heretofore on this charge, was the maximum sentence provided under the existing legislation imposed?  On examination, this will be found to have been rarely done. Where is the point in increasing the powers of the court to impose higher sentences if they are not imposing even the sentences laid down in existing legislation? The question ought perhaps to be considered in the context not of maximum sentences but, in certain circumstances, minimum sentences to apply to certain types of offence, possibly car stealing.  Hit and run driving offences, are an increasing phenomenon in our society.  People knock someone down, leave him or her dying or bleeding on the roadside and drive off.  Might it not be appropriate to have a minimum sentence for someone in that category?  Might it not also be appropriate in cases of violent assaults?  The only field in our legal system where there is anything like a minimum sentence is the mandatory suspension of driving in the drunken driving conviction.  In certain limited categories of offence and under certain circumstances there is a case today for a mandatory minimum sentence.  I would include in those car stealing &mdash; possibly confined to a second offence &mdash; the hit and run driver and violent physical assaults.</P>
    <P>There are many useful measures in the Bill for which I should like to express my support.  These include the necessity to give notice of alibis, the taking away of the right to make an unsworn statement and the provisions on majority verdicts.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the powers given to arrest and detain people for questioning.  This provision could affect innocent people who happened to be in the vicinity of a crime.  It could conceivably cause great misery to many innocent people.  Given that power, the temptation would be for the police authorities to cast their net too <Col N="2382" /> wide and perhaps take in for questioning a large number of people among whom they might suspect a guilty person to be present.  If it were as simple as Deputy Tunney indicated &mdash; a matter of answering a few questions for half an hour &mdash; no innocent person might mind that, but it could very well go considerably beyond that.  A quite innocent person could find himself or herself literally under restraint and locked up for many hours.  One must strike a balance between the advantages to be gained and the concessions to be made here.  The power given is too wide and at the very least the safeguards recommended in the Ó Briain Report should be adopted and written into the Bill. However, I hope to tease out these matters on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that in the past there have been allegations of Garda ill-treatment of persons in custody.  These instances may not be many but, nonetheless, those allegations have been made and it is essential before the measure is implemented that the complaints procedure referred to by the Minister be brought into being and that it have full and plenary powers to send for witnesses, or for gardaí against whom complaints might have been made.  It is essential that the complaints body be constituted independent of the Garda authority.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of inferences drawn in sections 16, 17 and 18.  These go against the very ancient legal principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty.  If these measures are adopted we must face the fact that that basic principle will no longer be there.  The responsibility is thrown on a person to decide what is or what is not material to his or her defence.  A person could be tried not only for the offence but for lack of skill in answering questions, possible about technical matters.  This represents a change in our whole approach to criminal law from the accusatorial system to the inquisitorial system.  That may have to be, but if it does then the inquisition should take place before an independent person and the questions and answers recorded verbatim. The position is that the accused person is placed in the position of having to make his own defence fully and accurately <Col N="2383" /> at the time he is arrested or run the risk of having his failure to do so used against him.  It has been pointed out that the source of this concept was the 11th Report of the English Law Revision Commission of 1972.  In fact, sections 16 to 18 of the Bill go beyond that report yet these sections were rejected by two Tory Governments as being dangerous and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The questioning and failure to mention facts which can occur sometimes by reason of chance, by a person's inadvertence or stupidity would take place in a situation where neither the Garda nor the person being questioned would have recourse to legal advice as to what might or might not be a matter of defence in proceedings which at that stage did not even exist.  This question of the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof resting on the prosecution has been treated somewhat lightly by some of the previous speakers.  It is a very sacred principle and An Príomh Breitheamh Ó Dálaigh, in the case of The People at the suit of the Attorney General against O'Callaghan in 1966, said:</P>
    <P>The courts owe more than verbal respect to the principle that punishment begins after conviction and that every man is deemed to be innocent until tried and duly found guilty.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice McKenna, a well known English judge wrote:</P>
    <P>I do not find it far fetched to suppose that even an innocent man might wish to reserve his defence until his trial or until he has had an opportunity of being legally advised and to postpone his cross-examination until he would be protected by an impartial judge.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of silence by a suspected person may be as a result of many other factors other than a desire to conceal his possible guilt.  A person might stay silent, for example, by reason of his inability to articulate clearly, fear arising out of confrontation with persons involved wielding authoritative questions, fear arising from him being in an unaccustomed position or environment <Col N="2384" /> and the resulting isolation effects of finding himself in that situation, a stubborness in attitude when confronted with often unfriendly agents of the State, a belief that the allegations being made against the person were so baseless as not even to warrant a reply or an inability to understand the process in which the person is participating whether from feebleness of mind, old age, downright stupidity or the inability of the particular member of the Garda to explain it simply.</P>
    <P>The question of silence in the way it is proposed to alter it in the Bill requires further consideration by the House.  It seems to me that at the very least there should be a provision under which the rules governing the situation in simple and clear language would be printed and handed to the person involved.  That person should be given an opportunity to read the rules and study them.  He or she should have it in writing beforehand what the situation is and the inference that might be drawn as a result of a failure to deal with the questions put.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of valuable material in the Bill which will help.  It is not an answer to the problems our communities are complaining of.  In my view an increased and more efficient Garda presence can give the protection people need and are not getting at present.  Some of the increases in power require further consideration and I hope the Minister, as he indicated, will be amenable when we are discussing the situation on Committee Stage to have additional protections and safeguards that will preserve as far as possible the liberties of the individual, something we fought for and cherish, while at the same time provide protection for the ordinary citizen against the ravages of crime and the criminal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this long overdue legislation which should have been introduced two or three years ago.  The Bill was ready this time last year when Fianna Fáil left office and at last it has been brought before us.  The lawbreakers have been exploiting the system and putting the community at risk for a long time.  I will not be as lenient towards them as the last speaker, I intend to be <Col N="2385" /> very harsh on the criminal because for too long our citizen have been terrorised and put into a situation where they are afraid to open their halldoors to answer a knock.  Our citizen are afraid to walk our streets or go to the centre of this city to attend a cinema or go to a restaurant. About two weeks ago I was crossing O'Connell Street from the Gresham Hotel with a friend when in one swift swoop her bag was snatched from her shoulder.  When we looked around to see who took the bag there was nobody near us.  When it is not possible to walk our streets day or night something drastic must be done to protect our people.  The law has been leaning over backwards in favour of the criminal and has lost the responsibility to protect society.</P>
      <P>Our people must be protected against the criminals, the muggers and the car thieves.  It appears that such people have taken over.  They have taken away our human rights and left us in a situation where we are not safe in our homes.  Our Garda force is one of the best in the world but their efforts in recent years to try to convict criminals from the youngest to the oldest have been stymied.  They have arrested young boys and girls &mdash; in some cases it took them a long time to find them &mdash; but after bringing them before the courts they are allowed back on the streets again.  Such offenders are often back on the streets before the gardaí are back to their bases.  It is no wonder that such young offenders laugh at the gardaí. they are making fools of the gardaí.  The gardaí are frustrated and are not able to cope with the situation.</P>
      <P>When this Bill has been enacted I wonder if it will mean there will be more convictions, that we will have droves of young people being arrested and no where to put them?  At the moment we have them going to Mountjoy, in one door and out the other.  Nine times out of ten they are not convicted, or they get out on bail.  I ask again, where will we put them?  What will we do with the young car thieves if we hand out five-year prison sentences to them?  Will they serve even a month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ways and means will have to be devised, places of detention will have to <Col N="2386" /> be acquired to put away those young offenders who are terrorising our citizens.  Every night dozens of cars are stolen and burned in my constituency. Recently we had a serious accident when a group of young car thieves drove into a crowd.  Several were injured and two people lost their lives.</P>
    <P>We must look back to the time when they were four or five years old, when they began to go to school.  Parents at the moment do not seem to accept any responsibility for their children.  Perhaps the parents themselves are suffering agonies from unemployment.  Perhaps the parents are too worried about their own situation to give any attention to their children.  It seems that parents have given up.  Therefore, it is evident that unemployment has a lot to do with the increase in teenage crime, with the complete breakdown of law and order here. School children have lost all sense of authority and since corporal punishment was abolished things have got worse.</P>
    <P>I disagreed with the abolition of corporal punishment.  I do not think that three or four slaps on the hand did any harm.  Many the slap I got when I was at school and it did not do me any harm because it made me feel that the teacher was the authority whom I had to respect. I knew I had to be quiet and behave myself.  Now the children make fools of the teachers.  They abuse them continually because they know the teachers have no authority over them.</P>
    <P>I served on a school committee which dealt with children who are not going to school &mdash; we sat once a month and interviewed the young people who had been mitching.  I remember an occasion when two boys aged nine years came before us. Their parents were with them and one mother was extremely upset.  I asked them: &ldquo;You are not going to school &mdash; what do you do after you leave the house?&rdquo;.  They said: &ldquo;We go breaking into factories and stealing.  Then we go along the road and we sell what we have stolen to people on the road&rdquo;.  I was horrified to hear that two nine year olds who had been leaving their homes to go to school each morning could do such things.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2387" /> Until proper discipline has been brought back to the schools you will have young criminals of 14 and 15 years of age leaving school and going out mugging and stealing cars.  When they look around them they see that everybody else is doing it and they do not think they are brave unless they join in.  Many of them are intimidated into doing it.  At 12 and 13 years of age they make fun of their teachers.  They tell teachers to shut up. The teachers have not the slightest control over clases.</P>
    <P>What can one expect of such children when they leave school?  They cannot get employment and they have to stand at street corners.  Now they are being pushed into the drug scene.  I was campaigning in the by-election recently and was horrified at what I saw from the point of view of drug abuse.  Until we put the pushers into jail for life we will not overcome that problem.</P>
    <P>We have heard talk about civil rights for criminals, about the right to silence, about not being too hard.  We know that their lawyers will have their say.  What about the rights of the people whom they beat up, rob, rape?  What are we doing for them?</P>
    <P>Recently we saw the case of a man who got a nine-month suspended sentence for raping a 16-year-old and another man getting a similar sentence for raping and abusing a slightly retarded 13-year-old girl.  Why can we not impose the maximum sentence of life imprisonment for such offences?  When will we begin to impose even five-year sentences?  Where are the justice and the human rights in that sort of thing?</P>
    <P>I heard recently &mdash; I have not read this and I am not sure of its truth &mdash; of a man who had committed rape and who murdered a 16-year-old girl.  I have heard he is out on bail.  Where is the justice there? We are talking about the rights of criminals, of murderers and rapists, without any thought for the victims.</P>
    <P>We must remind ourselves of what all this violence is costing the country. Recently the New Ireland Forum issued a document on the cost of violence in the North during the past 13 years.  What <Col N="2388" /> about the cost of what I will call everyday crime here, the malicious damage claims on Dublin Corporation for the breaking of windows and the bashing in of doors, the insurance claims by people maimed by stolen cars, of malicious claims when young people burn down factories and other premises?</P>
    <P>When we catch criminals and they are convicted, after much effort by the Garda, if there is room we put them into beautiful prisons complete with videos and television.  They are given three good meals per day.  They are better off than they ever were before.  They have videos and colour television at the press of a button.  When a criminal is convicted he should be made to feel uncomfortable. He should be put somewhere which will impress itself on his memory as some place in which he would not care to find himself incarcerated again.  He should be made to do some work for the community. He should be made to compensate in some way for the damage he has done.  He should not be put into Mountjoy where life is fairly comfortable and where prisoners have facilities that they may never have enjoyed outside.</P>
    <P>There is another type of criminal.  I do not know how one would deal with him, but is there any section in this Bill under which this criminal could be arrested and brought to justice.  I refer to the man in this city who is the boss of the prostitutes. I refer to the pimp.  The girls are arrested, the girls who are being exploited by the pimp.  They are brought before the court and sentenced.  Those who exploit them, who manhandle them, abuse and beat them, come out at the end of the week with £500 or £1,000 in their pockets.  They are the people who are making money by exploiting these girls.  Is one of them ever in court?  Is one of them ever sentenced and put in jail?  No. But the girls whom they control are charged and brought to court.  Pimps, the bosses, get off scotfree.</P>
    <P>The situation is extremely serious.  I would make criminals pay totally.  I have no time for them.  My concern is for those citizens who have lost their liberty and their human rights, those citizens who do not even feel safe sitting in their own <Col N="2389" /> homes, those citizens who cannot go for a walk in the evening in safety.  What is our country coming to when we cannot control crime?  We have allowed it to become almost out of hand, uncontrollable. Some place must be found for these young offenders in particular.  I am concerned because I see evidence of what I am talking about all over my constituency. Some place must be found in which they can be kept for a length of time and possibly trained in some trade or craft. Above all, they must be made to realise they have a duty to society and they may not go around causing harm, inconvenience and outright terror to people.</P>
    <P>At a meeting recently some people suggested that somewhere like Spike Island would be a good place to put these offenders.  I agree it should be somewhere remote, somewhere where they feel isolated, somewhere from which they will come back with a better regard for their fellow citizens.  They must be made to realise they have a duty to their country and to the people who inhabit it.  I would put them on Spike Island.  Perhaps I am being a little harsh.  I would not like to see anybody who is innocent accused in the wrong or intimidated in any way but I agree with Deputy Tunney that, if it has to be that, so be it.  Why not?  We have to ensure that the community by and large feel reasonably safe, that the community by and large live in circumstances in which they are not terrorised and intimidated and where they can live in peace in their own homes.</P>
    <P>I will give this Bill a year to see how it works.  If the crime rate is not drastically reduced within that period and the Garda Síochána are unable to control the situation, then proper facilities to do their job in a proper manner must be given to them, given with all the backing of this Oireachtas in whatever they need.  I know last year 2,000 extra gardaí were trained in Templemore.  If there are still not enough, let us have 2,000 more.  Let us have proper protection for the people. Let us have gardaí on the beat.  Let us have them on the streets, in the shops, or wherever they are needed.  Let us give this Bill one year.  I hope it will not be a year before it beings to function.  I hope <Col N="2390" /> it will function in a very short time.  At the end of the year we will have to have another look at the situation and, if at the end of that period, our citizens are not protected and living in peace we shall have to bring in even stricter measures to ensure that vandalism, mugging, car stealing and bag snatching stop and, whatever that takes, it will have to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say something about the background in which this Bill is being introduced.  The report on crime by the Commissioner for the year 1982 has just been published. The report shows a rising crime rate, an increase of 10 per cent in 1982 over 1981. It has to be noted that the increase in crime is essentially an urban problem. The figures show that quite clearly.  In Dublin for every 1,000 of the population 57 were involved in serious crime in 1982. In Limerick the figure is 33 per thousand and, in Cork, it is 30.  There is a very interesting contrast in Cork.  In the Cork-east district, which is basically city, the figure is 30.  In Cork-west the figure is eight.  That figure is mirrored all round the rural areas.  The further west one goes, the lower the population and, in many respects, the poorer, the lower the crime rate.  We are talking then about the more affluent and more highly populated areas providing the more serious crime rates.</P>
      <P>The second point noteworthy in the background to this Bill is the inevitable result of the spillover of violence from Northern Ireland.  I believe that has had an effect on crime rates here.  Another factor is the modern phenomenon of drugs, soft drugs and hard drugs.  A staggering statistic &mdash; to me at any rate &mdash; is the figure for seizures of heroin: in 1981 there was a total of 170 grammes and, in 1982, that figure rose seven and a half times to 1,264 grammes.  If there is no need for a Criminal Justice Bill then I do not know what there is need for.  The case is clearly made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must refer to the increasing crimes committed against the most inoffensive sections of our community &mdash; the aged, children and women.  Another phenomenon <Col N="2391" /> is the creation of &ldquo;no-go areas&rdquo;, particularly in Dublin, the increase in robberies with violence, the increase in bank robberies, the attacks on homes. Driving through the suburbs of our cities now one of the most significant changes in the landscape over the last decade is the number of houses with alarm systems. I never saw one in Cork ten years ago and they were not to be seen in Dublin 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Then there is the pastime of stealing motor cars and the sinister development of protection rackets.  Statistics show that there were 24 murders in 1982 and one quarter of those have still not been detected, a very serious proportion.  One would have to conclude that crime does pay and that the criminal is winning.  The existing law was enacted for a different era and very different social conditions and it is now proving patently unequal to the challenge of the sophisticated professional criminal.  Something must be done about that.</P>
    <P>At any time the balance of advantage should not lie on the side of the criminal, but that is where it has been lying for some time.  This legislation sets out to redress that imbalance and to restore vital confidence in the ability of the State to protect its citizens and to turn back the rising tide of crime.  That is what this Bill is intended to do.  Like most Members I welcome the Bill, as do the people generally. It is a generally, though not perhaps totally, balanced attempt to provide measures which will make it easier to convict criminals while at the same time providing safeguards, the checks and balances which are so essential in the kind of society to which most of us aspire.  I welcome the measure because of the practical and psychological support which it will give to the Garda in their desperate battle against serious crime, particularly in the large cities.  I also commend the new measures relating to appropriate punishments for every serious crimes where previously punishments were not a sufficient deterrent.  The old adage about making the punishment fit the crime is as relevant today as when it was first sung.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2392" /> Sections 3 to 8 deal with detention in Garda custody.  It needs to be emphasised that this power is given in regard to serious crime, not minor misdemeanours. That is a protection but consideration should be given to the idea that the Garda should state the reasonable cause.  The Bill refers to the Garda being empowered to detain a person whom they have arrested without warrant on suspicion with reasonable cause of having committed an indictable offence.  They should be required to record those reasons to the sergeant or superintendent or to the person being questioned or to both.  In the interests of the Garda themselves, as well as in the interests of those being questioned, there ought to be some recognised form of questioning and not the haphazard arrangement whereby there are different forms of questioning in different stations by different gardaí.  I suggest that gardaí should be afforded more legal training because some gardaí will not be equipped to undertake the task of questioning in a very legalistic way.  Such training has been shown to be necessary by gardaí presenting cases in the District Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister has promised to set up a complaints procedure but most of us would prefer to see the terms of that procedure before finally passing the Bill into law in order to form a balanced view.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 to 11 relate to offences committed while on bail.  The notion that a person who commits a crime while on bail will be given a concurrent sentence is almost an incentive to commit crime. The stealing of motor vehicles is a modern urban pastime and changes in the law are badly needed.  Serious firearms offences are covered by section 13 and it is self-evident that in our society we have a growing incidence of crime of violence committed by people bearing arms.  I welcome the provisions dealing with the necessity to disclose sources of arms supply and stolen goods to the Garda.  I am not happy about the provisions regarding the question of inferences.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government following the purchase of the premises to honour their clear commitment to have Clondalkin Paper Mills re-opened for the production of paper.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to rehash in any detail the events which have led to the present serious &mdash; one could almost say tragic &mdash; situation now facing us in regard to the re-opening of Clondalkin Paper Mills.  Leaving aside all the semantics of recent days and weeks, the parsing and analysing of the various statements issued and the comments made on this issue, the charges and counter-charges made and, in particular, the verbal gymnastics of the Minister for Industry and Energy, one basic fact is beyond doubt: the Government in the early hours of 9 February last decided to purchase Clondalkin Paper Mills at a cost of £1.76 million.  The Government's statement after that meeting refers specifically to the commitments of the previous Government made last November and their decision to purchase the mills.  It did not make any reference to the abrogation of the agreement or to any conditions about re-opening.  That was basically the situation on the morning of 9 February.  The Minister for Industry and Energy, acting on behalf of the Taoiseach at that meeting with the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, accepted commitments.  The commitments were entered into by the previous Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wishes to engage in semantics of that kind we are talking about the night of 8 February and the morning of 9 February.  On the 8-9 <Col N="2394" /> February the commitments made by the previous Government were honoured by the Minister for Industry and Energy acting on behalf of the Taoiseach at a meeting with the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I repeat that the Government statement issued after that meeting referred to the commitments of the previous Government and their decision to purchase the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  That statement by the Government, of which the Minister for Industry and Energy is a member, did not make any reference to the abrogation of the agreement entered into by the previous Government or to any conditions as to re-opening.  The very purchase of the Clondalkin Paper Mills for the sum of £1.7 million is an explicit acceptance by the Government of the commitment to re-open the mills.</P>
      <P>I do not propose questioning the Government's motives in arriving at the decision.  It has been said that the decision was taken in order to buy the Labour Party support for the budget, which was a current issue at that time.  The decision was taken, whatever the motivation, to purchase the mills.  That is the central issue in this matter.  The Government by that decision clearly took over the commitment of the previous Government. That was the clear understanding of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions representing the work force of the country.  In their statement of 14 November they justifiably said:</P>
      <P>It is news to us that an agreement made with one Government can be abrogated by its successor without any notification to the other party.</P>
      <P>There was no notification whatever to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in this case.  They continued:</P>
      <P>It is more surprising that such abrogation can be retrospectively applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely in all logic, reason and common sense, this Government or any other Government would not spend this large amount of the taxpayers money buying the mills with the intention of keeping <Col N="2395" /> them closed?  Surely that is not the Government's Alice in Wonderland logic?  There is in commonsense and reason only one purpose for which the purchase of the mills by the State would be justified, for the purpose of reopening them.</P>
    <P>I would like to chronicle briefly the type of abuse of power and position by the Taoiseach in dealing with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in relation to this matter.  On 30 June a letter was sent from Congress to the Taoiseach; on 15 July there was a communication between the Taoiseach and Congress: on 23 September there was a further letter from Congress to the Taoiseach and then telegrams followed on 10 October and 21 October.  All these communications from 30 June to 21 October did not bring any response from the Taoiseach.  In a very specific letter on 23 September from Congress to the Taoiseach the general secretary stated:</P>
    <P>When Congress representatives met you on 15 July last and stressed the extreme urgency of implementing the commitment you acknowledged that the matter should be finalised as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>That letter from the general secretary of Congress was followed by telegrams on 10 October and 21 October.  That all flowed from correspondence which initiated on 30 June following the unwarranted delay after the commitment of the Minister for Industry and Energy last February.  We have a history of regular communications from Congress to the Taoiseach apart from the Minister for Industry and Energy from February to now to which there was no response from the Taoiseach or from the Minister for Industry and Energy.</P>
    <P>This raises very serious implications as far as the whole running and the governing of the country is concerned.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is the most important institution as far as the industrial work force of the country is concerned yet this particular organisation can apparently be treated with that sort <Col N="2396" /> of contempt by the Taoiseach and the Minister who is in the House at the moment.  When we were in Government there were complete bona fide relations patiently established between the then Taoiseach and the Minister for Labour with Congress over many areas and many industrial disputes.  In this situation the word was acknowledged to be the word, a commitment given was a commitment given and Congress knew where the Government, the relative Minister and the Taoiseach stood and vice versa.  A very fundamental aspect is the whole question of the relations which should exist in our society, particularly in this period of economic difficulty between the Government of the day and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is quite evident from the facts in this matter that there is a very serious breach with Congress. There is no point in bringing in the propaganda machine of the Government Information Services to try to cloud over the fact that there is a very serious breach caused by the Government's ineptitude or bad faith.  You can pick either as the cause.  This ineptitude or bad faith is evidenced by the refusal to open the mills as a logical consequence of the Government's purchase of the mills, a purchase that could mean nothing else last February except a commitment to resume production at the mills.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement, quite rightly, regarded the purchase of the mills by the Government as the first step in resuming production there and that, of course, is a commonsense and logical approach.  Serious damage has been done to the credibility of the Government <i>vis-á-vis</i> Congress and that has very serious implications.  I do not expect the Minister to have any appreciation of the serious implications involved &mdash; his whole approach to this has been very lighthearted. This has very serious implications for the whole economy, our industrial relations in particular, in a serious situation which now exists where Congress cannot trust the word of the Government, the Taoiseach or his Ministers.</P>
    <P>We are told that the mills can only re-open when there is a guarantee of future <Col N="2397" /> commercial viability or, to use the Minister's own words, only on the basis of a totally viable project.  The difference between the Minister and our party seems to be that he believes, although I question his belief and political will in this matter, that the Clondalkin Paper Mills cannot be viable and that stems from his basic political philosophy and attitude, whereas we believe the mills can be made viable.</P>

      <P>What does viability mean in this context in regard to Clondalkin? It is a term used in a red herring fashion by the Minister in his exercise in semantics over the weekend through his propaganda chief to confuse the issue in the media.  Is it being used to place impossible hurdles in front of the reopening of the mills?  Is this question of viability being raised as a hare or a scare to divert public attention from the Government's basic responsibility and commitment to reopening the mills?  I hope the Minister appreciates that we are not talking about any ordinary factory or manufacturing enterprise.  We are talking about an industry of strategic national importance, if the Minister has any appreciation of what that means, the only industry of its kind in the country.  I am sure that most of us believe we have to make the most of our natural resources and develop processing industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that the economics of Clondalkin Paper Mills took a turn for the worse when the decision was taken to close down the pulping plant which relied on thinnings from State forests.  Huge sums of money have been invested in State forests and it is our job to ensure that we derive a national dividend from them, either in money terms or employment. It should be part of our objectives, once the mills are back in production, to bring the pulping plant into production, as well as the major part of the mills, at an early date.  I cannot imagine how any reasonable or responsible person would accept that it is sound policy and good economics to let this industry, so vital to <Col N="2398" /> our national interest, go the wall while at the same time we will continue to import ever increasing quantities of paper which we should be manufacturing in Clondalkin. In 1975, when Clondalkin was in production, paper imports were 169,000 tonnes.  Contrast those import figures with those for 1981 and 1982 which were nearly double that amount.  In 1981 298,000 tonnes were imported and in 1982 we imported 306,000 tonnes.  Would it not be sheer economic madness to let this situation continue while our own paper mills in Clondalkin remain closed?</P>
    <P>Clondalkin Paper Mills was a profitable enterprise for most of its existence and I understand that as recently as two years ago Fóir Teoranta were of the opinion that, while needing greater resources at that time than the group were in a position to make available, the mills could be made viable in the longer term. The Boston consulting group which reported two years ago &mdash; and the report was available to the previous Coalition Government at the time &mdash; showed how the mills, if restructured, could be viable as well as profitable.  I call on the Minister to lay a copy of this report in the Library so that its recommendations are accessible to everyone.</P>
    <P>As a Government Minister I saw the very positive and constructive recommendations contained in that report but it is not available.  I challenge the Minister to make it available so that Deputies may see the essential basic viability of this enterprise.  This neglect by the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister is particularly inexcusable in the light of the fact that every international forecast at present indicates that the world supply of paper and pulp is decreasing and the cost increasing.  It is internationally anticipated that there will be a major crisis before the year 2000 in the availability of newsprint and paper due to the increased consumption of paper, increasing populations and deforestation which is taking place in many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I am aware that as a high energy user the cost of energy has been a heavy drain over the years on the financial resources of the mills.  The time has come, and the Government might apply their brains to <Col N="2399" /> this, to examine scientifically as a matter of urgency the possibility of Clondalkin Mills availing itself of another energy source, perhaps Kinsale Gas.  If this proved possible and practical it would be of enormous benefit to the mills.  In any event, the case for re-opening the mills now and starting immediate production is a thoroughly good one both on economic grounds and, above all else, in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I now come to the two amendments to our motion.  The notion of State ownership, if necessary, contained in The Workers' Party amendment is implicit in our motion and part of our position on the whole issue.  They are saying nothing we have not been saying for a long time. This is not the first time such a suggestion has been put forward.  In a newspaper cutting of 26 January 1982 in <i>The Irish Press</i> I was reported as saying that this was not a lame duck industry and that if in the last analysis agreement was not found I would advocate the final solution of nationalisation as the nation could not afford to lose this industry.  These remarks were made during the previous term of office of the Coalition Government. Ironically, it was the day before the Government fell, although we did not know that, and we were on a deputation to the then Labour Tánaiste, now Fine Gael Deputy, Deputy Michael O'Leary, who indignantly refuted any suggestion that there should be any interference on the part of his <i>laissez-faire</i> Government with mere matters of national importance such as Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>However, after the election of February 1982 Fianna Fáil's plan to combat unemployment included a commitment to protect employment in industries of strategic importance such as the Whitegate Oil Refinery and the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  If any one is disposed to doubt our good faith I wish to point out that Fianna Fáil went ahead with the nationalisation of Whitegate Oil Refinery and it is now seen to be one of the best decisions made by a Government in recent years.  The situation in Clondalkin was rather more complicated owing to legal matters, which we finally resolved <Col N="2400" /> before we left office.  We were able to put together &mdash; and this was indicated to Congress by the then Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy Reynolds &mdash; a timetable for acquisition and re-opening of the mills, if necessary in public ownership.</P>
    <P>Why are the Minister and the Government not prepared to accept our motion? I suggest one of the reasons is that the Minister is determined at all costs to avoid nationalisation.  The Government amendment implies clearly that there will be no State ownership of the mills in any circumstances.  The Minister for Industry and Energy is adamant that Clondalkin Paper Mills, if they are to be run at all, must be run by a private company.  His motion merely endorses the continuing efforts of the Government to have the mills re-opened on a viable basis.  That means nothing.  Such efforts, if confined to the private sector, may fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the inherent viability of the paper mills but which have everything to do, unfortunately, with capacity problems and corporate interests abroad, issues which should be ignored in any consideration of viability in the real meaning of that word and not just when used simply as a cliché.</P>
    <P>If the Labour Party vote for the motion in the name of the Minister they will be voting against nationalisation in any circumstances. Here I am throwing out a few ideas.  Ownership could be vested, for instance, in the National Enterprise Agency for who the sum of £3 million was allocated in the capital budget and who hold &mdash; this is dear to the heart of the Labour Party &mdash; the unspent sum of £7 million which was allocated to the National Development Corporation. There are also joint venture possibilities as between the Government and private enterprise which could be explored as a matter of urgency once the decision to re-open is made.  Are the Labour Party to betray not only the workers in Clondalkin but also the party's philosophy? Only last November the Labour Party claimed that the private sector approach to job creation has failed patently.  Yet, they are prepared to let the question of the re-opening of Clondalkin Paper Mills <Col N="2401" /> stand or fall on the basis of efforts to persuade some foreign company to take over Clondalkin Paper Mills?  If they support the motion in the name of the Minister, they will be turning their policy on its head and saying that the public sector approach cannot succeed and should not be tried.  It is very sad that any such attitude should be taken by the Labour Party.  Apart from the general philosophical attitude to which I have just referred, I would remind the House that the Leader of the Labour Party said that he wished to reiterate that the party were in favour of the re-opening of Clondalkin Paper Mills and of the maintaining of employment there.  He said that his party would do all in their power to bring that about.  I do not pay any attention to what Fine Gael say.  They also made promises but they are irresponsible people whereas I respect the Labour Party.  That is why I am saying that so far as they are concerned there is a question of honour and of philosophy at stake from the very serious issue of the workers concerned and of the political commitment that was made to them by that party.  The vote on this motion tomorrow will show whether there is any cohesion or consistency remaining in the Labour Party and whether they are prepared to support the basic right-wing ideology of the Minister and his people.</P>
    <P>I say to the Government that the time for theorising and for one-up-manship is over, that what is needed now is urgent action and Government decision based on serious purpose in regard to this matter. To the two hunger strikers, who are friends of mine and whom I met again this morning &mdash; Brian Nolan and Myles Spreight &mdash; I say that they have taken very principled and courageous action on this issue, that they have made their protest on their own behalf and on behalf of their fellow workers but now that their voices have been heard loud and clear I appeal to them not to put their lives at further risk, to call off their hunger strike. I assure them that if others are not prepared to look after the interests of the workers concerned in Clondalkin, Fianna Fáil will look after them and will do so in partnership with the ICTU.  Together we <Col N="2402" /> will ensure that this matter is not allowed to rest.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in a position to bring this deplorable situation to an end.  I am asking him to do so now.  There has been too much prevarication, delay and two-timing. This has led to a profound sense of disillusion not only among the workers in Clondalkin but throughout the whole country and in particular in the trade union movement.  We do not wish to hear in the Minister's contribution a mere duplication of platitudes.  By reason of ineptitude or of bad faith, this whole matter has now reached a very serious stage.  There has been enough suffering and hardship caused.  The Government must not add to the loss of jobs or allow the tragic loss of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;endorses the continuing efforts of the Government to have Clondalkin Paper Mills re-opened on a viable basis&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My concern in this entire matter has been to ensure that two things are achieved. The first is that any investment of taxpayers' money, for which I am the trustee so far as industry and energy are concerned, is a viable investment and, secondly, within that constraint do my utmost to have Clondalkin Paper Mills re-opened. I stress that to open the mills on anything other than the viable basis which is the core of the amendment, would not be to do anyone a favour.  It would not be a favour to the workers involved because in an enterprise that is not viable their jobs would be brief and insecure.</P>
      <P>I was glad yesterday &mdash; and surprised that Deputy Lenihan did not refer to this &mdash; to receive a report, which I subsequently studied, of the statement on radio of his colleague, my predecessor, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  Although Deputy Reynolds and I have had our disagreements in the past &mdash; they have never been very deep &mdash; I feel we are at one in our basic objectives in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to quote from a transcript <Col N="2403" /> of Deputy Reynolds's remarks.  Perhaps they might help Deputy Lenihan to recast some of the things he said in his contribution. Deputy Reynolds said:</P>
    <P>... I wouldn't attempt to get involved in Clondalkin Paper Mills if I didn't believe I could put it together on a viable basis.</P>
    <P>He was asked the question:</P>
    <P>When you made the initial commitment to Congress you were not making it as a precondition that the Mill should be viable.  It was not spelled out clearly?</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds's reply to that was:</P>
    <P>Absolutely spelled out clearly from the first meeting...</P>
    <P>That was what he said in regard to viability being a precondition.  Again he said:</P>
    <P>It is not in question with the workers there because there is no point in opening a lame duck situation that is going to close again in 6 to 12 months.</P>
    <P>He was asked by Phil Crotty:</P>
    <P>But in a sense you are probably agreeing with Minister Bruton in that you are saying that the Mill must be viable to be reopened?</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds's reply was:</P>
    <P>I have never said otherwise.  It was never a question.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is clear from the record that Deputy Reynolds, whatever about Deputy Lenihan, is in agreement with the Government's policy, the policy contained in my amendment here, which is to have the mill reopened on a viable basis only.  Given the extent of the taxpayers' commitment that is involved, given also the interest of the workers, the interest of everybody who might become creditor suppliers to this enterprise, in the interests of anybody giving a commitment, either as a worker, investor or as a creditor supplier, it is in all of their interests that the project be assessed carefully first so that everybody can be <Col N="2404" /> fully satisfied that it is only being recommenced on a viable basis and that is what I have been trying to do.</P>
    <P>In this difficult situation I appeal for calm and restraint on all sides to allow time for negotiation.  As I have already indicated, the IDA are in negotiation with two private sector interests from overseas in regard to this matter.  Clearly we must aim to get the best possible deal both for the taxpayer and for the potential employees of Clondalkin Paper Mills. I do not believe that forcing the Government's hand, pushing the Government by any means, by applying pressure of any form, into reaching a particular agreement within one, two or three days, is likely to help the Government to make the best possible deal.  Clearly the Government's negotiating position would be strengthened if people were to say: &ldquo;Look, you go out there and make the best possible deal,&rdquo; not: &ldquo;You go out there and make a deal by next Friday.&rdquo; Anybody who is told that they must make a deal by a particular time &mdash; and there have been various ultimata issued in this context &mdash; is obviously at a disadvantage in negotiations.  As far as I am concerned, as I have said, as Minister for Industry and Energy, as a trustee of the money of the Irish people, contributed through their taxes, I am not going to be rushed into making a deal other than the one I believe to be the best possible that can be obtained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan asked the question: why was this mill bought?  He sought to imply at a number of points in his contribution that, having bought the mill, the Government were not serious about trying to have it re-opened.  I categorically reject that assertion of Deputy Lenihan.  I should like to cite some evidence which I am sure fair-minded people will see to be convincing, though I am not certain it will be sufficient to convince Deputy Lenihan.  First of all, if we had not acquired the mill at the time we did it would have been sold by the receiver, for any purpose, not necessarily paper making, and would not have been available to be promoted by the IDA for paper making.  Therefore, the very decision of purchasing the mill was clear <Col N="2405" /> indication of the Government's anxiety to create the conditions under which paper making could be recommended on a viable basis, a very tangible indication of that anxiety.  Having purchase the mill the IDA then contacted 120 firms throughout the world, firms involved in and with an expertise in paper making with a view to endeavouring to interest them in having Clondalkin Paper Mills restarted for paper making.</P>
    <P>I should like to indicate briefly if I may, why it is important to contact firms all over the world.  This is something that may be of interest to Deputy Lenihan. The fact is that the market for paper is a world market.  One is talking here of getting into market opportunities that might exist in the Far East, South Africa, the Middle East, virtually all over the world. These are amongst the markets being discussed at present in some of the discussions we are having with possible promoters. Clearly international companies, with international contacts, are in the best possible position to know where the market niches exist for the type of paper that can be produced in Ireland.  We are not simply talking about supplying the Irish market.  Indeed, if we want to do the best possible job, we have got to specialise and develop an export business. This is something I had thought was common cause in economic policy on all sides of this House.  Clearly it was and is the right strategy to look for international promoters, with international market contacts, to ensure that the best and most sustainable prospects for employment in Clondalkin can be created.  To build a project simply around the home market without this well developed international network of contacts would probably be very rash indeed.</P>
    <P>Out of those 120 firms who were contacted three firms made site visits to Clondalkin. A detailed proposal was made by one of those, which was mentioned in the public press, FMI, on 30 June last.  This was discussed by the board of the IDA very shortly afterwards.  They decided, in order to examine it carefully, indeed in order to provide a basis of information for future policy making in regard to this whole matter, to engage consultants, the <Col N="2406" /> Boston Consultancy Group, who were taken on by the IDA to examine this project and paper making generally in mid-July.  They are, I stress, to my knowledge, the principal international consultants in the area of paper.  They are the people with the best international reputation as consultants in this area. Prior to taking on their assignment they had one day and a half of intensive briefing by the Industrial Development Authority on all of the considerations that needed to be taken into account. They were given one month to present their report.  They presented it on time in the middle of August.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority again had a 12-hour discussion with the Boston Consultancy Group on the contents of the report.  They went through it line by line, paragraph by paragraph. Therefore, it was not simply a case of the Boston Consultancy Group, however eminent they may be, making a report; it was also a case of the Industrial Development Authority giving very considerable time both in initially briefing them as to what their task was and subsequently in going through the conclusions of the report.  The IDA considered this report and the discussion report of their own staff and decided they could not support the project as then put forward. In fact, it had been reckoned by the consultants that the proposal had no better than, on average, a 20 per cent chance of success, and, by inference, an 80 per cent chance of failure and the IDA decided that they could not support this proposal.</P>
    <P>In my view it has been one of the great strengths of Irish industrial policy that in investment decisions of this kind we have the benefit of an independent authority established by statute.  If I may say so, we are much more fortunate in this regard than our neighbours across the Irish Sea. There are many instances of British Governments being forced into taking decisions on political/economic considerations which subsequently turned out to be quite unwise and which they would not have taken if they had had the wisdom which Irish Governments of all political persuasions have had of ensuring <Col N="2407" /> that decisions of this kind were taken by an independent authority using the best commercial judgment available to them.</P>
    <P>The IDA were established in 1949 by an inter-party Government consisting of the Labour Party, Fine Gael and others, and their present powers were much extended and underlined by Fianna Fáil in 1969.  The authority have been much respected by people on both sides of this House. We all realise what a great strength it is that we have an independent body like this to make these sorts of decisions.  The authority do not consist solely of people employed by the State. They use much of their own staff for their own work, but they also use international consultants as they did in this case.  More important, the authority consist in the main of practical business people who are engaged in making this sort of decision on a day to day basis.  That, in my view, is the most important aspect.</P>
    <P>The authority, after all that consideration, decided that that particular project could not be recommended.  That decision was not altered by the Government when they considered the matter on 14 October.  I subsequently made it clear that the IDA would continue their efforts, in consultation with this particular promoter and with any others that might be available, to seek a new project that would have the possibility of viability. As a result, the staff of the IDA have been in Canada for further discussions with the FMI Group.  I also received some ten days ago, or slightly less, an approach from a British interest who were anxious to get involved in the setting up of a viable paper industry in Clondalkin.  I am glad to say that after the initial inquiry to my office and contact with this interest by the IDA, their board confirmed that they wished to enter into meaningful discussions about the matter.  Staff from the IDA, with whom I have had some discussions in the last hour, will be spending two days &mdash; tomorrow and Thursday &mdash; at the premises of this large British firm for detailed discussions.  It is hoped that they may be able to visit Ireland next week.  If they do I intend to meet them.</P>
    <P>I have also indicated that I am prepared <Col N="2408" /> to meet the FMI Group if they consider a meeting with me would be productive.  They made an approach to meet me on a day I was not available, but I have indicated then and since that I am anxious to meet them should that be seen by them to be beneficial.</P>
    <P>It is important that I should explain to the House some of the difficulties that lie in our way and, notwithstanding the rather trenchant nature of some of Deputy Lenihan's statement, I feel there is a certain amount of common ground between us in that we are all anxious to see the papermaking industry re-established in Clondalkin on a viable basis. We should all realise the problems we face in this regard.  No benefit would be served if Deputy Lenihan were to make a political issue out of this.  He must see this in its true economic reality because sentiment, however strong it may be and however well motivated, will not sell paper.  We have to take account of commercial realities if we are going to set up a business that cannot just produce but sell paper.  The two are of equal importance. The concentration so far has almost exclusively been on production and not enough on the selling aspect.</P>
    <P>Since the Clondalkin Paper Mills closed, or at least since 1980 &mdash; and this is an indication of the extent of the problems in the paper industry worldwide &mdash; there have been 470 mill closures in Europe.  It has become a much more competitive operation.  The size of machine in use has increased dramatically.  The capacity of the mill and machines in Clondalkin is about 24,000 tonnes.  Machines are now in use with a capacity, and hence efficiency, corresponding to 200,000 tonnes.  There has been a great improvement in the internal efficiency of the mills that remains after the very large culling out of mills to which I referred in the form of mill closures of 470.  Furthermore, as has been referred to by Deputy Lenihan, there has been considerable emphasis on integrated mills.  These have become the mills that have been able to dominate the scene more completely than ever before, mills where there is both a pulping operating and paper production, and the combination of the two <Col N="2409" /> has given an advantage to these very large operations with this combination.</P>
    <P>These are the competitive realities that we now face.  Sensible people will agree that the more difficult the international trading environment in any area &mdash; nobody will deny that the paper market is particularly difficult at the moment &mdash; the more careful must be the Government in their assessment of projects, because the risk factor in a difficult market is higher than in a buoyant market. Suggestions have been made that there has been considerable improvement in the paper market.  I noted that a statement to that effect in <i>The Financial Times</i> in the region of three weeks ago where reference was made to the fact that the mills in the UK were busier than they had been.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately on seeing this statement in <i>The Financial Times</i> I referred to the IDA for consideration with the Boston Consultancy Group to ask them if the improvement that I had noted in <i>The Financial Times</i> in a statement attributed to the British Paper Manufacturers Association changed their conclusions about the project that they had considered in a way that would make the prospects more favourable and hence improve the viability.  The Boston Consultancy Group, at my request conveyed through them the IDA, re-examined their calculations on the basis of this new information which I had drawn to their attention.  I have been informed that they have concluded that it did not change the conclusion that they had reached in regard to this matter.  The reason for this is that the improvement in price is not uniform.  For instance, there has been a considerable improvement in newsprint prices but Clondalkin do not and cannot produce newsprint.  They are engaged in the production of other types of paper. The improvements have not been uniform to all types of paper.  However, I will ensure that in their assessment of these proposals the IDA make sure that they take full account of any improvements <Col N="2410" /> that are taking place in the world market so that the full benefit of the doubt is given to any proposal.  The indication that I have given of my prompt action in referring this item of information to the IDA is indicative of my concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As I have said, pressure of the type that the Government are now being subjected to does not help them to get the best possible deal for the taxpayer, the workers in Clondalkin and the private sector interests involved.  I do not believe that anyone should try to press the Government into making arrangements that are not the best possible deal or to use pressure to that effect.  Secondly, I do not believe that sit-ins assist industrial promotion in Ireland.  Industrial sit-ins do not assist our image as a location for international investment.</P>

I do not see any former Minister for Industry and Energy in the House, apart from my colleague Deputy O'Leary, but those who have served in this office will realise how important it is to maintain a good image of Ireland.

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate and I will quote a remark which I think very relevant: &ldquo;It is hard to maintain dignity and self respect, let alone idealism, in the face of rising unemployment.&rdquo;  Those are not my words nor are they the words of any member of my party but of the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, during the election campaign in 1981.  I quoted those remarks two years ago this very month in the Dáil when the prospects of Clondalkin Paper Mills and their closure faced this House.  I said then, as did my colleagues in Fianna Fáil, that if Clondalkin Paper Mills closed down Clondalkin would be nothing but a ghost town.  I am sorry to have to say that two years later that that is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have studied English like anybody else but I am not a linguistics expert and in order to understand the phrases coming from this Government one would need to be such a person.  If a Government commit themselves to spending taxpayers' money in the buying of any plant surely that Government are going to do the obvious thing, open the plant and begin production.  We are now being told by this Minister that that was not the case.  Not only do I believe that the decision to buy a plant must mean the intent to open it, but so too do the ICTU.  When one is dealing with the ICTU one is not dealing with any normal, average group of people.  These are tough negotiators who have been in the business for a long time and are not easily fooled.  When they left Government Buildings on 8 February <Col N="2412" /> last they were in no doubt as to what kind of commitment they had received. Because of the sort of people they are, they understood that to buy a plant meant to re-open a plant.</P>

      <P>I shall later deal with the remarks which the Minister attributed to my colleague, Deputy Reynolds, and show clearly that the commitment of Deputy Reynolds, myself and the other Members of the party was not merely a commitment to buy the mill but to open it &mdash; to restart what in an island country is a strategic industry and can be viable.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he bought the plant because without one we could never have a paper making industry.  I wish the Minister were honest. Did he buy the plant as a monument to the unemployed in Clondalkin, now numbering 834?  Did he buy it as a museum to be visited to commemorate our last fine paper making industry? He bought the plant, not because he was committed to a paper making industry but because he knew that the only way to get the support of his colleagues in the Labour Party in bringing in the budget last year was to purchase this plant and re-open it.</P>

      <P>We continued to follow through that commitment when in Government and on 16 November last in a letter signed by the Minister &mdash; and nothing is more appropriate than that &mdash; to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Deputy Reynolds laid out clearly a programme for the re-opening of Clondalkin Paper Mills.  He finished by saying:</P>
      <P>On completion of refurbishment, the mill will be opened and employment will be phased in in relation to market demand to achieve full production on a two-tier machine.</P>

      <P>Those comments were reiterated in letters, not only to myself and Deputies Walsh, Lenihan and Lemass but to Deputies Taylor and the other people who were interested.  On 18 November Deputy Reynolds said:</P>
      <P>The mill will re-open on completion of refurbishment and employment will be phased in in relation to market demand to a possible level of 200 to 220 jobs.</P>
      <P>Let there be no doubt where Deputy Reynolds stood in relation to the opening of the mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that to force the Government to re-open the mills or complete negotiations within a particular period of time would be to damage those negotiations and prevent the best possible <Col N="2414" /> deal from being achieved.  That may well be the case, but how long can one wait for this Government to complete their negotiations?  It did not take very long on 8 February for the Government to agree to buy the mills.  Perhaps it was at that stage that the Government should have decided whether or not they were viable.  Buying a plant without the intention of beginning production is like building a school in case there might be children who might want to go there.</P>

      <P>What kind of logic is there in spending £1.75 million of taxpayers' money to buy a plant in the event sometime, somehow &mdash; perhaps 20 years hence &mdash; of perhaps getting some people from Canada or the United States or elsewhere to put money up and decide on opening the plant?  If the Minister is trying to tell me and the workers of Clondalkin Paper Mills that that was his intention, he would want to try something else.</P>
      <P>When the last election took place last November the workers in Clondalkin were under no doubt as to the commitment of the Fine Gael Party.  In case they had been in doubt, they were handed a glossy leaflet by Deputy Michael O'Leary and his fellow travellers in Fine Gael outside a polling station in Clondalkin where the 11,000 or so people who could vote were going to vote.  They were told in that leaflet:</P>
      <P>Fine Gael back in Government will honour the commitment of the Fianna Fáil Party to open Clondalkin Paper Mills.</P>
      <P>There was no doubt in the minds of the Fine Gael workers &mdash; at least when that party were trying to secure the votes of the people &mdash; that the commitment was to re-open it.  In case there was any doubt in the minds of the Labour Party members, I quote from a letter sent by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Spring, to Mr. Donal Nevin dated 8 February as follows:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. Nevin,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge your letter of the 5th <Col N="2415" /> of February and I am sure that Congress is pleased, following my intervention and the intervention of the Labour Party, that Clondalkin Paper Mills has been purchased and that the matter has now been brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for the Environment thinks that it is a satisfactory conclusion to buy a plant and leave it there for ever, he is very wrong indeed.  The workers in Clondalkin wanted the plant to be bought in order that they could get back to work and that we could have a proper papermaking industry here.</P>
    <P>My party, and I in particular, have not come here to ask this Government to do anything more than to restart an industry which in a small island country is an essential industry.  During the last war, when this country was cut off and had no paper supply, it was the Clondalkin Paper Mills, manufacturing fine paper from straw, that supplied us with our paper.  If we reach that situation again, or if there is to be a world embargo preventing us from receiving paper from external sources what are we going to do?  I would envisage our whole industrial and commercial life winding to a halt unless we had our own fine paper supplies.  It is because of that my party committed themselves to the continuation of that kind of industry here.</P>
    <P>Faced with similar circumstances some years ago in Scariff, County Clare, my colleague, Deputy O'Malley and the then Fianna Fáil Government kept the Scariff Chipboard Company in production.  I am delighted to say that they are still in production precisely because there are certain types of industries and materials which are strategic to any country.  For that reason we are keen now, even at this late stage, that the Government do not lose an opportunity which may never come their way again.</P>
    <P>When the Minister talks about viability, what does he mean?  For any industry to be viable the most basic ingredient is a work force with the expertise in the making of the product involved.  If this <Col N="2416" /> situation continues for much longer does he think that the expertise which was in Clondalkin when it closed two years ago will still be available?  We are told in various surveys that if people are unemployed for more than 18 months to two years they become unemployable, having lost their previous skills.  The skill and expertise which were and are at our disposal will not always be available to restart this plant and bring it into production. The Minister talks about his determination to save the taxpayer's money and make sure that every penny spent by the Government is spent wisely. I must question that.  When this plant was in private ownership, being run by the Clondalkin Group, in 1981 they faced three major difficulties which they would have had to overcome if the plant were to continue.  Those three difficulties were: the high and rising cost of energy of which the Clondalkin Paper Mills were a major user; the fact that they need assistance from the Employment Guarantee Fund and some money and assistance towards modernising their machines and refurbishing their plant.  What did they do?  They sought the assistance of the then Coalition Government and wrote to the Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, saying:</P>
    <P>We now have 470 employees.  If this plant is to continue with 470 employees we will need some assistance from this Government from the Employment Guarantee Fund in order to keep the men at work.</P>
    <P>What did the Minister for Finance reply on 7 October 1981?  The Minister for Finance in the course of a letter to Mr. Lund, Managing Director of Clondalkin Paper Mills, said it would not be appropriate for any money from the employment guarantee fund to be given to Clondalkin Paper Mills.  That is still the attitude of Deputy John Bruton, now Minister for Industry and Energy, in relation to a paper making plant here.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if it were not for the fact that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and Members of the Labour Party, put severe pressure on the Minister, and the Government, the plant <Col N="2417" /> would not have been purchased.  I am disappointed that Members like Deputy Skelly who during the by-election in 1982 told the voters of Dublin West where he stood in relation to the mills&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">

      <P>Deputy Skelly when addressing the workers of the mill prior to that by-election told them that he, more than any other public representative, was well aware of the plight they were in because he had experience and expertise in paper making.  He told those workers that he was aware that a paper making industry was more than viable at Clondalkin.  I hope the Deputy is able to tell the Minister, and the Government, about his experience and convince them of the viability of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sad that our taxpayers' money was wasted in the last two years on IDA executives trotting back and forth to Canada trying to find a buyer for the plant or to get somebody to go in on a risk-sharing basis &mdash; the Minister has never spelled out the Government's intentions in regard to this.  Substantial amounts of money were spent by such executives negotiating with foreigners. The Minister has told us that 120 firms were contacted and I do not know how many representatives of those firms were met.  However, the travelling expenses for the meetings that took place cost our taxpayers a substantial amount of money. The Minister, and the Government, if they are not fully committed to re-opening the plant, should immediately stop those people travelling on such wasted journeys any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Canadians the Minister referred to are very interested but they will have to meet a Minister who is very reluctant to keep the plant in production.  Those Canadians have had <Col N="2418" /> long experience in paper making and if they are prepared to put £1 million into re-opening the mill their offer should be seriously considered.  I do not believe businessmen would be prepared to put £1 million into a plant unless they considered it viable.  The final negotiations for the mill are being delayed by a lack of political commitment by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>Paper making throughout the world has gone through a difficult period but other countries were reluctant to close down their paper making facilities.  In 1981, the last year for which figures are available, in countries where paper making is a major industry substantial government help was given to keep those industries in existence.  In that year in the UK for every person employed in paper making the Government gave a subsidy of £419.  Norway in the same year gave a subsidy of £45 per employee while the subsidy in Sweden was £671.  The subsidy in Canada in that year was £844 per employee but in Ireland our Government gave a subsidy of a mere £144.  The reason governments in other countries have been keen to give major subsidies to paper making is because they realise, as Fianna Fáil do, that paper making is a strategic industry of tremendous importance. Any country should be slow to let it close.</P>
    <P>Clondalkin Paper Mills, whether it is open by private enterprise or on some joint risk-sharing basis by the Government and private enterprise, will be successful only if the Government decide to plough money into it to subsidise the high energy cost and the refurbishing of the plant which is out of date.  Unless those ingredients are part and parcel of the Government's approach to the opening of the mill they might as well forget about the project.  When considering the viability of the plant it is no harm to consider the position of the men who have been unemployed for two years.  In the last year the mill was in production those employees gave to the State by way of PRSI, PAYE and hydrocarbon oil tax a total of £2 million.  The following year when the workers were unemployed they received from the State in the form of <Col N="2419" /> redundancy payments and unemployment assistance a total of £2 million.  I am told reliably that a sum in the region of £8 million has been lost to the State since the mill closed.  In the first nine months of this year we spent £143 million on the importation of paper and for that reason the sensible approach must be to re-open the plant.</P>
    <P>Our climate means that we have been very successful in the growing of trees and successive Governments since 1948 ploughed a lot of money into an afforestation programme.  I understand that more than one million acres of land is under forestry.  It does not make much sense that last year £25 million worth of trees were exported.  What use was made of those trees abroad?  In Sweden the trees were used in the manufacture of paper which was imported by Ireland.  It makes little sense that the thinnings from our forests now being exported to an English firm are used in the manufacture of newsprint and sold from our forests at £4 per tonne.  Such an amount of timber would make about £98 worth of paper. That approach by successive Governments has led to the present situation. We are not making any use of this natural resource.  In a country like ours which has had such a commitment to afforestation since 1948 it makes more sense to use the produce of those forests to make paper here for our own use.</P>
    <P>When the Clondalkin Paper Mills are re-opened &mdash; even if we must wait until another Fianna Fáil Government is elected &mdash; I hope Government agencies and Departments will buy their supply of paper from the Irish manufacturer.  Sadly that was not the case in the last two years of the existence of the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  Government Departments, local authorities and State agencies continued to buy their paper from foreign suppliers. That does not make much sense when one of our industries needs help.  Every effort should be made to encourage State agencies to buy home made products.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to reconsider seriously his approach since he was appointed to the Department.  I want them to consider seriously the <Col N="2420" /> remarks not only of their own backbenchers, particularly those remarks of Deputy Taylor, because like him I believe that a paper making industry such as the one we had in Clondalkin is an obvious investment for the National Enterprise Agency.  Speaking here on 10 November 1981, Deputy Taylor appreciated this and said:</P>
    <P>It is a situation where it would be most appropriate, if we had a National Development Corporation or a National Enterprise Agency, that they would have a substantial equity in this kind of industry.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Taylor still believes this and I hope that tomorrow night he will vote accordingly.  Accepting that the National Enterprise Agency were allocated £3 million in the last budget and that they have £7 million from the National Development Corporation, if they were to go no further than to start a paper making industry in Clondalkin they would be doing a great service to the country.</P>
    <P>Clondalkin Paper Mills workers in the past two years have been lobbying politicians, union representatives, Government Minister and officials.  They have done everything possible to get their plant re-opened.  Many of them and their families had worked in the plant for many years.  When the 470 employees lost their jobs the average experience at work there was 14 years.  That experience, which they developed during their lives working in the mills, is an invaluable asset in any country but particularly in an economy such as ours.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see this Government or the Dáil failing those people.  Commitments were made.  I regret there is so much conflict between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Government and various representatives.  Last night at a meeting of Dublin County Council separate motions were tabled by the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  It is not usual to have conflict on that sort between the parties in the Coalition.  Last night Labour Party members of Dublin County Council did an honourable thing and voted for the early re-opening of the <Col N="2421" /> mill.  They did that because they realised that their party had given a firm commitment to those workers.</P>
    <P>I do not condone or support hunger strikes.  Therefore, it saddens me that those two young men with whom I and my colleagues have worked in the past two years, should find themselves in a situation that led to a hunger strike.  I do not know what kind of state they are in &mdash; obviously I was never in such a state &mdash; but they were in a state of despair, having gone through every channel. Finally they decided to take this extreme and unusual course of action.  I am sorry they chose that course of action because I do not support it.  Like Deputy Lenihan, I hope they will come off their hunger strike &mdash; they have made their point &mdash; before they do irreparable damage to their health and endanger their lives.  It saddened me to hear their wives on radio yesterday.  I know the agony they have been going through because of their families and when they see their husbands on hunger strike.</P>
    <P>The Clondalkin workers, particularly the hunger strikers, have used every possible means to have the mills re-opened. If they have been told the situation at the beginning the matter would be over and done with now &mdash; they would have accepted the position, perhaps reluctantly.  They were not told.  They were dangled like puppets on a string by one or another Government spokesman. They were told negotiations were under way, to have more patience, and that the mills would be re-opened.  They have waited long enough and so have the people of Clondalkin, the ICTU and the many people who depended for their livelihood on that fine paper making industry.</P>
    <P>I began by quoting the words of the Taoiseach and I will end by saying, as the Taoiseach has always said, that when the State sector fails, his Government and party would never be reluctant to involve the Government in any project he believes to be essential to the country. The re-opening of this paper plant immediately is essential to the country and I hope the Minister and the Government, before time runs out, will honour <Col N="2422" /> the commitment so clearly given so that the Clondalkin Paper Mills will not be left as some sort of monument which will never be forgotten to the Minister and the Government.  The time for talk is over, the negotiations have gone on for long enough.  The Minister tomorrow should talk to those Canadians, tell them he appreciates their interest, the fact that they are prepared to put up £1 million, and that the Government will do the rest to re-open the plant and re-employ the 220 men who have been promised employment in the last two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the nub of the problem.  Viability has been spoken about.  It is clear the Minister does not understand the difference between him and us.  As Deputy Harney pointed out, Deputy Reynolds's position last year was to re-open the mills as a State enterprise. A few months earlier, in reply to questions by Deputy Michael O'Leary, he said that the implications of a State takeover at Clondalkin had been studied by consultants whom he had engaged in regard to the re-opening of the mills &mdash; he had that in mind all the time.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the present Minister has not got that option in mind.  He regards himself as having only the option of negotiating with some companies, and if they say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, then it is all over and that is the end of it &mdash; there is then no question of viability on a State basis.  The possibility of viability has been studied by the IDA.  Deputy Barry Desmond said during a debate here that the consultancy group were hired by the IDA to assess the viability of the firm.  They had reported that with new equipment costing £2 million, and pursuing the right markets, this plant could be viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the IDA report which the Minister has on his desk.  As I have said, Deputy Reynolds said that he had <Col N="2423" /> employed consultants to discuss the viability of a State takeover and the opening and refurbishing of the plant.  Therefore, the question of a State takeover has been well discussed.  That is what the Minister should be looking at if the Canadian firm or any other company do not turn up trumps.  If they do, the workers in the plant will give them the fullest co-operation as they did in regard to the last company before the mills were closed.</P>
    <P>At that time the workers were prepared to accept 150 redundancies, a seven-month pay freeze, a two-and-a-half year wage deal of only 2½ per cent, a commitment to negotiate a new house agreement and to put in £700 apiece of their own money.  They were such unique commitments that at the time Fóir Teoranta were prepared to put in 45 per cent if the Clondalkin people put in a further 45 per cent.  Therefore, a State injection of capital always was a consideration both by Fóir Teoranta, the IDA and Deputy Reynolds.  This Minister has not accepted that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get into an argument about who said what.  Deputy Bruton did not make a commitment but the Government issued a public statement on 8 February 1983 as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government have considered the commitments given by the previous Government to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in regard to Clondalkin Paper Mills and to the consequent industrial relations aspect of the situation as represented to the Government by Congress.</P>
    <P>Having told Congress they would take over the mill, Congress indicated to the Government they welcomed the decision in a situation which they recognised as unique by virtue of the commitments given by a Government to ICTU.  That commitment was given by a previous Government and was recognised by the present Government in February 1983. The Government acknowledged, however, that that did not set any precedent in regard to any other case.</P>
    <P>As well as economic viability of the mills, this question must also include <Col N="2424" /> social viability.  Consideration must also be given to the entire timber industry, of which the IDA have done a study.  This must be a matter of concern to the Minister. I am sure the Minister will agree that the timber processing industry here has suffered dreadful closures in the last few years.  Therefore, the re-establishment of a papermaking industry must be a necessary priority of any study of the timber in our forests.  If we are to have job creation on the basis of timber, not alone the paper making capacity in Clondalkin but the pulp producing part of that industry are of great concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue again. I had expected either the Minister for the Environment or the Minister of State at that Department to be here to answer some of the questions I wish to pose.  I have nothing personal against the Minister present but I have heard on a number of occasions the viewpoint of the <Col N="2425" /> Department of Industry and Energy on this matter.  I received a detailed reply from the Minister for the Environment to a question I raised on 30 June and I will refer to that later.  I hope tonight to have the problem debated in public again.</P>
      <P>Since the matter was raised in June the issue of nuclear dumping and discharge into the Irish Sea from land-based source has taken on serious proportions.  In my contribution on 30 June I detailed the discharges taking place into the Irish Sea. As a public representative I find myself in a difficult situation in that I am listening to conflicting scientific statements of opinion and due to lack of information I cannot draw a firm conclusion as to the nature and extent of the problem.  On the one hand we hear that sea disposal of nuclear waste is undesirable because of exposure to sea currents and the fear that radio-active particles will be carried into the food chain.  Recently serious questions have been raised on two different issues.  The &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme, which I did not see, raised serious questions regarding the Windscale operations and last week an article in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> reported the cases of six women who have given birth to mongol children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must make a strong protest against the way some of these reports have been sensationalised by some sectors of the press.  I am not trying to make political capital out of these reports, as alleged recently by a professor at Trinity College. Dr. Ian McAuley published an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 6 November in which he criticised Irish politicians for reacting in an opportunist fashion to reports, and he accused politicians of showing some interest only when a programme such as the &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme on Windscale was screened.  He further accused politicians of not releasing information.  He stated as follows: &ldquo;I do not think any evidence has been produced to suggest that any damage is being done to the population here from radio-activity in the Irish Sea&rdquo;.  It can be seen from the record that most of the politicians who have raised this question have done so when there was no publicity on <Col N="2426" /> the issue and it was not a matter of live public interest.  The matter has only recently aroused public interest due to some press reports.  At last it is being treated seriously.  I would agree with the conclusion that no firm scientific evidence is available to link up the reports we have been hearing about with the discharges from Windscale but serious questions remain unanswered and they will not be answered unless public interest and awareness are aroused.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board were represented recently by their Mr. Kavanagh in an interview on television.  While attempting to assure everybody that there was no reason for concern he was reluctant when questioned further to give any unqualified assurance that there is no health risk to the Irish population.  The Minister in his reply will be giving the reactions of the Nuclear Energy Board. To a large degree their findings and records are meaningless because they are very dependent on figures produced from British sources.  They are the wrong body to monitor the situation.  They have a history of being pro-nuclear and this whole question should be investigated by an environmental body who would monitor it from an environmental viewpoint. They should also have the right to monitor along the British coastline.  The monitoring being done on the Irish coastline has shown that there is no scientific evidence of any problem.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Tánaiste raised the question of nuclear dumping at last week's London Summit.  However, the statement that the British Government will carry out a special inquiry into the Windscale operation does not satisfy me. I will not be satisfied until such time as I see how the special inquiry will be carried out, who will be carrying out the investigation, whose monitoring figures will be used, whose advice will be accepted and how long the inquiry will take.  Without answers to these questions we cannot judge the usefulness of the inquiry.  The indications to date are that this inquiry will be carried out by the British who have a vested interest in the Windscale operation.</P>
    <P>On 30 June, I put a question to the <Col N="2427" /> Minister for the Environment asking him if he would make a detailed report of the meeting in Berlin in early June 1983 of the Paris Convention; the discussions that had taken place with Britain on the question of the dumping of nuclear waste and on the ratification of the Paris Convention; and if he will immediately open discussions with Britain on the question of nuclear waste discharge from land-based sources in accordance with Article 9 of the Paris Convention.  In his reply the Minister said:</P>
    <P>As regards the first part of the question, a report on the outcome of the full meeting of the Paris Commission will be circulated by the secretariat in about one month's time.  When the item on the agenda dealing with discharges of radio-active substances from land-based sources was under discussion the Irish representative set out this country's position on the matter and, in particular, expressed our concern to protect our marine resources, fishing, industry and coasts from pollution from whatever source and to protect man and the environment from excessive levels of radio-activity.  Our representative requested the commission to initiate further scientific studies with the objective of determining more precisely the measures to be adopted to deal with radioactive discharges. The commission decided to refer specific questions relating to such discharges to the Nuclear Energy Agency for further consideration.</P>
    <P>Regarding the second part of the question, no bilateral discussions have taken place between the Irish and UK Governments on the question of dumping of nuclear waste.  However, this matter was fully discussed at the recent meeting of the London Dumping Convention at which both Ireland and the UK were represented.  At that meeting Ireland's position was fully outlined.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what is Ireland's position because this House has never been informed of it.  I hope the Minister <Col N="2428" /> of State at the Department of Industry and Energy tells us tonight or the Minister for the Environment or his Minister of State makes a statement to the House at some stage or that we are given a full debate on the problem not just a short debate like this one.  The Minister's reply continued:</P>
    <P>As regards the third part of the question, the necessary arrangements for the ratification of the Paris Convention by this country are at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>When the convention has been formally ratified our position on the question of nuclear waste discharge from land-based sources will be reviewed with a view to initiating discussions with the UK in accordance with Article 9 of the convention.</P>
    <P>My information is that, even though this is an urgent matter, the Paris Convention has not been ratified.  What discussions have taken place?  The Minister for the Environment finally stated:</P>
    <P>I might add that preliminary discussions have already taken place about the possibility of concluding a formal inter-governmental agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom on the question of exchange of information about nuclear installations generally and the possibility of discharges from them.</P>
    <P>I have asked a few questions concerning what has happened since 30 June.  I am aware, in asking them, of the new attitude adopted by Ireland since the Minister for the Environment and his Minister of State have taken office.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that the Government departed from their usual stance at the London Convention in relation to the dumping of nuclear waste at sea when they allied themselves to Spain in backing a motion banning dumping of nuclear waste at sea until scientific studies are concluded.  Britain are violating that convention by continuing their dumping programme.  I believe we must now demand from Britain the right to monitor their discharges because there is a serious question about how <Col N="2429" /> these discharges are affecting our environment. The Danish Government have been continually undertaking a detailed monitoring of the Windscale operation and how this has been affecting the North Sea and the Danish population.  How much more vigilant should our Government be because of our proximity to the Windscale operation.</P>
    <P>I will repeat what I said on 7 July in an Adjournment Debate about nuclear waste disposal from land-based sources: I said:</P>
    <P>This problem is a serious international one affecting every country and it has not been aired adequately by this House.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister on that day to allow time in the new session to have this problem discussed in detail.  The time is long overdue to have it discussed in detail.  In July I asked the Minister to ratify the Paris Convention and to immediately seek a meeting with Britain to discuss the two problems, nuclear dumping at sea and nuclear dumping from land-based sources.  I also said that this problem cannot be solved in a satisfactory manner with Britain because I believe our policies are seriously compromised by our inability to bring forward a proper policy on the disposal of toxic waste.  Since mentioning that point in the House some months ago we are no nearer to developing a policy on toxic waste.  I noticed a press report recently that the IIRS had finalised the study of a site in the greater Dublin area.  How near are we now to a final decision?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have but it is all tied up in the same problem.  Our attitude to Britain is compromised by our inability to solve our own toxic waste problems.  I urge the Minister for Industry and Energy to try to answer the questions asked here tonight even though I know a lot of them are not in his brief.  It is the Minister for the Environment who should be here tonight.  I ask that a very firm stand be taken with Britain on the matter <Col N="2430" /> and that the Minister for the Environment make a detailed statement to the House as early as possible on what has gone on in our discussions with Britain since last July because the problem has become more serious.  Major questions have been raised and have not been answered.  I hope I have presented the case in an unsensational manner.  To present the case in a sensational manner as it has been presented from other sources does damage to the lobby demanding Government action here.  It undermines the credibility of that lobby. I ask the Minister to give as detailed a reply as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure Deputy Allen and the House that I am indeed very concerned about the recent reports of the effects of present levels of radioactivity in the Irish Sea.  In saying that I would ask that we do not accept as fact what appears in the media until the points alleged are objectively and scientifically established.</P>
      <P>In regard to this evening's reports of medical findings suggesting a link between illnesses and the radiation levels following the Windscale fire in 1957 I would have to await the views of the Minister for Health before commenting but I would point out that we must distinguish between the effects of a specific accident and the potential danger caused by the planned discharge of nuclear effluent which is our continuing concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to stress that recent UK media reports dealt with radiation risks in the immediate vicinity of Windscale or in areas far closer to it than any part of the east coast of Ireland.  Immediately following these reports in the media I asked the Nuclear Energy Board, who are the advisers to the Government on nuclear matters, to establish whether there was in fact any truth in the reports that the present discharge levels represent a health hazard to the Irish people. The Nuclear Energy Board have informed me that the amount of radio-active substances allowed to be released in the form of low level radioactive effluents from Windscale are within strict <Col N="2431" /> limits laid down by the UK authorities, that is the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Department of Environment and their controls conform with the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection which is a world renowned technical body and with the requirements of the EEC Directive 80/836 laying down safety standards for the health protection of the general public and workers against the dangers of ionising radiation.  We must view that statement as being very important and it goes quite some way towards desensationalising the issue.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these protections information on the distribution of radio-activity in the Irish Sea and estimates of exposure of the public to radiation is obtained from the monitoring programme of the Nuclear Energy Board themselves.  This work indicates that the radiation exposure of a member of the public is likely to be less than one part in a hundred of the safety limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection and by the EEC directive, which I have already referred to.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board results confirm those of the UK authorities who have undertaken extensive monitoring programmes to check radioactivity levels in the Irish Sea and have been independently confirmed by studies carried out in our own Irish universities.  The reports provide extensive information on activity levels in sea water and marine species such as fish and seaweeds and provide estimates of doses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen's statement that the advice given to the Government by the board was meaningless is an improper allegation which I refute.  I also refuted his allegation the last time he raised this matter because the board carry out their own independent investigation which, apparently, confirms the British position. An independent Irish universities report also confirms the report of the Nuclear Energy Board which formed the basis of advice to the Government.  We cannot start rejecting independent scientific reports by three different bodies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2432" /> The amounts of radioactive substances discharged from Windscale reached their highest level in 1974.  Since then they have been gradually reduced and I understand that further reductions may be expected from 1984 when a new effluent treatment system currently under construction at Windscale is brought into operation.  At this time I am informed that the UK authorities intend to review the discharge authorisations granted.</P>
    <P>Although the amount of discharges into the Irish Sea has been falling and may be expected to be reduced further from next year, nevertheless the continuous addition over the years of waste discharges into the Irish Sea is giving and will continue to give rise to concern in the public mind and is likely to give rise to linkages, whether well founded or not, with particular health hazards.  My Department acting on the advice of the Nuclear Energy Board are availing of all opportunities to review and improve the international arrangements for regulating discharges and to protect health and environmental standards.</P>
    <P>The question of discharges of radio-active waste into the marine environment was discussed at a meeting in June of this year of the Paris Commission for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land Based Sources.  The UK are a signatory to the Paris Convention and it is shortly to be ratified by Ireland.</P>
    <P>For the information of the Deputy, I understand that that matter will shortly be going to the Government for confirmation and, assuming that the Government agree, an opportunity will be given in the House for a debate on this subject.</P>
    <P>The convention prohibits or limits the discharge of certain specific substances, including radioactive waste, to the sea through pipelines and water courses as well as man-made structures at sea.  At the meeting the Irish representative expressed our concern to protect our marine resources, fishing industry and coasts from pollution and to protect man and the environment from excessive levels of radioactivity.  He called for further investigations to establish a broader scientific basis on which discharges might be carried out to determine if they should <Col N="2433" /> cease entirely and if other methods should be found for the disposal of the wastes.  Arising from the discussions the commission has decided to refer questions regarding the discharges of radio-active substances into the marine environment to the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for further consideration.  My Department and the other Departments concerned will be following developments in this matter very closely.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment who has responsibility for the ratification of the Paris Convention by Ireland reiterated the views expressed by our representative at the June meeting of the Paris Convention when at the recent Anglo-Irish Summit meeting in London he expressed Irish concern in relation to discharges from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Windscale. You will be aware that the Taoiseach confirmed this to the Dáil in a statement made on 8 November 1983.</P>
    <P>Further to views expressed by the Tánaiste at the recent Summit the Government intend to follow up this matter with the British Government in the very near future to ensure that our views are taken into account by the relevant authorities when the next review of the discharge authorisations for the Windscale plant takes place.</P>
    <P>I must also point out that official discussions have already been taking place at two levels.  The Irish Nuclear Energy Board have an arrangement with the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate of the UK Health and Safety Executive for the exchange of information on reactors and other nuclear installations including that at Windscale.  In addition preliminary discussions have taken place at official level with a view to concluding a formal Inter-Governmental agreement with the UK on the exchange of information and mutual asistance in nuclear matters.  Further discussions are planned with a view to making our recommendations on the proposed draft agreement known to the UK authorities.</P>
    <P>My Department have already been in contact with the UK Department of the <Col N="2434" /> Environment to inform them of this country's concern at the recent reports. I understand that the UK authorities are undertaking an even more intensified analysis of the exposure to risks and I have asked the Nuclear Energy Board to keep in close contact with this work and report back to me.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that I am aware of the need for greater vigilance in this matter and any risk to our environment or to the health of our community is one which is of major importance.</P>
    <P>I recognise that nuclear waste must be disposed of but we must assert in the strongest terms that this should be done at minimum risk to public health in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, a Cheann Comhairle, I cannot give one hundred per cent guarantees about anything.  If one flies an aeroplane there is always a risk of crashing. However, I can assure the House and Deputy Allen, whose concern I fully appreciate and understand, that we will not let any opportunity go by without making our feelings known to the British Government and their agencies.  We will be keeping in close touch with all developments in Britain.  One must assume that the British Government are not running a Windscale or an atomic energy station for the purpose of making their own population ill.  One must also assume they will take great care to protect their own people; any other assumption would be ridiculous.  Of course we will take care of our own people first and ensure that we have the best expert advice possible.</P>
    <P>Over the past two decades, Governments have expressed their concern in regard to this matter.  The question of dumping at sea is not under consideration here; we are talking about discharges into the sea.  Perhaps we will have another occasion to discuss that subject.  We are reviewing the pressure which can be brought to bear on the United Kingdom to lower to an absolute minimum the discharges from Windscale.  The Ministry of Health in England have appointed a professor of medicine in London University to establish the link between illnesses and the Windscale discharges.  I cannot <Col N="2435" /> say what the United Kingdom are prepared to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978, provides that with effect from 16 May 1978 dwelling houses, including those sold by housing authorities under tenant purchase schemes, must be sold in fee simple.  This requirement is in the interest of local authority tenants purchasing their dwellings and I do not consider that amendment of its provisions is required.</P>
      <P>The provision of acceptable title to its housing stock is entirely a matter for the local authority concerned and I have been informed by Wexford Corporation that delays in the completion of sales have been caused by the serious difficulties they are experiencing in acquiring fee simple title to a number of their housing schemes, including the one which is the subject of this question.  Every effort is being made to overcome this problem and I understand that the corporation are hopeful that the matter will be satisfactorily resolved in the near future.</P>

I have also approved the scheme for inclusion in the FEOGA (Western Package) and it will therefore qualify for a grant of 80 per <Col N="2212" /> cent of the cost from my Department's Vote.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the usual review of allocations carried out towards the end of each year, it became apparent that Roscommon County Council were holding about £600,000 in loan payments pending the availability of additional funds.  I have recently notified the council of a revised allocation for 1983 which I am satisfied will be adequate to meet all payments which the council expect to make before the end of the year.  The council now have a balance of £1.07 million from the Local Loans Fund for the payment this year of local authority house purchase, construction and improvement loans and supplementary grants (including disabled persons grants).  The bulk of this amount will be <Col N="2213" /> advanced to the council within the next few days and the balance on receipt of the necessary &ldquo;draw&rdquo; application.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Housing Finance Agency loan scheme is a matter for the agency themselves who have full responsibility for providing funds to individual local authorities to pay loans.</P>

      <P>The question of the supply of turf to the Deelis station in 1984 is directly related to the proposals of the ESB towards the continued use of turf-burning stations for electricity generation. No decisions to decommission any turf-burning stations have as yet been taken by the ESB but the Deputy will be aware that the ESB's Strategic Plan does propose the decommissioning of Deelis in 1984.  I have the proposals in that plan under detailed examination.</P>
      <P>The ESB are aware, of course, that any decisions which may eventually be taken to decommission a particular station would have implications for turf producers of the kind mentioned by the Deputy.  The board have informed me that they will take due account of these implications.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Government states that facilities will be provided for broadcasting debates of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In June 1983 I proposed to the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges (CPP) that (a) RTE should undertake experimental recording in the Dáil Chamber to establish whether the existing microphone system in the Dáil was capable of providing recordings of a quality suitable for radio transmission and (b) that RTE should be asked to prepare for the information of the Committee a &ldquo;mock-up&rdquo; tape of the type of Oireachtas debate programme they would intend broadcasting.  The Committee decided (a) that RTE should be asked to prepare such an experimental tape based on the proceedings of one of the Oireachtas Committees and (b) that RTE should submit a detailed memorandum outlining proposals for broadcasting of Dáil and Oireachtas Committee proceedings covering such areas as presentation, editing and privilege.</P>
      <P>RTE responded to CPP requesting permission to defer submission of the detailed memorandum and &ldquo;mock-up&rdquo; tape requested and sought to undertake actual broadcasting of some of the proceedings of the Joint Committee on Legislation on an experimental basis.  However, in September 1983 CPP decided that RTE should comply with Committee's original request.  A response is now awaited from RTE.</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to the broadcasting of the work of the Oireachtas and it is the intention that this broadcasting will reflect the overall work of the House on a balanced basis as between plenary sessions and committee work.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid the full redundancy lump sum to which he was entitled under the Redundancy Payments Acts from the redundancy fund because of the insolvency of his former employer. The Deputy's representations relate, I assume, to a possible entitlement to redundancy weekly payments.</P>
      <P>The position is that section 8 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1979, discontinued from 6 April 1979 redundancy weekly payments with certain limited exceptions.  The case of the person who is the subject of the representations does not come within these exceptions and I regret, therefore, that he is not entitled to any further payments under the Redundancy Payments Acts.</P>
      <P>As I explained in reply to a previous Dáil question on 7 July 1983, the question of restoring redundancy weekly payment entitlements to certain workers was considered at length in my Department in the light of legal advice on the very complex issues involved and the conclusion was that it would not be appropriate or practicable to propose legislation in the matter.</P>
      <P>I regret that previous representations made by the Deputy were not answered in detail.  This was due to the difficulty in tracing records about the particular case and the general pressure of work in the redundancy section of my Department because of the continuing high incidence of claims with which they have to deal.</P>

      <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1979, the obligation to pay a redundancy lump sum to a redundant worker rests primarily with the employer who is obliged to notify my Department of the proposed redundancy.  No notice of redundancy or claim under the Redundancy Payments Acts has been received in this case in my Department.</P>
      <P>I am arranging to send the person concerned the appropriate forms and explanatory leaflet to enable him to make application for a redundancy payment under the Acts.  If he considers that he is entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum, he should apply, in writing, to his former employer for payment, if he has not already done so&mdash;form RP 77 may be used for this purpose.  If the employer disputes his entitlement or fails to reply within a reasonable time, he should then refer his case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal&mdash;form RP 51A may be used for this purpose.  If the employer concedes entitlement by furnishing a redundancy certificate but claims inability to pay, the employee should apply to my Department for payment from the redundancy fund&mdash;form RP14 may be used for this purpose.</P>

      <P>The telephone billing system is reviewed on a continuing basis and numbers of changes have been made over the past year or so to improve its reliability. For example, most persons making trunk calls via the operators are now rung back.  Meters for installation in users' homes which will enable them to watch and check their meter usage will be available shortly in quantity at an extra charge for those who want them.  An experiment is also being conducted in the Naas area in the current quarter of supplying details of subscriber dialled trunk calls to a small number of customers.  The extension of <Col N="2232" /> this type of detailed billing was programmed for detailed consideration by my Department in the light of the likely demand for it and the costs involved. There is a perception among people that the billing system is somehow inaccurate. I have instituted a thorough examination of the system to see how it can be improved.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the operation of the telecommunications services is to be vested in Bord Telecom Éireann from 1 January 1984.

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue <Col N="2243" /> Commissioners that a recent review of the taxpayer's liability for the year 1982-83 revealed an underpayment.  The underpayment arose because an insufficient amount had been estimated in the tax-free allowances at the commencement of the year to cover non-PAYE income.</P>
      <P>On 26 September 1983, the inspector of taxes issued a PAYE balancing statement, showing details of the liability, and the taxpayer was requested to submit proposals for payment of the tax due.</P>

    <P>(1)The amount shown for &ldquo;Others&rdquo; relate to tax paid other than through the PAYE mechanism and are comprised of payments from self-employed taxpayers assessed under Schedule D together with a small amount collected under Schedule C.</P>
    <P>Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and statistics are not available which would enable a reliable monthly breakdown of tax on farming profits to be given.  However, it is tentatively estimated that the tax payments on farming profits in the period from January, 1983, to September, 1983, amounted to £11 million. The due date for payment of Schedule D tax (including tax payable on farming profits) assessed for 1983-84 is 1 October 1983, with a two months interest free period of grace. <Col N="2246" /> Most of this tax will be paid in late November or early December.</P>
    <P>(2)This figure includes income tax paid by building societies in respect of interest credited to their investors.</P>
    <P>(3)In view of the factors mentioned at (1) and (2) above, the figures set out in the table cannot be taken to represent an accurate picture of the relative income tax burden as between different categories of taxpayer for the year 1983 or for the tax year 1983-84.</P>

      <P>Two posts for blind telephonist were originally authorised for the Limerick Tax Office. Following the Government decision on staffing levels in July 1981 a number of blind telephonist posts were affected including a post at the Dundalk tax office. In order to provide a telephonist service in Dundalk one of the Limerick posts was redeployed to Dundalk.  The occupant of the post had in fact applied for a transfer to Dundalk.</P>
      <P>The present complement for blind telephonists in Revenue is ten and there are 15 serving.  The excess arose because, at the time of the Government decision to freeze staffing levels, recruitment procedures for a number of blind telephonists were so far advanced that they were taken on.  The excess is being reduced as vacancies arise.</P>

He appealed against the disallowance <Col N="2271" /> and in this connection he was examined on 24 October 1983 by a different medical referee who decided that he was incapable of work.</P>
      <P>Payment of disability benefit was restored from 22 August and a cheque for the arrears of benefit payable to the claimant from 22 August 1983 less a sum in respect of supplementary welfare allowance advanced by the Mid-Western Health Board was issued to him on 9 November 1983.  He is at present being paid at the weekly rate of £34.80, the maximum appropriate rate for a single person.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 10 January 1983 to 5 February 1983 but is not qualified for payment as he has not the required minimum of 26 qualifying contributions paid or credited in 1981-82, the contribution year governing his claim.  He was requested, on 17 January 1983, to forward details of his insurable employment in 1981-82 but he failed to do so.

      <P>The free electricity and free fuel allowance schemes were applied to persons in receipt of an invalidity pension <Col N="2272" /> from the Department on the grounds that this is a long-term payment to persons who are permanently incapacitated.</P>
      <P>The conditions for receipt of invalidity pension under United Kingdom social security legislation are substantially different from the conditions which apply under Irish legislation.  United Kingdom invalidity benefit is payable automatically to any person who has been in receipt of short-term sickness benefit for 28 weeks, irrespective of whether or not incapacity is permanent.  This does not meet the qualifying criteria for the allowances mentioned and it is not, therefore, proposed to alter the present arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The contribution conditions for widow's contributory pension may be satisfied on either the late husband's or the widow's own insurance record.  In order to qualify for payment at the maximum rate there must be a yearly average of at least 39 contributions in either the three or five contribution years before the husband's death, or alternatively an average of at least 48 contributions since entry into insurance.  Lower rates of pension are payable where there are averages of from 24 to 47 contributions since entry into insurance.</P>
      <P>According to the records of the Department both the husband and the wife in this case had insurance records but neither of them had an average of 39 or more contributions in the last 3 or 5 contribution years before his death.  The wife has an average of 20 contributions from her entry into insurance until the end of the 1982-83 contribution year.  The late husband had an average of 28 contributions up to the end of that year.  All his contributions were recorded before he ceased insurable employment in 1971.</P>
      <P>The rate of £38.40 a week in payment is the rate appropriate to a widow under 66 years of age with no qualified children, based on the late husband's average of 28 contributions.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit and submitted one certificate only indicating that on 27 July 1982 he was incapable of work.  Continuing medical evidence is necessary to establish the duration of incapacity before any payment can be made.  He was requested on several occasions to submit further medical evidence of incapacity for work but failed to do so.  He again claimed disability benefit from 12 August 1983 to 9 September 1983 but he is not qualified for payment of benefit at the moment as he has not the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in the contribution year governing his claim.  However, arrangements have been made for an inspector of the Department to call on the claimant within the next few days to establish the nature and duration of incapacity and the dates and frequency of medical examinations since 27 July 1982.  When the inspector's report is received his claim for benefit will be received.</P>

      <P>Following the receipt of notification of increased earnings of £118.96 a week or an increase of £5.66, he was entitled to a corresponding increase of disablement benefit.

He then became entitled to a weekly rate of £2.35, £28.00 less means £25.65, increased to £3.75, £29.40 less means £25.65, from 5 October 1983.  He has applied for a review of the means assessed against him and his case has been referred to a social welfare officer for a report on his means.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the social welfare officer's report.</P>

      <P>The application of the person concerned on 10 April 1983 for unemployment assistance was disallowed on the grounds that he failed to furnish particulars of his means.  He appealed against the disallowance and following protracted inquiries an appeals officer, whose decision is final, recently determined his weekly means at £14.00 derived from the value of board and lodgings in his relatives' home.  Unemployment assistance was, accordingly, authorised at the weekly rate of £11.45 from 10 April 1983 being the appropriate maximum weekly rate in his case of £25.45 less means £14.00, increased to £14.00, £28.00 less £14.00, from 29 June 1983 and to £15.40, £29.40 less £14.00, from 5 October 1983.</P>

The reinvestigation also revealed, however, that the person concerned had capital which had not been previously disclosed. It was necessary arising from this, to review his entitlement from 12 June 1981.</P>
      <P>It was decided by the local pension committee on 5 November 1983 that the person concerned is entitled to a pension at the increased rate of £32.45 from 30 July 1982, rising to £36.60 from 1 July 1983.  These are the rates appropriate to the current assessment of his means, consisting of half the weekly value of capital.</P>

      <Col N="2325" /> (a)  The scales payable with effect from 1 March, 1979, to ranks up to and including Chief Superintendent rank arose from a special increase recommended by the Garda Síochána Committee of Inquiry which reported in April, 1979.  The scales included the second phase of the 1978 National Agreement (2 per cent) which took effect from 1 March, 1979.</P>
    <P>(b)  The scales payable to these ranks with effect from 1 April, 1981 arose from a special increase granted following Conciliation and Arbitration proceedings.</P>
    <P>(c)  The scales payable to the Commissioner ranks and the Surgeon with effect from 26 June, 1979 and 26 June, 1980 arose from special increases recommended by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Service.</P>
    <P>The main allowances are rent, which is payable to ranks up to Chief Superintendent, and allowances for what are called unsocial hours i.e. duty performed on Saturday, Sunday, Public Holidays and at night.  In addition ranks up to and including Inspector rank are entitled to compensation for overtime worked. Overtime is paid at the rate of time and one-half.  The unsocial hours allowances with the exception of Saturday allowance are based on pay and are payable to ranks up to and including Inspector rank.  They are as follows:</P>
    <P>(i)  Double basic rate for Sunday duty.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Double basic rate for duty on a Public Holiday which is a rostered working day.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Double basic rate plus a free day for duty on a Public Holiday which is a rostered rest day.</P>

Legislation promoted by a member of the Government requires Government approval.  When Government approval is given for an announcement about legislation to be made, it is made without delay in the normal course.</P>
      <P>I will take note of the Deputy's views in regard to the harmful effects of some types of slot machine on the youth of the country.</P>

    <P>On 9 November, 1983 a proposal that the extension to Creagh national school, County Galway, should proceed to contract was approved and the usual formal letters were issued by my Department to the chairman of the school's board of management and to the Commissioners of Public Works.  This letter taken <Col N="2331" /> together with the formal letter sanctioning the grant for this project which issued on 5 May 1982, may be regarded as confirmation that the necessary funds are being allocated for the project.  I understand that the Commissioners of Public Works have in turn issued the necessary authorisations and the further arrangements now lie with the school's chairman and architect.  Information as to the dates on which work may actually commence on site and on which the project may be completed is not available to me.  I shall be in touch with the Deputies as soon as I have this information.
