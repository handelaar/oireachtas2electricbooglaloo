      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Business will be taken today as follows: By agreement Standing Orders will be suspended until 2.30 p.m. to allow statements by Members on the current economic situation, particularly in so far as it affects the level of unemployment. No member will speak more than once and the proceedings will not be interrupted between 1.30 and 2.30 p.m. After Questions it is proposed to take Nos. 7 (resumed) and 8 (resumed).  By agreement the proceedings on those items, including the naming of the date for the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 1983, if not previously concluded, will be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m.  The Minister for Finance will be called on to conclude the debate on No. 7 not later than 6.15 p.m.  Private Members Business will be No. 17 (resumed). The House will not meet until 11.30 a.m. tomorrow to facilitate those Members wishing to attend religious ceremonies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On the arrangements for business, the proposal is to suspend Standing Orders and I should like the Taoiseach to explain the purpose of suspending Standing Orders in order to allow the debate to take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be possible to have the statements it is proposed to allow without suspending Standing Orders.  If we do not suspend Standing Orders there will have to be a motion or a Bill before the House on which to hang a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De. Rossa Mr. De. Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De. Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very unsatisfactory that the House should be conducting its business while Standing Orders are suspended in this way, particularly as it is occurring weekly.  Would it not be more appropriate either to amend Standing Orders to permit such statements to be made or to have a motion tabled for discussion?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be for the Chair to comment on this matter but it occurs to the Chair that up to recently there was criticism of the House on the basis that matters were not discussed when they were hot.  As the Chair understands it, this device has been agreed upon between the Whips of the two major parties to give this opportunity to Members to express their views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate having the opportunity to deal with the present unemployment situation today but, nevertheless, we would prefer if we could be facilitated by putting down a motion for debate.  In the absence of that I am grateful for this facility.  However, I agree with Deputy De Rossa that dealing with these matters by way of motion would be preferable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Chair ruling that our attempt to raise this matter is not in order?  Deputy Lenihan is simply asking the Taoiseach if he, or the Minister for Finance, will be prepared to make a statement. Surely that is a reasonable request.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  It is an allegation and I must ask the Deputy to withdraw it.  A Deputy from his constituency, Deputy Flaherty, who had requested permission to raise a matter on numerous occasions, was given permission to raise it on the Adjournment last evening.  Deputy Tunney participated in that Adjournment debate.  I ask him to withdraw his allegation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I explain?  Last week when I asked for the same permission you give permission to Deputy Yates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tunney is being disorderly.  When Deputy Yates was called last week his was the only item <Col N="832" /> that was in order for the Adjournment. Deputy Tunney should withdraw his remark.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Tunney is saying could perhaps be interpreted as meaning that events have resulted in Fine Gael having an undue preponderance of Adjournment time, by accident or by other means, but there is no necessary reflection on the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity provided by this debate to identify the causes of unemployment, to indicate the Government's approach to the problem and give the Opposition an opportunity to demonstrate whether they see this matter as something more than a political football.  We shall in the hours ahead see whether they have the courage to admit their share of responsibility for the present crisis and rise to the needs of the enormous human tragedy by joining the Government in a clear-sighted and courageous attack on the roots of the problem in so far as they are to be found in society and within our own competence and control.</P>
      <P>As to the causes of the crisis, I shall enumerate four.  The first and perhaps the most important single factor has been the stagnation of the world economy during the past three or four years after the brief recovery which followed the first oil crisis in 1973-1975.  The second has been the weakness and vulnerability of our industrial base, the failure of so many of our established industries to take advantage of the huge new markets opened up by our entry into the EEC and our consequent excessive dependence on new foreign industries, the flow of which has been reduced sharply to Ireland by the world crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This third factor to which I must advert is our failure to maintain and improve our competitiveness, partly because our labour costs have risen disproportionately as wages and salaries have been <Col N="836" /> pushed up at a rate far beyond that experienced in competing countries, as other industrial costs, to which Government policy contributes directly or indirectly, have also risen disproportionately, for instance the various services for industry provided by the Department of Industry and Energy.</P>
    <P>The fourth factor to which I will refer in the context of the unemployment situation has been the serious deterioration in our public finances which has left the Government of the day without the financial capacity to mitigate the effects of unemployment by remedial measures on an adequate scale.  Some of these factors, those external to our State, are very largely outside our control save to the extent that by joining like-minded countries within the EEC we can exert some influence on the economic strategy of the Community and of the major member states and, perhaps, through this leverage affect, even though only marginally, the policies of other major industrialised countries.</P>
    <P>It would obviously be absurd to exaggerate our potential influence in this matter, but to the extent that we can, with others, help to shape international policies that may promote and sustain a recovery in world economy, in world trade, we are doing so, specifically in the preparation for the Williamsburg Summit of the major industrialised countries this month.  We have joined with other smaller members of the Community to work in conjunction with the Commission towards a positive outcome of the world economic summit, at which we will, of course, be represented only indirectly through the input of the Community and the Commission.  It is too soon to judge whether or to what extent the efforts we and others are making will have any positive influence on the outcome of that meeting.  The most one can say is that now there are signs that the participants may face some of the real issues of economic recovery rather than get bogged down in a sterile trans-Atlantic quarrel about the issue of east-west trade.</P>
    <P>Whatever the outcome of Williamsburg, we shall have to live within and <Col N="837" /> work within the context of the resultant world trading situation.  If the recovery now starting in the US is sufficiently strong and sufficiently sustained and if it is reinforced by appropriate responses from other industrialised countries, the major industrialised countries in particular, by this time next year and for a period after that we will find ourselves once again in a favourable world trading context with demand for goods and services rising strongly, bringing with it the possibility of expanding order books for Irish industry, with more tourists with the necessary money to come to our shores and spend it here.</P>
    <P>If the recovery now starting is weak and is not sustained, we shall have to adapt ourselves to a continuation of the unfavourable context in which we have been living for some years past.  The important thing is that either way we take the action that is within our power in order to maximise our share of world markets, whether those markets be expanding or as they have been for some years past, stagnant.</P>
    <P>There is much that is within our power and we have to avoid the kind of fatalism that can too easily be induced by concentrating our relative power to influence the course of economic recovery world-wide. Instead of reacting to this by throwing up our hands and saying there is very little we can do to influence these great events, we should be saying to ourselves that our share of the market in which we trade is so tiny that whether they are expanding or not we, by increasing our share of those vast markets, can achieve the growth needed to reduce unemployment.</P>
    <P>In this context we cannot and should not ignore the fact that other European countries such as Austria, Norway and Sweden &mdash; some of the smaller countries in Europe &mdash; have unemployment rates that are only a fraction of ours, a third or a quarter of the figure applying to this country.  Other countries such as Austria, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Great Britain have inflation rates that are only half to one-third of ours, reflecting in large measure a much <Col N="838" /> smaller annual increase in labour costs in those countries, which are, of course, crucially important, though far from the only element.  There is no inherent reason why we should not be able to match the performances of those countries.  Concrete or physical our situation is not so different from theirs that it would make it impossible for us to achieve what they have achieved.  There are, of course, differences in some cases of size, and in other cases the question of markets and organisation of industry.  However, there is no fundamental difference between us that explains or justifies the fact that our employment rate and our inflation rate are three to four times higher than in those other countries which have had to face the same external problems, such as the oil crises, that we faced.  Perhaps even in some cases they were worse placed than we were in regard to these problems.</P>
    <P>I will return to this when I come to the third factor I mentioned at the outset, our failure to maintain and improve our competitiveness.  First, I will refer briefly to the second factor that influences our level of unemployment, weaknesses in our industrial base, influencing not only problems of declining competitiveness together with labour costs, but also management efficiency in our established industries.  At a time when the flow of foreign investment to this country, as to others, has been reduced by the stagnation in the world economy, we are dependent more than at any other time on our own industries, those established here by Irish people, initially behind protected barriers.  These industries had a long period of preparation for the beginning of trade and the opening of new markets up to 1973.  They received every possible help from the Government of the day, which was a Fianna Fáil Government, to adapt to new conditions.  Some have done so and have been notably successful, but many others ignored both warnings and opportunities.  They failed to establish a good relationship with their workforce.  They failed to achieve the design and quality standards necessary to compete in international markets.  They failed to market their goods with the professional skills required to succeed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> Those failures were not fatal for many of those firms in good times; in hard times they proved disastrous.  It has to be said however, that the weaker firms or the stronger ones which survived, or the new industries that established themselves here in the sixties and seventies have not been helped by the third factor, failure to maintain and improve their competitiveness. In recent times efforts were made to decry the importance of labour costs in competitiveness.  It has been said rightly that they are not the only factor. Nevertheless their importance has been obscured by the fact that the scale of labour costs in relation to total costs varies tremendously from industry to industry, some being so highly capital-intensive that increases in labour costs may be relatively unimportant to their survival.</P>
    <P>Crude calculations based on the whole range of industries, lumping together those that are capital-intensive and those that are labour-intensive, tend to produce apparently indeterminate results in so far as relationship between labour costs and competitiveness are concerned. We should not allow ourselves to be misled by simplistic arguments based on that sort of approach.  The plain fact is that in many of our industries labour costs remain an important, even a decisive, element.  As a part of total costs they are large enough to be crucial from the point of view of the survival of these industries. As we have allowed labour costs to rise inexorably faster than in so many of our competing countries we have priced many of our products, especially those of our established industries, goods and services, out of our own and other markets.</P>
    <P>An important part of the unemployment problem we face today has been the rise in labour costs.  Many of the people who have lost their jobs and many young people who have been unable to find employment owe their plight to the shortsightedness of a policy of increasing wages and salaries much faster than output, thus raising production costs against the trend in other competing countries. Those who seek to deny that this is a factor, not the only factor, in the growth <Col N="840" /> of unemployment do no service to those who are without jobs.  If our labour costs had risen less fast than in competing countries, instead of faster, many thousands more would be at work today here, reducing but by no means resolving the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>This is a crucial issue at the present time.  Thousands are losing their jobs in what has been universally recognised as the most serious crisis in employment we have ever faced.  Pay increases on a scale that helped to fail to recover some of our competitiveness reduced the prospects of many of those at work to retain their employment and could destroy the hopes of new jobs for the 188,000 out of work.</P>
    <P>Even on the most optimistic assumptions about relative exchange rates in the year ahead and about the growth of productivity, increases recently agreed or proposed do not offer any prospect of unalleviation of our own in competitiveness.</P>
    <P>If followed generally the pattern set by some of these increases would lose us an opportunity to regain lost ground, and if later increases exceeded those which have recently emerged we would lose even more ground and thus even more jobs.</P>
    <P>The costs of industry are not confined to the wages and salaries paid in the firms in question.  Industries depend on services&mdash;transport, telecommunications, postal services and energy costs.  Where the costs of these services rise inordinately to a level that is higher than competing countries, industry is disadvantaged. Some existing industries may find their capacity to complete undermined and new industries may be deterred from coming here.  Our record in respect of these services is not good, especially in so far as they are provided by the State.  The combination of inordinate increases in labour costs in the public sector, arising from pay increases which between 1979 and 1981, far outran pay increases in industry itself, and in some cases also unwise management decisions in the State sector about investment, as well as low productivity and poor morale among workers, have increased alarmingly the <Col N="841" /> burden these services place on industry.</P>
    <P>This is an area of direct Government responsibility.  Most of these services are provided by the State or by State-owned concerns.  The Government must take their responsibilities in this area and will do so.  They must and will ensure that costs are controlled and are not allowed to rise at a rate that will become a burden on industry and the community.  That means improving the quality of management where it has proved inadequate and ensuring that wage and salary increases do not outrun productivity increases, so that the prices of these services are not increased at a rate that helps to make industry uncompetitive.  These areas are under our control, not areas where our fate is determined externally.  Any Government who fail to tackle these problems, as happened in the past, do not deserve to, and would not, remain in power.</P>
    <P>The fourth factor affecting our employment situation has been the deterioration in our public finances.  Given the scale of unemployment and the fact that much, but not all, of it is determined by external events, government should, in the face of the resulting crisis, seek to alleviate the problem by reducing taxes, stimulating domestic growth and creating employment opportunities where there is necessary infrastructural work to be done, whether it be road building, housing, the construction of schools, the development of telecommunications and so on.  No Irish Government, whoever they might be, can at this time take such action on an adequate scale because the public finances are in such disorder that the maintenance of public solvency requires action diametrically opposed to that which the employment situation demands.  Here lies the real tragedy of our situation today and the source of so many of the frustrations felt by our people.</P>
    <P>The scale of our financial problem is still only partially grasped by many people.  It is hard for our electorate to grasp that any Government could have behaved with such total irresponsibility as to have brought us to the brink of national insolvency.  They still cannot <Col N="842" /> fully believe that the people they elected to office could have done damage on such a scale, and so they underestimate the magnitude of the disaster and the scale of the constraints this imposes on the Government's power to act to mitigate the effects of unemployment.  The facts admit of no dispute, however.  Between 1977 and 1980 the rate of Exchequer borrowing was allowed to rise at such a rate, and the willingness and capacity of our economy to provide the State with its needs in terms of domestic loans was so undermined, that from a position in 1977, when we borrowed nothing abroad, three years later well over half our Exchequer borrowings, amounting to no less than the equivalent of one-twelfth of our national output, was coming from foreign banks.  Within five years foreign borrowing had quintupled from £1 billion, inherited from all the years before 1977, to £5 billion.</P>
    <P>Even if we, as a Government, were able to eliminate overnight the need for further foreign borrowing&mdash;and we cannot because it has to be tackled gradually over a five-year period if we are not to disrupt our economy totally&mdash;the payment of interest on what has already been borrowed in those years when Fianna Fáil were in power and the repayment of the debt itself, will cost us almost £1 billion a year up to and including 1989.  The figures are there for anyone to see in the tables at the back of the Central Bank report.  They fluctuate a little, around the £800 million or £900 million mark up to £1,000 million, but they average £900 million and will probably be somewhat higher in the light of the exchange rate situation which has developed since the last figures were published.  Almost £1 billion a year up to 1989 will be paid to foreign banks to meet loan repayments and interest.  That £1 billion will be lost to our economy, unavailable to provide a single extra job in this country, although no doubt the flow of resources contrived by Fianna Fáil from Ireland to Germany, the United States and other countries, at this rate will help to provide jobs in those countries in the decade ahead.</P>
    <P>The recession in our economy has now <Col N="843" /> reached the point at which were it not for the cost of servicing this enormous foreign debt incurred as a result of disastrous policy pursued by our predecessors, our external payments would be in surplus to the tune of some hundreds of millions of pounds.  This is the kind of situation in which the appropriate policy for an Irish Government to follow, if they were free to act, would be to pump some money into the economy, to secure a modest reflation of demand in a manner carefully judged to have the maximum effect on employment.  We should be doing this now, and were we free to, we could probably hold unemployment at its present level or even start to reduce it somewhat even in advance of the impending world economic recovery, but we are not free to do so.  The burden of public spending and of debt, foreign and domestic, is such as a result of what happened after 1977, that instead of being able to stimulate growth by tax cuts or increased infrastructural spending, in order to remain solvent, to maintain our creditworthiness and to prevent a further escalation of debt repayments, we are forced to do the exact opposite to what the unemployment situation demands.  We are forced to raise taxes to a virtually intolerable level and inhibited from taking action on the necessary scale to create employment in infrastructural works which would bring down the level of unemployment. To find oneself in such a situation is the ultimate condemnation in the Government policies which created this dilemma.</P>

      <P>The party which in Government created this situation and which in their last couple of years in power under a different leadership, failed to face up to the consequences of their folly, should not and will not be allowed to get their hands on the levers of power until they have recognised and faced up to the damage done, and perhaps until they have thrown up new men and women who do not share the responsibility for this debacle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> In the meantime we in this Government have to pick up the pieces.  We have to restore national morale and self-confidence as we tread our way carefully between the Scylla of national insolvency and the Charybdis of national depression. Our first duty, which we have started to fulfil, is to get our national finances into order so that we will regain the freedom of action which our dependence on foreign borrowing has temporarily lost us and regain the economic independence thrown away by Fianna Fáil after 1977.  This has to be done gradually, not suddenly.  Contrary to Fianna Fáil, we believe the task should be spread not over four years, as they set in their policy document and claimed at the general election, but over five years.  We believe the first step in the current year should involve cutting the current deficit to £900 million instead of £750 million as contained in <i>The Way Forward</i> and repeated since by Fianna Fáil during the general election.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have criticised everything we have done to get the country back on this road, but they have not told us, even by so much as a hint how they, if they remained in office, would have found the hundreds of millions of pounds which we had to find over and above the cuts they had made in the Book of Estimates, to reach our deficit figure of £900 million, never mind the extra £150 million which they intended to take out of the people's pockets in the Draconian budget they had foreshadowed in <i>The Way Forward.</i> Until they come clean about their policies and tell the country how they would have acted to get that deficit down to £750 million, no one will take them seriously again.</P>
    <P>Having taken the initial financial measures, we have started to probe all available possibilities for employment creation or maintenance within the constraints imposed on us by the financial chaos we have inherited.  The Government task force are at work on projects to channel private finance into the road system, to expand the activities of the Housing Finance Agency, which we established when in power for a brief period before, and whose work was deliberately <Col N="845" /> held up for political reasons by Fianna Fáil in their brief period in Government; to fine tune the work of the Youth Employment Agency, which we also established and which is now operating one of the largest youth employment schemes in Europe, and we are examining the possibilities for increasing employment by other means, such as reducing overtime, or work-sharing. Meanwhile, the newly established National Planning Board are preparing their initial recommendations, to be taken into account in the preparation of the 1984 budget, as a prelude to preparing a medium-term plan based on realities, not the aspirational approach in the discredited <i>The Way Forward</i> document.</P>
    <P>The plans will emerge as a result of the work of that board and the action taken by the Government on the basis of recommendations to be made by that board will be a plan based on reality.  It will set out what is likely to happen on the basis of current policies, allowing for a range of hypotheses about external conditions. It will not do what <i>The Way Forward</i> did &mdash; say what you would like to see happen in five years' time and then assume that it is going to happen by having page after page of &ldquo;it is envisaged that&rdquo;, without a single policy decision.</P>
    <P>Any plans which the Government produce will be realistic.  They will assess to the best of their ability, on the basis of independent advice, just what is likely to happen on the basis of current policies; and in so far as those policies look like yielding a situation that will not be tolerated by our people, they will propose the changes in policy necessary to bring about the improvement in the situation which our people demand.  For the first time the Government, dealing with this kind of problem, will face reality and the people will also be asked to face reality. In the meantime the whole apparatus of Government is itself being overhauled to ensure that it operates effectively in directing the process of economic recovery and, if world trade revives, that we are able to take the fullest possible advantage of this development.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, national morale is gradually being restored, an essential prerequisite <Col N="846" /> of any progress.  It is being restored by the knowledge that there is in power a Government with courage and will to govern, a Government who will solve the problems which they have inherited, not flinching from any unpopularity which they may draw on themselves by facing issues which have so long been dodged, swept under the carpet, or ignored, regardless of the effect of this on our capacity as a State to provide an environment in which people can find work.  Everything must now be subordinate to this objective.  No vested interests &mdash; and there are many and they are powerful &mdash; no selfish attempt to grasp and hold on to an unfair share of the national resources will be permitted by this Government to stand in the way of the steps which have been taken to get the unemployed back to work and to find jobs for those who are now leaving school.</P>
    <P>Let us recall that these two groups are unorganised.  They do not have the kind of weight that those people who are in jobs have, through their trade unions, that those people who are running industries have, through their industrial organisations, that those who engage in farming have through the farming organisations &mdash; those who, one way or another, find themselves in a position of having jobs, or property, or something to defend and are organised to defend what they have.  The unemployed and school leavers are not so organised.  They depend for the protection of their interests on the Government acting to protect them from the predatory efforts of the vested interests in the State seeking to hold on to what they have and unwilling to yield anything to help those who need to have the opportunity for employment.</P>
    <P>The task of Government is to undertake the work of protecting those who cannot protect themselves and helping these unorganised groups who have no political clout.  For too long they have been neglected by Governments kowtowing to the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; in our society &mdash; those who have property, those who have adequate incomes which they are unwilling to share, those who have jobs.  This <Col N="847" /> Government will not follow that path. We shall take our responsibilities.</P>

      <P>We have just listened to an academic dissertation spiced with some old-fashioned Fíanna Fáil bashing. That is the net extent of the speech to which we have just been treated.  This follows an appeal by the Taoiseach that the debate should be taken as a serious contribution from the Dáil as a Parliament to what is currently the most serious problem facing the country&mdash;the massive unemployment, now rising towards the 200,000 mark, which is highlighted by the fact that gilt-edged industries and industries essential for our economic development are now in serious trouble or have already foundered.  I do not have to go through the litany of them&mdash;Telectron, Black and Decker, Dunlop's of Cork in serious jeopardy, a similar situation arising with Roadstone, which is just maintaining itself in a creditworthy position.</P>
      <P>We are not speaking about occasional unemployment, about fringed or peripheral industries going to the wall.  We are talking about basic, fundamental industries which can be described as gilt-edged industries with regard to both employment and stature within our economy which are now either gone to the wall or in serious trouble.  That is the situation which we are up against and it is not a situation which warrants just an academic dissertation and some old-fashioned Fíanna Fáil bashing.  This country deserves more from this Taoiseach at this time than what we have just heard.  It does not deserve an attitude of mind that believes that we are at a debating society here in Dáil Éireann.  The Parliament of the people is not a debating society; it is a place where the majority in that Parliament elect a Government to govern. What we want from the Taoiseach when he addresses this House on a serious matter of this kind is a serious exposition of what the Government propose to do about the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we expect from the Taoiseach at this time.  We have enough economic commentators to analyse the problem for us.  We all know the facts, that factories are closing and about to close and that firms are in serious jeopardy.  What we want from the Government at this time is not just an analysis, not just a debating society approach.  We want from them positive suggestions and a positive outline of where their planning for the future is going and what sort of considerations they will take into account in organising planning for the future.</P>
      <P>There is no point in talking in vague terms about a National Planning Board or anything of that kind.  I noticed, by the way, that the National Development Corporation was not referred to at all by the Taoiseach.  I happen to agree with him on that, because that is a lot of nonsense which was engineered to seduce the Labour Party into joining the Coalition. It has absolutely no place in our present political climate, except precisely that.  It is rather significant that the Taoiseach, in his various panaceas for the future, did not include the National Development Corporation.  Obviously, the Fine Gael Party prefer the National Planning Board.  Now they can have either&mdash; Tweedledum or Tweedledee.  Neither the National Planning Board of Fine Gael, nor the National Development Corporation of the Labour Party are any substitute for political leadership and economic management.  What is required in this country today is a combination of those two factors from the Government, a Government giving political leadership at every level from the Taoiseach right throughout the other Ministers in charge of affairs and, at the same time, sound economic management as a back-up to that political leadership.  We are not getting either of those two factors right in the administration of the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will illustrate, if it requires to be illustrated, where we are going wrong in regard to both political leadership and economic management.  We have had a situation in which, in regard to jobs, the <Col N="849" /> Minister primarily responsible, the Minister for Industry and Energy, the Minister primarily charged by this house with responsibility for the whole industrial area has not shown a single example of where he has intervened in any way to prevent the breakdown or closure of a firm.  When we were in Government it was our constant endeavour to seek to pre-empt a closure of a firm or factory. Deputy Reynolds, as Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; week in, week out was in regular consultation with the State agencies concerned, with Foir Teoranta, with the Industrial Credit Company and the Industrial Development Authority with a view to preventing closure, taking action in advance, setting up a warning signal system.  We had established a clear warning signal system whereby the Department of Labour under Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and the Department of Industry under Deputy Reynolds were in constant consultation with the State agencies concerned to prevent closures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach if he has inquired from his Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy Bruton, to what extent he made any contacts prior to the actual closure of Telectron.  There was a big movement made after the event had happened.  When the horse had left the stable we found the Minister for Industry and Energy inside the stable cleaning out the remains when the horse had gone and Telectron was out.  There was no movement whatever prior to the Telectron closure. We have had a similar attitude adopted in regard to other firms that have closed in the recent past &mdash; the Black &amp; Decker firm in Kildare was another firm that closed suddenly without any apparent knowledge on the part of the Government, without any apparent action being taken through the agency of the Government Minister responsible.  A similar situation obtains across the board, an absence of consultation between the Minister for Industry and Energy, firms and State agencies, prior to an actual collapse. <Col N="850" /> There are various ways, means and devices, credit devices, grant devices, mergers, take-over devices, any number of them that can be adopted in the business and commercial world prior to a collapse.  But, once the collapse happens, it is an inevitable process thereafter.  The pathetic sight of the Minister for Industry and Energy seeking to rescue Telectron after Telectron had virtually closed was not edifying and did not show either political leadership or economic management of any kind.</P>
    <P>I shall go through this Government's record factually.  There is no point in treating this House as a debating society and talking in generalities as we have just heard from the Taoiseach.  We want to get down to practical examples.  I will tell the House one of the reasons the Minister for Industry is unable to do anything, or very little, about employment, because he simply ran away from the problem. Indeed he ran away from it in a very interesting way.  It was quite evident here on the first day this Dáil met &mdash; and I said so subsequently on a debate on Dáil reform &mdash; that we had the Minister responsible for jobs wasting his time sitting in here on these benches, day after day, week after week, discussing the esoteric subject of Dáil reform.  I am on record in the House as saying in that debate that Dáil reform was a very peripheral matter compared with the importance of executive reform and action, that no amount of Dáil reform, or other committees of the House, or indeed other debates in the Dáil would affect executive action, political action, political leadership and economic management of our society, that these basic matters were far more important than Dáil reform.  Dáil reform is a nice, esoteric, cosy subject to be given to some junior Minister on which to whet his appetite and so on, to get on with as a specific assignment.  That is the sort of subject it is but it is not a subject for a senior Minister concerned with jobs, concerned with safeguarding and creating jobs.</P>
    <P>In our present economic climate I would regard Deputy Bruton, or whoever may be Minister for industry as commanding the most important post in <Col N="851" /> an Irish Government at present, the most important post as far as the preservation of Irish society is concerned.  Yet he spends his time footling around on committees concerned with Dáil reform, spends his time sitting in here in the House listening to a debate for weeks on end on Dáil reform.  Indeed last week I was amazed when attending a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to see the Minister for Industry and Energy walk in, in the middle of the Telectron crisis; it was the black day last week when Telectron, Black &amp; Decker and other firms closed.  That very day I was sitting in a room in this House at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges when in walked the Minister for Industry and Energy to make a contribution about the procedures and privileges of this House.  I know that is a matter with which we are all concerned as Deputies.  I am not dismissing Dáil reform either.  That is a matter that should be discussed and we can always improve Dáil procedures.  But these are not fundamental matters today for the Minister for Industry and Energy who is charged with responsibility for jobs and for safeguarding and creating jobs.  He managed to spend the morning at that committee meeting last week.  That Committee on Procedure and Privileges was part of his brief as a Dáil reformer and obviously he felt as a Dáil reformer he should be sitting in on that meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming now to some very practical suggestions, the first of which is this, that if the Government do <Col N="852" /> not establish, as we had established, a proper pre-emptive system in regard to potential trouble within firms in this country than we shall continue to slide down the slippery slope on which we have already started.  There is no question about that.  We had established, through our Ministers for Labour and Industry and Energy, in conjunction with the State agencies concerned, precisely that type of early warning system whereby each of the State agencies was obliged to set up a specific division within their organisation. There was also a reporting system established to the Minister so that the matter came straight onto the Government table.  In this way we were warned weeks and months in advance about firm A, B or C being in a situation moving towards trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They still closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is basic commonsense and I am seeking to be helpful.  Any accountant will tell one that the time to settle a firm's affairs, to get that firm trimmed down, into order, so that it can continue production and give employment, is well in advance of the actual trouble taking place.  When the trouble happens it is virtually impossible to do anything about it.  Apparently this Government did not know anything last week about Telectron until they announced they were in serious trouble. Then we had the Minister for Industry and Energy, responsible for jobs, hurrying and scurrying about to deal with the problem.  The Minister responsible for jobs, responsible for unemployment in our society, has spent all of his time over the past five months establishing a new division within his Department, creating new jobs in his Department concerned with Dáil reform.  Dáil reform is an excellent, esoteric subject.  I do not mind somebody cutting their teeth on it, somebody like Deputy Allen up there, or somebody like Deputy Durkan &mdash; that is an excellent idea &mdash; but to have the Minister responsible for employment in our society spend his time, not just at meetings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but setting up a special division <Col N="853" /> in the Department of Industry and Energy to deal with Dáil reform is one example of what I would call a total lack of attention to essentials.  That is an example of the lack of political leadership and economic management we so badly need today.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, has given a very sorry and sad performance in Brussels.  It was a performance that yielded nothing and will yield nothing.  But, apart from the inadequacy of Ireland's Minister for Agriculture in Brussels, you have his further total inadequacy in regard to Irish agriculture as a whole.  When I left the Department last December there was an agreed four-year plan drawn up by all the Irish farming organisations in conjunction with the State agencies concerned and the officials of the Department.  That was a plan drawn up and agreed upon for the first time by all the interested parties. That plan has been shelved for the petty reason, obviously, that it was we who set it up &mdash; another example of Fianna Fáil bashing &mdash; because we established a constructive committee to bring all the farming organisations together to pool all their ideas.  It was a plan designed to produce very good practical results.  That plan was produced in December and was to have been published in January.  That plan has been buried.  Also buried with it was a very practical scheme involving £100 million credit over the next four years raised by way of Euro currency loans designed to increase our existing cattle herd.  There again is failure in a definite executive sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we have got so far from Deputy Dukes, Minister for Finance, in the way of Government policy is an accountancy Budget Statement in which he merely put the figures together and delivered a speech that could have been delivered here by the Secretary of the Department. I happen to know this because as the Government last December we had a preliminary look at the various documents and statements put before the Government at the time by the Department of Finance.  What the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, said here had <Col N="854" /> not one iota of political content in it.  The Budget Statement and the documentation presented with it was simply a repetition of submissions made to the Government by the Department of Finance and, as I said, the speech could have been read here just as easily by an official of the Department and not even the Secretary of the Department.  There was not one single item of political content in it.  There was no thought and planning for the future.</P>
    <P>It is vitally essential that, along with the necessary corrective measures the Government may have to propose, there should be a development content, a planning content and a content which shows that, if we get the corrective measures working, then we can plan forward for the economy and for further improvement. That is the sort of essential thinking and attitude required.  It is the sort of thinking and attitude right through the whole of <i>The Way Forward</i> which is the only document on record &mdash; I discard the Budget Statement as a serious document relating to the management of our society &mdash; dealing seriously with the management of our society.  The basic thinking is there in the very first chapter, paragraph 5:</P>
    <P>The Government consider that the measures necessary to overcome our economic difficulties and, at the same time, to realise our economic potential should be combined in a National Economic Plan covering the years 1983-1987.</P>
    <P>In other words, we must take measures to overcome our economic difficulties but we should also take measures to realise our economic potential.  I was asked some moments ago what we would have done. What we would have done is all set out in paragraph 5, page 45, dealing with the employment side in a very constructive statement in regard to the whole question of how to deal with the challenges facing Irish industry.  The document emphasises the various possible developments that should be adopted, and in paragraph 8 on page 47 it is specified that company development plans will be the focus for all State aid in the future:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> This approach will be selective and based on the potential for development of the firms concerned.  Assessment would be carried out on a joint co-operative basis with firms using the co-ordinated services of the various State agencies.  The new approach will result in a development plan where selected individual firms aimed at securing significant improvements in output, employment sales, product development etc.</P>
    <P>That is a specific suggestion.  The State agency should go to each firm, firm by firm, and pre-empt the situation, as I said earlier, and the State experts from the agencies concerned should sit down with the companies' experts and the State accountants and companies' accountants and assess the situation and make decisions which are designed to prevent the closure of businesses in six, nine or 12 months' time.  I regard that approach as being very constructive and basic in regard to the problem of unemployment. If we allow the situation to drift, if we do not have political leadership and economic management, then that will be very serious from the point of view of the future of our country; and I solemnly warn the Government they are playing with fire because they are playing with young people's idealism and their future and these young people will not tolerate this Government very much longer if they continue in this way.  They will take very serious steps to ensure the Government will not continue unless there is some evidence of planning, of development and of an approach by the Government that, side by side with the dry economic presentation of the budget sent to them by the Department of Finance, side by side with that and with whatever corrective measures they may take, there will be a developmental approach to and specific planning in agriculture and in industry which has not been attempted.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation, rightly ignored by the Taoiseach in his remarks, is no answer.  It is merely the creation of another layer of bureaucracy in the system instead of dealing with the <Col N="856" /> system that is there and seeking to improve it through the agents that are there and do it immediately and not just set up national planning boards or anything else.  This nice academic type of recommendation is not what government is about.  Government is elected to take action, not to delegate to some committee or some commission what action should be taken.  It is the Government's job to take action.  Taking action is what political leadership is about and economic management demands that action be taken.</P>

      <P>It may be helpful to the Deputy if I tell him that there is no fixed time for speeches but the Chair understands there is a gentleman's agreement between the Whips that speakers would speak for 20 or 25 minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A gentleman's agreement will always be observed.  I shall finish in five minutes.  What I have to say is practical.  It is designed to emphaise the necessity for political leadership and economic management and not allow matters to drift.  In regard to labour relations, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, Minister for Labour last year, took a positive attitude, in co-operation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and brought about a rational arrangement in regard to public service pay for the rest of last year and this year.  That was done by taking positive action, not sitting back and letting matters drift.  The initiative was taken. The same sort of initative was taken by Deputy Reynolds as Minister for Industry. I sought to take similar initiatives as Minister for Agriculture.  In my view there has been neglect in those three key areas since last December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area I wish to mention is one that concerns the Tánaiste as Minister for the Environment.  The last Government, as can be checked from the files in the Department, mandated the then Minister, Deputy Burke, to take charge of the whole area of import substitution. Deputy Burke had made considerable progress in that regard.  Import substitution is a fundamental aspect of our present economic problems but the words <Col N="857" /> have not been mentioned either by the Taoiseach today or by the Minister for Finance at any stage.  The reference to import substitution is to be found in <i>The Way Forward.</i> Import substitution is a positive way of taking steps internally to deal with unnecessary imports, with goods that can be handled at home.</P>
    <P>The then Minister was given the task of dealing with this area following reports and recommendations of consultants, architects and engineers throughout the country who reported that enormous amounts of machinery and other expensive equipment were being imported that could be handled at home.  Apart from the expensive machinery, many different types of fittings, furnishings and so on were involved.  There was a whole range of imports that could come within the ambit of the Department of the Environment if that Department were to impose the appropriate regulations on local authorities, on the professional people and on the forms involved.  However, we have not heard anything about import substitution from the Government and in particular we have not heard anything about it from the man who succeeded the person we appointed to deal with this very important area.  On a conservative estimate, import substitution could save this country £300 million per year if it was approached properly by all Government Departments but particularly by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have to be approached discreetly, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the need for discretion but part of the problem is that the people opposite do not have the brains to deal discreetly with such matters.  I know all about EEC regulations but if we must go abroad for lessons we need only look to the French to see what they are doing every day of the week and have been doing since they joined the EEC.  The Taoiseach's expression of belief in the Williamsburg conference was rather pathetic.  That conference will not solve our problems.  It can help in creating a climate of development throughout the world, but that development <Col N="858" /> will happen regardless of us altogether. We must get down to our own business at home and show political leadership and economic management in relation to our affairs.  Naturally, the rising tide will help us when the big powers free out their economies but it is nonsense to make a big deal of Ireland's participation at Williamsburg.  The Government were elected to look after Irish affairs at home.</P>
      <P>Another area in which there has been no evidence of leadership from this Government is the whole area of the training and retraining of our young people, of job mobility, of job sharing and of ensuring that through the State agencies concerned &mdash; the Youth Employment Agency, AnCO and Manpower &mdash; there is a co-ordinated policy designed to ensure that if young people do not get jobs immediately they will at least be equipped to deal with a range of jobs.  This will be in keeping with the American model in this respect.  However, the failure of the Government in this regard is yet another indication of their lack of political leadership and economic management.</P>
      <P>On behalf of this party I wish to record our total dismay with the performance of the Taoiseach who on an occasion when he might have indicated some positive steps on the part of the Government or proposals for Government action, engaged instead in what was a mixture of academic dissertation and Fianna Fáil bashing.  That is not enough.  We want performance from the Government.  I have indicated in my remarks that that performance is sadly lacking.  If we are to avoid total disillusionment which would lead only to social unrest, a pitfall towards which we seem to be heading, the Government must perform and if they cannot do that, they should get out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity for the House to discuss what I regard as being perhaps the greatest threat to both young and old, that is, the problem of unemployment.  There must be agreement on all sides of the House that this problem represents the greatest challenge both to politicians and to planners <Col N="859" /> and that unless we have vigorous and constant monitoring of industrial policy and performance, we will not be able to pave the way for the proper development of the country.  I agree with Deputy Lenihan that unless we face up to the problems and provide the solutions in the short term, in the medium term and in the long term, the whole fabric of our society will be under severe threat.  Vast social deprivation results from unemployment.</P>
      <P>Very little of the remainder of Deputy Lenihan's contribution would be of help to anyone in trying to provide jobs in the immediate term.  If the Deputy had only come into Dáil Eireann as a young Member I could understand his enthusiasm but as a man who has been here for perhaps 25 years he must accept some of the blame for the present condition of the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to manage that very well.  Deputy Lenihan waxed eloquent about the signal warning system that his Government created for the purpose of seeking out problems in industry as they arose.  I had a sad experience in my constituency of how this signal warning system was meant to work but never did.  The previous Minister for Industry and Energy visited a factory in Tralee on at least one occasion while some of his Fianna Fáil colleagues visited the premises on three or four occasions but when the factory collapsed had the audacity to say that despite visiting the factory on numerous occasions they had not been informed that the company were in serious trouble.  There was a lot of razzamatazz about that system but the solutions were not forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of this debate we should look at the broad context of the problem. We should look first at aspects of our industrial policy as we have known them in the past number of years and we should analyse our failures and our successes. We should look then at the present situation <Col N="860" /> and then we must consider the future with a view to finding out how to overcome the difficulties.</P>
    <P>In relation to aspects of industrial policy, by and large there has been a continuity of Irish industrial policy in the past 25 years, particularly in terms of the incentives offered, the gradual but inexorable movement towards full free trade from the early sixties to the late seventies and the push for regional development. Successive Governmants generally adopted a basic system of tax incentives and grants already in operation or added some new incentives &mdash; for example, in the areas of training or employment pressures or modified tax incentives such as tax free profits on export sales when necessary due to pressure from the EEC. There is little doubt that continuity was preferable to the constant changing of the basic incentives.  The thrust towards free trade began in the early 1960s added to by the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement of 1965 and accelerated by EEC entry from 1973 onwards.  This has meant the transformation of the Irish industrial structure.  The Labour Party warned against entry to the EEC on the terms negotiated in 1972 but the people chose by an overwhelming majority and in a democratic manner, the course of entry to the EEC.  The challenge for policy makers was to make the best of that opportunity and to minimise the losses for this country consequent on that decision. The question still remains as to how well our industrial structure reacted to the situation.</P>
    <P>There has also been a belief in regionalisation and this has been a feature of policy over the last 15 years or so with the location of new industry being pushed generally westwwards.  This has changed the face of rural Ireland and, I am glad to say, for the better.  On the other hand, the older industrial structures of the east of Ireland have faced tremendous problems on adaptation in the past number of years.  We have to analyse whether we have had success or failure in the immediate past with our industrial policy.</P>
    <P>The success or failure of industrial policy can be approached in a number of ways.  Favourable and unfavourable comparisons <Col N="861" /> can be made with other countries. However, as we all know, overall employment in agriculture, industry and services together has not been nearly adequate to meet the job needs of our growing labour force.  I would give examples. The IDA employment surveys, classified by grant type, found a growth in employment of some 21,000 in foreign industry and about 5,000 persons in indigenous industry between 1973 and 1980. However, we must take into account that between fiscal 1973 and fiscal 1980 about £2,000 million in 1980 values was spent, according to Telesis, on Irish industrial policy as a whole excluding tax foregone under export sales relief.  We must also realise that in the course of this period there was the impact of two oil induced recessions, that there was chosen adjustment to free trade, which meant enormous job losses in traditional industries which were unprepared in terms of management capacity, marketing skills and productivity levels for some level of competition experienced on both home and export markets.</P>
    <P>We also had the job gains in new mainly foreign-owned industries such as chemicals and electronics.  I would not wish to be critical of IDA performance. In fact, it should be recognised, as the Telesis people found, that the IDA had developed a marketing organisation which is unquestionably the most dynamic, most efficient and most effective of its kind in the world.  The problem may rather have been that the overall framework of policy was inadequate, that the IDA was expected to do too much, that there was too much attention to expected job approvals which never materialised and that, due to inadequate or non-existent planning structures, too little attention was paid to a coherent strategy for protecting existing jobs or helping existing firms to rationalise or merge and then develop into new areas or new product lines.</P>
    <P>The 1970s also saw the neglect of the State sector as an engine of development. It was neglected by politicians, who tended to notice only when issues such as major losses had emerged or when a financial crisis was imminent and who <Col N="862" /> failed to provide consistent and clear objectives for the State sector.  There was serious undercapitalisation and poor investment decisions in some areas which caused a major burden of debt.  Although the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies was an important innovation, there was no effective policy supervision or effective co-ordination between State enterprises.  Whatever the causes, the commercial and manufacturing semi-State companies have come into the 1980s weak in morale, in serious financial trouble and with their contribution to sound economic development seriously diminished by comparison with their earlier pioneering days.</P>
    <P>We ask ourselves, and many other people outside this House are asking: where do we go now?  What future have we and what plans and prospects have we of dealing with the serious problem of unemployment?  Generally over the last 20 years the rate of growth of industrial output has exceeded European levels, if not reaching the level of Japan.  It was on average, between 1959 and 1966, 6.2 per cent annually; between 1966 and 1973, it was 7.09 per cent annually; and, between 1973 and 1979, it was 5.11 per cent annually, with little or no change since 1979.  By contrast with the de-industrialisation trend in Britain and elsewhere there is no doubt that Ireland has the potential for future growth in processing and manufacturing.  We have long since realised, and it has been forcefully brought home to us in recent weeks, that new foreign industry is vulnerable to recession, to closure on market grounds and on grounds of overall global strategy.</P>
    <P>Multinational firms, in the last analysis, tend to be mobile.  Unemployment has risen dramatically throughout all western economies in the last two to three years and output stagnated. Although we in Ireland as an open economy are vulnerable to this, the growth of manufacturing exports continues to be impressive, consistently exceeding the growth of export markets; but competition from imports continues to be a major problem for many firms particularly in traditional industries.  Of course we must protect native industries, we <Col N="863" /> must allow them to develop, we must streamline the production and the commodities and we must at all times encourage the use of native materials in the market place at home.</P>
    <P>The growth of the labour force at about 20,000 a year is high by comparison with neighbouring countries and emigration is rightly rejected as a bogus solution for our younger people.  The necessity for corrective measures in the budget to protect our borrowing capacity and give us room for manoeuvre in the future curtails spending on both the current and capital side as a boost to recovery.  I would say that the budget was a harsh necessity rather than a preferred choice, if we were to be realistic and face up to the serious problems facing this country.  In setting out for a target of £897 million as a current budget deficit we were adopting a realistic approach to the serious problems facing this country.  I do not think it would have been practicable or feasible to have gone for the target of £750 million, as outlined by the Fianna Fáil Party in the course of the election campaign.  I do not think either that the country or the people, who in the end are what count, would have been able to sustain the serious economic deprivation which would have resulted immediately on aiming for a target of £750 million.</P>
    <P>Many recent industrial studies indicate that we are now at a transition stage in terms of industrial policy. Our past policies have been totally inadequate in providing employment oportunities and obviously changes must take place.  I will concentrate on a few of the issues which must be looked at if we are to overcome the difficulties.  Adequate infrastructure is essential for industrial development. This year there has been a significant increase in the provision for sanitary services which are a necessary part of infrastructure in attracting development. My Department are reviewing the road development plan and we are considering the establishment of a separate funding agency to tap private sector sources of funds so as to accelerate road development. Road development is very important <Col N="864" /> not only in the rural areas but in the cities in terms of attracting and locating industry.  We are well aware of the time and money wasted because of lack of traffic mobility in the cities due to an inadequate road system.  It is my intention to see that we have adequate infrastructure so as to avoid serious bottlenecks which will hinder industrial investment or recovery.</P>
    <P>It is accepted by all politicians that we must have a continuing and adequate planning system for this country to develop.  We must have a continuous planning system which will highlight obstacles to development and act as a special forum with wide contacts in the various sectors of the economy.  That will be an important part of the development process.  Ever since the Second Programme in the 1960s Governments have shown a marked reluctance to establish lasting planning structures.  All parties should be actively involved in planning and in charting a course which we should follow if we are to have economic development. Our overall costs must be competitive, as there is no solution in a low wage economy, nor is there any guarantee that restraint in incomes will mean increased output and employment.  From a given base, changes in wages and in related costs higher than those in competing countries will have a damaging effect and lower the prospects of recovery.</P>
    <P>Private investment has failed, due possibly to the recession.  What is needed is a more competitive structure, more innovation, more research and development and better marketing skills, which would allow us to market effectively in countries where English is not the spoken language. Up to recent times our marketing in these countries has been totally inadequate because we have not the basic language.  We should also encourage the development of high technology forms in growth areas so that there will be an increase in productivity levels.</P>
    <P>We have never neglected incentives to industry, but we are at a stage where we are analysing industry and the state of our economy.  We must appreciate that it is essential to encourage entrepreneurial <Col N="865" /> talent in the private co-operative and State sectors.  Sole reliance on new foreign firms and associated tehnology and capital is a recipe for disaster.  It is necessary to strengthen the climate which encourages genuine industrial risk and to severely penalise unjustified gains from speculation and windfall profits in nonproductive areas.  Every encouragement will continue to be given to worker co-operatives, although ideally these schemes should emerge as projects in their own right, before established firms get into difficulty, rather than as a last resort type of industrial rescue.</P>
    <P>The important role to be played by the State rescue agencies should not be underestimated.  These agencies must continue to be active in job protection. In the present climate employed people are wondering whether they will be employed next week or next month and there is a growing uncertainty.  We must fight to preserve existing jobs and to make the foundation on which these jobs are based a solid one so that they will survive the serious problems of recession facing us.  Every effort must be made to save existing jobs, so long as there is a possibility of a viable outcome, by injecting new State funds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan questioned the absence from the Taoiseach's remarks of the proposals for the National Development Corporation as have been outlined in the Programme for Government.  It is essential that the State sector be financially restructured and encouraged to develop and diversify into new and profitable areas.  The object of rationalisation must be to encourage development in other areas.  The National Development Corporation will be a key instrument in the development of new public sector enterprises, in initiating joint ventures and as a vehicle for commercialising ideas from State research institutes and elsewhere. They can play a key role in developing our natural resources in areas of industry based on agriculture and forestry and in high technology areas.  It is necessary to get the legislation right so that the National Development Corporation will be effective and so that State enterprises can again play a vital role in <Col N="866" /> industrialisation.  Adequate funding will not be a problem for the National Development Corporation when suitable projects are identified and analysed.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are serious problems facing us and, more particularly, facing our young people.  We have always spoken of our young people as being our greatest asset.  Unemployed young people are wondering from where we got that terminology.  We must recognise that the large numbers of unemployed young people are a sign of our failure to cope and develop policies to solve their problems. If we are to succeed in tackling this problem Irish companies must be developed in the private, co-operative and State sectors which will be able to compete in the free trade world.  We cannot rely on foreign enterprise or on foreign market forces to satisfy the national requirement for growth and jobs.  The forthcoming White Paper on Industrial Policy will spell out the details of Government action.  In the meantime within the overall financial constraints that exist where because of the huge burden of debt there is little room for manoeuvre, the Government are making every effort to save jobs and encourage investment and growth.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to deal with the region of the country which I represent and to refer mainly to the unemployment situation there.  At the outset I should like to make a few remarks about what the Tánaiste said a short while ago.  I am glad the Tánaiste welcomes the idea of regionalisation in regard to industrial development.  It was a very bright idea and for the most part it was one which was put to work in the regions quite successfully.  The Tánaiste referred to the semi-State areas, dealt with their weak position as of now and told the House that many of them are in a weak position and that there was a crisis of morale.  That whole area will need to be studied carefully and norms set, advice given and action taken by the Government in order to improve the morale and confidence in those companies.  It seems odd to be referring to a National Development Corporation at a time when the <Col N="867" /> existing and experienced semi-State companies do not seem to be able to deliver the goods.  It seems to be a kind of cosy answer which is given by commentators: &ldquo;All you have to do is develop State companies and then all our problems, unemployment and industrial development, will be solved&rdquo;.  It is not quite as easy as that and anyone who in Government has had close contact in the recent past with some semi-State companies crying out for equity, for further Government guarantees for borrowing, will be very dubious about the claims made for development by people who regard this as a solution to all our problems.</P>
      <P>I would agree with a good deal of what the Tánaiste said about our weaknesses in certain areas and about the importance of infrastructure.  It is not my first time to mention in the House that the region about which I intend to speak is one that has been treated very shabbily with regard to the basic infrastructure, namely, the provision of adequate roadways. I have said in the House before that in the twenties, thirties and for some time in the forties, we had in the Cavan-Monaghan area a fine railway service, the Great Northern Railway and the old Midland-Great Western, a CIE operated section from Cavan to Mullingar.  People were very reluctant to agree to those services being withdrawn, but promises were made of an extra provision of money for roadmaking.  Indeed, the promises were delivered on once or twice, but not for many years now has any cognisance been taken of the fact that road is the only access to that region.</P>
      <P>I get angry in the House when I hear pleas being made for improved roadways and so on &mdash; very busy roadways, admittedly &mdash; to the south while at the same time a good railway service is available to the major regions in Munster from Dublin.  Development is needed there, but it is difficult for taxpayers not to be angry when they find they are not getting the infrastructural development they are entitled to as citizens and that there are places of privilege in this regard in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste also referred to the difficulty <Col N="868" /> about training an adequate sales force to sell our goods in countries where English is not the language.  I agree with the Tánaiste, but I should like to add that as Minister for Education I took steps to improve the quality of oral continental languages by introducing an oral test.  I have not a great belief in the test as such but it will draw the attention of the pupil to the importance of being able to communicate in the language.  It will concentrate the teachers' interest in that area also and, inevitably, it will benefit the pupils.  What do we find now?  We find that the Minister for Education, for the sake of saving a few pounds, a bagatelle, a trifle, has scrapped the scheme which had been in progress on an experimental basis for some time.  That was a very short-sighted decision and the Tánaiste should impress upon the Minister for Education the importance of changing that decision.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Tánaiste that the development of entrepreneurial talent in our people is important, particularly among our young people.  It is true that all the programmes, syllabi for the schools, were reorganised with that in view, to develop imagination, self-confidence and ability to do their own research depending on what level they were at in the school.  Above all we were anxious to produce flexibility of mind and approach geared to the idea that young people should think up projects for themselves and that people working in certain industries should be thinking of setting up a small industry in an allied area.  Some time ago I mentioned in the House that Dr. Kieran Kennedy gave an account of the development of small industry in Denmark.  He pointed out that he learned from his studies that in Denmark most of the small industries were started by young people who have been employed in a specific small industry, had an idea related to that industry and set up on their own.  In that way the industrial base in Denmark was expanded and strengthened.</P>
    <P>I note that the Tánaiste said that when the time came to establish the National Development Corporation adequate funding would be available.  I will deal <Col N="869" /> with that matter later.  Another point I want to deal with is the budget and how it has damaged employment.  The House may be aware that the North Eastern Regional Development Organisation covers the counties of Louth, Monaghan and Cavan.  As the subject under discussion is unemployment, I should like to refer to the statistics issued on 25 March last for that area by that group.  The total figure is horrifying &mdash; 10,818 people.  I have evidence that since 25 March that figure has increased and the situation is now worse than ever.  That was the number who were unemployed in the Louth, Cavan and Monaghan region.  At a conservative estimate each unemployed person affects three others.  So we are talking about the plight of 30,000-plus people in that small region.</P>
    <P>In some cases there is a severe degree of hardship.  Admittedly, there is some cushioning from social welfare, but in other cases it is not merely a degree of hardship but of distress and despair.  In a sense the whole structure of society in recent times is bound to create despair for young people, particularly young married couples, when they lose their jobs.  Our way of living involves a mortgage, which is a heavy load on any young couple even when both are working. Consumerism has affected them to such an extent that they purchase, often on hire purchase, cars, cookers, fridges, washing machines, deep freezes, stereos, videos and so on.  Everything has to be wall to wall.  It could be characterised as the wall to wall society.  There is nothing as heart-breaking as the pride of young people when unemployment strikes.  It can be very upsetting for anyone in public life and is a severe blow to young people who are living in hope.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to the Minister for Labour some time ago.  It was answered by the Minister of State.  It related to the number of people who were registered for unemployment by the National Manpower Service in Cavan town.  The largest group were construction workers and general factory operatives. Next to that were clerical and related occupations.  The construction industry is in a perilous state, as everyone <Col N="870" /> admits.  Some responsibility for this lies with the capital budget.  There is a motion on the Order Paper at present about the cut of £220 million in the Minister's budget from what we envisaged we would have spent.  We had a programme for decentralisation involving Dundalk, Cavan, Sligo and Letterkenny &mdash; a girdle of towns around the Border.  If that programme had been proceeded with the category under &ldquo;construction&rdquo; would have been wiped out.  We had skilled people and projects were under way. They were simply cancelled.  I do not think there was any justification for this. The Government would eventually have saved money if they had gone ahead with the programme.  It was said in the House that there was no private money available. I said I was prepared to take up that challenge and that in my county town the money would be available, as were the skills to construct the building.  This would have involved a large number of highly skilled operatives and would have breathed life into the town with the increase in population, the numbers employed, spending power and so on.</P>
    <P>I am not alone in thinking there was a serious mistake made in cutting the capital budget.  Dr. Kennedy, Director of the ESRI, said in a speech in Galway that it was also a mistake to trim the public capital programme by eliminating the provision for new projects satisfying clearly defined criteria rather than cutting out some of the more wasteful existing components.  Nobody could accuse Dr. Kennedy of <i>ex parte</i> pleading or political motivation.  He has been more kind to the budget than I would be, but he makes the point I am making.  I am applying it to my own area.  It was a serious mistake to curb the capital programme.</P>
    <P>The second highest group looking for positions were clerical and related occupations. Many people, particularly girls, do their leaving certificate and then do a commercial course lasting one year. There are hundreds of them on the labour market and very few jobs.  I have had meetings with young people in the recent past in a number of different counties and asked them to speak up and say what <Col N="871" /> they thought.  Very often that problem surfaced, with wide ramifications.</P>
    <P>First of all, increasing automation of offices, increasing computerisation, will leave fewer jobs, at least in the larger enterprises.  There may always be employment, and there is no reason why it should not be good employment, in smaller firms in which it would not be economical to invest heavily in technology, but it is a serious problem we will have to face up to.  The North East Regional Development Organisation commissioned a study of the area and I am very pleased to see that the period they took in for the study was 1980 to 2000: they were thinking in terms of the next century.  The numbers out of work or looking for work, with good liberal education plus a year in training for clerical work, are very large.  It is very disheartening to find there are no jobs for them.</P>
    <P>Among the complaints of young people to me was that married women were staying on in jobs.  That was referred to in a wider sphere than clerical jobs: it was spoken of in relation to nursing, teaching, and so on.  It is very hard to make categorical statements about it.  It is a difficult problem.  A citizen who is a married woman may have skills and experience that she can put at the service of the State.  It is very difficult to tell such a person that she cannot take that job because she is married.  On the other hand a young person is told she is inexperienced and that she cannot get a job. If you cannot get a job you cannot get experience.  The Work Experience Programme came in for a lot of criticism from young people.  They said that it was not really serving the purpose that it was designed for, that the work experience was not worth while in many cases.  There were even complaints about exploitation. Young people tend to exaggerate and therefore I do not intend to dwell on that.</P>
    <P>However, we will have to have a deep study of the problem that automation of offices will create, difficulties that will be increasing in the near future, and to the end of the century and into the next century, in this regard.  Why should we continue <Col N="872" /> to encourage people to train for jobs if the jobs will not be available?  We will have to look at society to see how wealth can be distributed by giving part-time jobs or half-day work, etc., to people as this problem increases.  We hope the recession will lift and that there will be more jobs, but even if it does, even if we begin to produce more wealth, it may be that the wealth will be produced by fewer workers.  It is something we will have to face up to.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate that I condemn the cut in the capital budget which among other things wiped out the decentralisation programme, decentralisation being desired in its own right, but there would be a spin-off in the production of buildings, and great numbers of people would be employed.  I speak specifically for my own area but it would apply to other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>We have very serious problems of unemployment, redundancy etc. as a result of the budget.  I will cite a study made by business people of estimated losses in a small town in my constituency. The losses to the State on excise as a result of the penal excise duties in the budget have been estimated at £434,928 per annum; loss of excise on spirits has been estimated at £800,000 per annum; the loss to public houses because of VAT at 23 per cent is estimated at £365,976. Excluding petrol and the publicans, the loss of VAT revenue per annum has been given at £299,000, a total in one small town of almost £2 million.</P>
    <P>I submit there is a very special difficulty in the Border areas.  Some Members of the House who are members of the Government parties will have visited Donegal for the by-election campaign and they will have noted that there is a very alarming effect in Border towns. They will have noticed that there are roadside markets very near the Border. I encountered one on Sunday and it took me about half-an-hour to get through it. It was between Enniskillen and Swanlinbar. The market was along the side of the road.  The pessimism and lack of confidence being spread in that area cannot be exaggerated.  In the distributive trade <Col N="873" /> there are redundancies every week with shops and businesses closing down, some opening for portion of the day.</P>
    <P>In particular the hotel and catering industries, which for many years along the Border were thriving, are severely affected by the duties, taxes and excise and the difference between them in the Six Counties and the Republic.  I appreciate that a gesture was made by the Minister for Finance with regard to VAT, and it was appreciated, but it will not have a great impact on business, though the position is better than it was.  It shows the Minister was conscious that something had to be done because otherwise the industry would have fallen down and disappeared.</P>
    <P>I will give some indication of how widespread the increase in unemployment has been in a Border region.  Between January and November 1982, Dundalk lost very heavily.  I can add to that what is happening at the moment as a result of the budget impositions.  Dundalk is in a very serious position.  Drogheda, further south, also suffered severe job loss in 1982.  Ballyjamesduff, a small Cavan town, suffered very severely.  A meat processing business there was closed down altogether.  Kingscourt lost jobs, Ardee lost jobs, Killeshandra lost jobs, Castleblayney lost jobs, Carrickmacross, Cootehill and Ardagh lost jobs.  In Ardagh the copper processing plant was closed down leaving the workers in the lurch.  I could not charge the Dutch people who founded the company with irresponsibility.  They traded for as long as they could but their market dried up.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the North Eastern Regional Development Organisation had commissioned a study which could be a headline for other regions as well, and even for Government.  The conclusion of the report by the North Eastern Regional Development Organisation for 1982 is worth reading into the record.</P>
    <P>The much-promised and longawaited end to the recession has still not arrived&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The pundits said the recession is lifting. Dr. Kennedy in his speech in Galway said the US economy was lifting and that gradually <Col N="874" /> the European and our own economies would lift too.  I hope that is true because it is better to see the pint glass half full than half empty.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in fact the employment position has deteriorated further since the date of the survey in November 1982.  The needs and priorities of the North East Region have been highlighted on many occasions and in many forms but now similar needs and priorities are evident in many of the other regions in the state.  The competition for jobs in the future will be very keen and the North East Region will have to be promoted and projected intensively if it is to obtain its due share of the available jobs.</P>
    <P>I am toying with the idea of a type of SFADCo for the Border region which would be useful as a developmental vehicle.  Nobody ever took the economics of the Border area seriously.  It was never studied specifically as it affected the counties on the Border.</P>
    <P>The IDA is currently preparing its Industrial Development Plan for the next five years.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste mentioned that a White Paper on development will be issued soon.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that in the light of past performance and future expectations, the various programmes and procedures of the IDA will be closely examined to determine if they are suitable and appropriate for the critical task of job creation which faces the country in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>NERDO, having anticipated the need for a co-ordinated programme of development of the NE Region, commissioned a study to formulate a regional Strategy for the period 1983-2001.  Work on this study is well advanced and the final report is due for publication in mid 1983.  This strategy will quantify the population and workforce projections for the counties and main towns in the region and identify where the need for jobs is most pressing and it is to be hoped that a series of <Col N="875" /> imaginative and innovative recommendations will be produced which will assist the development agencies operating in the region to fulfil their obligations in the job creation field.</P>
    <P>We cannot fail in that, particularly because of the very large numbers of young people in that region.  I go along with all those who say that pessimism is a very serious enemy, that we must be very careful, despite the fact that all the indicators are wrong and that the recession is still biting, and that we instil confidence in our young people.  We must not deprive our youth of hope.</P>
    <P>I would like somebody to tell me about the Youth Employment Agency.  There is supposed to be a sum of £70 million plus for this agency.  The agency has two objectives, training and work experience, but they should create positive and continuing jobs for young people.  What is the agency doing in that regard?  I met young people recently and asked them to bring forward positive ideas for employment, to study the setting up of youth co-operatives and to look around and see if there is anything they could develop in their own areas.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long I have been speaking nor do I know how long I have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be much longer. I want to make the point that pessimism is a dangerous enemy and we must inspire our young people with hope and confidence. I want the Youth Employment Agency to get that £70 million, but they should invest it in projects for young people.  A youth co-operative movement would be a good idea.  I come from an area where the bulwark of the economy is large co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some positive suggestions to make.  There was a gas find in the western part of County Cavan, extending into County Fermanagh and maybe parts of County Leitrim.  Last borings made <Col N="876" /> improved the flow of gas, but there has not been a commercial flow.  Experts in this field say this gas is available.  The Minister of State, Deputy Collins, told me provision has been made for two borings this year.  I suggest that money from the European Regional Fund be made available to that more extensive borings can be carried out this year.  This would be a great boost for the national economy, apart altogether from the local economy.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said multinationals tended to be mobile.  Telesis said we should be concentrating heavily on native raw material based industries.  In my region there are very highly developed co-operatives.  At one time the area was famous for oats.  We are importing cereals. The dieticians and experts, particularly the health fiends in the United States, say the fibre and roughage available from natural porridge is best and over-manufactured cereals are not so good.  Why then can we not have import substitutions in that field?  Admittedly, my region has turned mainly to dairying but young people might pounce on this idea of growing oats and the scheme could be funded by the Youth Employment Agency.  Some years ago some Members, including myself, supported a woman who maintained a corn mill in Kells which was in danger of drainage. She produces the traditional porridge oatlets for her own locality.</P>
    <P>I seem to have potatoes on the brain. £26.4 million worth of potatoes was imported in 1982 into this country.  That is bad management of our agricultural economy, there is no doubt about that. Potato production and potato processing, as chips or otherwise, have a potential for employment.  I cannot understand, from a news broadcast which I heard this morning when on my way into the Dáil, why several tonnes of potatoes were being imported yesterday at Greenore.  I do not want to condone illegal action in any way, but the local farmers took action themselves and either dumped those potatoes into the sea or turned them inedible.  There is a glut of potatoes in Ireland at present, prices are at rock-bottom and I cannot understand why it was <Col N="877" /> necessary to import potatoes this year.  A glut may be followed by a famine and perhaps next year potatoes may be very dear and very scarce.  There is some lack of direction and thought.  Perhaps a floor price of some kind could be introduced. Deputy Lenihan spoke about import substitution. There is certainly no question of that amount of potatoes having to be brought into this country.</P>
    <P>Diversification from butter-making is important.  The Minister for Agriculture will have a fight on his hands to ensure that we get a fair deal in the British market as far as the selling of Kerrygold butter is concerned.  We are not getting that now.  The British are doing what they like in this regard.  Sales have gone down and there is alleged to be unfair rigging and competition.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency over 30 million gallons of milk are now used for the production of Bailey's cream, one of the great export successes of recent times.  A few years ago nobody would have thought of that as having such potential. That potential has been exploited and I am glad to say that another cream &mdash; Emmet's Cream &mdash; is being produced in the county, using a certain amount of milk.</P>
    <P>Why is it that if one goes on holiday to any continental country in the supermarkets one can get tinned and processed food from Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and France, but none from Ireland?  The only Irish product one sees on the shelves there is Kerrygold butter, salted or unsalted &mdash; one has a choice. We kill beef animals at a younger stage than they do on the Continent and our meat is better and more tender, so why can we not exploit it?  We are talking all the time about food processing and every venture which we have had has fallen down.  That includes the Sugar Company off-shoot which was not a great success &mdash; again I do not know why.  We have the raw materials.  We could go to the general market or go up-market by selling to delicatessens and charging high prices for special selected meats, whether lamb, beef or pork, the latter being extensively raised in my region.</P>
    <P>It will take the combined efforts of <Col N="878" /> everybody in this House and of all the existing development organisations to cope with the present situation as a result of the recession but also, when the recession is over, to cope with the huge numbers of young people &mdash; sophisticated, well-trained and well-educated &mdash; who will come on the market.  If the Government do not very soon come up with a positive plan for development, particularly in manufacturing industry, the pessimism will become endemic and it will be impossible to build confidence in our young people for the future.  People talk about the danger of a social explosion. To be quite frank, they would be foolish if they did not explode and blow the lot of us up if we let them down by not developing the country in such a way that they can find enriching employment and can with satisfaction develop their own country.  There is nowhere else to go &mdash; I am tempted to add &ldquo;Thank God&rdquo;.  They must stay and develop their own country. We must have the plans, provide the vehicles, give them the tools and I am sure that they will do the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what Deputy Wilson had to say and am glad that his contribution was in short, sharp contrast to that of the deputy leader of his party.  He made a number of constructive suggestions and accepted, as a politician in this House, that the blame lay on us as politicians in some part for the problems which face this country and not one Government or party.  He realises that this is a continuing difficulty which all of us must share and ask what we can do about it.  He endeavoured to make constructive suggestions, which appeared absent from the speech of his deputy leader, who took the opportunity to use it as an exercise to bash the Government rather than to put forward something constructive to give hope to the people who are without jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate on the recent factory closures and the job losses which have resulted has had a beneficial potential on two counts.  It affords the Government an opportunity to underline their policy for stemming the tide of job losses <Col N="879" /> through a concerted planning approach from the industrial sector level upwards. It also affords the Opposition an opportunity to demonstrate whether their intent in seeking this time was motivated by a genuine and constructive concern for those who have lost their jobs, or whether it represented an opportunist political stroke at our expense.  It certainly gave me no pleasure to have heard the feigned and empty anguish expressed by the Fianna Fáil deputy leader.  There was no constructive input which offers any hope for those who have recently found themselves without jobs.  Their plight is being used here for cheap political point scoring, if I understand the temper of his speech.  The sooner Fianna Fáil Members who would take this opportunity to make speeches like that discover the bankruptcy of that sort of approach, the better for us all.  Overcoming the jobs crisis is not a matter for the Government alone, but should elicit the most constructive and committed efforts of every Member of this House.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have addressed themselves to the planning structures which have now been put in place by this Government.  Their purpose is to evolve a more cohesive approach to industrial development than has previously existed.  In this exercise we have the benefit of knowing the strengths and weaknesses of past policies.  It is clear that only through achieving a broader and more diversified domestic industrial base can we have greater control over the employment destinies of our work force. The urgency and importance of this task is sharply focused by recent factory closures.</P>
    <P>Commitment by this or previous Governments to facilitating industrial expansion has never been an issue.  Huge sums of taxpayers' money are expended annually on factory premises, industrial grants for equipment, management and operative training, loan and rescue finance arrangements.  The State has generously assisted our industrial sector at every turn &mdash; from the cradle and, unfortunately far too frequently, to the grave. The questions now being seriously examined <Col N="880" /> by this Government are whether the return in terms of the creation of durable employment has not been far too meagre, as also policy changes called for to affect improvements to bring about a greater degree of industrial job security.</P>
    <P>When last in the Department of Labour I established the Youth Employment Agency, with the full backing of all parties in the House, by means of a 1 per cent levy, the continuation of which I have ensured since coming back as Minister for Labour.  It will now apply to all incomes.  More than £75 million, in addition to moneys from the European Social Fund, will be applied this year to ameliorate and overcome the employment problems of young people.</P>
    <P>The Youth Employment Agency has been only a short time in existence.  But when one considers the increase in numbers given training and work experience opportunities in the last two years, one will see that its intervention has already had a significant impact. Apart from working towards greater coordination and control of youth schemes, the agency has brought about an emphasis on catering, more centrally, for the need of disadvantaged youth and the longer-term unemployed than obtained heretofore.  The numbers undergoing programmes funded through the levy have increased also in two-year period from approximately 19,000 to an estimated 45,000 this year.  The Government are committed fully to the work of the Youth Employment Agency and, as indicated in the Joint Programme for Government, will facilitate that agency in every way to ensure that it can expeditiously and effectively discharge the important national task for which it was established.</P>
    <P>In outlining the potential of Government to address the problems of unemployment and establish more solid foundations for future economic growth, we must recognise also our continuing vulnerability to variations in the industrial economic climate.  This recession like the last, is taking its toll in closures and increasing levels of unemployment. Much stronger economies than ours have <Col N="881" /> been affected similarly.  For example, in the Netherlands at present unemployment stands at 14.3 per cent of the labour force.  In Belgium the rate is 13.4 per cent while the Federal Republic of Germany, with a traditionally strong economy, has an unemployment rate now of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The factors which have led to increased unemployment are many.  In the first place there is a world-wide economic recession which has led to the growth of Irish exports falling to around 3 per cent on average in the last three years as against 8 per cent in the late 1970s.  Apart from that, the recession has created an environment which is unfavourable to new investment and resulting job creation. In particular competition internationally between countries to attract direct foreign investment has intensified. This offers little consolation to those without work at home.</P>
    <P>However, in some recent closures, the tragedy of workers' plight has been callously heightened by the cavalier approach of employers to notifying them of their impending redundancy.  The Government and the country at large abhor this behaviour.  I want to make it abundantly clear to any employer who might countenance a similar approach that any disregard for the existing legislative provisions governing redundancies will be met with the full rigours of all the means at the disposal of the State.  The Protection of Employment Act, which is administered by my Department, obliges employers contemplating redundancies to notify the Minister for Labour and worker representatives in writing at least one month in advance of the proposed effective date.  The purpose of that Act is to allow for discussions to take place between all interested parties, to establish what possibilities, if any, exist to save the jobs at risk.  This legislative obligation is not discharged by an employer who gives no notice of redundancy to his workers and who instead seeks to compensate them financially.  Such an approach undermines the whole purpose of the Act, indicates scant regard for the future welfare of employees and often <Col N="882" /> jeopardises the efforts of State agencies to assist.</P>
    <P>I have reviewed the operation of the provisions of the Protection of Employment Act since it was first implemented in 1977.  As a result of this review I intend to strengthen its provisions in two areas. The requirement of one month's notification of impending redundancies has been shown to be too short to allow for an exhaustive examination of possibilities for salvaging jobs at risk.  I intend to extend the required notification period. I am concerned also that the penalties for non-compliance with the provisions of the Act should constitute a real deterrent. Therefore I intend to put proposals before the House which will increase their level and broaden their ambit in order to achieve that result.</P>
    <P>Closures of firms and large-scale redundancies can lead to serious industrial relations problems and put considerable strains on our industrial relations system.  Nevertheless the principle of free collective bargaining is accepted by all sides as the best basis for our system.  The role of the State is to provide institutions which can help the parties to disputes to settle their differences: the Labour Court, the conciliation service, rights commissioners and the Employment Appeals Tribunal, all have been set up for this purpose.  Disputes arising from closures and redundancies are best dealt with through agreed procedures and, where necessary, by invoking the services of public institutions.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately some closures have led to forms of industrial action which are not authorised by the law.  I know that trade unions generally do not condone or support such action.  I am sure they will continue to encourage their members to act within the law.  I would point out that illegal action frequently can frustrate the efforts of the State agencies endeavouring to get replacement industries set up where firms have had to close.  Furthermore the inevitable publicity which illegal industrial action receives can do nothing but harm to our prospects of attracting new industry here.  While the frustration and anguish associated with losing employment due to a closure are <Col N="883" /> entirely understandable, workers should appreciate that unlawful action often can have serious adverse effects on theirs and fellow workers' future employment prospects.</P>
    <P>I would advise employers to weigh very carefully the implications of having recourse to the law in an effort to defuse industrial relations difficulties.  The use of injunctions in industrial disputes is a difficult and emotional issue.  The granting of <i>ex-parte</i> injunctions where one party only to a dispute is heard, is subject to particular criticism.  I am anxious to have discussions with employers and trade unions on the use of injunctions in trade disputes, to establish whether an agreed basis for changes can be found.  In my view experience has shown that injunctions often can compound problems in industrial disputes, making their ultimate solution vastly more difficult.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the tenor of contributions from the Fianna Fáil benches.  They have sought to give the impression that they alone of the parties in this House champion the interests of working people, Yet, nowhere in their legislative record have they enshrined that commitment they so often profess in opposition.  The stock of substantive legislation protecting the rights of workers has not been updated by one comma since its advent onto the Statute Book at the instigation of the Labour Party in the period between 1973 and 1977.  For example, Fianna Fáil members of the European Parliament voted <i>en masse</i> only a short few months ago to scupper an EEC proposal to require multinational companies with subsidiaries in the Community, including Ireland, to give basic information to their workers on the wellbeing or otherwise of the enterprises in which they work.  Those kinds of realities are what test their sincerity in pleading the cause of working people.  Indeed talk is a very cheap commodity; actions speak louder than words.  That type of stance on the part of Fianna Fáil expresses a complex certainly not relevant to the Ireland of the 1980s.  Industrial location here, especially by the bigger multinationals, has never come <Col N="884" /> cheap.  The national duty-free shop has been exhaustively scrutinised in advance of start-up decisions being taken.  Often the bottom line is certainly not an indulgence of our national need for more industry but the potential for return in the form of profit.</P>
    <P>In assessing that potential for return locating firms take very fully into account the many positive advantages we offer. For our part we may in the past have been too willing to subordinate the longer-term interests of Irish workers in our anxiety to clinch agreement for firms to set up here, even where their longerterm durability was dubious.  To some extent our present difficulties have their source in such an approach.  A refashioning of our industrial policy must now take full account of past deficiencies and ensure that we proceed only on the basis that offers those now without work and the thousands who will join the labour markets in the years ahead the best possibilities for employment commensurate with their educational and technical skills.  That is the objective of this Governments's policy.</P>

      <P>Because of the short time left I shall try to be brief in order to allow other speakers to take part in the debate.  The debate so far has not attempted to deal with the problem of unemployment in any realistic way.  It has not attempted to examine what is wrong, what has brought about the levels of unemployment we are experiencing. Unemployment, is not, of course, a new problem.  It is an element we have had since the State was founded.  It is an element that existed even before that.  Successive Governments since the establishment of the State have implemented plans which they thought would imporve or develop the industrial base and provide employment for all those available for work.  It is clear from even a very basic and cursory look at the history of the State that the policies pursued down through the years by succesive Governments have failed and the most obvious indication of that failure is the present level of unemployment and the thousands upon thousands who have emigrated <Col N="885" /> in search of work since there was no work at home because of the grossly undeveloped state of the industrial sector.</P>
      <P>I would be anxious to hear the Government outline what precise proposals they have to change the thrust of this policy in relation to unemployment.  It is regrettable that the budget and the Bill now before the House have done virtually nothing to change the policies implemented down through the years in an attempt to solve the unemployment problem. We have had a chorus of speakers, some Government speakers and some from the industrial sector, saying that pay rises could put jobs in jeopardy.  We have the Minister for Finance in recent days indicating his willingness to interfere with the system of collective bargaining in order to impose sanctions on companies which enter freely into arrangements with workers for wage increases and, at the same time, refusing or saying he has no authority whatsoever to impose sanctions on companies which have failed down through the years to reinvest the profits made for their activities or to develop the various elements of marketing and research development which are so essential in developing competitive commodities for sale in the export market. The chorus we hear day in and day out is that the workers are the ones who are at the back of the crisis.  They are the ones creating job losses.  It is not the working class who control the finances of this State.  It is not they who engage in land speculation rather than invest in jobs.  It is not the working class who make decisions.  It is not they who invested £106 million buying a bank in America rather than bring the money back here to invest in housing and industry.  They are not the people creating job losses.  It is the people with the financial power and those with the power to make investment decisions who are at the back of the present crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told the recession is worldwide and we are victims of that recession. Recession in any part of the world will affect this country but it is ludicrous to suggest there is no way for us to tackle our problems until the recession in Europe or America is at an end.  Basically <Col N="886" /> this State and its economy is under developed. The chorus I mentioned about our pricing ourselves out of jobs and out of export markets is raised on the basis that workers who are looking for a reasonable standard of living have destroyed jobs.  I should like here to quote from a pamphlet recently published entitled <i>Jobs and Wages, the True Story of Competitiveness.</i> This pamphlet was published by a group of socialist economists in May 1982.  At page 11 it is stated:</P>
    <P>In recent years the other non-wage factors in competitiveness have been receiving more and more attention from international experts and management executives.  The business management approach to competitiveness recognises the cost of productivity and its effect on prices are not the main influence on competitive ability and profitability.</P>
    <P>It gives some quotations on this.</P>
    <P>The European Management Forum in a Report on the Competitiveness of European Industry 1980 strongly warns against such crude labour cost theories.  It says competitiveness is not a one dimensional concept.  In the market place buyers will weigh price advantage against poor quality or a lack of after sales service and so on. The notion that competitiveness might be reduced to consideration of costs and productivity is thus a dangerous one.</P>
    <P>The report has a much more comprehensive definition of competitiveness than the crude single factor ones of the costobsessed Irish business leaders and the conservative economists:</P>
    <P>Industrial competitiveness is a measure of the immediate and future ability of industrialists to design, produce and market goods whose various price and non price additives combine to form a more attractive package than those of similar products offered by competition. The final judge of competitiveness is thus the market place.</P>
    <P>That is a clear indication, if not in Ireland at least in Europe, that business and management <Col N="887" /> experience are not blinded by this simplistic approach that pay rises result in a loss of jobs.  No one argues that wage costs have not a bearing upon competitiveness.  But it is both ridiculous and simplistic for business interests and Government spokesmen to imply, as they have been implying in the past few weeks, that each time the worker seeks a miserable wage increase he is increasing the dole queue.  That is nonsense.  The form I mentioned earlier lists ten principal factors of competitiveness, but wage costs is not even one of those.  The total cost of production and industrial efficiency are listed as one factor and wage costs are but one aspect of that.  If the Government are serious about employment and about organising this economy, they must get off their hobby horse and stop implying that the working class, the people with jobs, are the ones who are causing job losses.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party stand alone in this House in offering a comprehensive and positive alternative to the hairshirt economic policies of both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  In October last our party produced a document entitled <i>An End to the Crisis.</i> This is based on the central principle that the massive economic challenge facing the country can be solved only by determined resolve on the part of the Government to increase by way of a production plan national production in industry, in agriculture and in new technology fields.  The plans produced to date by the present Government and by their predecessors &mdash; indeed this goes also for every Government since the foundation of this State &mdash; have been spending plans born from the economics of despair and based on the indefensible proposal that we can deflate ourselves out of the recession. No one denies that tough action is needed to get us out of the economic mess, a mess produced by the free enterprise policies of the conservative parties; but that tough action must be directed towards the productive sector and in particular towards the private industrial sector, and towards the farmers as well as by way of a broadly-based mobilisation of the State agencies and State companies. <Col N="888" /> The week-kneed and callous approach of taking measures only against the unemployed and those who have jobs, as well as against the elderly, the sick and the homeless, would not be necessary if the emphasis was on raising national income rather than cutting expenditure.</P>
    <P>We argue that full employment is the demand of this society, but none of the people who has spoken so far this morning has put forward proposals or suggestions as to how that aim can be achieved. What we are talking about in this context is a massive challenge, but with the necessary will the Government could succeed in that regard.  It is the responsibility of each of us here to address ourselves to that challenge.  It is not enough to talk about what has been done or about stabilising employment.  We must talk about the achievement of full employment, an objective that we believe to be both realistic and realisable.  We have not even begun to use our potential for industrialisation so far as our indigenous resources &mdash; agriculture, forestry, fisheries and minerals &mdash; are concerned.  We are an underdeveloped economy in many ways.</P>
    <P>Ours is also a low-wage economy.  I would refer again to the document from which I quoted earlier which indicates that our wage rates are the lowest in the EEC.  To those who would say that low wage rates represent the only means of creating employment, I would point to those many countries in the world whose wage rates would shock even the most conservative of our industrialists; but these countries do not have full employment either.  In this low-wage economy of ours we are trying to compete in assembly-type industries with lowerwage developing economies in the Third World.  This is particularly true of the industrial revolution in the electronics industry.  Our aim should be to reach the top of the market in specialised areas, but to be successful in that regard we must have highly-trained and highlyskilled workers backed up by the best research and development services and marketing organisation.  The market in this area is so huge and growing so fast <Col N="889" /> that a gain of only ½ per cent of the European market in the next decade would result in this State earning one billion dollars annually from the high technology industry.  But in addition to earning this money we would be helping our balance of payments and providing increased employment.  We would also be assisting in the increased efficiency of all our other industries by being first and best in the electronics field.</P>
    <P>There are two areas I should like to deal with specifically in relation to job creation.  One is the question of meat processing.  This morning we saw a large number of workers from the meat industry protesting outside the gates of this House about job losses.  One of the leaflets they were handing out explained that the reason for the workers taking this action this morning was to protest at the fact that more than 129,000 cattle were exported live so far this year to create jobs in Britain and elsewhere, but each week between 3,500 and 4,500 cattle are moved from the Republic to Northern Ireland, a quantity sufficient to keep two large factories in operation.  The leaflet referred also the IMP in Leixlip having laid off 400 workers, to Premier Meats in Sallins laying off 250 workers and to the fact that Kildare Chilling Company have their 150 workers on a two-day week. This is a disgraceful situation in a country which prides itself on the fertility of its land and on the excellence of its agricultural produce.  To argue that jobs cannot be created and that we are at a time when we must educate for leisure, while at the same time some of our natural resources are being exported raw, is not to put the situation fairly.  In addition to the export of live cattle, I refer also to the export of timber and of minerals taken from the ground in County Meath.  There is the disgrace, too, of the importation of food at a time when most of the land is unproductive. We read in the papers today of the ridiculous spectacle of farmers going to Greenore to destroy food, the importation of which they object to, while at the same time they have failed to produce the food that will keep the processing factories working full time, when they have failed to produce the food the housewives <Col N="890" /> are prepared to buy.  The Dutch potatoes that are being imported are up to £2 dearer in the shops than are the Irish-produced potatoes, but the Irish housewife is prepared to pay the extra amount.  Instead of so gallantly destroying the consignment of Dutch potatoes, our farmers would serve the country better by finding out why their produce is not acceptable and why it is that housewives are willing to pay more for an imported product.  The answer they will find is that what they are producing is not up to standard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson said he could not understand why it was that food was being imported when we could grow it here, why it was that processing factories have failed.  The reason they have failed is because the farming community have refused to supply these factories when there was more money to be got from selling in the open market.  The farmers have consistently over the years refused to fulfil contracts they made with processing factories.  I do not lay all the blame at the door of farmers.  They, like every other sector, are presumably anxious to maximise their income.  The blame must fall on the shoulders of the Government, not just this Government but also previous Governments, for failing to tackle the question of how the land of this country is utilised, how it is controlled and how it is abused.  Because of the power of the farming vote they were afraid to tackle the problem of utilisation of land.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach this morning indicated that they were going to take tough measures against the vested interests and he lumped the workers among those vested interests.  He also mentioned people who control land and resources and abused them or failed to use them.  I wait with bated breath to hear what proposals he has to deal with those vested interests other than the working class.  The present Government have shown clearly what they intend to do in relation to the workers.  They have cut their living standards. They are trying to force them to accept wage increases which are away below the cost of living increase.  I am waiting to find out what the Government intend to do with the land speculators <Col N="891" /> and the industrialists who continue to fail to reinvest, what they intend to do with the farmers who sit on land and refuse to develop it or to use it in any way.  I would like to know what the Government intend to do with the financial institutions which invest abroad and refuse to invest in industrial development and who hand out money willy-nilly for investment in land speculation and office blocks.  I hope the Government, when replying, will outline some of the steps they intend to take against the people who make the decisions which are losing jobs, the people who actually control the economy, to make sure that they use the power they have to develop this economy.  Unless the Government take measures to plan the economy, and not just set down nice targets which they would like to see realised, and ensure that all sections of this economy comply with this plan, we will be debating here in a year or in two years' time and there will be 300,000 unemployed.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed with the contribution made by Deputy Lenihan.  The most he seemed to be able to offer was an early warning system and he mentioned in passing import substitution. The most extraordinary thing I picked up from Deputy Wilson was that, while he advocated wealth distribution, he went on to explain that what he meant by this was work sharing.  In other words, he wants those of us who are working for a week's wages to share with those who do not have a week's wages, which is fine provided also that those who earn their living from investments, from profits and from speculation are also made to share their wealth.  The tax campaign which has been in progress indicates that the working class are not satisfied that this Government or previous Governments have made any effort to ensure that those who have wealth will share it.</P>
    <P>The notion that job sharing, work experience, early retirement or a shorter working week will cure the unemployment problem is unrealistic and does not come to terms with the basic fact that this economy is under-developed.  Governments to date have committed themselves <Col N="892" /> to encouraging private enterprise, and private enterprise has failed.  They must move away from that policy and they must insist that, if incentives are being given to private enterprise, productivity and re-investment must be part of the return.  They must insist that no more grants are given to any sector, whether the farming sector or the industrial sector, unless those incentives are tied to proper planning and management of the enterprise into which the money is put.  Work sharing and so on are temporary stop gaps which will not solve the unemployment problem.  The development of our resources and the proper planned investment of the wealth of this country in job creation is the only solution.</P>

      <P>I must express my amazement at the opening speech by the Opposition spokesman, Deputy Lenihan, who castigated the Government for inactivity and said there was not political leadership and that there was a lack of management in Government.  While I do not think it is a good thing to become involved in that type of debate it behoves us to remind Deputy Lenihan that it is only a few short years ago since a Minister in his party was reported as saying that if full employment was not achieved in a given time it would be necessary to dig holes in the road to provide people with jobs.  Three years later that man had resigned and the holes were in the roads and the Government did not have sufficient funds to fill them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an obvious indictment of the policies now suggested to be pursued. The House should consider what might happen if the policies which were pursued over the last five years were continued over the next five years.  We would have the same scale of borrowing, the same <Col N="893" /> scale of job losses and the same mismanagement. If that continued the situation would be disastrous.</P>
    <P>I, like all politicians, am seriously concerned about unemployment.  The unemployed are looking to politicians for the leadership which will give them not only the jobs but also confidence in the future. If they do not have that confidence there is a grave danger that our political system will break down.  Previous speakers referred to job losses in the meat processing area.  In my constituency in Kildare we had a litany of job losses, Cill Dara Spinning, Navan Carpets, Irish Meat Packers, Donaldsons of Celbridge, Ardagh Trailers in Celbridge, Trailer Manufacturers in Naas, Kildare Wallpapers and so on.  All this has happened over the last 18 months and in the last few days we had the announcement of the Black &amp; Decker closure.  It is imperative that we as politicians unite to put forward some constructive proposals which will arrest the decline in the numbers of people out of work and at the same time we should generate the confidence which is necessary to bring about that situation.</P>
    <P>Various people have put forward solutions to these problems.  Deputy De Rossa seems to want a greater involvement by the public sector in the wealth generating areas.  This would be further economic madness.  If we look at the public sector and its efficiency and production over the last couple of years we could ask ourselves serious questions about whether or not we should consider taking money from taxpayers to allow it to be spent in the same fashion.  Any Government embarking on such a policy could only be castigated and annihilated by the electorate.  We must have industry which is efficient, capable of paying its own way and contributing something to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Despite what the last speaker said, we all represent workers, as we are elected by the masses of people most of whom are workers.  A large proportion of the electorate in my constituency are workers and as their representative it is my duty to put forward constructive policies which will ensure that workers' interests <Col N="894" /> are considered by the Government.  If that means harnessing the private sector and encouraging it to take the necessary risks to provide jobs, we must do that. That is the only way out of the situation. There is no point in saying that the State should become involved to a greater extent and that the State should be involved in wealth-generating areas and in nationalisation.  That policy was pursued by various Governments throughout Europe and it has failed.  We should create a climate which will encourage the private sector to become involved in relieving unemployment.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the importation of potatoes.  What the producers in this case have been trying to do is to organise a quality grading and marketing situation which will benefit the housewife, but their efforts are being frustrated by people who have other interests and who see fit to import potatoes legally and illegally to distort the market and create a situation which will ultimately undermine the producers' position and which will give the housewife a poorer choice.</P>
    <P>We must now depend on agriculture to bring about an improvement in our economy and a dramatic improvement in the jobs situation.  In relation to meat and food processing, I hope measures will be taken by the present Government to ensure that every opportunity is availed of to recover job losses and to create new jobs.  We require a tough and aggressive policy on negotiations at EEC level.  Our Minister for Agriculture should bring to the attention of the British Minister for Agriculture in particular, the necessity to remove some of the anomalies that exist in relation to meat processing here.  I refer to the variable slaughtering premiums and to the fact that this seriously militates against both the Irish producer and the Irish meat processing worker. The Government should take steps to bring about the re-opening of the meat plants which have been mentioned already in County Kildare, in Leixlip and in Sallins.  The Government should also try to ensure the return to full-time working of the Kildare Chilling Company. This area has been beset with unemployment and job losses during the last number <Col N="895" /> of years and it is unfortunate that this area is once again affected.  This area of work should have a reasonable degree of efficiency; it is long established, it should be highly developed and the raw materials are available.</P>
    <P>Some other speakers say that the cause of the problem is that too many live cattle are being exported.  I do not agree with that.  Some years ago the producers had to beg to get their cattle admitted to some of those factories.  A monopoly existed and no attempt was made to facilitate the producers.  The producers have long memories.  I should like to point out that fewer live cattle were exported last year than any year since 1979.  All the blame does not rest with those who are exporting live.  Obviously, there is a need for greater efficiency in some of the plants I have mentioned and I am sure the Minister is aware of the need for more efficient operation.  I hope he will do what he can to restore the jobs that were lost in that industry recently and see to it that the families of the workers concerned are looked after.</P>
    <P>The Government have a great responsibility in regard to unemployment but they have been in office for approximately five months and they should not be expected to produce the dramatic results Deputy Lenihan suggested.  Having regard to the record of the Fianna Fáil Government I do not think that even he would expect the results he is seeking. In the infrastructural area, as the Minister for Labour mentioned earlier, there is the possibility of creating more jobs by getting private enterprise to build new roads, bridges and so on.  We are all aware of the big number of people on the local authority housing lists and the fact that it has been impossible for such bodies to house them.  For that reason the time has come when we should ask the private sector to become involved in building such houses which should be made available for sale to approved Housing Finance Agency loan applicants. That would have a dramatic effect on our unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>There should be further encouragement for small industries.  The time has <Col N="896" /> long passed when there should be some type of emergency employment relief scheme introduced involving projects of an environmental nature, the restoration of public buildings, the development of open spaces, anemity area development, the development of canals, public parks and so on.  In those areas local authorities have not the resources to deal with such matters but if a scheme was introduced along the lines of the youth employment scheme it would be possible to provide much needed employment in the areas I have mentioned.  The most important matter that I as a consumer am concerned about is the need for more patriotism. Many speakers have mentioned that it is possible to buy products manufactured throughout the world here.  It is unfortunate that domestic and commercial consumers pass by products manufactured here, preferring foreign manufactured goods.  We have also the dumping here of clothing manufactured abroad.  In some cases labels are changed abroad and labels stating that the products were manufactured here are substituted.  That is dumping.  We seem to ignore that the most important area of patriotism is to support our own industries but for the sake of a few pence we seem to support foreign industries to the detriment of our own.</P>

      <P>Naturally, I am disappointed that a time limit has been imposed on this debate because the need for an economic climate to create jobs is our greatest problem.  We have never experienced in our history greater despondency on the part of the unemployed. The unemployed look to the House more in despair than in hope seeking a solution to their plight.  It is unfortunate that this despondency has been created here.  It is the duty of the Taoiseach, <Col N="897" /> and the Government, to show the way forward, to provide encouragement and hope for our people.  It is regrettable that has not been the case but even at this late stage I hope we can indicate to our people that it is possible for us to overcome the recession if we can all pull our weight.  It is for that reason that I do not wish to be seen to be making a political contribution on this debate.</P>
      <P>The extreme monetarist policies being pursued by the Government have contributed to our problems.  I can understand the economic reason behind such policies but the objective of those policies is being seriously undermined by the increasing demand on State resources to support a rapidly growing number of unemployed.  Whatever economic gain there may be in pursuing such a policy is being seriously eroded.  In the course of the budget debate, and in the debate on the Finance Bill, the Minister for Finance has stated that his objective is to bring the public finances under control but that that objective is being undermined.  That is also the opinion of economic commentators. It makes better economic sense to subsidise employment by keeping potentially viable factories going than to pay from public funds benefits to workers who are laid off in such factories.  I am not advocating such a policy as an acceptable long-term objective for industrial development.  As far as possible our industry should be self-supporting and competitive and in this regard we have a lot of ground to make up at all levels.</P>
      <P>Part of the problem is that we have not faced up to this reality before now.  We are now paying a high price in terms of economic and human losses.  I am pleased that the last speaker dealt with an area which deserves greater support by our people, that is, the need to purchase the produce of and output from Irish factories. The slogan &ldquo;Do not import unemployment&rdquo; is very true and relevant.  We pay a lot of lip service to patriotism, but real patriotism is our commitment to support and work for improved economic conditions so that all our people can enjoy a decent standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the right time to abandon ailing and depressed industries.  Many <Col N="898" /> industries have cost the Exchequer millions of pounds and could survive in a more favourable economic climate.  We should assist each of these to survive in the improved economic climate, of which there is already evidence throughout America and Europe at present.  Our policy should be to support and sustain our original investment in those industries so as to maximise the benefits which will come with the rising economic tide as the economy recovers.  It is vital that we are poised for that recovery and that we are not left with a skeleton of abandoned and dead industries from which to commence our recovery.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on foreign industrialists who have benefited from State assistance and from a manufacturing base, which we were pleased to provide, to share and carry part of the recession we are going through at present.  We have too many examples of such firms taking the easy option of safeguarding their firm economic base at the expense of the nation which helped them to consolidate that base in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I have said on many occasions that we have not maintained a fair balance between productive industry and public sector employment.  I still hold that view. The answer does not lie in the negative attitude of cutting back in the public sector but rather in the implementation of a productive job creation plan where productive employment can be increased through industrial and agricultural development. Instead of encouraging productivity some recent Government measures, particularly in relation to VAT, have discouraged production.  The emphasis should be on value added and not on taxing value added &mdash; in other words, we should place the emphasis on generating economic activity where productive employment can expand.</P>
    <P>With regard to industrial development our priorities were originally wrongly based.  We should have developed our industrial base using our natural resources &mdash; agriculture, horticulture and forestry.  As previous speakers said, we have failed miserably in the area of food processing and as a nation have not benefited <Col N="899" /> from our greatest national resource, the land.  I was interested to hear the comments of the previous speaker in relation to the importation of potatoes and the fact that a large consignment of potatoes was destroyed at one of our ports last night.  I cannot agree with his sentiments when he said farmers and horticulturists here have not produced the goods the Irish housewife requires.  I know many farmers and horticulturists who produce high quality goods.  They bring them to the Dublin market properly packed and prepared, but because of the large vested interest syndicates who operate there they find their produce is given second place as regards sales.  It is in that kind of situation that they found it necessary last night to board the ship in Dundalk and take action.</P>

      <P>As regards forestry, if one talks to a forester he will tell one that this area has a great potential for employment.  Many men could be employed in the planting of trees and in the processing of timber. However we are told that there is not sufficient money to create that kind of productive employment.  On the other side of the coin, the Department of Social Welfare seems to have a bottomless source of finance from which to meet the day to day payments of our unemployed work force.  Surely it should be within the competence of those who work in the Department and the various Ministers to co-ordinate the activities of both Departments and transfer from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Forestry and, indeed, the Department of the Environment, the money which is paid out weekly from public funds. Unless we have the political courage and will to tackle this problem we will not make any kind of real progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> I am a bit frustrated that my line of thought has been upset by lack of time. At present the Minister for Labour has a proposal from a small group in County Laois who have put up local community money to put unemployed people to work in the area.  They have requested the Department to supplement the local contribution to the amount of the unemployment assistance which is now being paid.  That is a positive proposal from a community which could be developed and expanded.  It would go some way towards resolving the massive unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The importation of industrial raw material is the greatest source of unemployment.  An industry in which I worked at one time make doors and windows, all high class joinery products.  Now we import these products from Taiwan and other countries and this is posing great hardship on the manufacturers of similar products here.</P>
      <P>In the constituency which I represent we had a factory, Snia Ireland Ltd., which up to last August employed 380 people.  Then the 380 were asked to take six weeks holidays.  They took their holidays but not one of them has gone back to work.  Unfortunately this has not been brought to the attention of the House.  I should like to know why those people were asked to take their holidays and then why work was not made available to them since.</P>
      <P>What we should be doing in the House, instead of Shadow Ministers shouting across at Ministers and <i>vice versa</i>, is trying to get together to work out the best possible way to solve the unemployment problem.  Shouting across the floor of the House will not solve anything.  We should all get together to try to find ways to take the thousands of people out of the dole queues.  The most frustrating thing for a man used to going to work is to be put on the dole for months or perhaps years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Durkan refer to patriotism here.  If we had true patriotism we would be buying Irish and in that way we would be providing many more jobs for our people.  If we go into <Col N="901" /> shops or supermarkets we will find them full of imported goods which we are capable of producing here.  I would ask the Minister to do what he can about doors and windows being imported from Taiwan and elsewhere, materials that we could produce here, and of much higher quality.  That was my type of work and I know that the imported products are not half as good as the doors we can produce here.</P>

      <P>To listen to the Opposition in this debate &mdash; with the exception of the last two, who were very constructive &mdash; one would be forgiven for forgetting that the Opposition party, and I am thinking particularly of Deputy Lenihan, had been in Government for 56 of the last 69 months.</P>
      <P>One might also be forgiven for forgetting that the high costs that are so much a feature of current industrial problems derive directly from decisions taken in their period of office.  There were decisions to set a record of weakness in setting appropriate standards in wage negotiation; decisions to intervene to get employers to pay more than they could really afford, or had intended to; decisions to increase State borrowing, the interest on which is the major cause of current high tax levels, which are a large part of industrial problems; decisions to impose the ill-conceived tax regime of VAT at point of entry which caused many tax-flow problems for industry.</P>
      <P>This is the industrial record of Deputy Lenihan and his colleagues, against which his current effusion of bombastic rhetoric ought to be judged.</P>
      <P>I turn now to what this Government are doing to tackle this problem.  We have strengthened Government activity in the industrial rescue area, as a result of which 2,481 jobs have been saved by various State agencies in the first four months of this year as against 1,619 in the first four months of 1982 by IDA and Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are launching through the IDA a major national campaign to assist in starting new businesses.  This is backed up by seminars all over the country, TV advertisements, <Col N="902" /> and the opening up of a new late opening advice centre in Dublin for people with product ideas who might set up on their own.  We have reversed the worst effects of the ill-advised VAT at point of import regime.  We are undertaking a major overhaul of our industrial incentives.  We want value for money. We want flexible aid that helps each firm in the way it needs it most, not rigid schemes tied to capital investments.  This may mean beefing up management, marketing, quality control or any number of other key features rather than putting money into a new machine or such things.</P>
    <P>We intend to close this gap between industry and new technology.  We have brought the National Board for Science and Technology, together with the IDA, under one Minister, where they always should have been, so that there will be proper integration of the results of modern technology and its application in the industrial field.</P>
    <P>We are setting out to fight at European level the protectionist threat to our markets by some major European countries. This matter will be raised by the Taoiseach at the highest level at the forthcoming European Summit at Stuttgart.</P>
    <P>We are taking steps to unleash the potential of our food industry which is being eroded by unnecessary imports. Recent speakers have referred to this. The Minister for Agriculture has set up a top level group to examine the cause of food imports, and I intend to have discussions with him to see how the industrial development side of the food industry can be properly integrated with farm levels of production.  Lack of supplies to our factories, which are causing demonstrations and redundancies at present, could be overcome if there were long term contracts between meat processors and farmers which would be legally binding on both sides as to price and supply. These would help to eliminate the cause of redundancies.  We do not need to adopt radical measures, simply to encourage the making of contracts which would be honoured by all sides, thus setting a firm foundation for long term marketing strategies in the food industry.</P>
    <P>We have restored the incentive to <Col N="903" /> work, despite opposition from Fianna Fáil, through the changes in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>In the 1982 budget we provided a tax incentive scheme for worker shareholding in industry which will bridge the artificial gap which often exists between workers and management and help eliminate the cause of restrictive labour practices which sometimes strangle healthy industries to death.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan referred in this debate to Dáil reform and suggested it was taking up too much of my time.  First of all I assert, without fear of contradiction, that many of the problems now faced by Irish industry, and many of the job losses now taking place, derive directly from a lack of reality in this House about public spending and taxation.  Unless we get our house in order we have no business telling other people how they should organise their business, whether it be in the trade union movement or in industry itself.</P>
    <P>Secondly, practically the only time I have spent on Dáil reform in recent weeks has been chasing Deputy Lenihan's colleagues to get them to respond in any way to detailed proposals the Government made to them, in the hope of getting a measure of consensus on the subject.  Thirdly, the proposals we have made will directly help the environment for job creation.  By setting up a committee on public expenditure we will be helping to create a cross-party consensus to remove the cause of high tax levels, and by setting up a special committee on small businesses we will help to get something done on a lasting basis.  That sector of the economy, which has been most successful in protecting and creating jobs, is the best means of promoting indigenous Irish enterprise.</P>
    <P>It is out of small businesses that major Irish export corporations will grow.  The majority of the most successful corporations in the United States and on the continent were started by people who were self-employed.  It was the self-employed who became small employers who gradually became larger employers, and who set up businesses which could sell goods competitively anywhere in the <Col N="904" /> world.  Industries grow and countries prosper.  That is something we should constantly remember and I intend to focus maximum attention on it in order to promote a spirit of enterprise.  I believe that through the committee on small businesses we will get a consensus on methods to help small businesses.  I will be undertaking trips to certain parts of the country to get this message across, encouraging people who have ideas to put them into practice, and talking to the IDA so that they can help create jobs.  I will be visiting Deputy Hyland's constituency in the relatively near future.</P>

      <P>Reference was made by Opposition speakers to what they described as the monetarist policies of this Government. Nothing could be further from the truth. I would like to recollect the contents of <i>The Way Forward.</i> In that document Fianna Fáil said if they were in office they would have a current budget deficit of £750 million as against the £900 million we have in this budget.  In other words, they would be taking not just the present amount of tax out of the economy or imposing the present restrictions on public spending, but a further £150 million would have to be found either by way of reductions in expenditure or by increases in taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not come sincerely from the Opposition to be criticising restrictive budgetary policies in this <Col N="905" /> regard when their own policies would have taken a further £150 million out of people's pockets this year.  In my view, there is no foundation for talk from the Fianna Fáil benches about a climate of despair.  I believe there is every ground to be confident about our future in the industrial field.  This is not a party point; it is something about which all parties can feel a measure of satisfaction.  Last year our industrial products grew by about 13 per cent in a world market which was contracting by about ½ per cent.  Irish industry was beating the world trend in terms of gaining a share of the export market, despite many of the handicaps they have to work under in terms of high costs and various restrictions.  Our industry was able to give a much better industrial export performance than most of its competitors in Europe.  That underlines the basic health of our economy and the inherent strength of the enterprise sector. The majority of these export gains were made by foreign-owned industries established here.  We are inclined to criticise foreign-owned industry.  Let us not lose our sense of proportion.  There are 80,000 jobs in foreign owned industries, and there are 800 foreign firms in this economy exporting more than £4,500 million worth of goods.  What would be our export position or our balance of payments position if we did not have the contributions those industries make? While we should criticise bad or hasty decisions made by foreign industries &mdash; or bad decisions made by anyone &mdash; we should not lose our sense of proportion or lose sight of the major contribution made by these enterprises to our economy.</P>
      <P>Let us recollect the many successes there are in Irish industry.  Look at the success of Baileys Irish Cream which has 80 per cent of the world market in cream liqueurs.  This industry located in Virginia, County Cavan, is dominating the world market.  Other countries are producing imitations pretending they are as good if not better that the Irish product. Let us not forget what we can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us recollect the successes of the Irish cheese industry.  They have developed new forms of cheese to sell on the <Col N="906" /> European market to meet new consumer tastes.  Let us look at our successful industries and learn from what they are able to do in adverse circumstances.  Let us look at the success of the Irish farm machinery exporting group set up under the aegis of Córas Tráchtála.  They got together and produced a brochure showing a wide range of farm machinery suiting almost any need which can be produced here for the export market.  This was a co-operative endeavour by a large number of firms which previously had been operating in competition with one another.  They have come together and succeeded.</P>
    <P>Look at the Irish knitwear group.  That is a sector of the economy where one would say they are bound to meet difficulties because it could be argued that people in Taiwan and elsewhere would have a competitive advantage.  The Irish knitwear group got together and presented a package of a wide range of goods which can be produced here.  These firms are co-operating and gaining new markets.</P>
    <P>Another success story in the textile group is the Irish fashion group set up under the aegis of the Irish Goods Council.  They got together to market Irish fashion goods at home and abroad and they are regaining the share of the Irish market for these goods.  This shows we can produce the best designed products to quality and to time.</P>
    <P>I believe it is very important that we get together to reform this House.  We should share what we have and in this way contribute to the economy.  Let us start by looking at what is good, such as our successes in the marketing of food, textile goods, farm machinery and so on, and apply what we can learn from them to other parts of our ecomony which have not been so successful.  That is the proper approach to adopt.</P>
    <P>Having got all the criticism off their chests during this debate, I hope all Members will co-operate through the new committees to create an environment in which Irish industry can succeed and Irish jobs can be created.  We should develop an aggressive market approach based on <Col N="907" /> selling our goods as the best quality on the European market and get on with the job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together. British-Irish relations suffered last year because of differences of view between our predecessors in office and the British Government.  The Government, on taking office, considered it to be in the interest of both countries and particularly in the interest of peace and reconciliation in this country, that relations should be restored to the state they were in when we were previously in office.  To this end, a number of meetings have taken place at ministerial level.  I met the British Prime Minister in Brussels on 22 March and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in Dublin on 5 May.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on two occasions and has also met the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.  As Deputies will be aware, it is not customary to disclose details of confidential <Col N="908" /> discussions of this nature.  I can say, however, that during these meetings and on all other appropriate occasions, our views on all aspects of developments in and relating to Northern Ireland were made known.  I can also say that I am satisfied that, despite any individual unhelpful incident, much progress has been made towards restoring the former relationship.</P>
      <P>The Government have also initiated discussions among party leaders which have led to the establishment of the Forum within which there are to be consultations on the manner in which lasting peace and stability can be achieved in a new Ireland through the democratic process.  It is the intention that the Forum will report before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>I envisage that, building on the progress we have and will continue to make in restoring relations between the two sovereign Governments and on the work of the Forum, we can and shall, at the opportune time, follow up with the British Government the agreement we reached when I met with the British Prime Minister in November 1981.  As the Deputy will recall, both sides then indicated that they were ready to join in promoting arrangements to diminish the divisions between the two sections of the community in Northern Ireland and to reconcile the two major traditions that exist in the two parts of Ireland.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy is incorrect in suggesting that an agreement was made on 6 November 1981 to meet twice a year. There was no decision then to vary the agreement in the report of one of the Joint Study Groups that meetings at Heads of Government level would take place once or twice in the year in accordance with which a further meeting was then proposed for spring 1982, although this did not, in fact, take place for reasons that the Deputy is in a better position to assess than I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions which I have put down seeking specific information on a number of points, I regret that the Taoiseach has not dealt with.  First, may I ask if he recalls during the course of the general election that he said that <Col N="909" /> a complete and radical rethinking of British policy is now needed and needed quickly if the situation is to be retrieved from a drift towards chaos?  I recall him saying that it must be the purpose and the prime objective of the Government elected to office on 14 December next to secure from the British Government a recognition of the need for such a radical revision of its policy while there is yet time to save the situation.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell me in a few short words what precisely he has done since taking office to implement that election promise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined some of the action taken by the Government in a responsible, carefully judged approach towards the resolution of the problem.  In contrast with the position last year, we are now moving in the right direction and useful progress has been made in the course of generally positive and constructive discussions.  The groundwork has been laid.  Of course, it became increasingly clear from the time that the Government took office that a British general election was in prospect and it would have been naive to expect significant developments in British policy on this side of the election, which has now been announced.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of the Forum and when the British election is over, the question of Northern Ireland can be pursued with the British Government in a new context, with a view to securing progress, which is urgently necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that the words he used were &ldquo;securing from the British Government a complete and radical rethinking of British policy&rdquo;.  Can he not agree with me that such a radical rethinking of British policy in regard to Northern Ireland has not taken place and to that extent is he prepared to agree that that particular election promise which he gave is just another instance of a broken promise by him arising out of the last general election campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="910" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do agree about the time.  The fact that the British election was impending has clearly made it impractical to expect that the British Government would review their position in regard to Northern Ireland in the closing months of their period in office.  Our efforts have been directed towards preparing the ground for a new and better relationship with the British Government which would make it possible for us to build an all-sided hope, as a result of the Forum, to enter into discussions with them in due course, which I hope will lead to a revision of their policy, the need for which I am as convinced of as when I made that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach must agree with me that when he made this promise during the course of the election campaign last year, he was as well aware then of the position with regard to the British general election as he is now.  I hope he would agree with me that it is a little naive to expect the House to accept that he gave that promise during the general election without regard to the position in respect of the British general election. However, I would like to move on to a Supplementary Question arising out of my Question No. 2.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to us, even in broad terms, what specifically he put to the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 5 May? I accept that the discussions are confidential, but I am entitled to ask the Taoiseach &mdash; and I do not think that it would be any breach of confidentiality on his part &mdash; to tell me what were the specific points in regard to the British Government policy in Northern Ireland which he put to the Secretary of State on 5 May?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, in fact, be contrary to practice because the question of the points under discussion is confidential. It would also not be in the interests of achieving the objectives which all have in mind if I were to indicate the subject under discussion at a particular meeting.  That position is one which the previous Government also upheld and all Governments have upheld and must uphold who are concerned to achieve <Col N="911" /> actual progress, as distinct from making use of a headline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that he is on public record as saying that the present Northern Ireland Assembly has fatal flaws in its Constitution and that his view in that regard is supported by the Minister for Foreign Affairs who said that it does not represent a satisfactory political movement.  In view of these two public statements by himself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, could he tell the House whether, on the occasion of meeting the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland he made those points to him, or did he raise at that meeting at all the question of the Assembly of Northern Ireland and its defects and did he consider putting the point of view to him that it should be wound up as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to be drawn on the question of what matters were discussed, for the reasons I have given and the Deputy knows that I will not be drawn.  I do not propose to comment further on that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Assembly, the defects are not as much in the Assembly itself as in the failure to make provision in connection with the Assembly that would have made possible the emergence, on the one hand, of a power-sharing administration and, on the other hand, of recognition of the identity of the minority community in Northern Ireland. There are broader issues at stake, as the Deputy is well aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must take it from what the Taoiseach is saying that again he did not follow up, in discussion with the Northern Secretary of State, the policy which he and his Minister for Foreign Affairs have outlined in regard to the Northern Ireland Assembly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, may I ask the Taoiseach to give us a clear and frank statement about the position in regard to a meeting between himself and the British Prime Minister.  I ask him to recall that in November 1981 it was apparently agreed <Col N="912" /> between himself and the British Prime Minister that meetings would take place at regular intervals.  My impression at the time was that it would be twice a year, but I am prepared to accept that at least once a year and possibly twice a year was what was agreed.  Can he tell us now what is the position in regard to these meetings? Was a meeting sought either directly or indirectly, was the possibility of a meeting sounded out even at diplomatic level, or are we to take it that the British Government's position is that these matters are to be dictated entirely in the interests of British politics, which is indeed the historic position in so far as most British Governments are concerned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the position is that the arrangement which I had entered into &mdash; which indeed involved a meeting foreshadowed for spring of 1982 &mdash; broke down because of the change of Government and the handling of events by the Deputy and his Government.  Our job is to restore the relationship and to recreate the situation in which meetings will take place of the kind the Deputy has referred to once or twice a year.  We are working towards that.  It takes some time to undo the damage done without adequate thought in 1982.  We have had to have regard also to the fact that the British election has been impending during this period.  No meeting has been sought, no soundings made. It was our decision that, given the position we inherited, we should proceed by developing contacts along the lines we have and through informal meetings until after the British election, until the situation has developed where there would then be a Government in both these countries with a term of office of four years jointly ahead of them, two Governments which over that period of time could tackle this problem consistently, coherently and taking a long-term view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach be prepared to accept from me the view that the Irish public are getting a bit fed up with his apparent answer to everything in this country that is wrong, which is to blame <Col N="913" /> it on his predecessors?  Would he accept from me a suggestion that the people would be anxious to hear from him, on the odd occasion at least, some constructive suggestion as to what he is going to do himself as distinct from blaming his predecessors in office for everything except perhaps the bad weather we are having at present?  Would he then agree with me that, in regard to his election promise to secure from the British Government a redical re-think of policy in regard to Northern Ireland, his specific statements of dissatisfaction with the Northern Ireland Assembly, his apparent failure to secure a meeting with the British Prime Minister since he came into office, despite his implicit undertaking that he would do so, that in all these areas practically everything he has said about his policy in regard to Northern Ireland is a total failure and he has kept none of his promises in regard to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I reject all that propaganda the Deputy is producing as nonsense.  It is true that the people are fed up with our predecessors in office. Certainly the damage done to Anglo-Irish relations during 1982 is a matter of deep regret to people right across the political divide regardless of party.  That damage has to be undone.  It is being undone and, from 9 June next, there will be in office in Britain, a Government which I hope will have a majority, as we have, with a term of office of five years ahead of them, and we will have a term of office of four-and-a-half years ahead of us.  During that period we will jointly tackle these problems with a view to achieving real progress which has not hitherto been achieved over the years for a variety of reasons, by no means all the fault of Irish Governments of one or other complexion.  But we now have the chance, and will have the chance to make progress and achieve a radical change in the position over that period of four-and-a-half years when the two Governments will be in office together.  Our planning is directed towards that.  Our plans have included the establishment of the Forum.  We believe that, with the co-operation of the Opposition, out of that <Col N="914" /> will emerge constructive elements which may be useful in the development of both the Anglo-Irish relationship, and working towards a resolution of the Northern Ireland problem during the four years that will follow the conclusion of the work of the Forum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the difficult situation facing the hotel industry in Ireland.  Both the Minister and I have met with representatives of the industry to discuss their problems.  As the Deputy is now aware, the Government in the recent Finance Bill make provision for a reduction in the VAT rate chargeable on accommodation provided by hotels from 23 per cent to 18 per cent from 1 May 1983.  This provision has been warmly welcomed by the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism the steps he proposes to take this year to maintain the tourist industry's competitiveness in relation to other destinations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that Board Fáilte have been provided with a current expenditure allocation of £21.258 million in 1983 as a means of assisting the tourism industry and of contributing towards maintaining its competitive position.  This provision represents an additional £3.131 million on the board's 1982 allocation and gives a substantial increase in real terms for tourism promotional activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent Finance Bill has also provided for a reduction in the VAT rate chargeable on accommodation provided by hotels, guesthouses, hostels, holiday camps, motels and camping sites from 23 per cent to 18 per cent from 1 May 1983. In addition, the Government have cushioned other sectors of the industry by exempting them for this year from the 5 per cent VAT increase in respect of <Col N="917" /> services provided to non-residents under fixed price contracts entered into before 1 January 1983.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to monitor this situation and to explore means by which further measures to assist competitiveness might be possible in the future within the context of the government's overall budgetary strategy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wish the Minister could have found it possible to outline some of the measures he says it might be possible to introduce to help this ailing industry in a crisis situation at present.  Is the Minister aware that of the 700 hotels operating in the country, half of them lost money last year?  Is he aware also that there is grave danger that of the 26,000 people employed in the industry, 3,000 will not be in employment at the end of this season?  Will the Minister tell me what he proposes doing about that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the problems confronting the tourist industry.  Indeed, some of them are not of recent origin but rather have been with the industry over a period.  In addition to the reduction in VAT, I have indicated to the House the increased moneys provided by the Exchequer this year to the tune of £3.1 million in order to assist hotels in an intensive promotional campaign extended primarily to the British market, which element had shown such a massive decline in our tourist earnings. This campaign commenced very early in the year.  Indications to date are of a very substantial increase in inquiries, which is a good indicator that the intensive campaign processed by Bord Fáilte in Britain and on the Continent will prove beneficial to our hotel and tourist industry generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate what the Bord Fáilte estimate for growth rate in the industry will be this year and what the total revenue is expected to be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any indication at this stage would be purely theoretical because late bookings are a feature of the <Col N="918" /> industry now.  Late bookings are the current tendency.  All we have to go on is that inquiries are substantially up and Bord Fáilte's statistical review at this stage would indicte a growth of four per cent on the 1982 figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8 and 9 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should first of all explain that I have already indicated publicly the developments <Col N="920" /> which I regard as essential for the implementation of a rational medium-term capital development programme for the acute general hospitals.  At the same time I also indicated that certain hospitals which were not included in the programme for major development could not be expected to continue to provide adequate services without some in-put of resources.</P>
    <P>In that context, and having regard to the difficulties which are being experienced in some departments at Castlebar General Hospital and in particular the children's unit and the out-patients department, I have decided to allow a limited capital scheme to go to tender at the hospital in 1984.  On my instructions officers of my Department met with the management of the health board to identify the minimum capital requirements necessary to alleviate difficulties at the hospital.  The necessary arrangements are now being made so that a contract can go to tender next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify one particular sentence in his reply to the effect that he has accepted the need for capital expenditure but did I hear him correctly that there would be a limited scheme allowed to tender next year to deal with the paediatric unit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. There is overcrowding in the childrens' unit.  It is very severe and so there is a high risk of infection.  Because of the overcrowding and the pressure on beds the situation could be very difficult in the event of fire.  I have made provision accordingly and as recently as 3 May officers of my Department visited the hospital and inspected the priorities with officials of the health board and members of the design team and as a consequence of that I have reached agreement on a specific tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate when he expects the work to go to contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would expect the work to go to tender very early in 1984 <Col N="921" /> and I propose to include a specific provision in the capital programme in that year.  I would hope it would be early in 1984 and then in a matter of four to five months tenders should be back and arrangements can then be made for construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a limited capital programme for the children's unit.  Do I take it he will not allow to go to tender the substantial scheme he estimated which was somewhere in the region of £20 million? In other words, it will be a phased capital programme, starting with one unit next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. The overall scheme in terms of the current capital programme would have been £20.045 million spread over four years but the previous administration provided for a start in 1987.  I am now proposing in relation to the first block of development to provide new accommodation for children, for medical and surgical patients and out-patients.  That first block will meet the most urgent needs of the hospital at a cost of about £5 million. When that is completed then the second block will go to tender, a block which will provide kitchen and dining facilities and so on, and that block will cost about £6 million &mdash; in all therefore about £11 million commencing in 1984 and spread over a three-and-a-half year period.  These are the urgent immediate needs of the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has now stated is entirely different from what he led the people of County Mayo to believe when he appeared on a <i>Today Tonight</i> programme.  It was put clearly to him that he would allow the total scheme to go to tender next year and I ask him to confirm this.  Now he tells the House that the scheme for next year will be a tender for £5 million with no indication whatsoever of when any further tenders might be contemplated.  I put it to the Minister he has misled the community and broken a solemn commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy <Col N="922" /> that every satisfaction has been expressed in the Department regarding the agreement reached between the Department, the senior planning staff and the members of the design team.  This contrasts with the notoriety being sought by the Deputy whose party had not made any provision in this regard for 1984, 1985 or 1986 and only tentatively for 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Commencing in 1984 there will be the substantial expenditure of £5 million.  The best efforts of the contractors and of the design team will be required in 1984-85 but I am insisting that the ward accommodation be provided as the first phase of this development and ultimately we will have the overcrowding and other problems to cater for.  This diverges in no way from the observations I made either on the television programme referred to or at any other time.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for allowing this very necessary work to commence next year, but do I understand him to say that the previous Government, of which two of my colleagues on the other side of the House were senior members, did not make any provision for this project except a tentative provision for 1987?

      <P>Basically, there are two phases in the project.  As the Deputy <Col N="923" /> knows, the design work has been turned around.  The original proposal was to demolish the nurses' home and then to clear a major site and start a phased development.  The design team are happy that the most urgent need is in the areas of new accommodation for children and of medical, surgical, specialist and out-patient facilities.  The £5 million expenditure will go to tender immediately and the second phase will involve the provision of kitchen and dining facilities as well as a pharmacy and a theatre.  This will cost another £6 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On 31 January last the hospital authorities wrote to the Department offering £500,000 or a sum sufficient to complete the first two storeys so as to provide the out-patient and casualty facilities.  This offer was conditional on provision being made in the Department's capital programme for the budget cost of the project.  The hospital's proposals have been accepted by the Department and this will only increase marginally the time scale for building &mdash; by a further six to nine months.  It is expected that the project will be ready to be put to tender in July this year.  On that basis construction of the project could begin in September 1983 with the building being completed in about two years.  However, that will depend on the contractor who is appointed.  A medium-sized contractor would probably need about two years to complete the work while a major contractor would be much faster.  The position is that the money has been allocated and will be available in September.</P>

I would imagine that the January 1982 prices would have to be revised, but in any event the project could start in September 1983 depending on the speed with which the tendering arrangements are completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the health board have passed a resolution to close the small four-bed maternity unit at Dungarvan. This is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Expert medical opinion is that it is safer to have babies delivered in a consultant-staffed unit with support facilities such as specialist paediatric, gynaecological, medical, surgical, pathological and radiological services close at hand, and that this is essential for the well being of mothers and babies.  There is no obstetrician-gynaecologist attached to Saint Vincent's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> The number of births delivered in Dungarvan is very low and has declined from 148 in 1975 to 65 in 1982.  It is the intention of the health board that future deliveries should take place in consultant-staffed units in the areas such as Waterford. The board intend to provide a consultant-staffed out-patient clinic in Dungarvan which would be a valuable service for mothers in the area.  The South-Eastern Health Board have decided that no further bookings for admission for delivery in Saint Vincent's Hospital, will be accepted after 30 April 1983.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. J. Fahey Mr. J. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the unrest among the people of Dungarvan and west Waterford is fully justified?  This closure is unjustified.  The maternity unit in Dungarvan was the only unit available to the town of Dungarvan and the area around it.  Is the Minister aware that Dungarvan is an expanding town with an expanding hinterland?  Is he aware of the distance from west Waterford &mdash; which includes the towns of Cappoquin, Lismore, and Tallow &mdash; to Waterford City?  It is a distance of 65 to 70 miles.  The final decision taken by the South Eastern Health Board was only taken on the casting vote of the chairman. The onus is on the Minister to take action in this matter especially as there is no private maternity unit in all of that area. Would the Minister accept that the unrest of the people is justified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a four-bed maternity unit in a small hospital of 30 medical and minor surgical beds.  In 1980 the number of births was 87, in 1981 it was 73 and in 1982 it was 65.  I do not have any statutory powers to direct the health board in relation to a change of use of a hospital premises.  A decision was taken by the health board.  My powers only arise where there is a formal decision to close a hospital.  I have to give assent to that.  The health board have decided by a resolution in January 1983, confirmed in April 1983, admittedly by a casting vote of the chairman, to close the hospital.  In that health board area in New Ross, in Tipperary, in Clogheen and <Col N="929" /> Carrick-on-Suir, similar maternity units were closed in recent years and there were no protests or local opposition to the decisions.  I have a substantial number of closures from health boards throughout the country at present.  It is of critical importance that we have consultant staffed maternity units available to mothers to ensure that they have every paediatric, gynaecological, surgical and pathological facility available to them in those units.  Where a health board takes a policy decision of this nature I would not wish to interfere with the provision of the best possible medical care for the women and children of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that there has been a considerable decline in the number of births in St. Vincent's Hospital. Women have not been using the maternity beds there.  They have obviously preferred to go elsewhere. Apart from that, the health board, as a matter of general policy, have decided that there should be in that area consultant staffed units.  I have received petitions from the urban district council, from my own party colleagues and the Deputy's party colleagues.  Despite that, the health board are statutorily entitled to take a decision of this nature and I cannot, in conscience, have what I would call Departmental interference with the health board on whom devolves the responsibility of providing the best care for the women of this country irrespective of political considerations.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the intention of the health board is to save £60,000 by closing this unit?  This money will be saved at the expense of six jobs.  Is it the policy of a Labour Minister for Health to have economies made in this way?  Is it now the policy of the Department of Health that deliveries will only be done in consultant staffed units? If this is the case, what is the Minister doing about the non-consultant staffed units?  We have one in Carlow.  Would the Minister make an announcement on that?  The Minister also said that the South Eastern Health Board are shortly to provide an ante-natal clinic in the Dungarvan area.  Does he think this will alter the situation in Dungarvan?  Is it not a fact that the number of deliveries in the Dungarvan area have increased dramatically in the last month?  This is something that could not have been planned in advance because nine months ago we were not aware that the unit was to be closed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The health board are having discussions with consultants from Ardkeen General Hospital concerning the provision of clinics at St. Vincent's Hospital.  I am sure the Deputy shares my concern that where births take place it is <Col N="931" /> highly undesirable that there should be no obstetrician or gynaecologist available in the immediate precincts of the hospital. I am sure that in his professional competence and as a member of a health board he would share that view.  It is true that the health board decided to have discussions with the doctors and staff involved to ensure that there is proper ante-natal consultant facilities available in Dungarvan.  I will provide whatever encouragement and assistance I can towards having the ante-natal facilities and clinics available, but as a matter of overall policy the health board have decided, and I cannot reverse their decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the two questions together.  Under EEC rules it is not open to me to ban imports of potatoes into Ireland from other member states just as they may not ban imports of agricultural products from Ireland.  While I fully appreciate the weak state of the market here and the low level of prices which Irish producers have been getting, I regret the action taken yesterday at Dundalk port to prevent imports.</P>
      <P>Imports of potatoes to date this year have been low as compared with previous years.  The quantity imported in the first three months of 1983 was 3,600 tonnes as compared with 26,400 tonnes in the same period last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is an adequate supply of good quality potatoes available which are selling at about 50 per cent of the accepted minimum price that the potatoes were produced for?  Is the Minister aware that this could be termed as dumping?  Is the Minister aware that there are precedents for controls and that other EEC Governments have safeguarded their producers' <Col N="938" /> interests even if they go against EEC regulations in regard to other products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not dumping and this has been established.  The variety of potato in question is a very high yielder but we have been assured that they are not being dumped here.  We cannot ban produce for any length of time even though we might like to do so.  We are very vulnerable in this regard because we export between £1.5 billion and £2 billion worth of agricultural produce annually. For that reason we have to be very careful when it comes to imposing any type of ban.  I am sure the Deputy will accept that.</P>
      <P>On the whole question of potato production, I should like to tell the House that the Department have initiated &mdash; I believe this commenced under the last Administration &mdash; with producer groups and merchants a type of planned potato production.  That is how we will have to tackle the problem.  We will have to take on the competition wherever it comes from within the EEC.  We are capable of doing that once we initiate planned production, continuity of supply and quality control.  Growers are demanding this.  Up to now it was difficult to get the agreement of the growers but they are now telling us they are prepared for quality control and have their bags of potatoes identified even with their own names. Legislation will be necessary in this respect and we hope to get that through the House quickly.  Hopefully, when that is passed we will not have this type of annual occurrence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there was not a Department inspector at the port yesterday when these potatoes arrived?  Is the Minister aware that there was a growth on the potatoes and that they would have been refused entry if an official from the Department had inspected them?  Will it be possible, until such time as we have a common agricultural policy and the measures the Minister has outlined, to ban the import of potatoes until the 30,000 tonnes of top quality Irish potatoes that are available in 15 counties are used up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Our people were there yesterday.  In fact, a representative from the Department cleared the consignment of potatoes with regard to plant health. That was a loophole we used for a number of years with regard to imports but plant health has been standardised and once imports comply with plant health regulations we have no further function. What happened subsequently at the port is a matter for the Department of Justice. We cannot impose a ban on imports, even for 24 hours.  The matter is as simple as that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in Donegal farmers who expended up to £800 to produce an acre of potatoes are selling them now for £15 per ton?  I cannot accept the Minister's statement that he does not have any power to ban the importation of potatoes because there is a precedent for such action.  Bearing in mind that new potatoes from Cyprus and the Canary Islands are coming on the market, the Government should impose a ban on imported potatoes for at least eight weeks.  If that action is taken the farmers who are now in a terrible plight in regard to the tonnage of potatoes they have on their farms will get some relief for the high cost they have put into producing the 1982-83 crop.  We should not accept the argument that a ban cannot be imposed.  We do not accept the Government's argument that we should be the goodies on the European scene while bans are being imposed by other countries to protect their produce.</P>

      <P>While I sympathise with the points of view expressed I must point out that the facts have been established that this time last year in the region of 6,000 tonnes of potatoes were imported. That is a fact of life with regard to potatoes produced in the Community.  We are aware that the price of potatoes is quite low.  The Dutch have the advantage in their heavy yielding variety.  In fact, they are more expensive at present than Irish potatoes.</P>

We succeeded at Question Time today in dealing with 17 questions, which is less than half of what is normal.  I allowed a number of questions on the Private Members' question which was put down.

I know you do not have any control over the Minister, but finally I will ask a simple question again and hope that in the interests of the House the Minister will see fit to answer it.

      <P>The information the Deputy has asked for is not available.  I would refer him to section 51 of the Electoral Act, 1923, which disqualifies any person for election to the Dáil who is undergoing a sentence of more than six months at hard labour or who has been sentenced to penal servitude for any term.  In Mr. Gallagher's case the sentence recorded was imprisonment.  At the time this was regarded as being false imprisonment and this is now a statutory one.  The person in question has the right to bring his application to the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that when we reach the Committee Stage the debate will be properly structured so that everybody will have an opportunity to discuss the entire Bill, having made a minute inspection of it. On previous Finanace Bills we only reached the second and third parts of the Bill.  The opportunity should be given to debate the whole Bill and I hope there will be co-operation between the Whips in this matter.</P>
      <P>I spoke on some sections of the Bill yesterday and I now wish to deal with the sections relating to the residential property taxes.  I am not against the principle of taxation on residences in general or on dwelling houses because such taxes will help to offset the cost of services of one type or another which are provided for different houses, such as roads, water supplies, sewage, which are absolutely necessary.  The more income a person has the greater the amount of rates he should pay.</P>
      <P>Section 88 (4) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The market value of any property for the purposes of subsection (3) or section 94 (2) shall be ascertained by the inspector in such manner and by <Col N="988" /> such means as he thinks fit and he may authorise a person to inspect any property....</P>
    <P>I believe this section is very loosely drafted and could lead to a serious invasion of privacy.  I am very concerned that a person's privacy may be invaded.  I accept the principles of this Bill but I ask the Minister and the Cabinet to look closely at this section.</P>
    <P>If a garda believes there is stolen property in a house and he wishes to search it, he must obtain a search warrant.  In this section there is no reference to how the house will be inspected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A good point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This section should be closely examined because in this country a person's private residence has always been treated with the utmost respect. This section as drafted, could lead to a person's home being violated.  I am very concerned about this.  I realise the Government do not intend that to happen, and I would like the Minister to reassure me that it will not happen.  From reading the section I believe the Revenue Commissioners will be allowed to inspect the house.  Subsection (5) reads:</P>
      <P>Where the inspector requires a valuation to be made by a person named by him, the costs of such valuation shall be defrayed by the Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The earlier section uses the words &ldquo;... by the inspector in such manner and by such means as he thinks fit&rdquo;.  I am very concerned about this and would like the Minister and the Government to examine it very closely because it could have the most serious implications for democracy as we know it.  If the Revenue Commissioners are allowed entry to a private house to inspect it, we will be giving them new powers and I will be very concerned if that happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Revenue Commissioners be allowed enter the front door to inspect a person's private residence?  Once inside, what next?  We are talking about a person with a house valued £65,000, earning an income of £20,000 or more but the principle <Col N="989" /> is the same, it does not matter how humble the house.  I ask the Minister to give careful scrutiny to the wording of this section.  If the Revenue Commissioners are given the power to enter a private residence I believe that will be going further than was ever intended. This would be breaking new ground which most people would find totally unacceptable.  It would lead to demonstrations and protests because most people would not wish to see such powers granted to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in opposition, decided very recklessly to abolish rates without understanding the consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to introduce the residential property tax, water and refuse charges and so on.  In my view, the collection of these taxes will lead to enormous administrative costs for the local authorities and the Revenue Commissioners. There is a very big overlap in the methods of collecting taxes.  This leads only to an increase in numbers in the Revenue Commissioners' office, which is unwise and unhelpful, as it will add to the burden on the PAYE and PRSI sector.</P>
      <P>The PLV system had many faults and failings, but it was a simpler and somewhat more equitable system than the one proposed.  At some stage this whole situation will need to be re-examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These sections deal with residential property.  This is a self-assessment tax and if a person does not make a return he or she becomes liable for quite sizeable interest.  Take the example of a <Col N="990" /> father having a sizeable mortgage on his house who dies and leaves that house to a son and two daughters, perhaps two out of three working.  Their aggregate income is then taken into account.  If one is a teacher and another a civil servant, their aggregate incomes will bring them over the £20,000 limit.  These people would thus be liable for residential property tax, while still having to pay a mortgage on the house and all other expenses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This tax needs examination. It will lead to quite serious legal problems and many legal decisions will have to be made on cases involving it.  It will be a legal minefield for administration and will open up vast new horizons for people in the accountancy and the estate agency fields.</P>
      <P>It would take an army of civil servants to collect this tax, which is unhealthy for a democracy such as ours under present circumstances.  The more civil servants are established, the greater will be the burden on the PAYE and PRSI sector. The money collected may be large or small, but anything which may increase rather than decrease the burden on the taxpayers would not be satisfactory.  One of the redeeming features of this Bill is that the present exemption limit of £65,000 will be index-linked each year, as provided by section 90, as also will the income limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other items which I will touch on briefly.  One of the main reasons for the serious unrest amongst the PAYE and PRSI sector has been the vast amount of uncollected PAYE and PRSI payments.  We are all aware of firms, private individuals and companies who have not made their returns.  Everyone in the House knows them.  A number of RTE radio and television programmes highlighted a number of companies who were making these deductions, who went into liquidation and then set up new companies.  This led to justified anger.  With regard to the different levies and increases in PAYE and PRSI, there has never been a genuine, determined effort by the Revenue Commissioners to collect these due <Col N="991" /> amounts from the firms.  These firms got into arrears a couple of years ago and got accommodation from the Revenue Commissioners, who to a large extent are understanding and helpful and I am not criticising them for that because I admire their efforts in that direction.  Having been in arrears, they make an arrangement to pay these PAYE and PRSI deductions as they are made and if the Revenue Commissioners fail to ensure that these companies meet their commitments, they are failing in their duty.</P>
    <P>There should be far more field officers in the Revenue Commissioners' Office to visit these firms and ascertain whether the employees are still with them and that all deductions from pay are being forwarded to their office.  If the firms are in default, the workers concerned should be informed that the deductions from their wages are not being sent in to the Revenue Commissioners and, in conjunction with their union, should ensure that no further deductions are stopped by that firm but that the amount liable is collected direct by the Revenue Commissioners. In the past, rate collectors called to collect bad debts and made sure that these were paid.  There would have been far fewer protests because there would have been a far greater amount of money available to spend in the running of the services if the Revenue Commissioners had the necessary field officers to make these collections.</P>
    <P>A responsibility is laid on the shoulders of the Revenue Commissioners and on the Department of Finance to see that this money is collected.  The unions should also play a more active role in ensuring that the returns are made immediately.  This would help to ease the burden on all taxpayers, in reducing the amount that each would have to pay.  The whole business of fly-by-night companies forming, taking the assets and starting anew would have been avoided.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal to bring an additional estimated 90,000 farmers into the tax net, this was promised also by the Opposition under Deputy Haughey as reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> of Saturday, November 6 1982:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> Mr. Haughey promised also that the income tax code would be extended to farmers as a whole.  The Government believed that the farming community should make a much greater contribution by way of income tax, now that rates have been removed.</P>
    <P>That was an article by Michael Mills in <i>The Irish Press</i> of Saturday, 6 November 1982.  While the completion of returns and so on will cause a lot of difficulties for farmers in the long run, for the sake of equity and everything else, it will be of benefit to everybody, that these people pay their tax on normal returns the same as everybody else.  There will be a certain number of farmers who will be liable to tax under the £40 valuation limit but a certain number of others who will not be.</P>
    <P>I might quote from the Minister's introductory remarks at column 416 of the Official Report of Thursday, 5 May 1983 when he said:</P>
    <P>Farmers who have not been liable for income tax up to now will be required to fill in details of their business and personal circumstances in a farm profile form with a view to the identification of those who would have a taxable income.</P>
    <P>He said, at column 417:</P>
    <P>I consider that the profile fully meets the Government commitment to a system which will deal simply and fairly with the large number of small farmers newly liable for income tax.</P>
    <P>I would hope that those forms would be as simplified as is humanly possible.  I would hope also that the period over which a farmer would have to go back would be no more than one or perhaps two years.  In this respect I have noted with concern some reports that some of the farm profile forms would require farmers to go back over a period of five to ten years.  It would be impossible for farmers to give details of buildings, purchase of machinery and so on five or ten years ago.  If that were to be the case it would place additional work on the Revenue Commissioners which would be totally unnecessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> The Minister is to be commended for reducing the VAT rate on room sales in hotels from 23 per cent to 18 per cent. The Irish Hotels' Federation have acknowledged that this is a concession they were seeking and for which they are grateful.  We are all aware that our hotel and tourist industry is encountering enormous difficulties because of the cost factor here.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with the different rates of VAT and with increases in excise duties and so on.  In recent years I have spoken at length about the problems confronting vintners, people such as Irish Distillers, Guinness and so on, and the duties imposed on beers and spirits. Many surveys have been undertaken showing that our cost factors <i>vis-à-vis</i> those in Northern Ireland and Britain were much higher.  Indeed we do not need any survey to tell us that.  When one visits Northern Ireland or Britain and buys one drink in a bar one realises immediately that our cost factor is about 40 per cent higher.  This is something everybody in the tourist industry is aware of and is the reason also that so much smuggling goes on.  This is something to which I drew attention about two years ago.  We must endeavour to create a competitive climate here so that tourists coming to this country will find it some way attractive rather than the position obtaining at present with our cost factors very much in excess of those in Northern Ireland, Britain or many continental countries.  Therefore that section of the Bill dealing with the reduced VAT rate on rooms in hotels is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Also in his introductory remarks on this Bill, as reported in the Official Report of 5 May 1983 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The changes in legislation will be supplemented by administrative improvements.</P>
    <P>I suggest a number of administrative improvements the Minister might consider. First, it is essential to cut down on needless bodies and authorities.  We in this House must give the leadership in this direction.  I spoke here last evening about the proposals for Bord Poist and <Col N="994" /> Bord Telecom and said it was lunacy to consider their continuance.  I would ask the Minister for Finance to give them the chop because I do not think they are desirable or necessary particularly when one sees the cost of accommodating ten people, £1 million.</P>
    <P>There is then the proposal to introduce charges for water, sewerage and planning permissions.  An Bord Pleanála costs the State money and has become completely politicised.  I see little future for that body and do not feel its continuance is necessary either.  Indeed I might recommend to the Minister for Finance also to forget about the appointment of an ombudsman. We have, I would hope, a diligent Parliament fully representing our people.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the collection of taxes it should be remembered that generally taxes are collected for running expenses and that, as a democracy, we who represent the people must carry out our duties properly.  There are proposals, albeit distant proposals, for having a Garda authority.  It is my honest opinion that there is no necessity for a Garda authority here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I shall just make passing references.  I believe that the cost of establishing a Garda authority would be excessive and I do not consider it necessary.  There are many other proposals which could be proved to be unnecessary <Col N="995" /> also.  The different State boards and bodies should be scrutinised to ascertain whether savings could be effected there.  For example, there is the situation in regard to office block accommodation. We must undertake detailed examinations of all of those to ascertain where savings can be effected.  It must be remembered that PAYE workers realise that these bodies cost them money and the fewer of them that exist the better.</P>
      <P>I might make one further suggestion and I do so with the greatest respect for the office and its various officeholders &mdash; indeed it is enshrined in our Constitution &mdash; that is, whether or not the people might be asked in a referendum about the necessity for maintaining the office of President.  It is something that should be considered in great depth bearing in mind the importance and prestige of that office and its cost.  Candidates are not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have tried to be constructive in what I have said.  I have been critical to some degree but I commend him for the effort he is making and the expertise he has demonstrated.  He has a most onerous task and I wish him every success in it. The sad thing about Ministers for Finance is that nobody seems to see any particular merit in what a Minister does.  The present Minister has only been in office for a short time.  I wish him well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make some remarks about the Bill in general and its purpose.  The purpose is to implement the provisions in the budget and any other provisions the Minister may have considered necessary since the budget, and so in the Bill we should find a control aspect and a planning aspect.  The Bill is dominated by the control aspect.  Like the bird it has to fly on one wing but birds do not fly on one wing and, on that basis, the Bill is unbalanced and weak from the point of view of planning.  The Taoiseach this morning highlighted the fact that one cannot plan at this stage.  I shall come back to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis in the Bill is on control and that brings me to what the function of the Department is and what the function of the Bill is as representing the principal instruments of the Department. Traditionally, the Department of Finance was the keeper of the nation's purse and this is where control comes in. It was the treasurer.  Any club or group needs a good treasurer.  We all subscribe to that.  You must have a good treasurer and the Minister for Finance shows himself to be dealing effectively with the bookkeeping and the treasury aspect. Now the traditional position of the Department of Finance suited the non-interventionists. It suited the social Darwinists, the people who believe in the survival of the fittest.  It also suited the proponents of that philosophy, those who for many years said: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;.  We saw many of them over the years welcoming Bills like this, Bills dominated by controls and with no development arm to them.  I know the Minister will argue that, if we do enough control for long enough, we can then get on with the development and control will ultimately contribute to development. Control is, of course, a component of development but it is not the dynamic and it is the dynamic that is lacking in this Bill.  This kind of approach in the past was accompanied by massive unemployment, low wages, extensive poverty.  This poverty was officially condoned by the <Col N="997" /> nation's bookkeepers as an unfortunate concomitant of prudent bookkeeping. We have seen a great deal of this kind of approach to our financial affairs over the years.  In this Bill that aspect is emphasised and one has to ask oneself if this is not really the politics of depression, on the one hand, and despair on the other. One takes one's pick as to which is involved here.</P>
    <P>We came then to what was known as the Lemass era.  We came to the First Programme for Economic Expansion in 1959.  The old mould of the simple treasury role of Finance was broken.  The then Secretary, Mr. Ken Whittaker, of the Department of Finance, participated fully in this development within the Department and the Department took on a dual role of bookkeeping, on the one hand, and development, on the other.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get on now with the job here.  You had in that period real leadership.  It was a very stimulating period.  Then we had our present leader, Deputy Haughey, who gave us <i>The Way Forward.</i> That again showed the development approach of our party to this whole question of finance.  This is crucial to what is happening at present because in our approach &mdash; this was laid down clearly in <i>The Way Forward</i>&mdash; we were setting targets in the budget and in the Finance Bill.  They were targets for employment and those targets were set out clearly.  They started in 1983 with new jobs created, 28,000, 500 jobs lost, 27,500, and, therefore, a net change in employment of plus 1,000; running on to 1984 plus 12,000 therefore a net change in employment of plus 12,000; 1985 plus 20,000; 1986, plus 25,000 and 1987 plus 34,000.  These were firm targets in the production and development in which some of the leading economists had participated. These were set out firmly as part of the economic strategy and which would be part of this Bill were we presenting the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, of course, has to be carried in the context of our average annual labour <Col N="998" /> force increase of 17,000 which takes a great deal of the shine off the new figures but that is the reality we have to face, a reality which demonstrates the size of the task.  In contrast to that, and again not contained in this Bill, is the fact that here this morning we had the Taoiseach saying their policies were diametrically opposed to what the employment situation requires.  In that he was saying something in which we know he believes.  It is in the policy in this Bill.  It is in everything that is being done and that is that for the first couple of years they plan to concentrate on the control aspect and on the book-keeping and therefore the steps taken are in many respects diametrically opposed though I have conceded already that some of those will help the situation in relation to controls.</P>
    <P>Here we have a situation in which we are presented with a Bill totally lacking in a dynamic commitment to job creation. We were at least prepared to put down a commitment and stand over it. There could, of course, be difficulty in reaching the targets but, if one is going for a target, one gets somewhere.  If you have no target, inevitably you will have massive unemployment and that is one of the things which comes out in this Bill.  It is regrettable that, for whatever reason, the Minister for Finance is leading his Department into a retreat back to the pre-Lemass situation and shedding responsibility for risk-taking and development. At this point in time industry needs incentives to export and development as distinct from what are regarded as concessions, industry needs positive dynamic and constructive incentives to develop and to export.  Our future lies in the vigorous promotion of both private and public export industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In what year did the late Mr. Lemass run a current budget deficit? He never heard of one, but if there had been any such suggestion he would have condemned it out of hand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly tends to blow a gasket for very little reason.  Perhaps he would contain himself.  He should face the position now instead of repeatedly <Col N="999" /> looking backwards.  In <i>The Way Forward</i> we outlined our targets and commitments for the years 1983 to 1987.  Our plans envisaged a rapid rise in exports, especially of manufactured goods.  This would be based on the more efficient use of existing resources, improvement in cost competitiveness and an increased capacity of the economy to export as a result of new investment, both foreign and domestic, private and public.  That was the kind of approach we were taking. I concede to the Minister for Finance that in some aspects of this Bill he is doing the same thing in terms of trying to improve cost competitiveness.  However, the fact that he is not investing is particularly distressing.</P>
      <P>Taking the basic strategy of the Bill, we would have broadly similar objectives in relation to borrowing targets and the overall situation on bookkeeping, but the approach differs considerably.  In the first instance this Bill is based on increases on taxation, both direct and indirect.  There is no need to list those increases.  They are well known by now. They are based on a reduction in capital borrowing of £263 million.  As soon as this was mentioned by the Coalition it was clear to any sensible person that it was the beginning of a doomsday situation so far as employment was concerned. Once a Government begin to dismantle capital investment and to create disincentives for management generally, for industry and for business, they are putting off the day when we will be able to provide even reasonable amounts of employment for our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has reduced the long-term investment programme and as a result we are now faced with great pressure in the area of wages and of inflation because by increasing the direct and indirect taxes there will be an immediate effect on inflation and in terms of pressure on wages.  The Fianna Fáil approach included similar targets: reducing public expenditure but using methods different from those being used by the Government, introducing certain charges in certain places, but again with differences in approach.  Our plan was based on long-term <Col N="1000" /> investment, on the creation of jobs in the private sector and in capital expenditure for this purpose with a very strong export orientation.  We were committed to fighting the closure of factories, a matter that is very much in question now in terms of whether the Government are really committed in an underlying way in this regard especially having regard to what the Taoiseach said today about having to accept unemployment and having to keep the books right until some future time when we might be able to do more about unemployment.  It is our contention that if a company have any possibility of long-term viability we should allow Fóir Teoranta to move in and give every assistance.</P>
    <P>The result of the measures being taken in this Bill will be increases in unit costs. Our imports will increase and more factories will close.  Redundancies are increasing.  Our exports will drop.  This Bill sets no target in the areas of production or of jobs.  It provides no yardstick by which we can test the performance of the Government in the coming year other than by way of the bookkeeping objectives that have been set.  The only objective in the Bill, therefore, is the countering of tax evasion and the tidying up of the books, both of which measures we would agree with, but the basic lack in the Bill is that of a dynamic approach.</P>
    <P>When we consider some of the individual aspects of the Bill we find that the additional 1 per cent levy is particularly obnoxious especially after we, Fine Gael and Labour included, had gone to the electorate saying that there would not be an increase in PRSI.  The Government insist on saying still that there is no increase in PRSI, that all that is involved is a raising of the ceiling, but added to the PRSI is the extra 1 per cent.  So far as the worker is concerned, that 1 per cent levy included here will add to the 5.5 per cent simple PRSI the 1 per cent health charge, the 1 per cent youth employment levy and now the 1 per cent income levy, making a total of 8.5 per cent on incomes up to £13,000 with three of the percentage points going on to total income.</P>
    <P>This section of the Bill is unfair and unjust.  Its impact will be particularly <Col N="1001" /> severe on those who are the heavy PRSI payers.  Consequently, we are opposing the provision.</P>
    <P>The youth employment levy is estimated to bring in £80 million this year. That is a very substantial sum which is more or less in line with the original predictions.  It would be particularly valuable if it were going into training plus job creation, but here again the weakness is that the money is going into the replacement of finance that was being put towards training.  I would be the first to acknowledge the extreme value of the work done by AnCO and by the various training bodies and work experience groups.  For many of the young people concerned the training is only a stop gap operation to carry them through some period of time; but unless some of the money is also diverted to real job creation also there is nothing at the end of the line for those young people.</P>
    <P>In addition the income levy is to yield £47 million, giving a total of £127 million this year.  I appeal to the Minister to commit some of this extra resource to the creation of jobs.  It is being said around the country that the only post being created as a result of this money is the job of the chief of the youth employment agency.  There are some more people, district officers and so on, to be appointed within that agency but some of the money should go towards the creation of jobs for young people.</P>
    <P>There are various other aspects of the present situation that are disturbing.  For example, £73 million has been cut from the construction industry.  Obviously that will hit employment straight away.  The borrowing of £100 million by way of subsidisation in respect of the restocking of farms was a measure that would have been included in this Bill if we had remained in office.</P>

      <P>I am just wondering why the Minister did not go ahead with that borrowing having regard to his interest in agriculture.  I was suspicious at that time that the Government intended to devalue our currency.

We did have devaluation subsequently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would introduce that scheme.  We find, too, that there is a reduction of £1 million in respect of Córas Tráchtála.  Again, this indicates a lack of development strategy and of a commitment to exports. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this Bill is that it contains no incentives to investors or to management to get up and help us to get out of the difficulties we are in.  There are no incentives for production or for the creation of new jobs. If anything the opposite is the case.  Investors are being frightened.  Business people are quite scared about the things they are seeing.  They are being told that things are bad and going to get worse.  I have learned from people involved in the accountancy world that increasing numbers of people in management are considering getting out.  If that happens we will be left with mediocrity.  I know that some of the most committed people are among the best people there but we cannot afford to lose good management and we should be encouraging them to stay and put the best into this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find the Taoiseach's recent statements particularly depressing.  Former Coalitions adopted this tactic of telling people that something bad was coming so they could claim credit for predicting it.  We only want to see people putting <Col N="1003" /> their shoulders to the wheel and if the Government are prepared to do that they will have our support.  The philosphy which the Taoiseach is expressing of things bad and getting worse is no good to anybody.  There is no incentive in this Bill to develop indigenous industries. There is no stimulus for small service industries.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill about which there has been a great deal of comment is the one relating to residential property tax.  The last speaker talked about the importance of bringing back some form of rates.  Through this the Government are now introducing two kinds of rates. This in effect is what is being done at present.  There is the rates on services and this residential property tax.  It is right and reasonable to pay something for services.  In County Dublin, for instance, a water charge is paid whereas in the city it is not.  It is only equitable that there should be a similar charge there.  That is a very small charge.  The theory of the residential tax makes some sense.  In theory it is supposed to apply only to the largest houses and to people who have the highest incomes.  In these difficult times it makes sense, in theory, to seek some assistance from the people who are in this strong position.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the practice of it, it is quite clearly bad.  There are many defects and many anomalies and I hope the Minister will amend it on Committee Stage.  The tax is to apply on incomes above £20,000.  That is all right, but it includes the income of the husband and wife, the children's income the granny's income, the invalid sister's and the mentally handicapped persons income, and the income of anybody else who happens to be there.  It includes the garden, and as a person who spent some time in horticultural research I am sad to see gardens being taxed.  We need more of them rather than fewer.  They add to the general environment physiologically apart from the beauty aspect.  Will the granny flat be included?  The approach of the Department of Health recently has been to get people to look after their elderly with consequent benefit to the Minster <Col N="1004" /> for Finance because the charges for homes and hospitals are reduced.  This tax is in direct opposition to that.  It will force such people out in many cases.  I hope the Minister will alter that.  As regards the children's income I think it is a scandalous provision.  It really worries me to thing that there are people who want to get at the children in their homes and to force them out of their homes. Take a family with two or three children with incomes who are hoping to get married in the not too distant future.  They will be forced to go on to the property market and to look for a flat.  Young people today have sufficient dignity to clear out and not be a burden on anybody. I am sure it was not the Minister's own intention but he should never have agreed to allow the children's incomes to be included.  We also want to see the grandparents excluded.  They should not be put in that most invidious situation. An invalid sister, for example, who is being looked after will be put in a very difficult situation if she has an income. This is a particularly nasty provision.</P>
    <P>Once you get to the £20,000, apart from some marginal relief, there is not really an upper limit.  You may find decent people who happen to live in a fairly sizeable house and because everybody else wanted to come and live in their area and because the property in that area went up in value they now have a high valuation.  That house is their home and they want to stay in it.  They may not be far above the income level. This is the aggregate gross income and when you come to look at the net take home pay it is a different thing.  The youth employment levy is based on gross income, the new 1 per cent is based on gross income, but they are deducted from one's net income so certain categories of people are put under considerable strain. I appeal to the Minister to exclude children, the granny and the grandad, the dependant relative and the handicapped person.  I would ask him to exclude the granny flat because it is something we should be encouraging.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at the question of making allowances for mortgages, especially mortgages on the principal <Col N="1005" /> residence, as some people are in difficulties in that respect.  I would like the Minister to give an undertaking that the income level or the house value would not be reduced.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Bill says it is to be indexed, but I would like the Minister on behalf of the Government to give a clear indication.  People outside of this House would like the Minister to re-emphasise the intention here because the Bill could change with a new Government or in new circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person on PAYE earning £25,500, minus deductions for PAYE, PRSI, VHI and so on, in net terms is taking home £12,000 or £13,000 a year.  It is from this figure that the State will be deducting as far as PAYE payers are concerned.  This scheme is wide open to legitimate avoidance not by PAYE people who are on fixed incomes but by self-employed and professional people.  A civil servant earning about £17,000 per annum with a son or a daughter working and earning about £6,000 will be pushed over the limit of £20,000; but a self-employed person could decide to work a day less per week so as to reduce the income in real terms as it would not be worth working extra. Perhaps that is a good thing, since somebody else might do some of the business, but in relation to this section there would be a loss of money to the Exchequer. That is a simple thing to do in a flexible situation.  In that situation the Minister loses the amount of tax that would be paid by someone who could have earned £25,000 and he also loses the money which he had hoped to get by virtue of this section.  This means that this measure will bear severely on the PAYE payer only.  I know that the Minister's intention is good, but under the section as it stands this could happen.  People on fixed incomes will be caught and the people on variable incomes will not be caught. Indeed, the last speaker said that accountants were already working to avoid this section.  Perhaps that is what is really behind this situation.  Perhaps the Minister had to give a sop to the Labour <Col N="1006" /> Party and that that is why he has introduced a system which will give a sop to the Labour Party and offer the self-employed a way out.</P>

      <P>I have given some Members of the Coalition credit for being smart.</P>
      <P>This Bill also contains a number of petty measures one of which relates to the exemption on deposit interest.  I have had elderly people with as little as £1,000 on deposit come to me for an explanation of this.  Having brought up their children they are now enjoying a little endowment, when they suddenly read that the Minister will reduce the £70 to £50 or the overall £150 to £120.  They are disturbed about this and it takes a fair bit of explaining. But at the end of the day they are bitterly disappointed that even the little interest allowance they were getting on their post office or bank deposit is being pulled back by this Government.  That is a scandalous situation.  Some years ago I suggested that the Department of Finance might take some advice from the Japanese whose approach is to encourage people, to give them more interest freedom, but to give it for money invested in State or selected investments.  We must spend money to make money.  Anyone in business would say that one should advertise when business is going well but when things are going badly it is even more important to advertise.  This Bill does not provide for advertising.  This measure indicates that.  For the Minister to hunt little people with their little savings is scandalous.  I do not understand the reason behind it and it is objectionable. There should be an incentive.</P>
      <P>The second petty thing in this Bill relates to the allowance for the year of marriage.  There was always a rush before April to get married so as to avail of the full year's benefit.  The Minister is doing away with this now.  The huge rush is gone now.  This was obviously a small help to people in the first year of their marriage.  Why take away the small props that people have at that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another petty thing was cutting the <Col N="1007" /> PRSI allowance from £312 to £286.  When that was originally introduced I regarded it as being the equivalent of the pension content of the PRSI contribution.  Of the PRSI contribution of 5.5 per cent an amount is allocated for unemployment, for sickness and for pension purposes. With regard to the amount for pension purposes a worker was given an annual allowance in tax terms amounting to approximately £312 or £314.  That meant that there was equity in the sense that the person who was paying the full rate of PRSI was getting an allowance for the amount of his contribution that was going for pension purposes.  All others get an allowance on the amount that goes for pension purposes.  I viewed that as an improvement in terms of equity and I was disappointed when I discovered that it was being reduced without reference to what its equivalent was.  That means that if things are bad in another year it could be reduced further and that amount of equity taken away.  That was a petty move.</P>
    <P>I expected to see a provision in the Bill providing for a payment for low income families, as promised in the budget. Hopefully, it will be introduced at some stage.  However, the Bill proposes to remove the double week payment in September and December for low income families on social welfare.  That scheme cost £4 million in 1982 and would have cost more this year.  It is my view that if a measure which was promised in the budget is not contained in the Finance Bill we are entitled to comment on it. Presumably, the Minister will indicate when it is proposed to introduce that payment.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Minister announced an increase for passports, a reasonable thing to do to collect money to offset some of the other charges.  However, I have discovered that elderly people and those who are handicapped who go to Lourdes on organised tours or with voluntary agencies now find that instead of having to find £10 for a passport they must pay £30 per head.  I have made representations about that but the Passport Office informed me that there was <Col N="1008" /> not anything they could do about it.  The Minister should look at the possibility of leaving the charge for passports for such people at £10.  Such a move would be welcome.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is about the reality of the strategies and policies being implemented by the Coalition, not about their promises, pre-election or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I do not think I said very much about social welfare.  Five months ago the Coalition made a number of promises.  They promised that the proportion of tax derived from PAYE on wages and salaries would be reduced, but that has not been carried out.  In fact, the proportion of tax has been increased. They promised that there would be a reduction of the PRSI on gross income below £120 per week, but that has not been kept, and since the budget more is being paid than before.  The Coalition also promised that the indirect tax increases would be minimised in order to help reduce inflation, but that did not happen.  We are all aware that indirect taxes were increased by at least 4 per cent this year.  We were told that tax credits would be substituted for tax allowances, but that proposal has been dropped quietly. Perhaps the Minister will explain the reason the Government have not kept those promises.  We were told also that the Government would maintain the living standards of social welfare beneficiaries, but that has not been done.  The National Development Corporation, which was promised, has not been set up yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of tax evasion and avoidance, Deputy Enright sounded a note that most Deputies are concerned about, the extent to which measures may be used to invade the privacy of the home of an individual.  I share Deputy Enright's view.  I am concerned that the Minister ensures that reasonable controls are <Col N="1009" /> exercised on the invasion of anyone's privacy. I am sure that matter will be debated at length on Committee Stage. With regard to the question of tax evasion and avoidance, there is a duty on the Government to effectively administer this area.  There are potential savings to be made there and there is also the question of equity and fair play.  The duty is on the Government, and the Revenue Commissioners, to deal with that matter. We support the efforts to achieve the potential savings, but I must warn against over-reaction in this direction because there is a danger that the cure might become worse than the disease.  We must ensure that there is not an undue preoccupation with administrative controls.</P>
    <P>For the first time in recent years the Finance Bill does not provide increases for social welfare beneficiaries from 1 April.  This year those increases will be effective from the end of June or the beginning of July.  There has been a systematic reduction of old age pensions and pensions for widows and the handicapped. There has also been the loss of the double week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a general reference to social welfare.  I hope the Chair will not mind if I mention that children's allowances are being devalued. In fact, the Minister for Health stated recently that he has proposed that children's allowances should be taxed.  That is an aspect of social welfare he obviously will be attempting to bring under the scope of the Bill.  Not only have the Government not increased those allowances but now we have a proposal from a Cabinet member that they should be taxed.  There is a relationship between these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as a whole misses the point in relation to planning and development.  It is strong on control and on book-keeping. As an instrument of economic policy it has failed.  If managers followed the lead <Col N="1010" /> given by the Minister for Finance there would be no hope, no investment and a prolonged recession.</P>
    <P>The budget and Finance Bill set the targets and the climate for the year.  We used to say in the House some time ago that it was important to build in a three year element and to look forward.  There is no question of development this year because the Bill sets no targets for growth and development.  Performance cannot be measured in these terms.  This Finance Bill will not lead to a systematic reduction of those in genuine need.  It will not create jobs, which are our greatest need.  That was emphasised by the Taoiseach this morning.  It will not attract investment, encourage enterprise or exports although it will go some way towards dealing with tax evasion and avoidance.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government are totally preoccupied with book-keeping in the Bill and have increased taxation under a smokescreen of tackling evasion to the exclusion of development, shows clearly their inability to lead us out of the present depression.  Predicting more unemployment and hardship, as the Taoiseach is doing, is a poor excuse for leadership, courage and for a practical sense of direction.  There is no sense of direction but rather a full stop as far as economic development is concerned.  It is no wonder that managers and investors whose assets are reasonably fluid are considering pulling out.  Their only hope and that of the unemployed is that this Government will pass and, and in the interests of the country, the sooner it does the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two clear and essential elements necessary in a budget and a Finance Bill.  One directive has to apply itself to the question of dealing with receipts and payments which will accrue to the State during the coming year but the other, no less important, must be directed towards the economic progress and well-being of the country during the years ahead.  I agree with the criticisms of the budget as brought into print in the Finance Bill in that there is a major failing to give a prognosis of the economic development of the country in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> We are at a time of crisis and at a stage when our unemployment is at an all time high.  Industries are falling by the wayside day by day and those industries which we were led to assume were the lifeblood of the country are dissipating and falling away before our eyes.  It has been put to us that the budgetary measures in the Bill are an introductory measure to control the economic situation, but my fear is that when the time comes when control ends &mdash; if it ever does &mdash; and we look to an upturn, what will there be left to turn up?  Those industries will have gone and there will be no bringing them back.  Factories will have closed down and skills will have been lost.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as the budget, attracted great criticism on the grounds that it does not embody equity in taxation.  That is a reasonable criticism in many respects.  I know it was put together at relatively short notice and the parameters were fixed.  From the point of view of equity in taxation it leaves a great deal unsaid, particularly in the area of capital taxation. Fianna Fáil may make noises about equity and what should or should not be done.  They never refer to the fact that they abolished the wealth tax when they came into office.  This was the first step towards equity in taxation which was brought in by a Coalition Government. There is great hesitation on the part of Fianna Fáil speakers to refer to that.  One can never forget the cheers that went up when the abolition of this key element in capital taxation was announced.</P>
    <P>We are faced with almost 200,000 people unemployed.  The taxation base has narrowed to an extent we never had before.  Instead of those people producing and contributing to the taxes of the State, thereby easing the burden across the board, they through no wish of their own are in the reverse situation and are a burden on the State in the sense that provision must be made for them in taxation to pay out massive sums in social welfare payments.  These must be raised under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are many factors which have brought about this situation.  I shall concentrate on one aspect which was a major <Col N="1012" /> factor in bringing about this intolerable burden of taxation on the working population, as shown in the rebellion, upsurge and disquiet exhibited in the tax marches and protests which have taken place and which will be the ongoing position.  We have been practising the notion of free trade.  The idea of taking any steps to protect our vulnerable industries is not accepted by any Minister.  This matter is frequently raised in the House. It was raised noisily today.  The purpose of my contributing to the Bill is to advocate, as an item of policy, that we should initiate a selective, limited, temporary policy of protection for certain of our vulnerable industries.  When this matter is raised Ministers say it would be dangerous and a serious step to take, that we are an exporting nation and rely on exports to a very large extent.  The implication is that free trade is practised by everyone else.  The big fallacy in that argument is that that implication is completely removed from the truth.  I do not say that on my own say so.  I refer to an investigation and report which was carried out on this subject in great depth by a committee of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.  The document concerned is No. 5052 of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly published on 19 April 1983 and adopted by the plenary session.  On page 1 it states:</P>
    <P>Despite appeals by OECD and GATT the international trading system is becoming less liberal and more protectionist.</P>
    <P>On page 2, paragraph 5 it states:</P>
    <P>Sectoral and bilateral arrangements are becoming increasingly prominent features of the international trading system and the GATT rules are frequently ignored.</P>
    <P>At page 11, paragraph 35, it is stated that most countries continue to resort to protectionist measures.  These apply to more and more industrial sectors and taken an ever wider variety of forms.  For instance, these measures are so numerous and varied that only a small number are mentioned in this paragraph.  They include administrative harassment, <Col N="1013" /> health regulations, industrial standards, legal obstacles and economic and commercial sanctions.  In a recent survey the GATT secretariat identified more than 600 non-tariff measures.  The conclusion is that public opinion has very little idea of the extent to which protectionism is inherent in the present day trading systems.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in suggesting that public opinion has little idea of it, unfortunately I suggest that some of our Ministers also have very little idea of that fact.  We in this country are the prime observers of the rules among the industrial countries, if we can include ourselves in that category.  We are the ones who are observing the rules, at tremendous cost to ourselves in terms of employment and in failing to provide opportunities for our young people.  The Council of Europe, which represents 21 countries, recognises the fact, as reported, at paragraph 9 of the report, that protective customs measures may be necessary in some cases to cope with serious unemployment and balance of payments problems.</P>
    <P>I appeal for a review of our policy regarding the free trade which we accord to our imports and which has thrown many of our vital industries to the wolves. Some people are protesting at that.  We saw what happened in regard to the import of potatoes yesterday.  That is very much the thin end of the wedge.  Not only the Council of Europe has recognised the fact that protectionism in the world is now rampant.  The CII also produced a report, on 29 March last, confirming the fact that there is an increasing trend towards protectionism in some EEC countries.  This is widespread throughout the free world &mdash; we do not have to remark on the Eastern European countries.</P>
    <P>What is the effect of it all?  The employment rate, our capacity to produce and to manufacture are being thrown to the wolves and being abandoned.  I will point to one industry, but that case could be applied in equal force to virtually all our industries.</P>
    <P>Take the case of manufactured fertilisers. I have the index of the last report <Col N="1014" /> of the CSO, published on 4 May 1983.  It shows that during March last we imported £16 million worth of manufactured fertilisers.  I discussed recently the situation with the senior executive of a firm that manufacture fertilisers and he told me that his factory has worked on a regular basis for many years past to a set procedure, two months every year.  They make all the fertilisers they can sell during the entire year and at the end of the two months they automatically close down.  And we are importing up to £60 million worth per month.  Those workers are being provided for in this Finance Bill: the taxation is being raised in this Bill to provide for those people for ten months in this financial year.  That is another thin end of the wedge.</P>
    <P>The same thing happened in regard to Ranks in Limerick; we had it in Telectron and we had it in Clondalkin.  This is the time when we have to look after our own position as every country in the free trading world is doing.  There was a very ancient saying in the Ethics of the Fathers, many thousands of years ago, &ldquo;If we are not for ourselves who will be for us?&rdquo;. If not now, when?  To whom are we going to look to see about employment for our young people, for the preservation of our industries in preparation for the good times that we are told are coming?  Will the EEC Commission do it for us?  I see no indication that they will.  Will the AT &amp; T do it?  Will the Dunlop Tyre Company of Britain do it?</P>
    <P>We have been the observers of these laws too long and now is the time to review that situation and to have a look at what our trading partners are doing in this field.  And when the Minister in a reply here said that we dare not do that because of the effect it would have, my answer is that they are doing those things to us already: it already has happened. The riposte, the retaliation, is not that they will retaliate on us: this is our retaliation. We must stand on our own feet henceforth if we are to have an economic future.</P>

      <P>In discussing the Finance Bill it is necessary at the outset to take in context the economic situation <Col N="1015" /> which the country faces and which the Minister for Finance has had to face up to &mdash; a situation which he inherited and which had been inherited previously by this Government in June 1981.  Unfortunately the situation we inherited last November was worse.  It is important to consider the overall approach of the Government to the financial difficulties, the economic problems, which are besetting the country.  We have to consider the amount of money that is owed to outside concerns and we have to discuss the high unemployment figures.</P>
      <P>All these problems have to be faced up to.  The existence of the problems must be acknowledged and faced up to in the coming months and years.  The Finance Bill provides for high taxation levels which unavoidably had to be introduced. There was no other option open to the Minister for Finance in relation to achieving the objects which he set out when he introduced the budget.  There had to be an effort to reduce foreign borrowing, to reinstate our competitiveness and to ensure that the less well off people in our society would be protected.</P>
      <P>In dealing with several aspects of the Bill before us, we hope that when the situation will improve certain measures will be looked at again with a view to finding taxes elsewhere, or to look hopefully at the possibility that less tax will have to be imposed so that the burden will be lightened on certain sections of society.  There has been much talk about tax evasion and about bringing equity into our tax system.  Part of this talk has been exaggerated because though tax evasion has gone on, is going on and no doubt will go on despite the measures in this Bill, it is important to look at ways to reduce the overall tax burden which many people have to face each week. Much of their wages are taken up in the various tax measures, where so much money has to be collected to keep the country going, to provide essential services and make sure that the less well off in our society are looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the proposed residential property tax.  Every tax will be unpopular to a <Col N="1016" /> certain extent.  Every penny collected by way of tax is necessary to make sure that this country remains viable, that our debt is reduced and that our competitiveness is maintained.  I hope the residential property tax collected will benefit the areas in which it is collected.  In my constituency of Dún Laoghaire a number of people will be affected by this tax.  Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin County Council are in severe financial difficulties and I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to my suggestion that the money collected by way of residential property tax will be used to the benefit of that area.  A percentage of that money should be spent improving roads, local conditions and ensuring that the local authority can provide the necessary services.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the powers given to inspectors under section 94 if they are not satisfied with the assessments made. Under this Bill if an inspector is not satisfied with an assessment he can make another assessment.  He has power of entry into a private residence and he can assess the value of the house.  This is an infringement of the rights of privacy of a householder.  I hope the Minister will tell us in what circumstances this right will be availed of by the inspectors.  In regard to valuations, whose valuation will be taken into account?  Depending on the climate of the time and other circumstances, various valuations will be given by auctioneering firms and estate agents.  It is important that the Minister say which valuation will be used.  This Bill provides that 75 per cent of the tax will have to be paid if a person appeals an assessment.  I hope this too can be gone into more fully.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 78 in which the Minister recognises the problems being faced by the tourist industry.  He recognises the contribution the tourist industry makes to the economy and the need to attract visitors.  I am glad to see the VAT rate for accommodation has been reduced. This has been acknowledged by the hotel federation as very important.  In these difficult times we must attract as much money into the country as possible.  If we charge tourists less for accommodation they would spend more on entertainment. <Col N="1017" /> When they are presented with their hotel bills at the end of their stay they would see accommodation was not too expensive and they would be encouraged to return and tell their friends about their holiday.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 29 which provides for the continuation of a scheme to encourage firms taking on extra employees. I do not know how many people benefited from this scheme last year but anything that can be done to encourage firms to take on extra staff at a time when many people are unemployed, despite having undergone various training courses and acquiring skills, is to be encouraged.  It will be interesting to hear how many people benefited from this scheme and how many firms employed extra staff.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about tax evasion and tax problems.  The penalties which have been introduced should be used where necessary.  It is important that we look at this matter from the point of view of improving the present situation when people wish to get information from the Revenue Commissioners and talk to their tax inspectors. The Minister said administrative changes willl be introduced and I will be interested to hear any definite proposals he has in this regard.  The public should be able to get information more easily than they do up to now.  It should be possible for them to visit their tax inspector and have their case dealt with sympathetically. If they are willing to pay their fair share of tax, they should not be inundated with numerous forms.  For small businessmen who have to make VAT returns regularly special arrangements should be made because they are assisting the Revenue Commissioners to collect taxes and this procedure should be made as simple as possible.</P>
    <P>The small savers should be encouraged. They have been affected by the reduction in the interest-free allowance. If things improve &mdash; and hopefully they will from next year on &mdash; the Minister could increase this amount again.  The introduction of this measure shows the magnitude of the problem and the amount of tax needed to be collected. <Col N="1018" /> Every penny collected under this Bill is needed to provide the many services needed to keep this country running.</P>
    <P>When looking at the Finance Bill before the House it is important to remember the overall strategy of the Government in reducing the need for borrowing, in maintaining competitiveness and in making sure that the many who depend on the various welfare allowances are looked after.  I hope that the Minister will take up some of the matters mentioned by me.</P>
    <P>I understand that Deputy Lynch wishes to contribute.  It is unfortunate that this debate was curtailed due to an extra large number of Private Notice Questions being taken yesterday and today.  However, I hope that sufficient time will be given on Committee Stage to discuss some of the sections which might need slight modification and will certainly need clarification by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On 9 February, the Minister in his Budget Statement set out the aims which he wished to achieve. They were: reduction in borrowing, improvement in our competitiveness and minimising the effects of the recession on the less well-off members of our community. In his recent Finance speech he added the countering of tax evasion and the improving of tax collection.</P>
      <P>The question to be answered is: does this Bill achieve the fulfilment of those aims?  I believe that it does not.  The main thrust of the Bill is to increase taxation receipts by various methods such as no increase in personal allowances, a lame duck residential property tax, advance corporation tax, penal VAT rates, farm taxation, tax charged on illegal profits and the tightening up of the appeals procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill singularly fails to provide any incentive or encouragement to bring about balance and continual economic development which is essential for the future of this country, essential in reducing <Col N="1019" /> the unemployment level which would, in turn, provide more funds for the Exchequer.  As the tax paid shrinks, which it does every day, the amount of revenue available from income tax also shrinks.  It is clear to everybody from the closures day after day that the tax base is shrinking at an alarming rate, despite the figures published last month regarding the unemployment level.  Those figures are already out of date.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, employees and all workers are being savagely taxed.  Even though they are, the targets set out in the budget will not be achieved.  The only option then open to the Minister, if he wishes to reduce borrowing, will be a reduction in spending on public services.  That decision would defeat his third aim which is to minimise the effect of the recession on the lower paid workers.  Unless the Labour members of the Government partnership get their way, those who will be hurt most will be the ordinary working people.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the reduction in the hotel VAT rate from 23 per cent to 18 per cent.  This reduction is laudable because it is very necessary.  However, no comments were made on other items, one with which I disagree wholeheartedly being the reduction in the threshold for registration under section 68.  The threshold for deep sea fishermen is reduced from £15,000 to £12,000, for businesses consisting of not less than 90 per cent of sale of taxable goods, from £30,000 to £25,000 and for general trades and professional businesses from £15,000 to £12,000.  From my experience I am aware that people in those categories have been clinging to their livelihoods by the skin of their teeth and this change is a body blow to many of them.  I fear that many will go out of business because, although the increase in VAT might not be so considerable, there is extra time needed in preparing VAT returns.  No matter how small a business, there is a vast amount of paper work to be done and if people have to concentrate on paper work that will take away from their producing income.  The benefit accruing to the <Col N="1020" /> Exchequer from the reduction of these thresholds will be very small and this was a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>Putting VAT on coal, peat and other solid fuel substances and also gas and oil could not by any stretch of the imagination be described as helpful to the less well-off members of our community. Much furore was made by the present Government regarding payment of VAT at point of entry, when introduced by the last Government.  Having examined the small print, I fail to find any repeal legislation and perhaps the Minister would look into the possibility of getting rid of this imposition.  I never agreed with taxation at the point of entry.</P>

      <P>Such VAT changes and increased VAT charges on farmers, the majority of whom are not as wealthy as some reporters would have us believe, have had a detrimental effect on businesses and on the cost of running households since their imposition.  Together with the high rate of PRSI, they have helped to deflate the economy.  Add to that the non-increase in personal allowances and the narrowing of the tax bands and we are assured of a continued reduction in consumption for the present.</P>
      <P>Especially hit are the young married couples by the taking away of the allowance for the year of marriage.  This is indicative of the lack of &ldquo;cop-on&rdquo; of the present Government, because not only does that affect the married couples but also shops such as those selling furniture and other household items.  Most young married couples, on getting the tax free refund, use that money in purchasing furniture and other household fittings.  I ask the Minister to reconsider replacing that allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of sections 3 and 4 dealing with the payment to separated couples.  The residential property <Col N="1021" /> tax is a plausible sop to the socialist partners in Government.  Significantly, there are enough loopholes left in it for Fine Gael's rich friends and backers to escape what could have been a ticklish problem for them.</P>

      <P>This is an unfair task in that it aggregates the income of the whole household.  In many cases the father and mother may be retired and have four or five sons living with them.  Those children would be liable to that tax even though they may never at any stage gain any benefit from that house.</P>
      <P>The tax appeals procedures have been abused over the years by some people in order not to pay tax.  There were also some people who did not abuse the system purposely but who for many reasons did not make returns.  Undoubtedly, it was necessary to have those procedures improved.  I might pose this question to the Minister: what would be the course of action open to a person making a late appeal if he did not have the money to pay the tax assessed plus interest?  That person might be experiencing cash flow difficulties.  If he did not have the money to pay that tax would his appeal be upheld?  For example, would he have to sell his business when it might turn out at the end of the day that he did not owe any tax?  In that event he might then have a few shillings but no business.  Furthermore, with regard to tax appeals I do not agree with the provision that appeals be held in open court in the Supreme Court. This could affect many firms with regard to trade secrets and so on.  For example, if another competitor was able to come in and listen to proceedings it might not be of benefit to the appellant.</P>
      <P>Taxation is to be extended now to every member of the farming community. Previously farmers submitted a form of simplified accounts which the taxman would not accept.  I hope the new type of accounts to be furnished will be acceptable to the taxman so that the farmer will not be told to get another accountant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the notion of taxation <Col N="1022" /> of illegal profits what should be done is that all profits from such illegal activities should be confiscated and penalties imposed on those carrying out those illegal activities.  The very idea of putting such a provision in legislation seems to suggest an acceptance and blessing of such illegal activities.</P>
    <P>Having studied the Bill and its implications I believe the Minister has failed to attain the goal he set out to attain. Because of the failure to improve our competitiveness to date, as was conceded this morning by the Taoiseach, and the deflation of our economy caused by the budgetary measures, the targets for taxation receipts cannot be achieved.  Therefore, unless there is effected a further reduction in public service expenditure, borrowing will have to be increased.  Also the VAT increases, low social welfare increases, reduced disposable incomes, because of no increases given in personal allowances and the narrowing of the tax bands have worsened the lot of the less well-off members of our community.  The Central Bank guideline for credit for 1982 was 14 per cent, of which 6 per cent only was taken up.  This is indicative of the fact that consumption went down and continues to do so.  From that follows a fall in tax receipts.  Indeed, all of the foregoing point to a falling-off in tax receipts.  This reduction, coupled with increased repayments on our foreign borrowings due to the realignment within the EMS and the strengthening of the dollar, makes it clear for those who wish to see it that borrowing will not be reduced.  Increased taxes, PRSI levies and dubious-tax evasion and appeals provisions, together with advanced corporation tax, will not help in any way but rather will reduce the competitiveness of all businesses.  By no stretch of the imagination have the less well-off members of our community been helped by the budget nor by the social welfare provisions, penal VAT rates on fuel and so on. Indeed, the methods of improving tax collection by way of appeals legislation are extremely dubious and I doubt if they will be successful.</P>
    <P>This Bill has failed miserably to grasp the nettle of making our tax system more <Col N="1023" /> fair and equitable.  Cosmetic operations have been applied but, as is the case with much of what we hear from the far side of the House, when the time for action arrives it is shirked.  This Bill and the budget fail miserably to attain the goals set out.  Especially, they fail to do anything to solve the greatest problem obtaining in our society today, that is, unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I might take up the last point made by Deputy M. Ahern.  There is a great deal of irony in hearing a Member of his party say with such conviction that his impression is that, when the time comes for action, it is shirked.  He had spent the previous 15 minutes taking issue in one way or another with the action now being taken by this Government, action which is rendered more difficult and severe by the very fact that it was not taken three years ago when the leader of his party had identified correctly, as many of us then believed then, the kind of action that was required.  To say at the end of a contribution such as Deputy Ahern's that action is being shirked illustrates to me that, unfortunately, some of this debate has been conducted on the basis of opposition for opposition's sake.  I do not think it is very constructive, nor do I think it is very helpful either to this House or to the general public to approach the debate in that context.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the debate on the Finance Bill is a difficult one.  In all of the years that I have been interested in one way or another in Finance Bills I cannot remember any year when a Finance Bill passed through this House without being criticised more or less severely by Deputies on all sides of the House on account of various of its provisions.  Of course, it is in the nature of a Bill like this that that kind of debate should take place because we are here dealing with the measures required to implement the tax changes announced in the budget.  We tend to concentrate on tax measures when talking about the Finance Bill and not to look at the other side of the equation, which is the expenditure side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> A certain amount of the criticism, I might say the unreality, of some of the comments made about this year's Finance Bill derive directly from the fact that it gives people the excuse to talk about taxation without looking at expenditure.  It is a pity that it should be so because we have suffered here for many years and are now paying the price for the fact that we conducted so many of our economic debates without taking the two sides of the equation into account.  In many ways we are now up against the argument and have no option but to take the two sides into account. There are many people in our community and indeed in this House who are finding it a very difficult process with which to come to grips.  But we must get to grips with it because until we do we will be replicating situations, year after year, in which the very criticisms made during this debate of tax measures will become more and more part of our daily round and a more obtrusive part of the State's activity in the financial area generally.</P>
    <P>The debate has ranged very widely over matters raised in the Bill and indeed, in spite of your best efforts, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, over a number of matters not contained in the Bill.  In the time remaining for this debate I shall have to be somewhat selective in dealing with matters that have been raised.</P>
    <P>I must say that the Bill as it stands, and for some of the reasons I have outlined, has been represented by a number of Deputies, in particular by Deputies O'Kennedy and Woods, as being concerned only with the tax evasion problems. This is a total misrepresentation of the Bill.  The very fact that Deputies O'Kennedy and Woods spent a great deal of time talking about features of it other than the tax evasion measures makes my point for me.</P>
    <P>Tax evasion is, of course, a central part of the concern underlining this Bill, but to represent a Bill of this magnitude as a purely anti-evasion Bill is a caricature of what the Bill really is.  I would be as concerned &mdash; and I have said this on a number of occasions &mdash; as any Member about our present high level of taxation and I would in general agree with Deputies <Col N="1025" /> who pointed to the problems caused on productive activity and employment by our high level of taxation.  If we are really concerned about the high level of taxation and with the remedies, then we have to look at the other side of the equation.  Anti-evasion measures will make some improvements in terms of tax revenue and tax equity but they will not do anything to deal with the other side of the equation.</P>
    <P>Anti-evasion measures will help to bring in more revenue by extending our tax base and we think some extensions of the tax base at its present level will also help.  There is not any doubt in my mind, and I think a great many would agree with this, that there is a large area of untaxed revenue into which we can move in order to relieve substantially the problems that arise from our present high level of taxation.  There are some areas where extra revenue can obviously be raised &mdash; and I think there would be agreement on both sides that greater revenue should be raised &mdash; but to think we can raise the amounts of revenue required to make a significant difference to the overall level of taxation on productive activity would be a delusion. Looking for solutions to our present problems in that way only is very unproductive and to present it in that way would do no favour to those who are most concerned, namely, those who want to know whether they will continue to have a job and those who are not in work at the moment and would like to know they have a reasonable prospect within a reasonable time of getting a job.  It is against that background that it is proper to look at the provisions of this Bill and what it aims to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy tended to suggest that the concern in this Bill with tax evasion would give rise to apprehensions, tensions and divisions in our society.  He implied that the measures designed to deal with tax evasion would give rise to a certain amount of hysteria.  I am not so sure he was really convinced that would be the case because I did not hear him at any point seriously suggesting that this was an issue we did not need to tackle.  I think it is generally agreed it is an issue <Col N="1026" /> we must tackle, and tackle vigorously, and that is what we have set out to do in this Bill.  I would make the point that there is nobody who is paying his or her due tax who needs to be in any degree worried about the new tax evasion provisions provided in this Bill.  The vast majority of our taxpayers pay their due taxes &mdash; there is no doubt about that &mdash; and those who pay their due taxes more or less on time have nothing whatever to fear from more vigourous and better thought-out ways of countering tax evasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy moved on from the question of tax evasion to the question of equity.  He was not very specific in putting forward any suggestions as to how we could bring about greater equity in our system.  My view is that the antitax evasion measures we have brought in are the first move in this direction, because there is no doubt that if we tackle evasion effectively we will correct what is objectionable in the system and thereby bring about a greater degree of equity.  Having done that in the circumstances of this year and, indeed, in the short time available to build a programme of this kind, my contention would be that we have made a substantial contribution to improving the equity of the system and my intention would be that we would go on from here and, as a next step, go further into the area of the structure of our system in order to find a way in which the structure can be revised so as to bring about an even greater degree of equity.</P>
    <P>During the course of his contribution Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the report of the Commission on Taxation. Indeed he waved it around, something he has done on a number of occasions in recent weeks, but he carefully avoided giving any indication of what his party's view is about the main recommendations in that report.  I am bound to say that since that report was published there has been no substantial statement from the Fianna Fáil Party as to their view on the main recommendations in that report and no indication as to what that party's view is as to what we should do about it.  On this side there has been no lack of clarity <Col N="1027" /> in our approach.  As I said, in present circumstances I do not believe it is a practicable proposition to proceed with the implementation of the central recommendation.  In saying that I am not in any way criticising that recommendation. I am simply making the point that, in the circumstances of the time and given the problems that exist in respect of the level of taxation, people's perception of that level and the Exchequer condition, it is not at the moment a practicable proposition to implement holus bolus the main proposal in that report.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed some unease about the additional powers in certain areas which this Bill confers on the Revenue Commissioners.  A number of Deputies questioned the provision which would mean that the hearing of tax cases in the High and Supreme Courts would no longer take place in secret. These are two points it was reasonable to raise and two points to which a proper response can be given.  As far as the additional powers of the Revenue Commissioners are concerned it is clear that in our system, as it stands, there is room for considerable delay and there is a great deal of room for exploitation by people who do not want to pay their taxes on time or who feel that by spinning out the process they can reduce their liability. I have been concerned to give the Revenue Commissioners the extra powers required in order to shorten the process and make the system more effective, to remove the facility, indeed the incentive, that is there for people to postpone the payment of their taxes.  This is being done on the basis of giving them just that amount of extra time they require.</P>
    <P>The very fact of shortening that appeals process will make our system more efficient in terms of the use of available manpower.  It will also make it much more equitable.  The system will be seen in that way by those who do not have the option of resorting to a long series of appeals in order to postpone or even put off the payment of their taxes.  So far as the hearing of tax cases in the High Court and in the Supreme Court are concerned, the putting forward of changes in the <Col N="1028" /> appeals procedure will in itself reduce the number of cases that are susceptible in terms of being brought to court.  My intention is that those cases that would be brought to court would not be ones where the dispute is about the amount of the tax or about the computation of the tax but rather cases in which the difficulty relates to a point of tax law.  Therefore, those cases that would come to court could be cases in which there would be an interest in establishing a point of law. I do not see any reason for there being any secrecy about the courts establishing that the Revenue Commissioners were right or otherwise in not accepting the kind of scheme being put forward in relation to the abatement of tax.  Whether it was a question of proving the Revenue Commissioners right or of proving the taxpayer right it would be useful and desirable that the public would be aware of the situation.</P>

      <P>I accept the concern being expressed in that respect but we are simplifying the appeals procedure by ensuring that those cases that do reach the courts are not ones in which the argument is about the amount of tax payable but cases in which the argument is about points of law.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We can have a detailed <Col N="1029" /> discussion on this on Committee Stage when I think Deputies will share my views on the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy expressed concern about section 83 which is the section relating to penalties.  He expressed dismay that negligence is now being elevated to the status of crime.  As I pointed out by way of interjection, that is not the case.  Negligence has a special meaning in law in this respect.  It is already a matter that is covered by the law.  Therefore, we are not introducing something new into the law in this connection.  Deputy O'Kennedy made a point in relation to what is known as the section 23 incentive for rented residential accommodation. What I am proposing in this Bill is that from now on the tax relief in respect of expenditure on the kind of accommodation in question would be limited to the rental income derived from the property and not as at present to the total of rental income derived from within the State. The Deputy said this was a restriction to which he would object.  Personally, I would consider it eminently reasonable to say that if we are giving tax relief to an investor who has used his funds to build or to buy accommodation of this kind for renting out, the tax relief should apply directly to the proceeds of the rent.  I do not see any reason for extending that tax relief to rental income which that investor might have from other properties that he owns already but which have not been added to the stock of housing property by the provisions of the scheme in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla described the budget as being unfair, anti-working class and mean.  I utterly reject each of those adjectives.  At the same time I would have a great deal of sympathy in spirit with the situation as the Deputy sees it.  The situation in which we find ourselves as a nation could be described as unfair and anti-working class but we are faced with very serious economic difficulties and it is the job of Government to face those difficulties and to remedy them as best we can.  In our present circumstances it is essential that we take action that will lead to a relief of the burden on our working class, on the productive sector and on the <Col N="1030" /> community generally in terms of the levels of borrowing that we have seen in recent years and which now form such a heavy part of our public finances.  Until we do that we will be in what Deputy Mac Giolla referred to as an anti-working class situation because we will be obliged to continue taxing productive effort and taxing individuals at the level that is required in order to service those debts. Almost one-third of our revenue this year will be required to service those debts.  In other words, that proportion of our revenue will not be available to enable us to do what we would like to do from day to day, to promote the level of services from which people can benefit.  That is what is unfair and anti-working class but it is the problem to which we must address ourselves. That is why it is so important for us to bring back to public finances the kind of balance that we have set ourselves. It is only because we are concerned about prospects for employment, about prospects for equity in our society and about the prospects of relieving some of this burden both on the productive sector and on individuals that we are so determined to restore balance to our public finances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla accused the Government of eroding the welfare state to the detriment of the poor.  Again, that is an accusation that I would reject totally because what we are doing in bringing back balance to the public finances is protecting the capacity of the State to provide those services, to provide social welfare services and all the other services for the least well off.  If the State were to find itself in a position of not being able to do that, the people who would suffer most would be the very ones who depend for whatever reason on our social welfare system.  That is at the basis of our action. We must protect the capacity of the State to respond to those needs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla sees these matters differently.  He sees them in a way which I think is rather popular in the community. For example, he drew attention to the perilous burden of foreign debt and went on in the next breath to berate me for the action the Government are taking to prevent that debt from growing, to <Col N="1031" /> bring it under control.  The Deputy's argument is not consistent.  The criticism of the action we are taking and which is based on the notion that there is a difference between a concern with people and a concern with bringing public finances back into balance, represents the beginning of the cop-out.  It is the line that many people seem to take simply to turn away from the kind of action that is required precisely to meet the needs of individuals, and as I have said, to protect the State's capacity to meet the needs particularly of the less well off.</P>
    <P>There was the criticism also that the Government are axing productive capital spending.  I challenge those Deputies who made that criticism to be specific.  I would challenge them to say what particular items of capital spending they have in mind because there is no doubt but that the return we have got as a community from substantial amounts of capital spending in recent years has not been at the level that we would wish to see in economic terms, in terms of job creation or perhaps indeed even in social terms. That in any case is an area that must be dealt with very carefully.  There is no dispute in this House that borrowing for productive investment is something which every Government must be prepared to contemplate but borrowing for what is regarded as investment that does not produce a return is a very dangerous course of action and it is one which has placed a weight on our public finances that we are finding difficult to bear at this point.  What we have done in relation to the public capital programme this year has been done in a way that will reduce, as far as possible, the effect of the reductions that were required in the employment-generating capacity of the capital programme itself and of the economy in the investments to which it gives rise, the effects of which we hope will continue over a period of years.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the property tax.  A number of Deputies have made a series of points in this connection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Enright, Woods and Cosgrave expressed some concern about what they saw as the possibility of excessive intrusion by the Revenue Commissioners on taxpayers in the course of collecting this tax.  It is not in any way my intention that we should have a very intrusive method of operating this tax, which in itself is part of the reason why the tax is based, as a number of people have pointed out, on the idea of self-assessment.  It is not my intention that the operation of this tax should turn into an intrusion on people in their homes and if people accept the operation of the tax as it is set out that will not arise.  It has also been suggested that it is wrong in the formulation of this tax not to allow for the exemption of income received by way of old age pension.  That is a criticism which is made without having regard to the total picture of income that is being taken into account in determining thresholds for this tax.  It is required that the income of the household exceed £20,000 before any tax becomes payable so that it is not in any way, and could not be presented, as a tax that will concern people on the margin.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy ventured the opinion that the Government were losing the opportunity to take advantage of the improvement in our balance of payments position to relieve some of the burden of taxation on our economy.  I was very surprised to hear that kind of comment being made in the circumstances of today.  It ignores the reason why our balance of payments is not now the major constraint that it has been in recent years.  The main reason why this is so is to be found in the effects of recession on our economy.  It is not because our exports have been booming ahead at a huge rate, although we have been doing well on the exports side. It is not for that reason that our balance of payments has become less of a problem. It has been because the recession has affected consumption and activity in this economy to the level where imports are not rising anything like as fast as exports that we have a slow down in the level of imports and progress there in relation to the total size&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>During the last division one of our Members was refused his right to vote and was asked to leave the House by the Captain of the Guard.  Our clear understanding was that today you asked that Deputy to leave the House because you considered he was being disorderly and he did so.  When the division was called and when we could not raise the matter, we were informed that the Deputy was actually put out of the House today.  It is our understanding and it is his understanding &mdash; I have checked with a number of Members who were present in the House at the time &mdash; that when the Deputy was asked to leave he left immediately. We wish to know why he was refused his right to vote in the division.</P>

      <P>I have not personally read the transcript but my clear recollection of what happened today was that there was a grave disorder on a Private Notice Question about potatoes.  So bad was the disorder that the Chair found it necessary to adjourn the House for 15 minutes.  On resuming, the Chair called on Deputy Gregory to read a Private Notice Question which he had been allowed, thereby passing from the item which was the cause of the row.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ray Burke stood up and in a polite manner requested permission to put one question.  The Chair made it perfectly clear to the Deputy that he could not put the question, that the Chair had passed from the question dealing with potatoes to Deputy Gregory's question. Deputy Burke persisted, and persisted for quite a while, until he reached the stage where he was defying the Chair. The Chair, in the recollection of the Chair, called on Deputy Burke to resume his seat.  However, the Deputy declined to do this and persisted to ask this one question, whereupon the Chair ordered the Deputy to leave the House.  Deputy Burke did not leave the House.  The Chair intimated to him that he would name him.  The Chair was actually looking at and was in the process of calling the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Cluskey, to name him when Deputy Burke left the House. That, in the Chair's opinion, is an accurate account of what happened.</P>

      <P>I do not want to argue with the Chair about the difference between &ldquo;ask&rdquo; and &ldquo;order&rdquo; but I think you will accept if you were looking around the House and had intentions in your mind to name him the fact is that you did not name Deputy Ray Burke. The Standing Order No. 51, which I presume is the one you are quoting, asks if a Deputy is put out in that manner he is told he is going for the day's sitting.  In this case he was asked, following your interpretation of disorderly, and he left. At no time was he named or at no time was he told that he was not allowed in for the remainder of the day.  It seems that the Standing Order was not quoted to <Col N="1038" /> him.  This is very unreasonable.  While you asked him to leave you are now saying you ordered him out, which is a different interpretation.</P>

      <P>It is too late now, as far as we are concerned, for Deputy Burke to have voted in that last vote.  We feel, in the defence of our colleague, that we should protest at him not being allowed to vote.  I was in the House at the time. Deputy Burke is a robust debater but I think you will agree that he is not normally a disorderly Deputy.  My clear recollection is that right through he persisted in saying that he would accept your ruling.  Finally, my recollection is that you asked him to leave and he said: &ldquo;I will leave at your request&rdquo;.  This side of the House have to say that we are very positive that he was not ordered out of the House in accordance with the terms of Standing Order 51.  Therefore, with all due respect, I have to submit to you that you were in error in refusing him to vote on that last occasion.  I am not saying that in any carping spirit.  The matter is over now and Deputy Burke was not allowed to vote but in his defence I want to say that we regard him as having been badly done by in this matter and that, in fact, as an honourable man, when you asked him to leave, with some protest he did in fact leave of his own free will.</P>

      <P>It is quite true what Deputy Haughey says that Deputy Ray Burke kept protesting that he would obey the Chair but at the same time declined to obey the Chair.  It was only as a last resort, when I asked him to resume his seat and told him to leave the <Col N="1039" /> House and he did not do it that I was in the process of calling on the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Cluskey, to name him.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Reynolds on Tuesday, 10 May 1983:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the total failure of the Government to protect employment by not taking the necessary measures in time to prevent the collapse of an increasing number of major industrial firms.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. a1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that the Government is taking a number of important initiatives to assist in industrial development including the modification of arrangements for VAT on imports at point of entry, the establishment of an Employment Task Force of Ministers and a National Planning Board, and is preparing plans for a White Paper on Industrial Policy to include provision for a National Development Corporation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Last night I said very clearly that the Minister had completely ignored the motion and his amendment.  I went on to explain at some length the lack of urgency the Government appeared to apply to factory closures nowadays and the death wish they appear to have imposed on many of our State industries.  I said, with regard to Verolme Cork Dockyard, what a tragedy it was that the order that could have been placed in Belfast with Harland and Wolff was not placed there and was allowed to go to Japan for the second time in the <Col N="1040" /> history of Coalition Governments.  I honestly believe that was a major mistake by the Government.  If the order for that ship had been placed in that yard the spin off could have helped Verolme and the maintenance of the skills in that yard.  As well as that, the orders for the fishery research vessel and the fishery patrol vessel must be regarded as urgent because unless those orders are forthcoming it will not be a case of 400 redundancies but probably the vast majority of the work force becoming redundant.  I want the next speaker from the Government side to tell me their intentions with regard to Verolme Cork Dockyard, the placing of orders and to explain in great detail why the order for the bulk carrier was placed with the Japanese yard and not given to Harland and Wolff yard in Belfast.</P>
      <P>When in Government we made every effort to avoid factory closures and to prevent job losses.  We were constantly pilloried and misrepresented for doing so.  We were accused of extravagance and of mismanagement.  There is no Minister or Minister of State in the benches opposite.</P>

      <P>I was making the point that we were constantly pilloried and misrepresented for endeavouring to protect jobs and prevent factory closures. We were accused of extravagance and mismanagement.  I suggest to the House that there was a lot more hope, confidence and happiness in society then than there is now.  The policies of the Government are no substitute for the efforts we tried to make at a time of what we all agree is serious international recession.</P>
      <P>I have dwelt at length on the Irish Dunlop situation and on Verolme Cork Dockyard.  One only has to read the reports of the last ten days regarding the Irish Steel situation to see how confused we are.  On one particular day an account in one newspaper varied entirely from that which appeared in another newspaper. The Minister or somebody on his behalf, in the interests of the House, should tell us what the real position is with Irish Steel.  The Minister will have our full support in maintaining that very important strategic industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach really believe that by threatening to axe State enterprises and by forecasting that the present frightening situation will get even worse, as he did last weekend, he is contributing to the restoration of public confidence and the creation of the kind of climate which we will need in order to get investment in job creation on the scale we require?  I heard the Minister in the House last night and again today talking about the necessity to restore confidence.  Does he think his Taoiseach is doing this House and the country a service or disservice by his public utterances on this very important issue?  Does the Taoiseach or the Government really believe that we can increase the level of foreign investment here when we hear the Tánaiste threatening further dire impositions on the business and industrial community by <Col N="1042" /> way of further forms of wealth taxes yet to be devised?  Government spokesmen, including the Taoiseach, have tried to put across that the present appalling situation has been brought about entirely because of the world economic situation.  This is not true.  Let the Taoiseach try to tell that to the traders of Donegal and other Border areas.  No doubt he and his party members have been there in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>Instead of the drastic crisis in capital spending created by the Coalition budget what is urgently needed is a major programme of public and private investment to try to combat unemployment and to give hope to the many thousands of young people already unemployed and those about to leave school in the next month or so.  If ever a situation of no hope was created it is being created now. I ask the Minister, in deference to this House and to the people generally, to tell us where he and his Government stand. He must tell us through some of the other speakers now because he did not do it himself last night.</P>
    <P>I outlined at length the position of the National Development Corporation and the National Enterprise Agency.  The only reference the Minister made to such bodies in his speech was to say that the National Board for Science and Technology had been transferred from the Taoiseach's office and that that will solve all our problems in that respect.  He owes the House more.  He owes the House an explanation of all the points made in Government with regard to the Youth Employment Agency in the Labour-Fine Gael package prepared in December 1982.  I understand that we can expect in the near future some announcement regarding community enterprises.  Of course I welcome that.  I do not know what stage they are at.  We were supposed to have some announcements in May which have not yet come.  These are things that the Minister should tell the House at least in the interests of those young people who will be leaving school during the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>What has been happening?  We have had a succession of factory closures.  The Taoiseach then tells us that things will <Col N="1043" /> become even worse, some must close and there is no alternative to their closing. State enterprise must be checked, we must cut the costs still further and, obviously, cut employment also.  He asks where the money is to come from.  Where is the money to come from to meet the added needs of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance generally?</P>
    <P>The choice facing this Government is fairly clear.  Their performance to date has been so inept, divisive and hopeless that one must ask them as a matter of urgency to go back to talk about the rapid action of the injection of £100 million in infrastructural development that they promised us in that programme of December last.  It is now May and we have not seen it.  We have seen withdrawal. I ask the Minister through some of his speakers to give us some information in reply to the questions that Deputy Reynolds and I have asked during this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment of the Minister for Industry and Energy and I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Of all the debates going through the House now this is the most significant and important when we have 187,887 unemployed of whom 56,219 are under 25.  This is a tremendous economic and social problem which deserves a degree of seriousness and gravity which have not emanated from the opposite side of the House, last night expecially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When dealing with this area there can be no running away from the simple fact of the fundamental environment for employment.  While we have many indigenous advantages to attract foreign investment and for the expansion and development of various sectoral aspects of industry, essential cost inputs to industry &mdash; energy through electricity, telecommunications charges, transportation costs, through fuel costs and many industrial and other services, aside from the central industrial issue of restrictive trade practices in many of our professions &mdash; are the basic reason why we are falling down in the area of viable production. <Col N="1044" /> Be it in the agri-related area or manufacturing industry, we have not the fundamental basis of competitiveness to produce goods and services profitably and viably and thereby protect jobs.  The Government recognise the need to control inflation and interest rates before dealing with the symptoms that are highlighted by a debate such as this.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the speakers to this motion one would think that this problem of escalating unemployment had only just developed in the four months since 14 December.  Perhaps it is conveniently forgotten that in the last two years, on any 12-month basis, 40,000 jobs were lost.  Seeking to blame, the Fianna Fáil motion directly condemns the total failure of the Government.  We should be fair and look for blame on all sides in relation to the dilemma we find ourselves in.  The record shows that the previous Government did nothing to control the costs that I speak of.  That is one reason why I must not support The Workers' Party amendment which seems to put the emphasis on State-owned development of manufacturing industry as a solution to the unemployment problem through State industry.</P>
    <P>The reality is that part of our problem is the tax burden we must carry because our semi-State bodies this year will run at a loss of £170 million.  The high costs and high-cost structures in the semi-State bodies provide no real alternative in the free-trading economic world in which we live.  If we seek to apportion blame &mdash; in industrial relations &mdash; that is not very constructive but it is relevant when the Government are taking the flak we see in regard to the crucial pay guidelines that are to be negotiated that staff of the ESB are prepared to cause a blackout if necessary, regardless of the effects right across our whole economy.  Also a major company, Asahi, are crippled on a dayto-day basis while the parent company are reviewing their future operations, and this is due to an NBU strike in CIE. In many receivership instances we see the failure of companies as going concerns because of the claims and efforts of those who are due for redundancy in the attempt to preserve the company and <Col N="1045" /> whatever remaining rationalised jobs can be preserved.  Their wish for severance pay and for many other claims weigh over and above statutory redundancy payments which means that the receiver does not have the money.  Under law the Government do not have the money either and, therefore, the investor who wishes to take over the company cannot do so because there is a lack of co-operation.</P>
    <P>I learned today that in a company in Dublin, which is struggling to survive, absenteeism &mdash; and this is true of many companies &mdash; on Mondays, especially during the summer, is as high as 30 per cent.  These are some of the reasons. We must also look at our banking system. The interest rates, and I am not necessarily speaking about the free market rate, are simply higher and the profit percentages are also higher than in other countries and, therefore, they limit the money and costs that any business can carry.  If we are apportioning blame, we should be realistic about it.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Reynolds mentioned that the early warning system which he had rightly set up in Government had broken down and that the Government are doing nothing to counter the problems in this area.  I have it directly from the Department and those concerned that the efforts in relation to identifying the warning signals prior to the advent of receivership have intensified over the past few years.  Through a diversity of State organisations, namely IPC, the lending institutions of the ICC and the ACC and, of course, the rescue operations of the State agencies directly responsible, the rescue board of the IDA and Fóir Teoranta have weekly meetings which have been intensified.  In the instances of the companies in question, Telectron, Dunlop and Black and Decker, every effort was made by the State agencies to prevent them from closing.</P>
    <P>There is an ACOT advisory service through which there is daily communication with all the rescue agencies in an integrated and co-ordinated way to ensure that everything possible is done to avert receivership.  It is fair to point out that in <Col N="1046" /> the case of these companies, where they had European operations, their rationalisation programme and losses were not limited solely to Ireland.  The action they had to take was regrettable but it, too, was not related only to Ireland.  In the case of Black and Decker, my information is that they had been on a three day week for some years now and, although Deputy Lenihan said the closure was out of the blue, I am assured that everybody in the area knew there were problems for quite a considerable time.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention what the Government are doing now in this area. The Minister mentioned that the planning board has been set up, that there were changes in regard to regulations relating to VAT on imports at the point of entry, the employment task force and the national planning board.  I was interested in discussing with SFADCo their proposals in relation to the food sector. They have intensive development now in relation to this sector and they have a three phase programme whereby they will get existing small business people in the secondary processing of foodstuffs, such as tomato ketchup and horseradish sauce, to develop them into a large concern. They have done this by taking on board these people and by giving them advice in terms of marketing, research and development, management and will eventually help them to build units of 30 square feet which will provide a pilot project.</P>
    <P>With regard to Limerick and Shannon, one might well ask why Mattersons were not successful.  The reason is they were in the canning industry with a high volume turnover, low costs and high output but, when the State took it over, through the Sugar Company, the reality was that the low cost structure disappeared.  They were not able to provide the goods and services at a competitive price.</P>
    <P>In the areas of secondary processing of our natural resources of agriculture, fisheries and forestry, inter-departmental groups, through civil servants, tend to look after their own areas of responsibility. We hope that by raising it at the highest ministerial level they will overcome these problems.  I hope that the <Col N="1047" /> National Development Corporation will be actively involved in this area and that they will use the shareholding equity of the primary producers, the people already in the production business, and the retailers to provide a continuous marketing trading co-operation in sectors that will be used to ensure that there is real job creation in this area.  But there is also a need for technical trade barriers within the confines of the free trading Treaty of Rome countries.  It is possible, through the enforcement of technical standards for certain items, to curb the extraordinary growth of imports and, without having a protectionist policy, we could have some real structures which would help to solve that problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked if Deputies had any ideas to advance which would contribute to a solution of this problem.  I suggest that the National Development Corporation should be primarily involved in the post farm gate, post harbour, post forestry activity of getting involved and getting a sufficient share of the market in that area.  I hope we will see expansion of the innovation centre set up in NIHE in Limerick, incubator factories as stated in <i>The Way Forward</i>, and that we will have a residential State run business centre.  If people have a good idea for setting up a business they could go to the centre and avail of the full expertise in all the problems associated with setting up one's own industry.  The old maxim is that the way to get rid of bad debts is by good management and I hope such a centre will be set up on a permanent, residential basis.</P>
    <P>I hope the task force will try to ensure that the county development teams will be expanded and developed instead of regionalisation which has utterly failed. We should have one field officer from the IIRS, CTT and the IDA in each county development team and they should be on the ground to provide an expert, localised consultancy service.  I wish to mention briefly, although it is not totally relevant to industrial policy, the activities of the Youth Employment Agency.  It has already been mentioned in this debate that there are 56,000 young people without <Col N="1048" /> jobs.  As the youngest Member of this House I am most concerned about this aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>While the agency had problems with short-term policies, and had to use existing channels to expend such large amounts of money, it is time that their medium-term policy started to work. There is a need for a job development scheme for one year guaranteed to all school leavers integrated with the work experience programme and the AnCO training schemes.  Our technical schools are empty in the summer where real training and education could be provided related to the need for employment opportunities and moving away from the sterile type of education and training for clerical and administrative work which has been taken over by technology.</P>
    <P>The Goods Council in conjunction with the Youth Employment Agency should use their initiative to provide co-operative structures, and whatever, on the basis of import substitution even for small items which could be produced here by sole Irish producers or to service large manufacturing industrial units.  The agency should pilot schemes.  Instead of having grants paid through different Departments for house improvements, the unions should have an open viewpoint on traditional areas of labour which could be looked at again to provide schemes involving young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Youth Employment Agency will be the champion of schemes such as providing sanitary services which are essential in 1983. Instead of providing grants, young people could be employed to provide <Col N="1049" /> essential services for young people, or to carry out improvements to public buildings, or whatever.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned the real problem that we will be spending £473 million on unemployment compensation this year.  These people have to live, and they have a very meagre standard of living. I appreciate all the social aspects of the problem.  The reality is that this is a multiplication of the type of resources we are spending on attracting foreign investment, on the manufacturing industry, on the development of agriculture, or the development of any area related to job creation.  Environment and improvement schemes should be taken away from the Youth Employment Agency as they have no training content.  When the employment figure is over 10 per cent or 12 per cent, or whatever is the prescribed figure, schemes should be initiated in certain areas and people on assistance could be paid at the rate of benefit for six months.</P>
      <P>Those are some of my personal proposals. I reject the Opposition suggestion that nothing is being done.  It is very easy to play the hurler on the ditch on those benches in a debate such as this.  The reality is that our fundamental structure of cost competitiveness was eroded by successive Governments to the point where we are not attracting the volume of foreign investment we need.  Many vested interest groups in our industrial relations scene are more interested in protecting the stance of their members and less interested in employment creation. Our private and public sectors are up to their eyes in debt, and we must not do anything which would frighten away foreign investment which is so essential for our future.  I will be supporting the Government in their endeavours in the future.  I hope that with the National Development Corporation and other innovative measures, they will bring about a real resolution of this problem.</P>

      <P>Before I call on Deputy Aylward, with the co-operation of the House I want to suggest the following rota to which I hope the House will agree in view of the restricted time: Deputy Aylward from 7.45 p.m. to <Col N="1050" /> 8.05 p.m., Deputy Mac Giolla from 8.05 p.m. to 8.15 p.m., Deputy Skelly from 8.15 p.m. to 8.20 p.m., and Deputy Reynolds to conclude for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion in the name of my colleagues Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Reynolds:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the total failure of the Government to protect employment by not taking the necessary measures in time to prevent the collapse of an increasing number of major industrial firms.</P>
      <P>Any public representative who is aware of his duties as a Member of this House must view with dismay and shock the number of closures in recent months. I refer in particular to the closure of the Telectron Company with the loss of 500 jobs.  This closure should not have taken place.  It reminds me of the situation in my own constituency not so long ago when a multinational company decided to close the Fieldcrest operation.  At that time as a member of the Government party I went through a very difficult time.</P>
      <P>Tonight I detect an air of hypocrisy on the Government side of the House.  At that time they waltzed through the lobbies having put forward a proposal that the Government should nationalise the Fieldcrest operation in Kilkenny. Tonight the shoe is on the other foot and the approach is totally different.  The operation in Telectron was very sound and solid for many years.  I would have hoped that the Government would see it in that light, and take the necessary action to ensure that that plant continued in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own area I felt very strongly about the Fieldcrest operation.  For many months after that closure I listened to political crying from my political opponents in Kilkenny condemning the failure of the Government to keep the Fieldcrest plant in operation.  The Sandtex operation in Kilkenny which was initiated by my colleague Deputy Reynolds has not been developed any further, and the empty spaces in the Fieldcrest plant have not been occupied by any alternative industry, as was promised by the Fine <Col N="1051" /> Gael Party before the recent General Election.</P>
    <P>Consistently in the south east area we have been losing jobs at an unprecedented rate.  Waterford city could be described as a ghost city, and Kilkenny and Wexford are not much better.  Both the Minister and Deputy Yates adopted a very philosophical approach to this problem, but the problem is far more serious than that, and the issue is different. We have 190,000 people unemployed, 70,000 of whom are young people.  We have 250 companies who went into bankruptcy in the recent past. It is time for very serious action.  It is time the Government introduced a plan to ensure that jobs are not lost at this rate in the future.  There is no policy or direction and certainly there is very little action on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>We have heard references to the task force of Ministers that has been established and to the National Development Corporation.  It is easy to refer to them but where is the action?  I have not heard of any action by the Government.  The Taoiseach, in his pessimistic approach, informed us that things will get worse, and that makes one fear for the future of the country.  The programme for Government drawn up by Fine Gael and Labour &mdash; their individual programmes fell by the wayside when they entered Government &mdash; stated that a National Development Corporation would be established as an early priority, but after five months in Government we are not any nearer to establishing that body.  I would be glad if it was set up as a matter of urgency and given power to tackle the desperate situation that has developed.  We were told that £100 million would be allocated for the contingency fund, but that has been withdrawn.  That was part of the arrangement for the task force.  Job-sharing was to be discussed, but that has not taken place.  I am very concerned, as are other Members, about the situation.</P>
    <P>By their actions in the budget the Government have contributed in a big way to our unemployment situation.  In the capital programme they withdrew money from various schemes and that has <Col N="1052" /> added to our problem.  For example, in the building industry only half of those who could be employed have a job. Money has been withdrawn from local authorities and the policy of decentralisation continued by consecutive Governments over the years has been curtailed. Money has also been withdrawn from the building and construction industry with the result that fewer houses will be built. There have been huge increases in indirect taxes, more VAT on food, drink and other commodities and that has ensured that jobs will be lost daily.  The decision of the Government to add 4 per cent to the rate of inflation also contributed to the problem.  One wonders where this will lead us.  Huge sums of money are paid out weekly in unemployment benefit and I wonder if that could be put to some constructive use.</P>
    <P>We have been told that various committees and consultants will be reporting but we have had too many reports down the years.  It is time we got down to the task of getting employment for our people, particularly our school leavers.  I agree with the Minister when he referred to the great potential for exports by domestic companies and the need to curb imports by State companies.  They are desirable.  I would like to see Irish agriculture developed further and the food processing industry expanded.  That must be done as a matter of urgency.  It is one of the simple answers to the problem of job creation.</P>
    <P>Daily we are made aware of the lack of funds for our local authorities.  We have the personnel and expertise available at local level but less money is being spent on local projects.  Those who travel through the country are aware of the poor state of our roads and the need for major repair works.  If money was given to local authorities jobs could be provided at local level.  When one considers the number of firms that have closed down in recent times one is prompted to ask if we have been too generous in our efforts to attract subsidiaries of foreign multinationals to the detriment of many local industries.  I have found that if a local businessman wants to develop an industry every obstacle is put in his path. <Col N="1053" /> Native industry seems to take second place to the larger multinational concerns. Although the small concern may not provide the same number of jobs as the multinational, it must be remembered that the small firms provide secure jobs that will last through difficult times. Many of the multinational subsidiaries must communicate with their headquarters in other countries when decisions have to be made and often those decisions arrive too late to rescue the firms. In the case of Fieldcrest the parent company in America made all the decisions for the plant in Kilkenny and the lack of communication between them meant that the marketing operation went haywire. As a result the Kilkenny concern closed down.  In my view a similar situation existed in Telectron.  For that reason special consideration should be given to small local industries.  They should be helped, not hindered.  From my experience as a public representative I am aware that every type of obstacle is put in their way from the day they seek planning permission.</P>
    <P>It is time that a serious interest was taken in our small industries.  Deputy Reynolds reminded us last night that this was the House where decisions should be taken and he warned that if that was not the case those decisions will be made elsewhere for us.  That is the realistic position.  Over the years reams of paper have been used in compiling reports on the industrial sector but what we need now is action in regard to the creation of jobs.  In the case of Telectron there were orders for equipment to improve the telecommunication services and I find it hard to understand how a company with such orders can go out of business.</P>
    <P>The Minister is deeply involved in Dáil reform but there are more important matters to be dealt with.  He must do everything possible to provide jobs as a matter of urgency.  He should introduce an emergency action plan.  I accept that there are no easy options but there is not any substitute for hard work, good planning and good management.  The Government must give the lead in that area.  We should not adopt the attitude of the Taoiseach to succumb to despair and <Col N="1054" /> pessimism.  Now is the time for dedicated effort.  We have high taxes and high interest rates but we must also consider how demoralising it is to be unemployed.  Public representatives who have to deal with unemployed people are aware of the problems.  It is difficult to hold out any hope for those people.  The situation is getting out of hand.  I appeal to the Minister to forget about philosophising and get down to the job of establishing the National Development Corporation, if that is the answer, to ensure that the jobs are provided for all the unemployed, particularly young people.  The situation is far too serious for us as Members of the House to renege on our responsibilities to those many thousands of people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>We listened to a Deputy describe himself as the youngest Deputy in the House.  He made the most extraordinary reactionary speech I have heard here.  He said the claims made by workers whether for more wages, better conditions or redundancy were the real cause of problems in private sector industry.  He went so far as to say that claims for redundancy payments were the reason why other companies would not take over ailing companies.  It would seem he is anxious to get back to the days when a worker could be dismissed with a week's pay and never have a hope of another job.  Redundancy payments do not cover two or three years' wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He continued to make the point that public sector industry and companies are a major cause of the financial problems we have.  He mentioned some figures relating to subsidies which were given to public sector companies last year.  He made no reference to the cost to the State of the private sector through grants, loans, employment subsidies and so on made to them through various State agencies set up specifically to assist the private sector.  He suggested that the role of some State companies should be expanded especially those which helped the private sector.  He saw a special role for CTT, the IDA and IIRS which are public sector companies.  He suggested setting up a new one &mdash; a residential <Col N="1055" /> State-run business centre paid for by the Exchequer.  This would be specially for the management of private sector companies. This is the kind of speech we are being subjected to and is typical of Fine Gael thinking in relation to the private sector.</P>
    <P>He gave the impression that the industrial relations scene referred only to trade unions and had nothing to do with management. Management faults have been the major cause of industrial disputes over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>The major problem in the public sector is political interference.  The ESB is being brought to its knees by the imposition of a £20 million levy which they will have to pass on to the consumer.  The price for gas or turf is decided on by the Government so that the Government, through An Bord Gáis, can get further funds into the Exchequer.  There are directors from the private sector on the board of the ESB and other companies who are interfering with the running of those companies and preventing them from going into competition with private sector companies. All those political shackles should be removed.</P>
    <P>There are two areas where the private sector has failed and where the State must play a strong role.  One is in the electronics area which is of vital importance to the country.  Telectron had hopes in the early seventies of being the base for an indigenous technology industry.  It has now collapsed and the State must play a strong role in trying to bring together that very good design and development team which they had in Telectron and develop that area.</P>
    <P>The other area is forestry and the timber industry.  For 60 years our parents and grandparents paid taxes to build up forests for us to take advantage of today. We were told in reply to a question last week that we export 50,000 tonnes of timber which contractors can buy at £1 per tonne standing in the forest.  It is cut down and exported.  We have no processing industry.  This is an indictment of the policies pursued by Government. There is a strong role for the State to play in this area apart from the processing of <Col N="1056" /> timber through chipboard industries and papermills.  There is need for a national kiln drying plant which would cost approximately £3 million.  Approximately £200 million of timber was imported last year.  It would enable us to provide our own timber for the construction industry.  We have no such kiln drying plant.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question I put down I was told there were a few kiln drying plants. The capacity of all of them put together would be for 1,440 cubic metres of timber. That is just a laugh.</P>
    <P>Forestry must be taken out of the hands of the civil service.  It is a dead hand on the industry.  There should be a State forestry board established or it should be put into the hands of Bord na Móna who have shown that the job can be done.  That is essential if we are to make use of the money which was invested in forests over the years.  Up to 15,000 jobs could be created in addition to the 4,000 which exist at present.  By 1990 the amount of mature timber in the forests will have doubled.  We have no capacity for dealing with this.  There is a plant being brought in by the IDA but they will not deal with one-third of the capacity which will exist in 1990.  The State must become involved in this industry because private industry has collapsed. The timber is there for them now at a cost of £1 per tonne standing in the forests and yet they cannot develop a processing industry.  The State must do it as Seán Lemass insisted it do with the bogs in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed that the most thumbed document in the Opposition must be the Joint Programme for Government.  Deputy Reynolds thumbed through it and then passed it to Deputy Fitzgerald, who thumbed through it. Now I see that Deputy Aylward is also referring to it.  I am glad that we have made some progress since that document issued.  Deputy Fitzgerald spoke about failure and lack of hope, as did some of his colleagues on that side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that situation exists, it is a comment on their performance while in Government, when the country was brought to <Col N="1057" /> a position of no hope.  This Government have laid the groundwork of hope by establishing the ministerial task force, the National Planning Board, plus the White Paper which the Minister proposes to bring out on Industrial Policy.  There is also the committee on small businesses. Have the Opposition no confidence in the State institutions such as the IDA, Córas Tráchtála and Fóir Teoranta, which the able Deputy Reynolds used to the full while he was in office?  These institutions have been there: even after changes in Government, they have not changed.  It is generally agreed they are performing very well and they did not stop performing with changes of Government.</P>
    <P>A planned approach to any situation, particularly a no hope situation, requires immediate corrective action, such as the modification of VAT at the point of entry.  This time, the Government were faced with a more difficult task than in 1973 when inflation was 24 per cent and total cumulative foreign borrowings since the beginning of the State amounted to £1 billion.  In the space of four years after their return to power in 1977, the Fianna Fáil Government succeeded in adding 6 per cent to the inflation rate and £4 billion to the foreign borrowing figure.  Therefore, this Government when they returned to office faced a total of £5 billion of foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>The Government in the past few months have been laying the base for recovery through their planning.  I believe this to be the best Government we have had in the history of the State. The Government are led by the best Taoiseach we have had in the history of the State.  His performance in the 24th Dáil, I predict, will make the late Seán Lemass pale by comparison.  The Taoiseach's immediate predecessor has been made to look like a ball boy.  I have confidence in this Government and the Taoiseach, to whom the country looks with hope, because the people have confidence that he will save it from the appalling situation that we were left with by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed at the approach of the two former Ministers during this <Col N="1058" /> debate.  There was nothing very positive in their remarks, which they did not seem to have prepared.  There were plenty of jokes and fun about a situation which is extremely serious, nothing to be laughed at.  I was particularly disappointed to hear the unresearched comments about Telectron by Deputy Aylward and Lenihan.</P>
    <P>This morning Deputy Lenihan accused the Government of not taking the necessary action to prevent the closure of manufacturing firms and in this connection he instanced the case of Telectron.  I would like to tell the House that after hearing that accusation I made some inquiries myself about the action being taken to prevent closures and that, as a result, I can now say that I am convinced that after the Government took up office in December last the amount of time, attention and resources devoted by the Department of Industry and Energy, by the IDA, by Fóir Teoranta and by the other State agencies to the problems of firms in difficulties and to preventing the closure of such firms increased significantly as compared with the period during which Deputy Lenihan's party were in office.  And as the Minister for Industry and Energy pointed out this afternoon, that party were in office for 56 of the past 71 months.</P>
    <P>As regards the particular case of Telectron, I have been advised by the Minister for Industry and Energy that after the take-over of that company by A T &amp; T International, both the IDA and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were in frequent contact with the company, the former with a view to ensuring that it would honour the &ldquo;aspirations&rdquo; to which it had subscribed at the time of the take-over and the latter in connection with orders for pulse code modulation equipment and digital radio equipment which it had given to the company.  The fact that the company was making losses was known but this was not considered a matter for serious concern because at the time of the take-over it was widely accepted, not least by A T &amp; T itself, that the company would continue to incur losses for some time and, particularly, until it secured European markets for its products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> There was no indication whatsoever by the company that it intended to close its Tallaght plant &mdash; in fact all the indications were that the company was considering the transfer of the manufacture of other products from the US to Tallaght to improve the position at the latter location. Even when the company announced on 30 March that it intended to make 197 of its workers at Tallaght redundant because they had not at that time a sufficient workload to sustain a work force of 500 at the plant, there was no question of the closure of the plant.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there was still no question of the closure when problems related to these redundancies came before the Labour Court on Friday, 22 April 1983. However, as the House now knows, while those discussions relating to the redundancies were taking place in the Labour Court on 22 April, a decision was being taken by A T &amp; T International in the US, to close the plant; and that decision was announced on the following Monday morning, 25 April.  I would ask Deputy Lenihan how the present Government &mdash; or, for that matter, any Government &mdash; could have prevented that closure announcement?  I suggest that, if Deputy Lenihan is honest, his only answer must be the Government could not.</P>
    <P>Deputies know that, despite that announcement, the Government and the appropriate State agencies made strenuous efforts to avert the closure of the Tallaght operation.  The fact that these efforts were unsuccessful does not point to inaction or failure on the part of the Government but to the harsh reality that in the final analysis the decision as to whether an enterprise remains open or is closed down rests with the proprietors of such enterprises.</P>
    <P>It does not take a lot of reasoning to find that out but heavy-handed Deputies have come in to lambast the Government who are using the same agencies that the Opposition used when they were in Government.  It is naive to expect that the public will fall for that.  The same strenuous efforts are being made when any company in the country, especially <Col N="1060" /> those with large work forces, are threatened with closure.  I do not think Deputy Mac Giolla's approach would solve all the problems.  He suggested everything should be taken over by the State.  This total anti-private enterprise attitude that The Workers' Party have suggests that it is foreigners who run all private enterprise here.  We have a mixed economy and we should make the most of it.  I am happy to support the ministerial amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing to sit here and listen to the inaccuracies poured out from time to time from the opposite benches.  They talk about research, but themselves never trouble to check their information.  When they get the opportunity they should check what the inflation rate was in 1973.  I can tell them from the top of my head that it was not 23 per cent or 24 per cent.  They hold the record for the highest inflation rate ever seen in the Irish economy during the term of that Coalition Government from 1973 to 1977, and in the last seven months as well.  They added 4 per cent or 5 per cent to the inflation rate through the February budget.  If they had not done that, what would the inflation rate be at the end of this year?</P>
      <P>That is what bringing down costs is all about, but the Government are going in the opposite direction.  When they talk, they should talk facts.  Nobody here castigated the State agencies, but the responsibility rests in this House.  The agencies are responsible to the Minister of the day.  I disagree sometimes with what Deputy Mac Giolla says in relation to some of those agencies.  For instance, would Deputy Mac Giolla or this House condone a situation in which a chief executive in a semi-State body would deprive a backward part of the country of 70 jobs?  Is that the sort of action that any Minister should tolerate?  I say it is not.  If the situation I am referring to is not resolved I will be bringing it to the floor of this House.  I have tried to do it on two occasions but I was refused permission to raise it.  People are afraid to bring such incidents to the floor of the House and that will not get us anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> I begin to wonder where we are going when I hear Deputy Skelly come in here to say that the people of the country are looking to the Taoiseach, the man that will give them hope, and, at the same time, he is the greatest preacher of no hope.  The Government have given themselves the label of &ldquo;no hope&rdquo;.  The words that have issued from the mouth of their leader are not like the words of a future leader, and probable Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton.  He has spoken about optimism. I applauded him for that last night and I asked him to convey those sentiments to his Leader.  The Taoiseach has said that no Government could do anything about our present situation.</P>
    <P>The policies of the Government are diametrically opposed to what the employment situation requires.  Last night I said that the total thrust of the Government's policy was diametrically opposed to what the employment situation demanded and today in his speech the Taoiseach said the same thing.  Fine Gael should not try to tell us that the Taoiseach knows where he is going.  Perhaps he does, but I wonder if the rest of the people with him know where they are going.</P>
    <P>Time and again we hear the Taoiseach say one thing while the Tánaiste says something else.  Last weekend in Cork there were two different statements: the Tánaiste said there will be State aid for industry and that he believed in semi-State industries but the Taoiseach and many in Fine Gael do not.  I said last night, and I repeat, that the philosophy existing in the Fine Gael benches today is the same kind of philosophy that existed during the time of the late Paddy McGilligan when he said the State had no responsibility to provide work.  Fine Gael have not changed and they will never change.  It is time they changed the name of their party.  They have the same philosophy that they had in the fifties. Fine Gael produced a booklet which they called their Programme for Government which conned the Labour Party in Limerick.  Is it any wonder they are under very considerable pressure now?  There is no hope of work for 70,000 young <Col N="1062" /> people, without considering the young school leavers this summer.  What message is given to them?  It is that the Government are pursuing policies diametrically opposed to what the employment situation requires.  These are the words of the Taoiseach today.</P>
    <P>That is the man who has no hope.  He does not believe in the capacity of the people to solve their problems.  Fine Gael recently showed that not all of their members will follow the Taoiseach.  Last night the Minister produced selective statistics to try to prove a point.  It was said that for the first four months of this year 2,451 jobs were saved as against 1,660 for the corresponding four months last year. Has the Minister forgotten that for much of that time his party were in Government? We went into Government on 9 March.  The first case that appeared on my desk was Fieldcrest which the Government tried to nationalise but they changed their philosophy.  Some Members of the Government side have spoken about &ldquo;the hurlers on the ditch&rdquo;.  They should not forget about the policies and philosophies they put forward when they were in Opposition.</P>
    <P>We stand over what we say and we published it in our document <i>The Way Forward.</i> Today the Minister was selective when he spoke about how grants should be given in the future, how companies and IDA grants should be organised. All of that is printed in <i>The Way Forward.</i> If the Government wish to discard that document they should do so for the whole of the document and not use sections that suit them.</P>
    <P>Now I will give the figures for rescues in 1981 as against 1982 from a recent Fóir Teoranta report.  The figures for jobs saved to December 1981 was 4,187 and to December 1982 it was 7,679.  Does that indicate that efforts are being made to save jobs?  I challenge the Minister to look at the figures which I have since I was in office, and I will give them to the Minister if he wants them.  In June last year 2,295 jobs were saved and in September 2,718 jobs.  That clearly demonstrates the commitment of the Fianna Fáil Government to saving jobs.  Since Fine <Col N="1063" /> Gael took office the trend has been in the other direction.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister say if he is withdrawing the subvention to Fóir Teoranta or if he will supply the money required to save jobs?  Government Deputies ask where will we get the money for this or that.  They borrow for current expenditure because they have not the courage to tackle the root cause of our problem. We started to remedy this situation last July but they did not continue it.  When they saw our expenditure worked out on line for last year, they did not have the courage to cut current expenditure.  That is the root cause of our problem and the Minister knows it as well as I do.  Instead, the Government have taken the easy way out.  They reduced the capital programme by £220 million.  They say it is all right to borrow money to pay the dole and for current expenditure, but it is not all right to borrow money for capital expenditure which could be put into the building and construction industry which would pay off the money four-fold in jobs.</P>
    <P>People talk about the thousands of workers in the construction industry who have lost their jobs.  Look at what they are getting under the pay-related scheme and unemployment benefit.  When one compares that with the pay for local authority workers one realises that these people are getting more than they would if they were working for the local authorities. These workers are badly needed by the local authorities.  All that is needed are stones and tar to fix the potholes in our roads.  If the Government want practical solutions we can give them plenty.</P>
    <P>We have a national unemployment crisis and this Government have not taken any fire brigade action.  Last night the Minister put down an amendment to the motion saying he was setting up the task force of Ministers, a planning board and so on &mdash; more nails of bureaucracy &mdash; but not a single line in the Minister's speech said what those agencies were doing, if they had met or if they were producing any policies or programmes.  I asked those questions last night and it is easy to see why the Minister did not answer them <Col N="1064" />&mdash; the Government are not taking any action.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained the Government's philosophy in relation to the food industry.  I will back any measure he brings in to develop that industry, but as long as it is left in the Department of Agriculture it will never be developed properly.  The Minister knows as well as I do that there has to be a single Minister responsible for the development and marketing of agricultural produce and the sooner this is done the better.</P>
    <P>Why is there such unemployment in the meat factories?  Why are men being let go?  As a farmer the Minister knows the variable premium is the reason cattle are being sent to Northern Ireland to be killed, to the detriment of jobs in the Republic.  When the Minister for Agriculture put our case in Brussels he was immediately accosted by Mr. Walker, the British Minister for Agriculture, who said if our Minister did not withdraw his objections the British would look at the suckler scheme.  Our Minister cowed down and let Mr. Walker get away with it because there is a bonanza in it for the farmers in Northern Ireland and England.  Is that the sort of commitment we need in a time of emergency?  Is that the kind of Minister we need?  I say no. A Minister needs to take his courage in his hands and stand up for what he believes in.</P>
    <P>I wonder what some members of this Government believe in.  Last night I tried to find out if they had any policy to deal with our unemployment situation.  Have they any message for the 220,000 unemployed? Have they any short-term policy? Do they intend letting matters roll on and, as the Taoiseach said, throw up their hands in despair and say nothing can be done?  If that is the message going out to the 220,000 people, including 70,000 young people, then this Government are a failure in their eyes and the system is failing to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The Coalition were elected to govern. They campaigned during the last general election and had the Book of Estimates put at their disposal.  This had never happened before.  They had the programme we had laid out, and they knew all the <Col N="1065" /> problems before they went into office. Immediately they got into office, got the numbers right, got the cars distributed to the boys, they threw that document into the basket and it will be forgotten until they have to go back to Limerick or some other place.  They forgot about every document they ever believed in.  They are forgetting their own policies.  I do not know where the policies or philosophies of the Labour Party have gone.  If the Labour Party stand for the closing down of the semi-State industries which they are destined to do and have every intention of doing then fair play to them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tunney has been allowed to raise a matter on the Adjournment on the question of school transport in his constituency for two children. He has 20 minutes and the Minister has ten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially, I want to thank the Chair for having given me permission to raise on the Adjournment a specific <Col N="1066" /> matter not connected with school transport generally but in respect of that as it applies to two named students.  I am sure that, having listened to the case I am about to make, the Chair will understand my anxiety and impatience in bringing this matter before the House.</P>
      <P>I should preface my remarks by saying that I regret that the circumstances are such that other Deputies and I should on occasion have to waste the time and resources of this House in applying ourselves to what is the indifference and negligence of officers and institutions not connected with us but who we are told have some responsibility towards us.  I do not think it should be necessary for me, or indeed for any other Deputy, to serve as a watchdog on behalf of parents or anybody else who, through the indifference and neglect of two organisations &mdash; in this case the Department of Education and CIE &mdash; are being deprived of their lawful rights.</P>
      <P>That might sound a serious charge to make, but I am sure that in the course of the next 15 minutes I shall indicate that it is not a wrong accusation.  We know that the taxpayers pay annually a large sum, £900 million at the moment, towards what is called education.  That amount is divided up into different sectors which are served &mdash; primary, secondary and tertiary, or third level.  There is one level among those, that is the primary level, which is mandatory on parents. They must send their children to primary school.  The Constitution says that that obligation is there and that the State is obliged to provide that free of charge.</P>
      <P>We can leave examination of that aside for the moment, but we all accept it.  The Department of Education in discharging this responsibility and where they cannot provide at the doorstep the education that people require, for certain understandable economies, build centres of education in certain areas and students are expected to travel to them.  That is a simple and understandable point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years, however, in respect of a particular type of student and in deference to that ambition, aim, objective which we all have in respect of education of equality of opportunity and equality of <Col N="1067" /> rights, the State in its wisdom endeavours to indulge in what might be regarded as a distributive justice, and in respect of children who are not endowed with what is regarded as the normal or average IQ, has built special schools.  These special schools cannot be built on every road or in every vicinity and they are located at certain points.</P>
    <P>Again, all Governments have agreed that children who qualify for attendance at these schools are entitled to free transport, so establishing two simple facts. The Department oblige parents to send children to primary level schools.  In respect of children who are classified as eligible or in need of what is called special education, they are obliged to go to those schools and the Department, having adjudicated upon the students, provide transport, I take it, for many reasons, one of which is that it is cheaper for them to transport the children rather than build a school where there might be only a half dozen or ten or 15 such children.</P>
    <P>I want to establish two points.  The Department are charged with, accept and have provided for that responsibility. Parents who do not co-operate with the Department are liable to be charged if they do not send their children to school, whether it is the normal primary or a special school.  In respect of the transportation of the children, the Department co-operate with the national transport system, Córas Iompair Éireann and here again the Department pay to CIE, using taxpayers' money, a considerable amount of money so that they can discharge that duty.</P>
    <P>This year there has been much comment on it and I am not at all going to treat in any way of what is called the general school transport system, but the House knows that the subvention at the moment, the amount paid, is something in the region of $30 million.  CIE, arising from that contract or commitment, are paid the full economic cost of it, together with a percentage in respect of their handling of it.  So it is a paying proposition for them.  However, to me, CIE are the servants of the Department of Education in respect of what is required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> Now, I have devoted enough time to establishing the factual background to the matter to which I will now refer specifically. For the purpose of the anonymity to which they might be entitled lest anything I might say on their behalf might in any way be the occasion of embarrassment to their parents, I refer to the two students by their Christian names, Alan and Mark.  Alan and Mark have been attending one of these special schools &mdash; repeat, would not be attending there except that they have been adjudicated upon as not being the type of student blessed with the intelligence that benefits from the normal primary school.  The Department have accepted that they can use State moneys to have them transported. That contract has been discharged by CIE.  Again, I have established that these children are not what are regarded as average or normal children.</P>
    <P>On 24 January last that service was withdrawn from Alan and Mark.  From inquiries I have made I am told that the reason was that in the opinion of CIE &mdash;who, whatever else they may be cannot be regarded by anybody as educationalists &mdash; the two children in question were not behaving in a normal fashion.  I might add that the two children were two of 60 students to travel on a bus which caters for two special schools in the area, St. Michael's House and Scoil Chiaráin. That service was withdrawn by CIE on 24 January last.  I understand that it was reported by the school authorities.  I understand further that the Department of Education, the Department charged with the responsibility of looking after those children, the Department that would charge the parents of those children if they were negligent in the matter of sending them to school, did nothing about it.  If that is true, as far as I am concerned the Department of Education stand indicted.</P>
    <P>I gave notice here that I hoped to raise the matter on the Adjournment a week or two ago.  I did not succeed.  I have been in negotiation with the school.  The parents of those children have been with me twice weekly for the last three weeks. Those parents, because of the natural <Col N="1069" /> interest they would have in their children &mdash; and again I suppose to fulfil the requirements of the Department of Education and the State being that they send their children to school &mdash; have had to accompany those two little boys to school.  We all know, the Department of Education know and CIE know that already the children are not regarded as being capable of travelling on their own. Therefore the point I make is that if the Department of Education insist that they go to school, they themselves understand that somebody must accompany them. They understand further that one cannot accompany a child on public transport nowadays without paying for the child and for oneself.  Those two families have been obliged &mdash; apart from the other considerations of having a child of that nature in their homes &mdash; to spend sums of £10 per week to bring their children to the special school.  That is not hearsay. The history I give of this case is as I tell it.  I repeat that to me it is a case of the most serious neglect of duty I have met on the part of CIE and the Department of Education in respect of what they are supposed to be doing for young children. Two children from whom transport that was considered essential to bring them to a special school was withdrawn on 24 January last and has not yet been restored.  The parents in question, one of whom is unemployed, having been made redundant, have to spent £10 per week to get the children to a primary school so that first they will satisfy the normal interest of parents in their children but, secondly, they will not be charged &mdash; and the charge would be initiated by the Department of Education who have shown scant interest in the two children in question.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice said here last week that it costs £424 to keep a prisoner in prison; that is the cost.  We know that a person would not be in prison unless, in the considered view of a judge, sometimes a jury, he or she had been guilty of doing some wrong to society.  Here we have a situation in which two children, born in the fashion that has been decided, one which we cannot comprehend all that well, guilty of nothing other than that <Col N="1070" /> they were indulging in behaviour which is, I would maintain, proper and understandable in respect of retarded children, have been denied transport to school. We, in our coldness and indifference, allow the service to be withdrawn, sit back and do nothing about it until some public representative, who ordinarily might be about other business, becomes aware of this fact and attempts to have it remedied in the only fashion he knows by exposing it here in this House.  That should not be necessary.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister of State.  This was initiated on 24 January last; again I do not know why I should have to do this but the Minister of State in the past has indicated to me that he might think that contributions made by me are aimed at reflecting on him personally, so I would remind him that they are not.  I am reflecting on the Department of Education but more especially on CIE.  Who gave CIE permission to withdraw transport facilities from two of our students? It is not written down in any regulations I have read in the Department of Education. Who allowed CIE, having done that, not to provide or present a remedy, or to alert the Department of Education to the remedy, or if they did, am I wrong in my understanding or in accepting the innocence of the Department?  Maybe they did; maybe they knew about it before it was raised here.  Certainly the principal of the school alerted them to it. I have no evidence that they did anything about it.  I could understand a week, a fortnight, three weeks or even a month elapsing &mdash; it is not easy to rearrange things overnight &mdash; but this occurred on 24 January last.  We are now nearly halfway through the month of May.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the parents of these children have been forking out money they cannot afford so that these two boys can be brought to the school.  How long more is it going to last?  Is there going to be any effort made at making restitution to the parents who are forced into the position, wrongfully, of paying that money?  If those parents &mdash; and I know this from looking at files when in the Department &mdash; were in a better position to articulate their case, would this have happened?  Is <Col N="1071" /> it because they live in a certain area which is regarded as a special area that people thought one could forget about them?  I would hope not.  I had the pleasure of serving in the Department of Education. I met there, and was always happy to express publicly, the respect and esteem in which I held all the officers in the division dealing with special education. I was happy with the progress that had been made and would not want to condemn the Department on one isolated case.  But, from the evidence I have in respect of this case, the only &mdash; and this apparently would have been accepted by the Department &mdash; contention was that they were not well behaved on the bus. These were two little children of eight and nine years of age, but CIE, despite receiving £30 million in State funds to transport children, decided to withdraw the service while apparently the Department of Education have stood idly by.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister of State telling me that this matter having been brought to his notice, he has had the situation examined.  If he is in a position this evening to assure me that the service is being restored and if perhaps he can offer some apology to the parents, I would be prepared to accept that what happened was not known to him before I attempted to raise it in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed) Donal Creed">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with some reluctance that I approach this discussion on the adjournment regarding the withdrawal of transport facilities from two mildly mentally handicapped children. My reluctance is based on the fact that I do not wish to go into detail concerning the facts of the case, primarily out of concern for the children themselves.  I should add that there never has been any question of charging parents of mentally handicapped children in respect of the transport services provided for these children. It has nothing to do with the present transport system of charges.  I mention that in case there should be any confusion, though the Deputy mentioned that himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy well knows from his own <Col N="1072" /> extensive experience in the Department of Education that special education of special children is a matter to which the Department pay very particular attention. We can all take a little pride in our achievements in this area and on the dedicated commitment shown by voluntary bodies, by teachers, by school managers and by Department officials under successive administrations to bring about the best possible educational circumstances and provisions for handicapped children in need of special help.  I can assure Deputy Tunney that the same spirit pervades in the special education service today as existed during his period in office in the Department of Education and accordingly the special transport service would not have been withdrawn from the two children about whom we are both concerned without very good and cogent reasons.</P>
    <P>Without going into detail, I am satisfied &mdash; and I hope the Deputy will accept my assurance on this point &mdash; that the withdrawal of the special transport facility by CIE, as agents of the Minister in this case, was the only course open in the short term in order to ensure the safety of the children themselves, of their fellow passengers on the service and of other road users.</P>
    <P>This withdrawal of special transport was not sudden and precipitate.  Concern regarding the behaviour of the children in question while travelling on the school bus was raised with the principal of the school they were attending on more than one occasion and, I understand, that the principal, in turn, raised the matter with the parents of the children.  This did not secure any improvement in their behaviour.</P>
    <P>There are many issues of importance arising out of this case to which due consideration must be given.  First, there is the safety of other road users.  Persistent disruptive behaviour of the kind practised by the children in question while on the school bus was of such a nature as would unduly distract the driver and produce other hazards which could have resulted in a serious road accident.  Secondly, there was the question of the safety and comfort of the other children <Col N="1073" /> travelling on the bus, all of whom were pupils of special schools.  Actions which could threaten the safety of these children either within the bus or arising from a road accident to which the disruptive behaviour to which I have referred would contribute, clearly could not be tolerated. Also these children are entitled to avail themselves of school transport under acceptable conditions and not to have their comfort and security continually upset and threatened.  Last but not least there is the question of the safety of the two children in question.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will know that disruptive behaviour of the kind to which I referred can frequently be the result of hyperactivity in the child and, indeed, it may very well be that the children are not in a position to fully understand the seriousness of their actions nor to bring such behaviour under control.</P>
    <P>Whatever the source of this behaviour the safety of the children themselves is paramount and it would not be considered appropriate to continue transporting them on a service on which their safety could not be reasonably assured.</P>
    <P>The nature of their behaviour was such as to raise questions as to whether they were appropriately placed with regard to special education services.  Obviously this is a matter of considerable importance to the children as their best hope of progress lies in having a special education service that matches their needs as much as possible. The Deputy will know that the investigation of this matter takes some period of time and involves the health services, with the consent of the parents. The first steps in reviewing the position of the children in respect of the suitability of the education service being provided for them have been taken and the matter will be pursued further in the interests of the children.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile my Department have been investigating alternative means of transport of such a nature as might be able to contain their hyperactivity and ensure that they would not be in a position to constitute a danger to themselves and others.  I hope to be in a position to have <Col N="1074" /> such alternative means of transport implemented within a short period.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to Deputy Tunney or to anybody else bringing this matter before the House by way of an Adjournment debate.  However, because of the sensitive area with which we are dealing, I am not in a position to give to the Deputy a full and detailed reply.  The decision that had to be taken was in the interest not only of the two children concerned but of their fellow passengers.  As the Deputy mentioned, this bus was transporting more than 40 children to different schools.  While the position of the two children in question is a matter of concern, the position of their fellow passengers must be taken into consideration also.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates the difficulties in a situation such as this.  The matter is being investigated and I hope to be in a position to give further information to the Deputy as soon as that investigation has been completed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot give any further information at this stage.  Regarding the Deputy being the watchdog of people in such circumstances, if he had called to my office in the first instance and given me the information I could have had the matter investigated. I have been aware of the situation only since the Deputy tried to raise it on the Adjournment.  But I hope that there will be a satisfactory outcome to my investigations.  I sincerely hope that the Deputy will appreciate the difficulty of the situation having regard to the number of children involved.  The matter will have my attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister is trying to do, but in the meantime the parents are paying £10 per week in order to have their children taken to school.  That is money they can ill afford to pay.  In so far as the Minister might be paying later anyway to have the children taken to school, will he not consider doing something to alleviate the burden on the parents in the meantime?  The parents have no option but to pay this money or keep their children at home.</P>

      <P>There is no record in my Department of an application from the person named for a reconstruction grant.  There is, however, an application for a new house grant and an inspection of the house showed that the floor area is in excess of the maximum allowable (1,346 sq.ft.) for grant purposes.  Consequently the application was rejected and the applicant has been so informed.</P>
      <P>The decision in this case hinges on the question as to whether the attic space is developed or not.  I am satisfied on the basis of reports by my Department's inspectors that the attic space in this house is not undeveloped and as such must be regarded as part of the floor area of the house for grant purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate of 5,700 completions was regarded as valid when the material for the Revised Public Capital <Col N="953" /> Programme was being cleared by my Department for printing.  Subsequent examination, taking account of trends in the number of houses in progress and in tender prices, suggested that the figure of 5,700 was marginally too low.  The Deputy may also have noted that in my speech on the budget on 3 March, I said that allowing for the recent more favourable tender prices, &ldquo;over 5,700&rdquo; houses should be completed this year.  At this stage of the year any estimate of completions in the year is inevitably subject to adjustment.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring <Col N="957" /> to a letter which was widely circulated to public representatives by the Irish Waste Contractors Federation recently.  I am fully aware of the need for improved disposal facilities for industrial waste.  My Department have taken up with local authorities the need to provide adequate land-fill facilities for the disposal of industrial as well as other wastes arising in their areas and have issued detailed advice on the wastes which are suitable for co-disposal and the precautions which must be taken on environmental grounds in the selection, design and management of co-disposal tipheads. The importance of developing co-operation between local authorities and the private sector in this matter has also been consistently emphasised in circulars issued by my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 457 and 458 together.  A working party was set up by the Minister for the Environment in June 1982 to examine and make recommendations on, among other things, a scheme of postal voting for disabled persons and others who may be unable to vote in person at an election. The report of the working party was published recently and I am giving detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the report with a view to bringing forward proposals as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will take steps <Col N="958" /> to ensure that essential repairs grants are available to needy householders in the borough area of Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential repairs grants scheme has, since its introduction in 1963, been confined by statute to houses located in county health districts.  This followed from the basic objective of the scheme which was to enable local authorities to give assistance for the carrying out of essential repairs to prolong the lives of houses, occupied by elderly persons, where there would not be a continuing need for the house.</P>
      <P>The same considerations do not apply in urban areas.  I have no proposals at present to extend the essential repairs scheme to urban areas, since I am not convinced that this would be the best way of dealing with any problems of unsatisfactory housing conditions of elderly persons in urban areas.</P>
      <P>The Government's concern in this regard is, however, evidenced by the fact that a further provision of £1 million was made in this year's budget to finance the special programme of the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly which is designed to improve the living conditions of elderly persons living in insanitary or unfit accommodation.  I am satisfied that this approach is more flexible and effective than a formally regulated grants scheme and that it enables speedy action to be taken where necessary on behalf of those living in unacceptable conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of fees for planning applications and appeals, the cost of the planning control system was borne by the public at large through general taxation.  At a time when the <Col N="959" /> public finances are under particular strain and are incapable of meeting all of the many demands on them, it was decided that those persons using the planning system in particular cases should make some contribution towards the cost and thus relieve to some extent the burden falling on the ratepayers and the taxpayers.  All applications and appeals must be carefully processed and assessed and the cost to public funds of this operation now exceeds £10 million.  The fees which have been introduced are relatively modest and will meet only a proportion of this outlay.  While I have no immediate proposals to change the fees system, I intend to keep the operation of the system under review and if in due course it emerges that elements of the system are giving rise to serious difficulties or problems, I will consider what actions might then be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 480 and 481 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information is not available in my Department regarding offers of local improvements scheme grants made by county councils in 1982 which were not accepted because of difficulty in meeting the ten per cent minimum local contribution required under the scheme in <Col N="960" /> respect of farm road projects eligible for EEC aid.  From inquiries made of Galway County Council in the matter, however, I understand that they are aware of only two or three specific instances where the minimum ten per cent contribution acted as a serious deterrent to the schemes concerned being carried out.</P>
    <P>The administration of the local improvements scheme, including the selection of schemes, is primarily a matter for county councils, subject to the provisions of the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act, 1968 and general guidelines issued annually by my Department.  Under the arrangements for the scheme this year, £646,000 may be spent on non-EEC work in western counties compared with £277,000 in 1982. This increased allocation will enable county councils to exercise a greater degree of discretion in 1983 in undertaking farm road schemes where the appropriate local contribution would be less than ten per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Details regarding the number of travelling families in each local authority area are in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  The information is derived from a count carried out by local authorities on 16 November 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following examination of the count figures, I wrote to each city and county manager requesting a report showing to what extent travellers have made applications for housing, how many of the families are on approved housing lists and the action to be taken regarding the remainder.  Managers were also asked to indicate their intentions, in the light of the count, regarding the programme to meet the need for serviced sites.  When <Col N="961" /> replies have been received from all managers, the need for further action will be considered.</P>
    <P>As regards making a statement on the matter, I would refer the Deputy to the statement of policy which I made in reply to Question No. 402 on 8 March 1983.  I might add that the Report of the Travelling People Review Body has now been <Col N="962" /> completed and the Government have set up a review body comprising the Ministers of State at the Departments of the Environment, Justice, Finance, Labour, Health and Social Welfare, and Education with a view to ensuring urgent consideration of the recommendations</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The pensions of certain supervisory grades in common with other salaried staff in CIE are determined by reference to their salary on retirement and to their pensionable service.  In reckoning the pensionable service of such supervisory grades, regard is had to their service prior to promotion to the supervisory grade. These pensions are reviewed in July each year to take account of changes in salary for the appropriate grades.</P>
      <P>CIE supervisory staff in common with their other established salaried staff pay only Class D1 Pay Related Social Insurance contributions, i.e. the contribution appropriate to permanent and pensionable employees in the public service.  The benefits for Class D1 contributors do not include retirement or old age pensions. Some supervisory grades may, however, qualify for certain social welfare retirement benefits on reaching 65 years of age and subsequently for old age pensions, based on the period for which they have contributed to full pay-related social insurance when employed as wages grades staff prior to their appointment as supervisors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> There are cases where supervisors are in receipt of pensions from the board's superannuation schemes which are less than the social welfare retirement or old age pensions.  Some of these, as I have indicated, by virtue of their previous insurability, would be entitled to such social welfare benefit as would bring their pension up to at least the minimum level of the contributory social welfare pension. Those not holding such previous insurability would, subject to a means test, qualify for such social welfare benefit as would bring their pension up to at least the minimum level of the social welfare non-contributory pension appropriate to them.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, CIE and the staff interests have been authorised by the Government to continue negotiations on a new service related scheme for the wages grades staff on similar lines to public sector type schemes as to contributions and benefits, to be considered by the Government on the basis of prevailing financial circumstances when a final draft scheme is submitted to me.  The position outlined in the Deputy's question will no doubt be taken into account in the course of these negotiations.</P>

      <P>The question of Sunday polling has been considered on several occasions in the past in relation to Dáil, Presidential, and other elections.  I am aware that there are advantages and disadvantages involved in the proposal.  For instance, while it would facilitate workers generally by giving them a wider choice as to the time of day at which to vote, large categories of workers, e.g. in transport, hospitals, hotels, have to work on Sundays. Voting on Sunday seems to have proved satisfactory in a number of the other EEC countries but I am not convinced that there is a strong case in favour of its introduction in Ireland at present.</P>

A further letter was received in February 1983 from the Department of the Environment saying that a reply was still awaited from Dublin Corporation in respect of the hospitals in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>My Department have again, this month, written to the Department of the Environment expressing grave concern at the delay and asking that the inspection of these hospitals be carried out at an early date by the fire officers.  As soon as I have a report on the matter I will be in touch with the Deputy.</P>

Arrears of £184.30 in respect of her fifth child for the period from 14 October 1982 to 16 February 1983 were offset against a claim for refund of £650.00 supplementary welfare allowance paid to her by the South-Eastern Health Board after the commencement of her entitlement to the social assistance allowance.

      <P>It was determined by an appeals officer on 29 October 1982 that the person concerned is not entitled to any pension as the assessment of his means, consisting of the value of a holding, the transfer of which has not been accepted for old age pension purposes, exceeds the statutory limit.  Following further inquiries the case was again referred to the appeals officer who, however, considered that there are no new facts or fresh evidence which would warrant a revision of his decision.  It transpired that the claimant's nephew to whom the holding was transferred still works a 45 hour week elsewhere and the claimant was effectively in control of the holding.</P>

      <P>To be entitled to unemployment assistance an applicant must be the holder of a qualification certificate which is a statement of his means.

When interviewed by a social welfare <Col N="985" /> officer the person concerned threatened the officer and refused to answer queries.</P>
      <P>A letter received by the Department on behalf of the person concerned is being treated as an appeal against the decision revoking his qualification certificate and his case is being referred to an appeals officer.
