      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I want to ask about the arithmetic of the Estimate.  I have been fortunate enough to get a copy of the Supplementary Estimate and I am probably very privileged to have got this document. The document I have shows an original Estimate of £750,000.  The revised Estimate is £750,000 plus £10.  We are apparently voting through an additional sum of £10.  Perhaps the Minister of State would explain how far that £10 will go to pay creditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am sure Deputy Haughey understands that this is a token Estimate, which is a technical device to allow these moneys to be paid prior to discussion in this House.  It arises because they must be paid by 18 April.  As soon as these moneys have been paid and identified we will come back with a proper Estimate and there will be a debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Am I right in thinking that this is only a parliamentary finance device to enable these moneys to be paid out and that in fact the entire sum of £750,000 plus £10 will come before us in due course and we will have an opportunity of debating it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>: I had a letter from you this morning marked &ldquo;Urgent&rdquo;.  A number of amendments in my name were adjudged out of order.  While I understand that some could be ruled out of order under Standing Order 118, I fail to understand why amendments 1 to 5, inclusive, have been ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: The amendments were ruled out of order because they imposed a potential charge on the Exchequer.  That is well established under Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>: I contend that amendments 1 to 5 do not put an increased charge on the Exchequer because, in <Col N="567" /> effect, the Government have increased the social welfare benefits by 12 per cent and 10 per cent respectively.  If that amount were reduced to what it really is &mdash; 9 per cent and 7½ per cent for the year and paid from the beginning of April &mdash; it would not create a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have considered these carefully and have taken expert advice.  The effect of the amendments of which the Deputy is speaking is to bring forward the payment date and, in so doing, more money will be drawn out of the fund.  If there is a shortfall in the fund as a result there is a statutory duty on the Government or on the Exchequer to make up the balance and that is what is known as a potential charge on the revenue.  If there were to be an absolute charge, then before it could be ruled out of order maybe we would have to have evidence that that was so. Obviously there was a potential charge and time and time again amendments have been ruled out.  I am sorry, Deputy, there is nothing I can do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept what you say in relation to the increased charge if the 12 per cent or 10 per cent were given from the beginning of April as should have been done in the first place, but if the 9 per cent and 7.5 per cent were given for the year it would not create an increased charge on the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I support the Deputy on the basis that for some reason we were given percentages on budget day that no longer apply.  The Minister is well aware that the effect, for example, of devaluation alone has made an amazing impact.  The amendment before this House on this occasion differs from similar <Col N="568" /> amendments that could be put down on other occasions (1) from the point of view of the change caused by devaluation and (2) because the percentage claimed by the Minister relates to the imposition of these coming in in the first week of July or so when normally they would come in on 1 April.  It is a completely different picture for the recipients and beneficiaries who should be benefitting by certain percentage increases that they have not been receiving.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: The effect of these amendments would be to draw more money out of the fund.  There is a statutory duty on the Government to make good any shortfalls in the fund which would arise and it is not necessary that before an amendment is ruled out of order under this or any other order there be proof positive that it will impose a charge on the funds.  If there is a potential charge it is properly ruled out.  I will not change my ruling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>: We will oppose section 2.  We are not opposing the increase, meagre though it is, but we certainly oppose the size of the increase because we believe that 12 per cent and 10 per cent, or rightly 9 per cent and 7.5 per cent, for the year is about half of what the increase in the cost of living and inflation will be this year.  We are unhappy about the size of the increase.  Particularly we are unhappy about the fact that these payments will not be made until the beginning of July or until the last day of June and the first day of July.  That is a precedent and perhaps a dangerous one. In the years to come the Coalition Government might decide not to pay these benefits until six or nine months later.  That would leave the recipients in a very serious predicament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Society is judged on the attitude of the community to its weaker sections, to the poor, the aged, the ill and the handicapped.  No self-respecting politician in this House could support this section of the Bill.  Successive Governments have committed themselves to looking after the weaker sections of the population and this is first time perhaps since 1929, <Col N="572" /> that a Government have delayed implementation of increases in such a way as to create real hardship for those at the lower end of the income scale.  Even since the Second Stage of this Bill commenced, another 2 per cent has been added by devaluation.  This will militate against the weaker sections of our community.  If one were to use the arithmetic of this Social Welfare Bill, it would mean that recipients of long-term benefits having received a 25 per cent increase over a full year, would gain 31¼ per cent over nine months.  Here we have increases of 12 per cent and 10 per cent at a time of rising inflation and rising cost of living, much of it brought about by the actions of this Government in their short time in office.</P>
    <P>The VAT increases of 5 per cent across the board will have a very serious effect on social welfare recipients, as will VAT imposed on fuel for the first time.  Devaluation will also seriously affect them.  The increase in the price of petrol of 36p for those who, because they live in the heart of rural Ireland have no choice but to keep some sort of car, even to sign on for their unemployment assistance, will have a serious effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement said that the improvements this year would cost the Exchequer £88.6 million, whereas the Minister for Social Welfare in his opening statement on this Bill said that the cost would be £80.6 million.  How does this difference of £8 million arise?</P>
    <P>In relation to the drugs refund scheme, the amount which one has to pay for drugs each month has increased from £12 to £23.  The increases in social welfare benefits and unemployment assistance for a single person have gone up by £10.60 per month.  The people without medical cards will not receive enough to cover the increase in the drugs refund scheme.  A Government which introduced such a measure should be ashamed of themselves.  I am surprised that so many Members, particularly of the Labour Party, voted for Second Stage of the Bill last night.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister taken account of devaluation?  If he knew at the time of the budget that there would be devaluation, <Col N="573" /> did he make provision in these payments for devaluation and is it intended to give a further increase to these social welfare recipients to ensure that they will be able to live under conditions of minimum comfort in the coming year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I support the comments of my colleague and while accepting the Chair's decision to rule out of order the amendments tabled, I find it hard to understand why that has happened. The change of date does not necessarily mean a change in the amount of money provided.</P>
      <P>Before I was elected to this House I so often heard the then Deputy Barry Desmond, a member of the Labour Party, from the Opposition benches weep, scream and plead for extra assistance for those in the lower income bracket in our society.  Very good reading for the once proud Labour Party would be the contribution of the Minister, then Deputy Desmond on the Finance Bill of 1982.  They should read his contribution on the amendment tabled by Deputy Gregory &mdash; amendment 33 (b) I think &mdash; less than a year ago.  His present comments should be compared with that.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Hanlon has said, the 10 and 12 per cent increases are not real. They have gone already for a number of reasons and I am not taking into account the annual CPI increase or any part of it. They have gone simply because of the inflationary effect of the budget, which the Minister for Finance accepted was 3½ per cent.  He and every Member of the House knows that the 3½ per cent becomes 5 per cent because of the knock-on impact.  We are told that devaluation accounts for about 2 per cent more, which is a conservative estimate. That brings the 5 per cent to 7 per cent. For a Labour Party Minister not to introduce those benefits &mdash; meagre though they be &mdash; until the first week in July is incredible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that they are not being introduced until the first week of July means that if one were to compare what happens in normal circumstances, one is talking about a difference of approximately 3 per cent.  That brings the 7 per cent I spoke <Col N="574" /> about to 10 per cent, eroding completely the 10 per cent increase and almost completely eroding the 12 per cent, and I have not taken into account the annual CPI increase.  That gives some indication of the drop in living standards which these people will have to endure unless the Minister does something about it. The members of his party appear to have surrendered to the arithmetic and financial rectitude they preached about for so long.  In the weeks prior to the election these people shed crocodile tears for these people on social welfare.  Has the Minister moved so far away from the needs of these people that he has forgotten what he said before he took office?</P>
    <P>We will oppose these sections to the Nth degree and expect every Labour Deputy to examine his or her conscience and think back on what they said in this House.  Are they going to vote through a section which will not give these people even a 1 per cent increase, but rather a sharp drop in their living standards?  The Labour Party Minister, Deputy B. Desmond, when on the Opposition benches cried and pleaded for these people.</P>
    <P>I want to ask a number of specific questions. In the budget we were told that the personal and adult dependant rate for those on retirement pension/old age contributory pension in April 1982 was £40.25, and from the beginning of July 1983 there would be an increase of £4.85, giving a new rate of £45.10.  The old age contributory pension for 80 years or over, personal rate was £43.05 in April 1982 and from the beginning of July 1983 the increase will be £5.15, giving the new rate of £48.20.  The widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit, under 66 years, was £36.25 in April 1982 and from July 1983 the increase will be £4.35, giving a new rate of £40.60.</P>
    <P>What assistance is the Minister providing for those people living in rent-restricted accommodation, where difficulties were created because of the 1981 Supreme Court decisions?  Listening to the Minister for Finance on budget day I became suspicious that these people were in for a rude awakening because after the Minister had sat down, the <Col N="575" /> famous pink pages we have referred to on a number of occasions were passed around.  They gave more detail, more scaring detail, than was given in the Minister's presentation.</P>
    <P>On page 14 under the heading Non-Capital Supply Services there were two columns: the first gave the principal policy measures adopted by the previous Government in settling the published Estimate and the second gave the principal policy measures adopted by this Government in settling the revised Estimates. The second column, paragraph B (d), reads:</P>
    <P>The provision of £15.5 million for rent allowances for tenants of formerly controlled dwellings under Rents Restrictions Acts is being reduced to £10.5 million in the light of more up-to-date data.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to stop bluffing and tell the Labour Party what is meant by that phrase &ldquo;in the light of more up-to-date data&rdquo;.  He knows as well as I do that it was an arithmetical exercise.  But what is happening on the ground?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I understood Deputy Fitzgerald to raise the point that no provision was made in the Bill for assistance to help hardship cases of tenancies, where people found themselves liable for huge rents.  The Chair is not ruling this out; he is trying to the best of his ability to introduce order into the discussion.  Deputy O'Hanlon suggested that sections 2 and 3 be taken together <Col N="577" /> and maybe there was something in what he said but when we come to section 3 the Chair could not have any objection to the Deputy raising this matter <i>ad nauseum</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: There seems to be some confusion.  This is just as relevant to section 2 as it is to section 3 and for this reason.  As the Chair is aware, both Governments know of the difficulties which were caused by the Supreme Court decision and that as a result of that decision, certain subsidisation provisions were made for people in receipt of benefit or assistance &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: Perhaps the Chair could simplify matters.  As the Chair sees it, if Deputy Fitzgerald is complaining that the amount of benefit given is not sufficient to meet the increases in the cost of living, that is in order.  But if what Deputy Fitzgerald is saying is that there is not sufficient money being provided to help the people who are caught up in this High Court decision then there is no doubt it is appropriate on section 3 rather than section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I began by saying that the 10 per cent has already been eroded.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: All of us are aware of the social welfare document SW 58 which refers to rent allowances for tenants affected by the decontrol of rents. May I ask the Minister to be very specific <Col N="578" /> in regard to those covered by the increases in section 2 who are, as of now, availing of subsidisation?  Does their position worsen substantially now?  For example, a single person in receipt of £40.25 at April 1982 will be in receipt of £45.10 from July.  If such a person has a small private income from some other source that brings his income to £47, it appears to me that five times 50p will be taken away if that person is being subsidised for rented accommodation.  Will the Minister amend the Bill to prevent this happening?  The recipients of these benefits will be in a much worse position from 1 July onwards.  I think my argument is reasonable and I thank you for bearing with me, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>The cases are going through the court at a remarkable rate.  The money provided in the budget appears to be two-thirds of what had been provided prior to that.  I do not understand the reason for that.  Does the Minister intend at least to restore the position of those people, which indeed is not enough because we should be providing additional benefit. Without taking the cost of living into account, 10 per cent of the 12 per cent is already gone because of devaluation, the pushing forward of the date of payment and the budget proposals.  People with subsidised rented accommodation are suffering still more, as far as I can see.  I honestly do not understand how the Labour Party can allow this section to pass.  I want to support what Deputy O'Hanlon has said.  I do not understand why Deputy Barry Desmond is putting through this legislation.  In the interests of the lower paid workers in this city and in this country, for goodness sake let us be responsible and reasonable.</P>

      <P>: In his winding-up speech yesterday the Minister for Social Welfare was particularly scathing in his attack on Fianna Fáil who had proposed almost exactly the same ideas on benefits and cuts as the Coalition Government <Col N="579" /> have introduced, and rightly so because quite a lot of the objections of the Fianna Fail Deputies are somewhat tongue-in-cheek. There is evidence in <i>The Way Forward</i> of the type of Bill which they would have brought in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>: In regard to this section those scathing remarks should not apply to the Fianna Fáil benches.  The most amazing part of the Bill, savage as it is, is the decision to apply the cuts in April and the benefits in June.  That is the portion which makes this Bill what Deputy Bell called it &mdash; an evil and savage Bill.  This is precisely the type of thing which makes the word &ldquo;evil&rdquo; relevant. The fact that there are just a small number of benefits and that they are so low and have been put off until June whereas the tremendous cuts are taking place in April is just unbelievable.  I am dealing now with section 2.  The sharpest cuts have been made in relation to the ill, the pregnant, the unemployed and those on short-time working &mdash; people claiming disability benefit, maternity allowance or unemployment benefit with which pay-related benefit may also be payable. People like that will lose anything up to £20 a week in April as a result of the changes in pay-related benefit.  They will get increases of something between £3 and £4 a week in June and they will get more if they have qualified dependants. They would need a great number of dependants to make up for the £20 loss in April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a person whose reckonable weekly earnings are £132 a week in the 1981-82 tax year the present level of pay-related benefit will be £40 a week. That is 40 per cent of the difference between £32 and £132.  After April it will be only £24 a week based on 25 per cent of the difference between £36 and £132. In fact there will be a drop of £16 a week from £40 to £24 a week.  The fact that the maximum personal rate of unemployment benefit and disability benefit will increase in June by £3.15 &mdash; that is from <Col N="580" /> £31.65 to £34.80 &mdash; will not be much compensation for the person who has lost £16 in April.  In fact that particular individual is being deprived of a further £40 by cutting off the increase in benefit until the end of June.  It is a further tax of £3.15 per week on that person from the month of April to the beginning of July. That is a savage and evil section in this Bill.  There is a £40 a week further deprivation of those who will be deprived of £16 a week in any case and a small increase of £3.15 is being deducted from them for that period of three months. That is a further penal tax on a person who has been already savagely dealt with in the remainder of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want to spend too long on this because the same arguments will be coming up on section 3 and other sections of the Bill; but postponing for three months will have the further effect, due to inflation, of depriving the beneficiaries of further benefits because a further increase in prices will have taken place between April and July.  We are told that prices will increase further as a result of the decision taken the other day to devalue the púnt.  That will create further increases in living costs and prices and will therefore deprive beneficiaries of the £3.15 they should be getting in April.  But that increase will be of less value in July and beneficiaries will be further deprived.  It was estimated in fact that the total cost of living consumer price increase between April of last year and July of this year will be something in the order of 20 per cent.  Now the increases which are being given are 10 per cent for the part-time benefits and 12 per cent for pensioners over long-term payments. There will therefore be a difference between 8 per cent and 10 per cent in the benefits and the cost of living increase.</P>
    <P>My information from certain Fine Gael circles is that this section is a Labour Party input into the Bill.  It was not the original intention of the Coalition Bill at all but for some convoluted reason the Labour Party have in fact decided that this should be postponed from April until June.  That is the story that is going around in certain circles and, if that story is true, it makes it even more unbelievable <Col N="581" /> and I will be glad to hear the Minister deny that this is the case.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the other sections of the Bill being put through I would appeal to the Minister and the Government to amend this section and give the benefits at the same time as the cutback.  I do not know the amount involved.  I have heard various figures between £2 million, £30 million or £39 million mentioned.  I do not belive it would cost anything in the region of £30 million odd.  On the basis of common humanity and justice I would ask the Minister to amend this section to ensure that benefits are paid in April or that the cuts do not take place until June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Might I intervene at this stage to reply to a number of points raised so far?  The single most important point to be made is that the bringing forward of the increases from the end of June, the last pay week in June, to the first pay week in April would entail an additional cost of £39 million.  Now there were no funds, of that magnitude this year to provide that kind of money.  This year, taking the unemployment side alone, we will be spending on unemployment related expenditure no less than £475 million, a massive increase over 1982 in which the increase was £93 million.  The alternatives facing us were and are startling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not heard Deputy De Rossa come in and suggest we should increase the rates of PRSI by, for example, 1.3 per cent.  That would yield this year £39 million.  We made no increase in PRSI contributions this year because of the very substantial imposition which such rates have on workers and on employers as well.  What we have done is increased the payment level from £9,500 to £13,000 a year.  But that only brings in £16 million, which is a very small amount.  I do not know the exact number but, speaking from memory, only about one in every ten earns more than £13,000 a year.  You may ask why not go right to the top and let everyone pay up to the maximum of earnings?  Personally I would have no great objection to that but we have raised the tax rate to 65 per cent and those earning more than £13,500 will be paying <Col N="582" /> substantially more in income tax this year.  However, supposing we decided to let everybody pay PRSI right up to the maximum of all earnings, what would be the advantage.  We would get about £9 million.  That is all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>: What about getting in all the money that is already owed on PRSI?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: To me there appeared to be a profound inherent misunderstanding in the amendment Deputy Mac Giolla tabled on Second Stage.  I made the point last night to him.  There is the illusion that PAYE employees pay the bulk of PRSI.  That is not true. Actually 52 per cent of all pay-related social insurance is paid by employers and this year we will take from employers £537 million and we will take from employees £260 million.  The Exchequer will contribute £220 million roughly.  Perhaps it is one of the greatest deficiencies of Dáil Éireann that anyone can walk in here and say let us pay social welfare increases as from 5th April.  Why not 1 January?  Why not 5 June?  No difficulty. All one needs to do is insert a one line amendment in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Nobody on the Opposition side has told us where the £39 million is to come from.  Deputy Haughey, for example has suggested that the increases should be of the order of 15 per cent.  Since to grant this higher rate would result in the expenditure of another £40 million to £50 million it appears that the Opposition would like us to spend an addition £60 million to £80 million on social welfare this year.  We are faced with a critical situation whereby, to take the unemployment side alone, half of all the current budget deficit of £890 million will be directed to unemployment-related expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald raised the question of the rent allowances provision.  That legislation was brought in by his administration. It is true that we expect to pay less money this year under this heading than we paid last year but the only reason for this is the courts dispute.  There are separate provisions for rent allowances <Col N="583" /> and there is no change in the position in that regard.  The question of the date of application of the social welfare increases has been raised.  Considerable thought was given to this matter but this is not the first occasion on which the increases did not apply from April.  In both 1973 and 1974 the date of application was July.  In this instance it is the last week in June. This will mean approximately 27 payments for the year.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the provision of £88 million for social welfare increases as announced in the Financial Statement and to the figure of £80 million given by me last evening.  The difference is accounted for by way of the income supplement of £5 million plus a provision of £3 million for health allowances not provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The propaganda that has surrounded this Bill has caused considerable distress to the many thousands of pensioners throughout the country who are under the impression that their rate of pension is being cut.  Some Deputies have made irresponsible statements in that regard. I reiterate that the increases are as follows: £8.45 for a person on a retirement or an old age contributory pension and who has an adult dependant of 66 years or older thereby bringing the new rate to £78.75.  Likewise, the old age contributory pension which is currently £73.10 is being increased by £8.75 to bring it to £81.85.  Instead of causing needless worry to the elderly, to people on disability benefit in particular and to many others who may not be aware fully of their social welfare entitlements, Deputies should exercise a degree of circumspection and responsibility in their explanations of the Bill.  The ordinary rates of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit, widows' contributory pension or deserted wife's benefit are not in any way affected by the ceilings that have been introduced on disability benefit, unemployment benefit and on the maternity pay-related supplement.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out there is no cut-back in the area of unemployment related expenditure in 1983.  Last year the relevant amount was £381 million <Col N="584" /> while this year it is £475 million.  There is a sharp limitation on the amount of money that can be made available in this area in a situation where there are fewer contributors to PRSI and to PAYE, where there are fewer employers than there were two or three years ago and where there is a reduced consumer demand by virtue of the recession with the consequent reduction in tax yields.  It is facile for Deputies to demand increases in cash payments when they are not putting forward proposals of any kind in regard to raising the extra revenue that would be involved.  I exempt from my strictures the Opposition spokesman who understands the position acutely.  I have no doubt that that understanding is shared widely within the community.  If we were to bring forward the 10 and 12 per cent increases to 1 April the moneys required would be £39 million and that would involve an increase of 1.3 per cent in the full rate of PRSI contributions with a proportionate increase in the modified rates.  If this had been the position I am sure Deputies would have showered criticism on us.  There has been no increase in PRSI rates or contributions at all this year.  I would stress that the system is not one which is financed on what one might call a social insurance basis.  It is financed on a tripartite basis by employees, employers and by the substantial contributions required by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of unfortunate misunderstanding about our system of social insurance.  That system, which is basically similar to that obtaining in other countries, which has a long history, does provide basic social protection against the massive contingencies facing many families with regard to disability, sickness, unemployment, widowhood, old age, for which the ordinary family and individual are quite unable to provide and cope with alone and for which provision is made on a collective basis.  We have said consciously that employers should pay the buik of the moneys required &mdash; 52 per cent this year &mdash; and that workers and the State should share the balance of the cost.  Listening to some Deputies here one would imagine one was talking simply about a commercial <Col N="585" /> insurance system, a system under which if one put in a few bob every week one automatically got back a degree of benefit. Our system has been quite different from that in concept from the early 1950s.</P>
    <P>There is a great need also for public awareness of the benefits of social insurance because there is a lot of spurious campaigning taking place now in relation to pay-related social insurance &mdash; the anti-PRSI syndrome &mdash; which is being fostered by certain sections of the community. In fact some trade union sections quite unwittingly and on a very counterproductive basis have fostered an anti-PRSI syndrome in our community, a highly dangerous thing to do.  What happens then?  It means that employers may well say, why should we be paying PRSI? Let the State pay it, let workers pay it themselves, we will just stop paying. Then I should like to see where some of the trade unions criticism would come from.</P>
    <P>As one who has been in this House since 1969 &mdash; when we have had up to 1979 contributions which were basically flat-rate contributions &mdash; I campaigned for ten years in this House to have those flat-rate contributions abolished because I considered them to be highly regressive and meant that all workers, irrespective of earnings, paid the same amount.  When I was in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, from 1964 to 1969, when I was not a Deputy, I campaigned strenuously against them as well.  When I first became a trade union official in 1967, in the Transport Union, I campaigned against them also.  I strongly criticised the system of flat-rate contribution as being regressive, as being particularly inequitable in the way they affected lower paid workers. I pointed out that there was real need to provide a system that would be fairer in relation to earnings of those people paying contributions.  As we know, after a long, hard battle at many levels, a system of a fully pay-related contribution was introduced only in April 1979.  I might point out that in April 1983 the employer will pay 11.6 per cent of his payroll and the employee 5.5 per cent of his earnings for social welfare.  To repeat, this year the employers will pay £537 million and <Col N="586" /> employees £260 million.  In 1982 employers paid 49 per cent to the fund.  This year they will pay about 52 per cent.  Last year workers paid 23 per cent into the Social Insurance Fund while the Exchequer paid in 28 per cent.  I want to repeat that the system is basically a &ldquo;pay as we go&rdquo; one.  There are no reserves.  It means that the income of the Social Insurance Fund, contributed by employers, employees and the State, for any one year, is paid out to persons entitled to various benefits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla may be tempted to fall into the very dangerous trap &mdash; one I would urge him not to fall into &mdash; of criticising the fact that short-time workers will get no pay-related benefit even though they pay PRSI contributions. I would submit that that is a mistaken belief because the contribution is pay-related.  There is a very mistaken belief that because the contribution is pay-related there is an automatic entitlement to pay-related benefit.  That is not and cannot be so.  Pay-related social insurance contribution from workers, employers and the Exchequer are the means of financing the whole range of benefits from retirement pensions right down to contributory widow's pensions. Therefore it cannot be regarded as an automatic entitlement and the contributions by employers and workers are payable in proportion.  To qualify for each benefit, including pay-related benefit, particular conditions must be satisfied.</P>
    <P>Now tragically and wrongly our PRSI system is under so much attack, largely by those who have the good fortune to be in employment, to have good health, who are a long way from retirement, who are not faced with immediate exigencies of, for example, maternity, sickness, widowhood, or indeed old age, such persons in our community.  We live in a very self-centered community.  We live in a community in which, as we long know from years of political activity, everybody particularises about himself or herself, his or her income, his or her benefits and entitlement without having a broader social horizon with regard to the rights and benefits of everybody else.  That is a dangerous manifestation in which agitation <Col N="587" /> is very easily fomented in our community, about PRSI in particular.  One could see a lot of merit in agitation about PAYE and income taxation.  But, as regards pay-related social insurance, a lot of the agitation could prove to be higly counter-productive and could defeat the aims and objectives of the trade union movement.  In particular I would urge trade unionists who currently advocate reductions in PRSI contributions to note with great care the extent to which employers are obliged now to contribute to the benefits workers enjoy.  Perhaps there is a substantial case to be made that in respect of some aspects of disability benefit in particular employers should be obliged to pay sickness benefit payments for perhaps the first two or three weeks. That requires some examination and I am sure that aspect would provoke a lot of reaction if one advocated it.  It is something that could be examined but in the current context I do not have any proposals to make on it.</P>
    <P>If I have dealt with this matter at length it is because I am anxious to stress that pay-related benefit is payable as a supplement with unemployment, disability, maternity and occupational injury benefits. It is true that from the beginning of April it will be payable after three weeks on income over £36 per week.  Deputy Mac Giolla did not make any reference to the fact that there will be a new ceiling of £220 per week and, in the case of disability, maternity and occupational injury benefits, the amount of the benefit payable will be restricted to 80 per cent. It is not unreasonable that it should be 80 per cent.  We are the only country in Western Europe, as far as I can gather, which has such a ceiling.  If one examines the Swedish, French or Belgian systems I am sure one will find that our system can stand up to close examination.</P>
    <P>In the case of unemployment benefit the restriction is 85 per cent of reckonable earnings in the current year and that is not entirely unreasonable.  It means that a married man with children, if he has gross weekly earnings of £145 per week will get 85 per cent replacement.  If he <Col N="588" /> does not have any children he will get 71 per cent replacement of earnings.  Admittedly, between April and June the replacement will be somewhat less, by 1 or 2 per cent.  The percentages I have mentioned do not take any account of the income tax refunds which in practice many workers are entitled to.  I am not saying that workers are not entitled to the changes but I stress that if the new arrangements had not been introduced the rates of PRSI contributions would have had to be further increased or we would have had further expenditure cuts.</P>
    <P>I may be asked where the money is going to come from for those increases. Deputies may suggest that I should get the money from the £25 million which is owed for 1981-82 for PRSI contributions but I should like to make the point that that represents 4 per cent of all contributions. In fact, the rate of payment of PRSI by employers is very much up to the estimated yields.  For 1982 it was within £2 million or £3 million of actual yield and we must bear in mind that we are in the midst of a major recession.  Of that £25 million we expect to get in between £19 million and £20 million in the current year.  There is no doubt that the moneys due will be demanded from all employers.  I can assure the House that the Departments of Finance and Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners act with great vigour and rigour in insisting that all moneys due are paid in.  I do not regard such payments as a source of major income.  Admittedly it appears to be a large amount but in terms of total contributions paid under PRSI by employers it amounts to 4 per cent.  We must keep a sense of proportion in that regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress that we have introduced substantial new measures of prosecution.  Not only will an employer be liable but his agent, or any person acting on behalf of an employer, such as a personal managers or company secretaries will be liable.  Nobody will be able to dodge the new provisions.  We want to ensure that there will not be any fraud or non-payment of contrubutions.  The provisions of the Bill will tighten up the legislation and leave little room for fraud. <Col N="589" /> I can assure the House that I would have wished to give greater increases if the money was available.  The alternative would have been to borrow another £50 million or £60 million or impose another series of expenditure cuts to that amount. We were not going to do that whether we were to be kept in Government or not. We were not going to cook the books this year but present them properly and make sure that the budget arithmetic &mdash; there is nothing monetarist about getting the arithmetic right &mdash; was correct.  Anybody can cod the people.  In 1980 the budget was codded through and in 1981 it had to be brought back on course but in 1982 we had total chaos which became evident in the middle of July that year.  We are all aware that that chaos brought down the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the system of social insurance and the financing of social welfare.  That is why I stressed that it was my intention to establish a commission on social welfare.  For the first time since 1949 we will have a commission on social welfare and I would warmly welcome contributions from all parties to that commission.  There has not been any examination of the whole structure of social welfare since 1952-53 when the system was introduced.  There has not been any clarity in terms of the real impact it has on family income, particularly the income of poor families.  The commission will, as far as I am concerned, be composed of persons of the highest expertise on social policy.  I am sure it will act on an independent basis in making recommendations of considerable importance to the Government as to the future structure of our social services and social security system.  There is an urgent need to broaden the system to take in the self-employed on a more effective basis and ensure that there is parity between the public and private sectors.  We must also ensure that we have married in the taxation system.  Deputy Woods is aware of the appalling problem of getting a system that will marry the income tax and social welfare codes.  We have not succeeded in doing that.</P>
    <P>In a small country of 3.3 million people of whom 1.1 million are in receipt of <Col N="590" /> social welfare payments it is inexcusable that we have not yet set up an interlocking system of family income maintenance using the benefits of computerisation. This should have been done long before now but politicians have been too busy playing politics with the system and parading their pet percentage increases every April as though these were the only things that mattered.  We, the politicians, have been so busy with public relations, political party relations and ensuring that the electorate returns us to Dáil Éireann that we have not done any really basic work when holding portfolios.  For me these reforms come first and political popularity and narrow party political considerations come second.  I am convinced that if I and my colleague, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, spend a few years in this Department we will certainly succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: I doubt the value of rising to speak on this section having listened to the Minister.  He is a fairly hopeless case because he has been totally brainwashed either by the Minister for Finance, the Government or the Fine Gael Party.  He sounds like one of those people who has been taken into a cult and keeps preaching the same story repeatedly as if there could be no other point of view.  Perhaps the best thing we could recommend is that the Minister should be taken away and de-programmed and sent back as a proper Labour Minister within a Coalition Government.  I do not believe that an extreme right wing person would put forward arguments on this section other than those the Minister has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He criticises the Opposition for talking about the delay but the date has been put back by the Minister and we are talking about restoring the date of application to the beginning of April.  I appreciate that this would cost £39.3 million.  It is the function of Government to find the solution to these problems.  People look to receive these benefits at the normal time. The Government's actions in increasing unemployment, which are a deliberate part of Government strategy, have placed a greater burden on this Minister and he has had to provide an extra £31 <Col N="591" /> million to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The failure to provide the necessary £39.3 million means that old age pensioners are losing out to the extent of £15.5 million while widows are suffering a clawback of £5.5 million.  The disabled are also losing £5.5 million, the unemployed £10.7 million and others £1.1 million, making a total of £39.3 million.  The Minister chastises Deputy Mac Giolla and ourselves for daring to suggest that old age pensioners should be paid as normal from the beginning of April.  He almost makes us feel that we are letting the country down by making this claim.</P>
    <P>I agree that there are anomalies in the system which must be tackled.  The Minister will know that a fundamental review of the system was carried out last summer and the benefits of that review are available to him.  Let us not cloud the issue. We are talking about genuine contributors who are not receiving their normal entitlements.</P>
    <P>This section does not tell us that the Minister is dropping the provision for a double week in September and December. It cost £4 million last year and would probably cost just under £5 million this year.  This clawback represents a real cash loss to the people involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister also leaves out the fact that these people are not receiving children's allowances.  Of course, within their direct social welfare payments they are getting an increase but for a person on unemployment benefit that increase amounts to 75p per week from the end of June this year.  For a second child the increase is 85p.  Unemployment is difficult enough for people and one does not even have to consider the VAT increases, the devaluation of our currency and the changes in fuel prices and transport costs to realise that an extra 75p will do nothing to help the unemployed.  It will not meet the increased charges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell was quite correct in what he said and the Minister will find that the ability of people in the poverty area to meet the needs of the day is being systematically reduced.  There are excessive reductions in their general level of benefit. For instance, there is the reduction <Col N="592" /> from 40 per cent to 25 per cent for pay-related benefit, in addition to what is happening to the basic rate.  Following the inter-departmental review last summer a reduction from 40 per cent to 30 per cent was indicated.  The Minister should not have capitulated to a further reduction because it goes beyond what is required.  It is a measure to take more money out of the system.  An increasing number of people are in receipt of unemployment assistance and such people will get an extra £2.65 a week from the end of June.  This is in addition to the £26 which they now receive.</P>
    <P>We can see how savagely these people are being treated when we consider that the Minister is saving £10.7 million by holding back this increase until the beginning of July.  The Minister should say, as he said so often in the House before when he was on this side, that these basic levels are inadequate to sustain people at the present time.  They were increased by 25 per cent in each of the last three years. We did not make an apology for doing that in very difficult economic times when we had Ministers for Finance who wanted to get their books and calculations right. The 25 per cent only brought those people up to £26 a week.  That is what is worrying Deputies on all sides of the House, even those on the Government side in Fine Gael and Labour, when they look at the reality of the position and the advancing cost of living.</P>
    <P>We support the Minister in implementing the measures which are necessary at the moment but we do not support him in going beyond that to take more money out of the system and to cheesepare on the old age pensioners, the widows, the disabled and the unemployed in the way in which the extra benefits are given.  That is why we said 15 per cent was the figure we had in mind.  We did not get as far as presenting the budget. Our leader has said that is the target we were working on and, as Minister for Social Welfare at that time, I know that that was the position.  We had a duty as a Government to find the means of doing that and not do as the Minister is doing: coming into the House and telling us all the reasons why it cannot be done rather <Col N="593" /> than working out how exactly it can be done.</P>
    <P>We had a fairly substantial lecture from the Minister on the whole system of insurance. I agree with him that many people do not understand that the employer contributes so much and that the State contributes to the system.  We have had that system for a good many years and it is the system people are entitled to benefit from.  There is nothing new about the fact that the employer is paying 11.6 per cent. The Minister might point to the fact that employers in Europe pay considerably higher rates.  The Minister said that as far as the employee is concerned the rate is 5.5 per cent for social insurance but he did not mention plus 1 per cent, plus 1 per cent plus 1 per cent.  He did not mention plus 1 per cent for health, plus 1 per cent for youth employment levy and plus 1 per cent now for a new levy which has been brought in to raise funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very careful to say that the rate of PRSI, which is 7.5 per cent as far as the working man is concerned, was not being increased.  You have to have a lecture like the Minister gave us this morning to understand the breakdown of the 7.5 per cent.  Most people do not go into that.  They just look at what they pay for PRSI, which includes the youth employment levy, the health charge and the basic social insurance.  We gave a firm commitment that we would not increase the PRSI rates because we regarded them as very high already.  The Minister did not say that another 1 per cent special levy is being introduced which will be collected at the same time. Will the Minister clarify that the collection of this 1 per cent levy will be made in conjunction with the PRSI figure from the beginning of April?  I understand that the Minister for Finance says that is the case.  As far as the worker is concerned it means going from 7.8 per cent to 8.5 per cent.  I will leave it to the Minister how he will present that and what sort of package he has.  His propaganda machine is very extensive and far reaching so I know it will do a very good job in presenting that.  The working man will find that, instead of 7.5 per cent, 8.5 per cent will be deducted.  The Minister is taking <Col N="594" /> a further 1 per cent for Government purposes and this is not being used to alleviate the situation within the social insurance system.</P>
    <P>Is this all that is to be given?  Will there be a double week in September and in December?  As far as we know there will not be a double week in September and December for those on social welfare benefits generally.  As the Minister knows, it was very helpful at the beginning of September last year for the people who are on long term unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance because they go on to the lower levels. All their pay-related benefit is gone and they depend on the lowest levels.  At the start of a new school year in September this double week was a very valuable contribution because it meant they got double for each child.  They got the same just before Christmas.  It was very necessary to give this because of the cost of clothing and preparation for school.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister consider the rise adequate in view of the changes in the consumer price index because of the extra costs that will be added by the budget and the devaluation which reduces the position generally for people on fixed incomes?  If we take the devaluation at 4 per cent it means a fairly substantial reduction.  If you take its impact on the consumer price index, it is at least an extra 2 per cent.  That has come subsequent to the preparation of this Bill and the budget.  Does the Minister plan to get from the Government an extra 2 per cent or more to cover this change which has taken place since then? The Taoiseach has said that the devaluation is a success for him.  If the Government intended this, why did they not give something to compensate within the general level of social welfare increases?</P>
    <P>I will not go into any detail in relation to medical cards but I would like to refer to one point.  The Minister pointed out that for an old age pensioner and a dependant approximately £78 is the combined rate for both.  That would be for an adult dependant of 66 years or more on old age pension.  I should have known the Minister would be citing the highest figure. When there are two old age pensioners <Col N="595" /> their income from June next will be £78.75p, according to the Minister.  I should like to point out to him that the medical card guideline is £77 for a couple. I trust the Minister will appreciate that this automatically excludes all contributory pensioners unless there are some exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister does not intend to do that, but setting the guideline at £77 for the medical card and quoting this figure of £78 should make the Minister appreciate the fact that contributory pensioners will be excluded.  Quite a number of them have come to me to point out that is the situation.  I am asking the Minister to have a look at it.  When he becomes deprogrammed and gets back to his own self again I am sure he will again show his concern for people in that category.</P>
    <P>This section includes the rates in the various areas and the increases.  Will the Minister say if the domiciliary care allowance is being increased?  There are routine increases but the domiciliary care allowance is not a routine one and it has to be provided for specifically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: Replying to what Deputy MacGiolla had said and to the amendment he put down on Second Stage, the Minister referred to the employer having to pay 52 per cent of the PRSI contribution and intimated that that excluded the possibility of amending the system to improve the lot of beneficiaries. That kind of argument by the Minister is particularly strange from Deputy Desmond who last night proclaimed himself to be a socialist.  It is a well-known tenet of socialism that the wealth created by the worker in his employment is part and parcel of the profits which the employer chooses to use in whichever way he decides and that the State in its wisdom would take portion of that profit which has been created by the worker in his labour.  I do not think I need to lecture Deputy Desmond on socialism: I am sure he accepts that as a basic tenet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried to imply that there are no cuts in benefits involved in this Bill <Col N="596" /> because there are marginal increases in benefits.  He failed to reply to the argument made that despite the increases the net living standards of those on social welfare benefits effectively will be cut because of devaluation and inflation.  It is double talk to claim on the one hand that there are no cuts and at the same time to fail to acknowledge that the living standards of those dependent on social welfare benefits will in fact be less than they were in the previous 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is interesting also to compare the increase the Minister is quite pleased to have got from the Government in relation to future unemployment, £31 million, with the cut in real benefits between now and 1 April.  There is a very direct relationship between the £31 million and the savings the Minister hopes to make between April and the end of June, £39 million.  He has had that saving and the £31 million he said he got from the Government to cover coming unemployment.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to reflect on the trap he has fallen into.  He warned The Workers Party when saying that there is no relationship between the benefits a contributor should get and the contribution he makes out of his wages.  The title of this scheme is &ldquo;pay-related social insurance&rdquo;.  If the Minister wants to have simple straightforward tax or have a pay-related tax, which is what we have, and incorporate it into the tax system and then simply provide the type of benefit the Government feel they can afford in any given year to those who must claim social welfare, he should simply abolish the PRSI system and incorporate it into the tax system.  I am not advocating that, but if we accept Deputy Desmond's argument that there cannot be any relationship between pay-related benefits and pay-related contributions, the obvious outcome would be to do away with the PRSI system entirely.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that argument.  I do not accept that, simply because there are some welfare recipients on flat benefits, that is a good thing.  I do not accept that because pensioners are on flat rates, the unemployed should also be on flat rates&mdash;they should be on pay-related <Col N="597" /> benefits for which they have paid.  I argue that the opposite should be the case, that pensioners should be on pay-related benefits for which they have paid during their working lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have listened attentively to the Minister's response. Nowhere did he admit that the living standards of recipients of social welfare benefits would be reduced as a result of this section.  He appears to have moved somewhat from his Second Reading speech when he said that the Government have no intention of allowing the weaker sections who are dependent on social welfare to suffer a drop in their real living standards.  This morning he did not admit that their living standards would improve as a result of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil in Opposition have been very responsible in their approach to this Social Welfare Bill.  Last night the leader of our party said an increase of 15 per cent should be provided.  We all agreed. It is recognised in all civilised countries that, in times of economic recession&mdash; and we all admit there are economic problems here as there are in many other western countries&mdash;the levels of support for the most needy in the community must be maintained.  That was spelled out in Report No. 61 of the National Economic and Social Council.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the £39 million extra which it would cost to pay out these benefits from the beginning of April.  Having regard to the fact that we are talking about the weaker sections in our community, it is extraordinary that, in the same week in which we received a revised estimate for £5.6 billion, £39 million could not be found to give people benefits to which we believe they are entitled.  The Minister said that in 1973 and 1974 these benefits were delayed for three months.  The significance of that is that in those three years a Coalition Government were in power.  One has to question whether it is the philosophy of Coalition Governments that these benefits should be paid for three-quarters of the year only, and not for the whole year as has been the norm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Fitzgerald spoke about <Col N="598" /> rent restrictions his point was that those who are receiving social welfare benefits will find that their rent allowances will be reduced by the Department of Social Welfare as a result of the increases in benefits.  As I said, any self-respecting politician in this House has to oppose this section and we are opposing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to make a few brief comments to put this matter in perspective.  Taking into account the increases on the health side we have to provide £88 million this year.  That includes the £5 million for family income supplement.  The effect of the unemployment crisis on the budget has not hit the political conscience of Deputies as yet.  It is easy to talk about increases of the magnitude we had in the past.  It is easy to talk about them in the context of 1980, 1981 or 1982.  In 1980 we were talking about a figure of 92,000 people unemployed. In 1981 the figure was 126,000. In 1982 the figure was 145,000.  Now when providing for social welfare on the unemployment side, we have to provide for over 203,000 out of work full-time, or on short-time.</P>
      <P>In 1980 we had a 25 per cent increase in social welfare payments, but it was an increase of 25 per cent for 92,000 persons who were unemployed.  In 1981 we had a 25 per cent increase for 126,000 persons who were unemployed.  In 1982 we had a 25 per cent increase.  Today we are faced with making provision for 203,000 persons who are unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last evening Deputy Haughey spoke about an increase of 15 per cent and Deputy O'Hanlon repeated that figure. Let us consider the magnitude of an increase of 15 per cent.  In nine months of this year it would cost £165 million.  If we had the money at Exchequer level the increase would have been given.  It would cost £165 million for nine months or £217.5 million in a full year.  That would have meant increasing the 35 per cent tax band to 40 per cent and the 65 per cent tax band to 70 per cent and would have involved not taking £300 million from PAYE payers this year but £450 million, or finding the money elsewhere, perhaps by way of cuts.  These are the stark realities. <Col N="599" /> Because we have to make provision for £80.6 million for the 27 weeks payments this year, in next year's budget provision will have to be made for £156 million.  That pinpoints the critical aspect of this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods criticised the fact that there is no increase in children's allowances. In 1971 and 1972 and in 1976 and 1978 there was no increase in children's allowances.  In 1971, 1972 and 1978 we had a Fianna Fáil administration and in 1976 a Coalition Government were in power.  It is not true to say that every year there is an automatic increase in children's allowances.  The 1 per cent levy is being collected by the Revenue alongside the PRSI contribution.  They do not come into the social insurance fund but go straight to the Exchequer.  The same applies to the youth employment levy of 1 per cent.  It is taken into the social insurance fund and transferred subsequently to the Department of Labour. The same applies to the health contribution. We do not get it in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>By making a case strenuously for a much larger increase it is apparent that <Col N="600" /> Deputies on all sides of the House wish to see an increased degree of social expenditure.  I have been an advocate of increased social expenditure over the years, but in Government and in Opposition I have also been a firm advocate of saying where the money should come from.  One does not get much thanks for stating the unpalatable but the fact is that an increase of 12 per cent and 10 per cent in respect of social welfare from 1 April at a cost of £39 million would have meant an increase of 1.3 per cent in PRSI.  If we had an increase of 15 per cent we would have had to add 2 per cent to PRSI.  One can visualise the reaction of the Opposition in that event.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods raised the matter of health allowances.  They have increased proportionately and there is no cause for concern in this area.  These are the main points I shall make on this section.  I have no doubt that on other sections, particularly that section dealing with short-time working, will be discussed in considerable detail.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Col N="603" />
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are opposing this section.  Our amendments have been ruled out of order so we have no choice. We are opposing it because the increases are not adequate to meet the rising cost of living and because they will not be paid until the end of June and the beginning of July.</P>
      <P>This section deals with the lowest paid workers in the State who are dependent on social welfare assistance.  One group of people who must give rise for concern are the unemployed.  The are unemployed mostly through no fault of their own.  It is important that we should show our concern by giving them a realistic increase in their assistance and by paying it from the beginning of April, because the unemployed have paid into the social insurance fund and if any are working after April they will have to pay into the fund for three months before they derive any benefits.  Those on assistance are on a lower level than those on benefit and it is important that we should give them a realistic increase.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how the Government, especially the Labour Party, can accept a sum of £37.85 per week as a realistic amount to be paid to widows living on their own.  If the recipients of these benefits were asked how they spent their money, it would soon be clear that it is not possible to have the ordinary comfort that one would expect in a civilised society on this small amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>: We also oppose this section.  The Minister in his speech yesterday referred to the need to do something for the long-term unemployed.  He shed tears for them but did nothing for them in the Bill.  We have heard all the arguments, from the Taoiseach down, against this dreadful occurrence where people on pay-related benefits are getting more on short time than those who are working.  We have heard about the benefits people get when they go on pay-related. The Minister spoke again today about tax refunds and so on which they get.  Anyone who gets a tax refund receives it because he has overpaid his taxes and it is something that should not <Col N="604" /> have been taken off him in the first instance.  To think that this is being used as an argument for reducing pay-related benefits is outrageous when so many hundreds of thousands of people do not pay any tax at all.  Indeed, anyone who gets a refund of tax should also demand a refund of interest on the tax he should not have paid.  Of course that is not being counted and the Minister, in a very lengthy speech on section 1, said that we had given no indication of where this money was to be found.  He told the Government that if they postponed the payment date from 1 April to 1 July they would get £39 million.  That seems to be advocating taxing those on social welfare benefits, which has been the argument of Fine Gael all along.  That did not sound too good and I suppose they decided not to use the words &ldquo;tax them&rdquo; but to take the money off them in a different way. This specific method of postponing the date of payment for over three months after the date of the cutbacks is to get £39 million from one section of the community. It is particularly vicious that those on assistance are included in this tax net.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about the great advantage of pay-related benefits but no one has said these benefits vanish after 65 weeks.  After 65 weeks one is back on assistance, which is £59 per week for a single person, and that is below the poverty line.  The Minister said something special should be done for the long-term unemployed because they will be longer term unemployed next year and still longer the year after.  Many of these people will never again get a job. If they are unemployed at 40 years of age there is little hope of them getting another job in the next 25 years.  What is to be done about the long-term unemployed? This section says that we will also tax the long-term unemployed by deferring the benefits for a period of three months or 13 weeks.  In relation to unemployment assistance the supplementary welfare allowance will be deferred until 29 June 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke at great length on the previous section and said that nobody told him where to get the £39 million.  If he was not to take it from the long-term <Col N="605" /> unemployed, pregnant women, pensioners etc. where else was he to get it?  He admitted that £25 million is due in PRSI payments by employers.  He tried to give the impression that this was not very much because it was only 4 per cent of the total.  A percentage of the total means nothing.  The fact is that £25 million is owed to the Exchequer which these people have not paid to the Exchequer. It means that they owe funds which belong to the State, to the unemployed, to pensioners and all of these people on welfare.  That £25 million is for them, for the Exchequer.  It is no use saying this is nothing because it is only 4 per cent of the total.  It is £25 million and the Minister is looking for £39 million.</P>
    <P>That is only one aspect.  A sum of £345 million PAYE is due from the self-employed which has been proved to be due, in other words it is no longer under query.  Another £600 million is under query, but £340 million is actually due. There is no question about it.  It should be paid, it is owed and by holding it back they are stealing from the State, from the people, the unemployed, pensioners and so on, and the Minister says that we have not told him where he can get £39 million.  If he got that he would have ten times the £39 million.  Even after all the avoidance and evasion, which would probably account for £1 billion, the amount owed and known to be owed is not being collected or paid in.</P>
    <P>Certainly the last three Ministers for Finance including the current Minister have got a submission from The Workers' Party on taxation in which we outlined where we felt the money could be got. There is no question but that there are wide areas in which the money can be got.  Capital taxes in 1974 were 11.2 per cent of all taxation in this State.  In 1981 this had dropped to 4.7 per cent of taxation from capital.  The Minister could take a look at that area.  He would then have a very good idea of where the money can be got.  There is no shortage of areas to go for the money.  The effort to provide for short-term and long-term recipients of social welfare by giving only 10 per cent increase to short-term and 12 per cent to long-term can have no basis whatsoever <Col N="606" /> in statistics, in economics, in humanity and in justice.  What is it about? Did their cost of living not increase just as much as in the case of those on long-term benefit?  Why did they get only 10 per cent?  Why did both groups get less than the actual cost of living increase which by June will be 20 per cent?  Even the long-term recipients will lose 8 per cent and those on short-term will lose 10 per cent of the cost of living increase. This postponement to June is further taxation on both long-term and short-term benefits and in this case the section is a tax on the unemployed.  deserted wives, old age and blind pensioners, widows, etc.  We must object to it again.</P>

As far as Deputy Prendergast and I are concerned, if the Opposition want the vote taken again we will vote with the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>: I want to reinforce the comment made by the Government Chief Whip on this matter.  I called into the room and quite definitely none of the people in it, Deputy Prendergast, Deputy McLoughlin or the third person there, had heard the division bell.  It is a totally unacceptable situation and I ask you, Sir, to ensure through the Superintendent of the House that a check is carried out so that that will not recur and the bells will operate properly.  It is a key matter for the Government of the country and the least we can do is ensure that the electronics in this House work satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>: As Opposition Chief Whip for quite some time and having been Government Whip I am quite aware of what can happen in voting.  I do not ever recall having to stand up and protest about it.  I have always taken these things as part of the life of a Whip.  On one occasion one of my Deputies was locked up in one of the rooms and he could not get out and another person lost the key. Bells did not go off, fellows maybe had a jar too many and did not hear bells and so on.  I have suffered all these things as a Whip.  However, I can understand that it is very infuriating.  All I can say from my fair amount of experience as Government Whip and Opposition Whip is that on major Bills where the eyes of the nation are watching us, Deputies must be very vigilant themselves in these matters. It is very helpful to take that type of advice.  I have had this with my own Deputies and I am sure that Deputies on the Government side will appreciate that they must do that also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole) (for the Minister for the Public Service)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As announced in the Principal Features of the Budget as presented on 9 February 1983, the decentralisation programme has been cancelled.  The saving in 1983 will be £5 million and the cost in subsequent years would have been a further £40 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: When the Minister refers to a saving of £5 million and a further saving of £40 million, has he completely disregarded the tenders that were submitted for building the offices at the various locations?  Does he consider that there should not be decentralisation <Col N="613" /> at this time in places like Ballina, Sligo and Athlone?  Does he not think it would be a substantial injection to the building industry in places like Ballina, which he knows so well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the first part of the Deputy's question he refers to privatisation. A detailed reply on that is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  However, privatisation proposals were, in fact, sought in addition to conventional tenders for offices in five of the proposed centres and the economic cost of these proposals was far more expensive, it would seem, than if the money were borrowed by the State and the buildings constructed by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The use of public funds to stimulate the construction industry is a matter for the Minister for the Environment in the first instance, but I do know that the Government and the Tánaiste are very concerned about the state of the building industry and concerned about providing a stimulus for it, subject to the availability of funds.  Obviously care would have to be taken that any public works involved would be essential high priority projects in their own right which are likely to generate a return to the economy as a whole sufficient to justify the expenditure involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Am I right in assuming then that this Government and this Minister have no commitment to a programme of decentralisation?  I cannot accept that it is anybody's responsibility other than that of the Minister for the Public Service.  Would he outline what his Government's position on decentralisation is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy must know it is inevitable that in times of harsh economic recession certain expensive State projects must be shelved or curtailed and it is a matter for the Government of the day, given the extreme scarcity of funds, to determine priorities within its public expenditure programme.  In relation to the provision of centres in different provincial areas, that would be a matter for <Col N="614" /> the Government of the day and the basic question will still be whether the relocation of 3,000 civil servants merits public expenditure on the scale required.  As the Minister for the Public Service would say, it would of course be a task for him to oversee and co-ordinate such a programme. The Deputy must realise that in current times of severe recession this kind of expenditure cannot be undertaken.</P>

      <P>: Arising out of the Minister's reply and comments made by the Taoiseach in Cork last week at a press conference, would the Minister tell us exactly what is the situation with regard to An Foras Forbartha?

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware of how advanced the decentralisation plans for Athlone were, that they had already gone out to tender?  The Minister, like myself, comes from a rural constituency. Is he not aware of the enormous social implications involved in decentralisation?  It is not just a matter of finance for the building.  Many young people wish to return to their home town and to contribute to the economic and social environment of their town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: Much of the money spent by the previous Government has been spent on good building land and could not be said to be a write-off.  It is a question of the availability of the kind of funds that are necessary to complete this project of decentralisation.  We are talking here of a sum in the region of £40 million. I am aware of the demands of the young people who are seeking transfers from Dublin city to the provinical areas but up to now no civil servant has been selected <Col N="615" /> for transfer on the basis of the plan laid down.  It has always been made clear that only volunteers would be sought when the buildings were approaching completion. No commitments have been entered into in relation to young people's transfers.</P>

The Minister spoke about it being shelved.  Is it shelved or cancelled? If it is cancelled will he leave the land there so that Fianna Fáil can do with it what should be done with it when they come back to power very shortly?</P>

      <P>: In relation to the cost, it now transpires that the cost of the offices that were supposed to be built in these areas is no less than what it is at the moment in Dublin.  I would have expected it would have been less but the fact is that for some reason it is not less.</P>

      <P>: Is the Minister aware that many hundreds working in the public service in Dublin have been making representations over the years to every Deputy to be considered for transfer as soon as this decentralisation programme first came up?  That is No. 1.  I do not <Col N="616" /> accept, and the Minister must be aware of this, that £40 million will be saved. The Minister for Finance is beside him. That figure is pure nonsense.  That is a smokescreen.  The Minister must surely be aware of the hundreds of people who are travelling to and from their homes each week who wish to be employed in their own areas.  Is the Minister further aware &mdash; he is from a town where one of the offices would employ 200 people &mdash; of how important this would be to the economy in the area?  Finally, is the Minister aware that the cost of these offices &mdash; and I challenge anybody to debate this &mdash; is negligible in comparison to the cost of expensive office accommodation required in Dublin?</P>

Seeing that one of these facilities would be provided in my own town I should like to see the project going ahead, but we simply have not got the finances to do it.

      <P>: The Deputy may say it is nonsense but the fact is it will be more when one takes the inflationary aspect into consideration.  In relation to the availability of office space in this city, for the first time in our history we are coming to grips with the numbers in the public service and there is now for the first time a reduction in numbers.  We have adequate office space, whether owned or on long lease, and the fact is that as of now there is no crying need for the provision of office space elsewhere.  The Government would now find it difficult to let the office space we own or hold on a long <Col N="617" /> lease.  The demand is not there.  It is not a question of replacing office space in provincial towns.  It is not a question of adding further office space to office space already available to us.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he will make a statement on the exchange of middle-management staffs in the civil service with grades in the same level in the private sector, as noted in the November issue of the journal of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: In 1979 a scheme was agreed with the civil service staff associations governing the temporary transfer of middle-management staff in the civil service to other parts of the public sector and occasionally the private sector and of comparable staff in other organisations to the civil service.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the scheme was to provide the civil servants and other employees concerned with an opportunity of broadening their skills and acquiring new experiences, to provide the civil service and other employing organisations with the special skills and expertise which officers on loan could bring and to promote better communication, co-operation and understanding across the public sector and between the public and private sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far the numbers of transfers which have taken place under the scheme are 22 between the civil service and the rest of the public sector and four between the civil service and the private sector.  I am particularly disappointed at the small number of transfers with the private sector although I recognise the difficulties that can arise.  There is, of course, also a fair degree of mobility of staff under <Col N="634" /> interdepartmental promotion competitions involving the transfer of many hundred officers and loans outside the scheme, currently involving some 180 officers, for example, to the EEC.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, for whatever reason, Departments are not making enough use of the scheme.  I intend to take steps to rectify this.  I would hope that private sector interests would be ready to cooperate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: On section 2 I referred to the impact on the percentage increases that were allowed and how they had been eroded.  The arguments I made on that section apply equally to section 3, I intend to be brief.  The Minister, judging from the reply he gave, does not seem to have grasped the argument I advanced.  I would like to quickly repeat what I said.  In regard to the benefits before us we are dealing with the old, the widows, the sick, the long-term ill and the long-term unemployed.  The budget will probably contribute about 5 per cent to inflation and will reduce the figure of 12 per cent to 7 per cent.  The devaluation of the pound will reduce it by 2 per cent to 5 per cent.  The 3 per cent, because of the pushing back of the date to July will bring that figure down to 2 per cent.  I did not touch the general cost of living increase for the year.  That final 2 per cent will be eroded for many people.</P>
      <P>I want to make clear what I said this morning because the Minister obviously did not grasp it and perhaps because of our dispute I did not advance the argument as clearly as I might have done.  I want to refer to the old age pensioners, widows, long-term disabled people on invalidity pensions and the long-term unemployed who live in dwellings covered by the Rent Restrictions Act and who live in conditions which have deteriorated very much because of the Supreme Court decision of 1981.  Those people are being further deprived by a Labour Minister.  Imagine Deputy Barry Desmond, Minister for Social Welfare, seeing his way to penalise those tenants in this city.  There must be many of them in Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown.  I know there are many in Cork and there are some in Galway and in Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Frank Prendergast would be very interested in those tenants in Limerick city.  In Cork their cases are going through the courts at the rate of a couple a dozen a week and their increases are tenfold, twelvefold and even twentyfold what they were.  The subsidisation was reduced in the budget and they were cut by £5½ million.  The single person in <Col N="678" /> receipt of a retirement pension or old age pension under £40 gets full remission.  If the person receives over £40 and less than £45 that person gets 50p in the pound remission.  The single person in receipt of £40.25 will now get £45.10.  Now, because that person is in the £45 bracket, it means that the subsidy, which is reckoned at 50p in the pound on £5, will be £2.50.  That person is not getting an increase of £4.85 but an increase of £2.85.  Are the Deputies in the Labour Party prepared to support this section?  Shame on them if they are prepared to support it.  For goodness sake, let them move to the right, let them be the conservative party and support the staunch solid Fine Gael conservative party as they have been doing.  We should realise what is provided in this section in relation to the people on rent restrictions.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the married people.  The husband and wife on an old age pension or retirment pension are getting at the moment £65.95.  They will receive an increase of £7.95, which brings them to £73.90.  If those people are receiving under £70 they get full remission, but as the people I am referring to are getting £3.90 above that figure it means that they are losing £2 of their subsidy.  The Minister said in his reply that the legislation was brought in by Fianna Fáil.  It might have been brought in by Fianna Fáil.  But if there is a change in circumstances relating to the subsidy, particularly in relation to the £40 going to £45, but in practice only going to £42, or in the case of the married people going from £65.90 to £73.90 but in effect only going to £72, then the Minister should really hang his head in shame.  He should explain to the House what he is doing to counteract that cutback for the thousands of people who live in flats.</P>

      <P>: I am rather surprised at the Opposition's approach to this section.  They say they are opposing the section.  What they are doing is opposing the payment of 10 per cent and 12 per cent to social welfare recipients.  They are saying they should not get them.  They are a very confused Opposition and do not know where they <Col N="679" /> are going.  As far as we are concerned we have a duty to protect the less well off in society and that is what we intend to do.</P>
      <P>When the Opposition were in Government we saw how reckless they were. Their answer to any problems which arose was to borrow.  The result was massive debts.  We hear a lot of talk about how much the PAYE worker has to pay, about how much is extracted from him and how he is bled.  Every penny he pays goes to meet the interest on the debts which were incurred by the previous Government.  That is where our problem lies.  When the Opposition were in Government they said they would do this and that and went on their merry way spending all the time but last October they got the message that this could not continue and they initiated a series of cuts.  A large number of medical cards were withdrawn and there were other proposals in their document <i>The Way Forward</i>.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>: As a result of the debts which had accumulated we found ourselves in a severe economic mess.  People who talk about borrowing should ask themselves if there is a limit to what can be borrowed.  There is a limit and our creditworthiness could be in doubt.  We could have been told what to do by international bankers if we did not deliver the goods.  Who would have suffered then? It would have been the less well off whom we are trying to protect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It ill-befits the Opposition to weep crocodile tears when they have landed us in this mess.  Since 1977 we have been <Col N="680" /> paying back massive sums on interest and so depriving the economy of money we could be investing in infrastructure and on providing jobs.  It annoys me to hear the Opposition bleating about how their hearts are bleeding for the less well off when it is as a result of their actions that we are in the present mess.</P>
    <P>There has been a 104 per cent increase in unemployment in three years.  That is their legacy.  That is their record.  We are determined to safeguard the interests of the less well off.  We would like to be generous and give more but it is simply not there.  The alternative is to increase taxation but we cannot do this.  The other alternative is to borrow but for how long could we borrow?  We would soon find ourselves halfway through the fiscal year and unable to get more money.  We all know who would suffer then.  Let us cut out the codology and recklessness and get down to the real job of tackling the economy and putting it right.  We must develop a job programme and our infrastructure and get the figure of 188,000 people unemployed down to some reasonable proportion.</P>
    <P>What the Oppostition are advocating is no solution.  Obviously they are playing pure politics.  On the first day of the new Dáil they indicated they would be responsible. If this is their idea of being responsible I would hate to see them being irresponsible.  Their only proposal now is to oppose this section.  If this section is defeated it will mean people will not be in receipt of social welfare benefits.  That is what they are advocating.  That may be their job but it is our job to ensure that people get their increases.  We have given long-term beneficiaries 2 per cent extra.</P>
    <P>Let us stop the codding and get our house in order.  Let us create a just society and provide employment.  In that way we could be generous to those who are disabled, unemployed or elderly in a positive and sincere way.  We made far-reaching and radical changes in the social welfare system when we were in Government from 1973 to 1977.  Given the overall financial structure one can only do so much.  Can the Opposition tell me of one section which is not feeling the pinch <Col N="681" /> whether it is the building industry, education or whatever?</P>
    <P>We are serious in tackling the problem over a period of years and a group has been formed to ensure that this will happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>: That was a most extraordinary contribution from the Minister of State.  He has tried to justify why the increases to recipients of social welfare should not keep abreast of the cost of living.  It is unfortunate he was not here this morning when we tried to have our amendments accepted and explained to the House that we were not opposing the increases themselves, although we are opposed to their meagreness, but we do not have a choice in the matter as our amendments were not accepted.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State talked about protecting the interests of the underprivileged. Does he believe that these increases will prevent the serious erosion of the purchasing power of those dependent on social welfare assistance?  We are talking about people on long-term unemployment assistance, non-contributory pensioners, widows and those at the lowest end of the income scale.  The Minister of State has said these are the people who have to suffer because the Government are not able to get their finances in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also said that borrowing started in 1977.  The Taoiseach last week on television tried to portray the same image when he put a chart on the screen showing that 1977 was the year in which borrowing started.  Borrowing started on a large scale here in 1973 when Deputy Richie Ryan was Minister for Finance. That is when our problems started.  The Minister of State said that if this measure was defeated the social welfare recipients would not get an increase.  I believe this measure should be defeated and if Members of the Minister's party help to defeat it, it will mean that the Government will have to bring in another proposal to ensure that these people will be able to meet their commitments during the coming year.  We have no choice but to oppose this section for the same reasons that we opposed section 2.  The main <Col N="682" /> reason we oppose this section is that the increases are insufficient to enable these people to meet their commitments and also that they are only receiving the increases for three quarters of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to deal with a number of points raised.  A number of Deputies referred to the non-payment of social insurance contributions.  Deputy Mac Giolla thought that if we had the £25 million which is owed in arrears in PRSI contributions from employers we could immediately pay the increases from April.  If one had £25 million one could pay the increases from the beginning of May.  If it was paid from April it would cost about £39 million.</P>
      <P>We should keep that figure of £25 million in perspective.  I am not attempting to minimise the seriousness and the unlawfulness of the non-transfer of PRSI contributions by any employer, no matter what the circumstances might be, but I should refer to that £25 million in some detail.  I originally mentioned it in the introduction of this Bill at the beginning of Second Stage.  The £25 million is outstanding in respect of the 1981-1982 contribution year, but one must remember that there was a total liability of £600 million in that year by employers.  The exact figure is £599.5 million PRSI liability. I indicated that 4 per cent of that was outstanding, a sum of £25 million, and that is the correct perspective.  We must remember that that 4 per cent in cash terms involves about 10,000 out of 86,000 employers.  That is a small sum of money spread over a large number of employers. One might ask why are we not going after these payments.  Follow-up action is being taken to recover that outstanding amount but £7.5 million out of that £25 million is under various forms of statutory and management control by the Revenue Commissioners.  For example, about £2.5 million is being queried by employers as to the precise amount they owe in respect of PRSI.  It is not unusual, when one is dealing with payrolls and a total liability of £599.5 million, that there would be a fraction under dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another £2.2 million is being paid by <Col N="683" /> instalments.  It is not a major amount but it shows the kind of control which exists. Another £1.7 million out of £599.6 million is under liquidation proceedings, and about £1 million out of the £7.5 million which the Revenue Commissioners were involved in is unidentifiable in precise forms of liability.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla said that this is worker's money.  It is, without question. Employers themselves have a liability twice that of employees.  They must pay over 11.5 per cent of their pay and that calculation frequently gives rise to a degree of dispute.  I have accounted for £7.5 million out of £25 million.  The remaining £17.5 million is under collection in the normal way and it can be assumed without question that the bulk of it will be collected.  I am talking about 1981-82 and this is the beginning of 1983. If I might give comparisons, you may ask what happened last year.  For comparison purposes for previous year, the position in regard to 1980-81 is that it is down to £13.7 million outstanding of which £6 million is under various forms of control and in respect of 1979-80 the amount is right down to £6 million.</P>
    <P>Anybody can say glibly £6 million, £13 million and £25 million and there are your social welfare increases.  It is not as simple as that. Whether it is collection of social welfare insurance, PAYE, or contributions from trade union members, the same problems arise in terms of returns from branches, returns from any section of the community, contributions.  I give all that by way of explanation because there is no let-up whatever on the Department of Social Welfare's part or on the part of the Revenue Commissioners in their determination to bring in all outstanding moneys.  In that regard the Department of Finance would not permit any sluggishness in the collection process.  Perhaps I am tempting fortune here in trying to quote from memory, but I remember that Deputy Woods estimated that he would bring in in 1981 or 1982 about £565 million in PRSI.  At the year end he had brought in £563 million. He was within £2 million of the anticipated <Col N="684" /> yield and that at a time of recession where employment is oscillating and proper forecasts of yields from taxation are very difficult.  In that situation the Department of Social Welfare are to be commended on the precision with which they can estimate yields.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon has made a point which is not contested in any way by me or by my colleague, Minister of State O'Brien.  It is true that the levels of increase just keep pace with inflation and I do not deny that, but we pose to this House the very serious problem that if one wants a 15 per cent increase from 1 April for 200,000 people out of work and for the other 800,000 people who are dependent on social welfare, the cost is simply £165 million in nine months and in a full year £217.5 million.  That is the equivalent of virtually all of the income tax collected this year.  If the current social welfare increase of 10 to 12 per cent were to be paid from 1 April the cost would be £39.6 million.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the question arises, where is the money to come from?  It is not sufficient at this stage, when the Government have made provision to bring in £70 million in capital taxation.  I believe that we should bring in very much more but we are bringing in £70 million this year in capital taxation which was permissible only in the context of coming into office in mid-December, getting a budget together by the end of January with a bare few weeks to do so and bringing in money from a bank levy of £25 million, from development levies of £10 million, from residential properties of £10 million, £14 million from capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax and another £1.5 million from derelict sites and so on, giving a total of £70 million.  It is not possible in six or eight weeks to devise a new capital taxation structure, because generally speaking no work has been done in that direction.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have very many excellent, progressive, egalitarian ideas and many of us have no more than ideas.  We pretend that we have more than we have in terms of our capacity to contribute. Most of us are not aware because we have not spent the time, we have not the <Col N="685" /> back-up research to that extent either in or out of government.  As a result we have the greatest of difficulty in devising measures of revenue on an equitable basis.  Then we are back to a situation where in a budget to provide for social welfare increases we increased the income tax level to the 65 per cent rate which brings in only £8 million or £9 million which is very little.  We have increased the level of liability for PRSI contributions from £9,500 to £13,000. This brings in only an extra £16 million, which is peanuts in terms of social welfare. That £16 million is only a miserable 1 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>The Opposition and the Government, irrespective of political persuasion and alleged idelogies&mdash;very often it is difficult to segment out precisely the ideology which is talked about from time to time&mdash;represent a country which is an ideology of sectional interests rather than political ideologies in terms of social and taxation perceptions.  It is very difficult in that context to perceive in a Social Welfare Bill, wherein we are spending £80.6 million on a 10 to 12 per cent increase and providing £31 million more for the cost of additional unemployment, how better one could produce money to pay for the increases.</P>
    <P>Without any difficulty we could have increased the rates of PRSI.  An extra 1.5 per cent on the existing rates would have brought in £45 million to £46 million. That would provide the increase from 1 April but, as I have said, the then reciprocal execration on the head of the Government for increasing PRSI would follow.  Everybody at work would then rebound on the Government and say, &ldquo;There we go again, more increases&rdquo;.  As it was, we had to put a 1 per cent increase on wage levels generally trying to ensure some kind of balance of the budget.  We worked out with a budget deficit of £890 million.  God forbid what would have happened to social welfare if we had a budget deficit of £750 million as <i>The Way Forward</i> clearly proposed and tabulated. The deflationary impact of VAT would have meant no increase at all in social welfare in 1983.  It was cleverly cloaked. <Col N="686" /><i>The Way Forward</i> on page 18 under &ldquo;Public Finances&rdquo; said that the current budget deficit as a percentage of GNP in 1983 would be 5.5 per cent.  That figure represents a budget deficit of £750 million. They did not put down the figure. In 1982 the outturn was 7.5 per cent, £900 million.  It is only when one reads through documents, particularly those prepared and carefully cloaked as was done in the document dealing with pay-related benefits for short-time workers, that it dawns on one what the true impact will be.</P>
    <P>My colleagues and I were faced with an increase in the social welfare provision this year, but it is by no means a real increase.  I am acutely aware of the current rate of unemployment assistance paid to a married man with a wife and two children.  At the end of June he will get £65.15, an appalingly low income to expect any family to live on.  It is only 42 per cent of current earnings.  In the transportable goods industry male adults earn approximately £155 per week.  I have never had to live on £65 a week and would be horrified at the prospect of having to do so, although I had to live on a Deputy's salary since 1969 and at times that was precarious enough.  The plight of these men who get £65 a week is desperate, but we as a community must deal with that poverty situation and with that of workers on exceptionally low incomes.  It is expected that there will be intensive discussions within the Government on these matters within the next eight or nine months.</P>
    <P>The other day I was talking to a young girl of 19 or 20 years who works in a cake shop for £30 a week.  She is being exploited.  I know of married men with two or three children who are getting £100, less tax, PRSI and so on.  Because of their deductions they are almost down to the medical card income level.  That is why we need our family income supplement scheme.  This will help those who are working but with low incomes.  We must ensure that this scheme is not used by employers to get cheap labour.  This scheme has to be very carefully worked out so that it will not do the reverse of what was intended.  We must carry out a thorough examination of income and taxation <Col N="687" /> levels as well as transfer payments. We have never carried out such an examination.</P>
    <P>The more I examine the thousands of pounds we spend on social welfare and the £90 million we spend on the general medical services, the more critical I am of successive Governments for their failure down the years to come to grips with social deprivation and poverty and to use properly our existing resources.  I am convinced that if we never raised another penny from taxation or PRSI, out of the money we are already spending on social welfare, health and education, we could have a society which would be more just and equitable because people in real need would be getting the money rather than the current patchwork quilt of transfer payments from one section of the community to another.  I make that point because it relates to the section dealing with unemployment assistance.  All the money for unemployment assistance comes from the taxpayers' pockets; not a penny is collected by way of PRSI.</P>

      <P>: On a point of order, I admire the Minister both in Opposition and in Government for his long, detailed and very interesting speeches but my understanding as Opposition Whip when we agreed to a very tight time scale on a very important Bill last week was that there would be fair play by both the Government and the Opposition.</P>
      <P>There are 26 sections in this Bill.  I gave the Government 30 minutes this morning by agreeing that this debate would be completed by 6.30 p.m.  We are on section 3, with two-and-a-half hours left and if there are a few votes we will lose more time.  The Minister has unnecessarily drawn out his speeches.  Effectively, he is preventing us from voting and, more important, discussing later sections.  This is grossly unfair and breaks the spirit of the agreement between the Whips.  We gave him the Second Stage yesterday and are giving the Committee and remaining Stages today.  I appreciate the Government might have voting problems, but it is a very unfair way to do business.</P>

      <P>: May I hasten to <Col N="688" /> immediately apologise to the Opposition Chief Whip.  I had no intention of prolonging the discussion on any section. The Opposition spent all this morning on section 2 and at 3.30 p.m. it appeared they intended spending the rest of the afternoon on the social assistance section. I have no intention of delaying the House and there is no difficulty in keeping my comments short.  There have been at least eight or nine Opposition speakers on these sections and I can assure the Deputy it is not my intention to exceed the normal process of debate.  I regret if it appeared that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: We have tried to be as brief as possible.  If one looks at the time taken one will find our contributions have been very much to the point.  The Minister of State has decried <i>The Way Forward</i> and said it was rubbish.  This is the section to which our document applies. It is clearly spelled out in <i>The Way Forward</i> where the jobs would be created.  It is because this Government are not pursuing a way forward as planned under the Fianna Fáil Administration that more people will be getting unemployment assistance and other social welfare benefits, and more people will be on the poverty line.  <i>The Way Forward</i> is very relevant to this section.  It is far from rubbish and it is because of the Government's policies that more people are coming into that section and will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the overall Government policy is very relevant here.  The Minister himself at the end of his speech said he regards the levels as extremely low and practically horrific for people who are in that situation.  Yet he is giving the equivalent of about 7½ per cent this year and he is leaving those people in fairly severe poverty.  This Bill will worsen very significantly the position of people on unemployment assistance.  The Minister earlier said that they just cannot produce the money.  They cannot produce it for this purpose but it can be produced for a lot of other purposes.  The September and December double week is gone as well.  Under EEC regulations in 1984 the Minister is committed to providing within <Col N="689" /> this unemployment assistance cover for all women.  Last year we extended it to include separated married women.  Married women will then be able to apply. The Minister will have to find about £25 million for that purpose.  He will have to find that money but for this purpose he says he just cannot find the money.</P>
    <P>This morning we had a fairly balanced debate in this House.  With regret I must say that the news at 1.30 on RTE did not represent what went on here this morning. It was quite unfair to have the Minister completely free to talk about Deputy Bell.  At least here in the House Deputy Bell has an opportunity to make his points and to have them noted by those in the Press Gallery.  The Minister has a great habit of quoting statistics. When I went to college quite a few years ago one of the things our eminent professors told us was to be wary of lies, damn lies and statistics.  We have as a country been treated to large dollops of these lies, damn lies and statistics in the statements which the Minister has made and in the statements which are made generally.  It is very easy to slip out onesided statistics and this is what the Minister is doing at present.</P>
    <P>We oppose this section because we believe it will result in considerable poverty for people who receive social assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would like to remind the Minister that he and the other Labour Party Deputies were elected on the basis of special help to be directed to those groups who fare worst under the present piecemeal system of social welfare and that includes long-term unemployment, the elderly, disabled persons living alone, one-parent families and so on.  That is the policy on which they are now reneging.</P>

    <Col N="690" />
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy Woods said this Government were not prepared to find the money to fund an adequate scheme of social assistance.  He overlooks the fact that the reason the country is in its present difficulty is because of the operations of his own party particularly dating from 1977 when they set about a massive borrowing of money abroad.  Was it to fund an adequate system of social assistance? No, it was to abolish car tax, to abolish rates for people living in £100,000 and £200,000 houses.  They used the money to abolish wealth tax.  I always remember that when the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, announced the abolition of wealth tax there were resounding cheers from the Fianna Fáil backbenches. It appals me that they have the gall to come in here and put down these amendments.</P>
      <P>We must face the situation as we find it and there is no doubt that people on social assistance suffer dreadfully.  They are caught in this trap and I am not satisfied that they keep up with the inflationary situation.  I would ask the Minister to look at the idea that henceforth the amounts of social welfare and social assistance in particular should be increased not yearly but quarterly when the consumer price index is produced. Increases ought to apply automatically to all social welfare payments in accordance with the cost of living index.  I should like to ask the Minister on what date these figures were last increased.</P>

      <P>: We are opposing this section on the grounds, first, that the Government have decided to impose an extra 1 per cent levy on workers.  We contend that the ceiling for contributions should not be increased to £13,000 this year as a result of that.  Secondly, there is the severe reduction in pay-related benefit and the fact that benefit for workers this year will not come into effect until the end of June or the beginning of July whereas the extra payments will be taken from them at the beginning of April.</P>

      <P>: This section increases from £9,500 to £13,000 the ceiling for pay-related social insurance contributions from the start of the new contribution year, that is, 6 April 1983.  I stress that the rates of PRSI contributions are not being increased.  I should like to point out that the new temporary levy of 1 per cent, as announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget, will be collected as an additional part of PRSI but in the same way as the existing youth employment levy.  For the information of Members I should like to state that the increased revenue from the raising of the PRSI ceiling is expected to be £16 million in 1983.  I must stress that those provisions were built into the Estimates by the last administration.</P>

I should like to point out that 240,000 contributors whose earnings are more than £9,500 will <Col N="695" /> of course be obliged to pay additional amounts of PRSI and the maximum additional amount of PRSI which a contributor will have to pay is £208 in one year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are opposed to this section.  This is the first occasion an alteration where the contribution limits do not equate eligibility limits has been made.  We oppose this on the same basis that we oppose the whole question of PRSI and what it is.  If people are obliged to pay a contribution for which they do not get any benefit that is taxation and why not call it PAYE or some other type of tax but do not call it PRSI.  The Minister has made lengthy contributions today and they have led us to the situation where we do not have time to debate the various sections.  I do not know whether that was done deliberately.  In one of his contributions the Minister said that PRSI was not social insurance and the fact that one paid social insurance did not mean one was entitled to any benefits.  If that is so it is not social insurance but a tax. PRSI has become another form of taxation and instead of raising PAYE further beyond the limit that would lead to revolt which it has reached, the Government simply increase the PRSI contribution. We believe in the concept of pay-related social insurance and we are not objecting to raising the limit to £13,000 but the people who pay the contribution should also be eligible for benefits.  We raised this issue before and we are opposed to this concept wherever it appears and in this section also.</P>

      <P>: The Deputy is being mischievous on this.  I never said, nor would I ever say, that because people pay PRSI they are not entitled to any benefits. I did not say that but I made it clear that because people pay social insurance on a pay-related basis did not automatically entitle them to pay-related benefit. That is a different statement from the one Deputy Mac Giolla is attributing to me.  Benefits are general and pay-related is in fact a supplement on top of the benefit.  The Deputy should not mis-quote <Col N="696" /> me in that regard.  Under the Bill 80,000 people will be receiving benefits to which will be added the pay-related supplement. We must be careful here because there is a tendency on the part of Members to misconstrue what is in the Bill for what may be described as purely party political propaganda purposes.  I must hotly contest that type of misinterpretation.</P>
      <P>I have not said that because workers pay social insurance on a pay-related basis they are not entitled to benefit.  I have said that pay-related social insurance contributions do not contain an automatic entitlement without conditions to pay-related benefit.  The same applies to any of the other social insurance benefits, such as drawing unemployment assistance or benefits.  There are basic qualifications in respect of them all.</P>

      <P>: There is one glaring anomaly in PRSI as far as a widower is concerned. A housekeeper allowance of £165 is available only in certain circumstances and if a non-relative is involved in caring for the family the person has to be considered an employee.  Therefore, a widower will have to pay the PRSI for a non-relative he takes in to look after his family.  That person is really being taxed under PRSI.  His tax concession would be £110.  The Minister should clarify that position.</P>

      <P>: In addition to the increase from £9,500 to £13,000 a worker must pay 1 per cent extra which will be collected in conjunction with PRSI.  The Minister should tell the House if that is the case.  It will bring the total contribution from 7.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent. The increasing of the ceiling to £13,000 will mean an extra £3,500 being brought in under PRSI per person and that will mean about £262 extra per annum, or almost £5 per week.  The Minister is not simply proposing an increase in the ceiling but the imposition of a levy of 1 per cent also.  I am aware that that is not covered in the Bill but it will be collected with PRSI and will mean a substantial increase in those contributions.  It is for that reason that we had gone for a <Col N="697" /> straightforward increase in the ceiling to £11,000.</P>

      <P>: The decision was taken on 22 October 1982 in Cabinet that the PRSI ceiling would be raised from £9,500 to £13,000 and that the pay-related benefit ceiling would be increased in line with wage movements.  The proposed increase at that time was to £11,000 in respect of PRSI and £13,000 in respect of contributions.  These were the decisions of the previous Government and I will be flabbergasted if they decide to vote against them here.</P>

      <P>: This is the kernel of the matter and I am glad it has been brought out so clearly.  I listened to the Minister on the radio at 1.30 p.m. misleading people about what will happen.  He should not try to confuse people in this House; he may do it outside but not here.  At the end of April 8.5 per cent will be deducted from wages up to £13,000.  There will be an extra 1 per cent which the Minister calls a separate levy but this was not included in any Fianna Fáil Estimate proposals. There was a proposal to increase the ceiling and this was made public but there was no proposal to increase the rate.  The Minister tries to tell us that he is not increasing the rate and he does not want us to consider that aspect because he is doing it behind his back.  He will talk on RTE and elsewhere about how Fianna Fáil were doing the same things. This is not so.  Fianna Fáil were not proposing to charge the extra 1 per cent in the devious manner employed by the Minister.  We had proposed the increase to £13,000 but there was no proposal to increase the rate and no separate levy of 1 per cent.  The worker will now be faced with an increase to 8.5 per cent in addition to the increase in the ceiling to £13,000.  Fianna Fáil have said that in view of the additional 1 per cent levy it is appropriate that the ceiling should be increased only to £11,000.  That is our argument.</P>

Irrespective of who the employer is, where there is a contract of employment of a whole-time nature or where the employer of a person is the principal employer, then the question arises of liability for the contribution.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 26, after &ldquo;5&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and in such a case the amount payable by way of such benefit for any day of unemployment in that week shall, notwithstanding subsection (6), be one-fifth of the appropriate weekly rate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> This amendment is self-explanatory.  As Deputies are aware, the section provides that the total number of days worked for which unemployment benefit is payable shall not exceed five.  The amendment allows for the calculation of unemployment benefit on the basis of a five-day week.  The benefit for full-time unemployment and disability benefit for short-time workers will continue to be calculated on the basis of a six-day week.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to remove an unintended inequity relating to the calculation of flat rate benefit for short-time workers.  At present short-time workers on a three-day working week who normally work five days a week may receive 60 per cent of their basic pay and, in addition, three days flat rate unemployment benefit plus pay-related benefit.  This represents half of the appropriate weekly rate of those benefits under section 29(b) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  These benefits are payable on the basis of a six-day week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling first raised this matter in the House and at a meeting of my party Deputies Pattison and Ryan made the point that, while accepting the situation as outlined, effectively short-time workers were being restricted to a five-day week and, therefore, their daily rate of flat rate benefit should be calculated in fifths rather than sixths.  The Government accepted that the anomaly should be rectified and that the general provision in the 1981 Act for the calculation of flat rate unemployment benefit on the basis of sixths should be set aside in the case of short-time workers.  This amendment means that the daily rate of benefit for short-time workers will be calculated at one-fifth of the weekly rate of benefit rather than one-sixth.  The cost will be about £1½ million a year so that Deputies can appreciate that what might be regarded as a small change is relatively expensive.</P>

      <P>: We are opposing this section.  In <i>The Way Forward</i> we had a similar proposal to that in this section but for the same reason that we opposed section 4 we are opposing this section. Workers are now being asked to pay 1 per cent on all their income.  The fact that it will appear in the Finance Bill is of academic interest to the person who has <Col N="703" /> to pay it and who will find that at the end of April he is 1 per cent less well-off.  He will not recognise the subtle distinction that it appears in the Finance Bill rather than in this Bill.  The rapidly escalating increases in the cost of living as a result of measures introduced by the Government &mdash; increased VAT, 36p increase on a gallon of petrol and deflation of the IR£ &mdash; all impose on the worker.  A married man with two children earning £145 per week has a net income of £114.  Under this proposal his salary will be just under £100.  If pay-related benefit was restored to him it would merely bring his income up to £105.  He would still be short on his take-home pay.  All reasonable people agree that nobody should have more money when unemployed than when working.  We oppose this section.</P>

The establishment by a former Minister for Social Welfare, who was a Member of the Labour Party, of this pay-related system was an advance and it is unfortunate that a Minister of the same party is now overseeing the dismantling of it.  Employees should be able to insure themselves for all eventualities, even for short-term unemployment.  For that reason we oppose section 7 because it is an unjust imposition on employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have difficulty in understanding why there should be opposition to this section.  I will give a classic example in this regard.  If a married man with two children is earning £150 per week, which is £5 less than the current average earning in the manufacturing industry, he would have a net take home pay of £117.10 after tax and other deductions. If he was on a three-day week he would have £80 net earnings.  He would have a take home pay of £133.47 for a three-day week as against £117 for a five-day week.  That would mean he would have 114 per cent of his earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the slightly higher liability on tax from 5 April, his take home pay would be £115.43.  He would have £79.01 of net earnings, £27.22 unemployment <Col N="704" /> benefit and no pay-related benefit, which would make up £106, thus giving him 92 per cent replacement of earnings on a three-day week.  As from July that will improve somewhat by going up to 94 per cent as follows.  He would still have £115.43 on net full time earnings out of £150 and he would have £79.01 on net earnings.  He would have increased unemployment benefit from £27.22 to £29.94 and he would therefore have a total of £108.95, thus giving him 94 per cent of earnings.</P>
    <P>I served for eight years as a member of the Council of Europe Health and Social Affairs Committee and I have been to 18 of the 23 states of the Council of Europe. I examined their social security systems and not one of them would give a replacement of even 65 per cent or 70 per cent for a three-day week.  We are giving 94 per cent, and we cannot have a situation where employers are telling me that they had an industrial dispute on their hands because they will have to pay their workers another £14 to £20 per week to get them back on a five-day week.  The position was examined very closely by an inter-departmental committee and they came up with the reasoning that a worker on short time should receive somewhat higher benefits than a worker in full-time unemployment.  In full-time employment the ceiling is 85 per cent and on short time the ceiling is 94 per cent.  We have taken on the precise proposals which were adopted in respect of the Estimates by the outgoing administration.  I do not want to prolong this discussion because of shortage of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree there was a certain amount of abuse regarding the three-day week, not just by workers but by employers. The Minister received a letter from the Cork Workers' Council recently regarding a three-day week by workers in Hickeys of Cork.  Since the change in social welfare the workers have decided to go on full time unemployment because otherwise they would be losing money.  I do not know if this information was brought to the Minister's notice but I assume that this industry will now close because the workers are not prepared to <Col N="705" /> work the three-day week because it does not pay them to do so.  If the Minister has any information on that, I would like him to clarify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: I strongly make the point that it is not the purpose of social welfare payments to deal with internal industrial relations problems and the organisation of employment within the workplace.  The function of social welfare is to provide the maximum possible replacement of earnings arising out of unemployment.  I have seen some employers put up notices saying that employees would be better off on a three-day week rather than working for five days.  Of course, the employer makes a saving on energy costs, overheads and so on.  The Department of Social Welfare are not operating an employment subsidy scheme or a manufacturing industry subsidy scheme.  We pay social welfare to workers in need who are out of work or on short time.  I know there is a tendency, as Deputy Wyse has indicated, for some employers to tell their workers they are better off working one week on and one week off or two weeks off and one week on.  The system is not designed to cope with the exigencies of recession and of major difficulties in particular employments. It is very difficult to lay down precisely under law the position regarding every firm.  For example, Deputy Pattison brought to my attention, quite understandably, that in his constituency some short-time workers have been on a two-day week since November 1980. That is a very long period on a two-day week.  The definition is that a person is on systematic short time &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo;.  One may ask logically what is meant by the words &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo;. Deputy Pattison's constituents have been on short time since November 1980. When does the time being cease to be the time being?  That is in a regulation and regulations were never designed to cater for all contingencies in employment. Within the limited scope of this change in the Social Welfare Bill the money available on pay-related benefit, which this year is £61 million, £37 million is going on unemployment benefit supplement. <Col N="706" /> My concern is that money should be allocated as fairly as possible to those who are on short-time or more appropriately whole-time unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister agree that he could be defeating the purpose of this section of the Bill?  I will give a genuine case.  I know there are abuses, but the innocent will suffer for such abuses. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the case and we have been asked to bring it to his notice in this discussion by the Cork Worker's Council.  Hickeys of Cork are on three-day working and the workers are now rejecting this and going on full-time unemployment.  Of course this consequently will close the firm.  Is the Minister now defeating the real purpose of this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not advocating the closure of any firm or encouraging it in any way.  I am simply saying that if the £475 million which I have for all unemployment related services, including the small amount of £61 million pay-related benefit, is used to keep firms open just by using that system exclusively, it might as well be classified as an employment subsidy and we may as well give the money direct to the employer by way of a straight subsidy on a payroll basis.  I would not advocate that, because, apart from anything else, it would be contrary to EEC competition rules.  We would not be entitled to it and we would not get sanction in that regard.  I have no doubts about the ingenuity of some people to get around the provisions in the Social Welfare Bill.  The provisions are not at all as draconian as they might at first sight appear to be.  Part-time workers such as casual dockers, workers on a two-day week in a cattle market, part-time shop assistants and so on or students working on a casual day-to-day basis are not involved at all as short-time workers. This applies only to people whose normal working week is five days and who are now on a systematic one-day, two-day, three-day or four-day basis.  Some workers on short time have worked a short working week on the basis of Thursday, <Col N="707" /> Friday and Saturday and have been off on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and have received payments in that regard.  The change is now there and, generally speaking, it is equitable enough.</P>

      <P>: As our spokesman said, we support the general measure, but on the specifics would the Minister say what the effect of giving the 25 per cent would be on the two days reduced from three? The Government propose that the rate is to be 25 per cent.  Would that add about another £6 to the £106 he mentioned?  In the example he said three days plus two days would be about another £6, which would be £112 against £117, instead of the figure he gave of three plus three plus 40 per cent, which is £133.  That would bring £133 down to about £112.  Is that roughly the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have not done the precise calculation, but such a worker would get two days' earnings, three-fifths of a social welfare week and no PRB. The three-fifths of a social welfare week is tax free.  We tend to forget that short-term social welfare payments are tax free. We tend to leave that out of the calculations. People working in full-time employment are liable for tax on every £1 they earn.  The Deputy's figure, broadly speaking, is correct.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are opposed to section 8 because this section is particularly penal.  It extends the waiting time from 12 to 18 days and, in effect, means that a man or woman who is off work either through unemployment through no fault of his or her own, or through illness, again through no fault of his or her own, will not receive pay-related benefit until into the fourth week of unemployment or disability as the case may be.  This <Col N="708" /> applies also to maternity allowance.  This is particularly penal on the man or woman who has worked for a number of years and then finds himself or herself out of work for five or six weeks and receives pay-related benefit for only one or one-and-a-half weeks of that period.</P>
      <P>We must ensure in a social welfare system that people are able to meet their essential financial commitments.  If, say, a married man has paid into the social welfare insurance fund for a number of years and then is out of work for a short time and receiving the basic payment of social welfare benefit or disability benefit, in such circumstances he would receive £57.35 per week for the first three-and-a-half weeks of unemployment of disability.  This is penal and for this reason we are opposing this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: I was a Deputy in this House when pay-related benefit was introduced here in 1974.  Deputy Cluskey brought in the measure.  The support generally in this House was that the level of payment on unemployment benefit or disability benefit would be approximately 85 per cent of earnings.  That was the negotiated decision at that time with the ICTU, who were then deeply involved in the introduction of the scheme.  Unfortunately the floors have never been changed and as a result one has the situation where in relation to disability benefit 100 per cent is paid and in relation to unemployment benefit on occasions it is substantial also.  The changes proposed here are not penal.  I will give a straightforward example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I will take £150 per week, which is the average earnings of a married man with two children.  At the moment such a person has net take-home pay after tax of £117.10.  Unemployed such a worker gets £68.05 unemployment flat rate at the moment.  He gets £31.49 pay-related benefit which gives him £99.54 or 85 per cent replacement of his earnings as of March 1983.  In April there is a change.  Because there is no change in the tax bands he will be receiving £1.50 a week less.  Out of £150 he will have a net take home pay of £115.40, as against £117.10 at present. He will still be getting his flat-rate benefit <Col N="709" /> of £68.05 and will receive a reduced PRB. It will go down from £31.49 to £23.25.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>: Will he receive any PRB?  Under this section he will not receive any PRB for the third week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will come to that in a few minutes.  I am talking about a worker who qualifies for PRB at the commencement of the fourth week. He would receive £91.30 or 79 per cent replacement of his earnings from July, which is the important point.  He would still have a net take home pay of £115.43 out of £150, but as from July it will increase to £174.85 flat rate and he will receive £23.25 PRB, bringing him up to £98.10, exactly 85 per cent replacement of his earnings.</P>
      <P>There is nothing draconian about that change.  There will be a slight drop because we have not been able to increase social welfare payments since 5 April as it would cost £39 million, but from July there will be a full restoration to 85 per cent replacement of his earnings. The same applies in respect of disability benefit.  For example, there is a slight drop on the disability benefit side. In my view, to have a slight drop in this area is less draconian than a drop in benefit for an unemployed person.  At the moment the replacement ratio is 91 per cent; from April it will be 79 per cent and from July, 85 per cent.</P>
      <P>We have 203,000 people out of work with a growing list of long-term unemployed. I contrast that situation with a person getting £98.10 PRB or disability benefit with a married man with a wife and two children getting unemployment assistance of about £65 a week.  There is a ferocious difference here in terms of poverty. There are 17,000 married people with dependants on that low level and they are the people who should be getting the transfer payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that there are severe limitations on the amount of money available for disability benefit.  I do not have the exact figures in front of me but at present we are paying £3 million disability benefit each week. We have increased the number of medical <Col N="710" /> appeals officers in the Department of Social Welfare.  In a situation where there is a dire shortage of money for unemployment benefit, my post-budget allocation for disability benefit was a major allocation; as of now it is in the region of £165 million.  That is a major sum in terms of the contributions required.</P>
    <P>I want to give the proper amounts.  We are paying £165,490,000, or roughly £3 million a week, disability benefit and £17 million pay-related.  This raises some questions.  It is interesting to note in particular that we are paying £209 million unemployment benefit plus £165 million disability benefit.  While I do not wish to pillory anyone,  I wonder frequently about some of the certifications which members of the medical profession provide in respect of disability benefit, but that is another day's work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: In my view the Minister is under a very serious misapprehension about the Social Insurance Fund.  One of the basic reasons for setting up this fund was to provide for sickness.  The mistake the Minister is making is in saying that more and more people are becoming unemployed.  This means if more money cannot be provided by the Social Insurance Fund, we will have to keep reducing the benefit to contributors to that fund. It is not possible for a Social Insurance Fund to go on absorbing the vast numbers of unemployed.  This is a sickness benefit scheme to which the workers themselves contribute.  The Minister is pushing back to the fourth week the waiting period for pay-related benefit.  The figures show that a married man with a wife and two children earning £150, £117 net, will have to wait until the fourth week to get, between this and July, the £91.  In between he will have to survive on £68.  He has to pay his various outgoings &mdash; rent or mortgage &mdash; and keep his family.  The Minister is <Col N="711" /> raiding that fund for other purposes.  It is not feasible to go on putting the extra unemployed on to the Social Insurance Fund as it exists.  It will not work.</P>
      <P>This is a bad move on the part of the Government.  Does the Minister consider it reasonable to ask the worker to wait until the fourth week before getting the pay-related benefit element.  We are not talking about people who are abusing the system.  There are such people within the system and they have to be weeded out of it.  The Minister knows that steps are being taken to deal with that situation. Leaving that aside, people who are ill must wait until the fourth week.  The Minister, of course, has given only one example but if one takes the case of somebody on a higher income the effects would be worse.  At present it goes up to £11,000 and obviously the loss for a person in that bracket would be very severe.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious mistake.  It has nothing to do with removing anomalies. It is just raiding the system which is there to protect the genuine worker when he or she is sick and taking another week away. Already their benefits are being reduced by the fact that the pay-related benefit element is being reduced from 40 to 25 per cent.  I cannot understand how Labour Party Deputies can come into the House with this kind of measure.  We are opposed to it.  There was never any suggestion of anything like this on our part. We were certainly dealing with the abusers of the system but we could not support this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>: We also oppose this section.  It is an absolutely outrageous one.  I cannot understand how the Minister could try to defend it on the basis of how much everything costs.  What has that to do with the guy who is on disability benefit or who is unemployed?  How the money is to be raised is for the Finance Bill but what we are talking about here is benefits.  What is being done here is taking a week off the person's benefit.  It is another method of taxation.  The Government make £39 million by putting the benefits back to July.  That is one method of taxation.  It takes £40, £50 or <Col N="712" /> £60 off the person on social welfare.  Now they are doing it again by taking a week's pay-related benefit element?  We are not has been saying that disability benefit costs us £17 million, so they take it off the people who are disabled to make up for this.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that poverty exists and that it is the responsibility of the whole of society?  That is what Government is about: to ensure that people have sufficient food, clothing, housing, education for their children, sickness benefits, health benefits and so on.  That is what Government is all about &mdash; to ensure that those who can afford pay their taxes so that these benefits can be given.  The Minister and the Government have done the direct opposite.  They are allowing those who have the money to get away without paying their taxes and they push the taxation in a hidden way onto the people who need the benefits most.  When you are ill you need money straight-away.  The 12 days waiting period is being increased to 18 days at a time when people need help most. In many cases unemployment will be permanent. The first year of unemployment is a traumatic one.  It is also the year in which people spend most of their time going around looking for work, spending money at a greater rate than ever before in an effort to get some other job before eventually they give up when they go on unemployment assistance after 65 weeks, now 63 weeks.  They then become the permanently unemployed which affects them mentally as well as physically.  All the Minister and the Government can think of is that this will cost us so many million so we cannot give them this money instead of saying: &ldquo;How do we raise the extra money that these people need and must get?&rdquo;  The attitude of the Government is totally wrong in this instance and this is a penal tax on the disabled and unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister is really inflicting a hardship here.  Let us take the case of a young married couple paying a house mortgage.  This has to be paid monthly.  The total income of many unemployed people goes to pay back a <Col N="713" /> loan.  Imagine a man coming home to his wife and saying: &ldquo;I am now unemployed but I will not have pay-related benefit for a month.&rdquo;  People must set themselves to pay a house mortgage.  In a case of hardship of that kind are such people entitled to draw social assistance?  There will certainly be hardship and social assistance is there specifically for those who find themselves suffering hardship.</P>
      <P>Let us talk now about the real poor, the young married couple who had the initiative to go out and build their own home rather than be a liability on the Government or the local authorities.  I can see very severe hardship imposed on such people.  They number thousands.  I would appeal to the Minister to have a re-think on what he is inflicting on this section of the community.</P>
      <P>I would also like to know is occupational injury included?  Do those who suffer occupational injury also have to wait? A man or a woman could have a very serious accident in his or her employment. Must they also wait for the 18 days for pay-related?  This whole thing is fraught with difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: There may be some fundamental misconceptions here.  I hope now the record will be absolutely clear. We are talking about the payment of pay-related benefit element on top of the flat rate.  There are some very peculiar misconceptions about the Bill.  Lest the word goes out that benefit is not payable generally until the commencement of the fourth week, let me put the record straight.  First of all, I should like to correct a number of misconceptions.  The proposal Deputy Woods had in mind when he was a member of the last Government, a proposal clearly recorded in a Government decision, was that from 1 January, not from 1 April, pay-related benefit would be reduced to 30 per cent for the first six months and 20 per cent for the remaining nine months.  If anybody here wants to accuse anyone of being draconian then he should accuse Deputy Woods.  Deputy Woods knows perfectly well he took that decision on 22 October 1982 and the consequential savings <Col N="714" /> built into his Estimate were clearly known to him and so was the impact thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: On a point of order, that is the next section.  The Minister has given us a lot of figures on the next section and they could be useful because they are relevant to it but what we are talking about here are the waiting days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: I want to put a number of facts on the record.  Our Government decided we would not bring in such a proposal on 1 January 1983; we would bring it in on 1 April close to the beginning of the tax year.  The consequence of that was we were short of £7 million and we made relatively minor adjustments on the particular Estimate provision on the savings already decided on by the outgoing Administration and published in <i>The Way Forward</i>.  If I may say so, there has been some very selective posturing on the part of Deputy Woods here on disability benefit.  A decision was taken by him to reduce the ceiling for pay-related benefit and disability benefit from 100 per cent to 80 per cent.  Deputy Woods took that decision in October 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister deal with the section and not be wandering over all the other sections in an effort to distract people from what we are talking about here, namely, extending the waiting period to 18 days?  Would the Minister confine himself to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: The extension of the waiting period for an extra five or six days in terms of impact on the benefit is relatively small compared to the massive decisions built into the Estimates of October 1982 decided upon by the previous Administration.  It is important to bear in mind in relation to disability benefits and pay-related benefits that there is one major distinction.  Workers out on sick benefit plus pay-related benefit have jobs to go back to, and we must never forget that.  In regard to some of the certification which members of health boards and some others are aware of in <Col N="715" /> terms of the payment of £3 million a week on DB, plus paying another £17 million pay-related benefit on top of that provided for in this year's Estimate, I think there might well be savings there which quite frankly should go to the long-term unemployed.  I challenge Deputy Mac Giolla when he talks about the short-term effect on someone becoming suddenly unemployed and I assert that it is at the very commencement of employment that lesser payments by and large might well be made, because the worker who is totally crucified is the worker out of work for more than 15 months.  It is towards the end of the period of unemployment, when savings are dissipated and one no longer has tax refunds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: If I might be allowed to make a point.  The greatest social deprivation is not within the first two or three weeks of DB application or unemployment benefit application; it is after the six months or the nine months.  That is where the money should be transferred to as against the current lop-sided system we have where the longer a man is unemployed the worse off he is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is something we are endeavouring to rectify and this Bill goes some of the way in that direction. The reason basically for the extension of the waiting period was the previous Government's decision to impose these changes, and they are undoubtedly an imposition, on and from 1 January 1983 and we decided not to do that.  We said it will be 5 April and there was then a requirement to make up the money <Col N="716" /> within the Estimate.  It was made up on this basis and that is the situation.</P>
      <P>I find some of the selective political posturing here difficult to understand, remembering that 95 per cent of the changes were decided on 22 October 1982 by the previous Government.  In they come now and one would swear they had never been in Government and had never made any changes.  All the provisions are there.  They are there with a vengeance and they have got to be accepted.  I except Deputy O'Hanlon from that, because I think he understands the situation. Indeed, I look forward to dealing with it constructively.  Deputy Woods has been talking nonsense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept the exception that I was not in the Cabinet but, along with my colleagues, I accept full responsibility for their actions.  On this particular section the Minister does appear to be vulnerable because on both occasions on which he intervened he seemed to avoid the section.  He rambled over the field of disability benefit, even including medical certification.  How the Minister can suggest that a person lying on his hospital bed, with a wife and young family to look after when his net income was £117 per week &mdash; and now he is told that for the first three-and-a-half weeks he will receive only £68.5 per week &mdash; is not deprived is something I cannot understand. I do not know how anyone can say that we should not be concerned about that situation and that it is more important to think about people at the other end of the scale.  I agree that we must look after people who have been ill or unemployed for a long time but we must not do so at the expense of one who finds himself suddenly out of work or ill and who must meet his commitments.  He is the person who is very vulnerable.  Therefore, we are opposing this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is no change in that regard.  It must be pointed out that the vast majority of disability benefit claims are of relatively short duration and that the extent to which there is a major imposition on families is quite limited.  I am adamant about reforming the system. A person who is sick and in his hospital bed for five or six months must be given special attention.  We must change, too, the system whereby a person who is out of work because of illness for only a week or two, and who normally would not receive pay-related benefit since it is paid only on the commencement of the third week's absence from work, then decides to stay out for another couple of weeks on foot of a certificate, which in many cases can be produced at the drop of a hat, for the purpose of collecting another £20 per week.  It is for that kind of situation that we are paying £3 million per week, whereas I am aiming to have the money provided for those on long-term disability benefit.  It is time that we faced up to the situation instead of having to listen to some of the very selective social policy criteria being used in this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister perhaps pinpointed the solution when he said that the difficulty is not at the beginning of the period of unemployment but at the end.  The effect of this section as outlined <Col N="718" /> in the explanatory memorandum is that the additional six-day waiting period will reduce effectively the maximum number of days' entitlement to pay-related benefit from 381 to 375.  If the Minister would agree not to delete those six days but to leave the situation as it is, there would probably be general acceptance for the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is a valid point but what the Deputy is suggesting cannot be done in the context of this year's Bill. Without wishing to bring in extraneous matter, if an Irishman living in the UK found himself in receipt of disability benefit, he would not be paid any pay-related benefit.  In addition, he would be receiving £10 less while he was on the flat of his back than is the case here and, thirdly, the benefit would apply only for 12 months whereas here the term is to be 375 days.  Let us not create the impression, therefore, that we have a bad social welfare system or one that is being dismantled. Despite the full frontal assault on this Bill we have an outstanding system which both sides have built up together down through the years.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> Question declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: Amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 are out of order.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are opposing section 9.  The decision to reduce pay-related benefit from 40 per cent to 25 per cent was never a proposal of ours and was not part of our policy.  Taking that in conjunction with the extended waiting time which has just been voted through, the number of hours per week disregarded increased from 32 hours to 36 hours, the three days' payment reduced to 2 days' payment, the 1 per cent levy which will be included in the collection of PRSI from the beginning of April, the increase in VAT of 5 per cent across the board and the effects of the devaluation of our currency, we have no choice but to oppose this section.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to answer one question.  Is it correct that the maximum pay-related benefit on a contribution ceiling of £13,000 will be £47 per week while on a contribution ceiling of £9,500 it was £63 per week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will check that point for the Deputy.  I have not the exact calculation in front of me.  I would point out very emphatically that the change from 40 per cent to 30 per cent as originally agreed by the former Government on 22 October was to be implemented on 1 January.  We took a deliberate decision not to go ahead with the change on 1 January but to make it coincide with the tax year and we decided to reduce the benefit to 25 per cent to make up the deficiency arising from the deferment. That was the only reason.  We decided to stay within the rigid parameters of the Estimate and I am at a loss to understand why there should be such adamant objection on the part of the Opposition, bearing in mind that 90 per cent of the change <Col N="722" /> was intended for implementation on 1 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister's main argument for the various changes proposed throughout the Bill has been that he is not doing anything more than Fianna Fáil were proposing to do.  I understood that we fought a general election in recent months to change the Government and to change the policies which would be introduced.  I have already pointed out that the Bill before us reneges directly on the policies on which the Labour Party were elected.  It also reneges on the Programme for Government agreed by both Fine Gael and Labour.</P>
      <P>The Minister argues that the proposed changes are negligible but the totality of the changes is quite substantial and the net effect will be very severe on the living standards of people who, through no fault of their own, are claiming unemployment or disability benefit.  For that reason we oppose the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: I take Deputy De Rossa's point.  I have said repeatedly that I fought for a ceiling of 85 per cent in terms of unemployment benefit, which we regarded as about the right amount to give basic protection to the unemployed. I fought for this as a trade union official in the sixties and when I came into the House in 1969 and also when finally pay-related benefit was introduced in 1974.  I never advocated a ceiling of 100 per cent replacement ratio in respect of disability benefit and that was changed quite correctly by the former administration back to 80 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some reason there grew up a practice in relation to short-time working of a ceiling of around 110 per cent or 114 per cent.  We have now brought it back to 94 per cent in accordance with the inter-departmental report.  I am at a loss to know why there is such adamant opposition, bearing in mind that we had not only to take on the Estimates of the outgoing administration but also to find <Col N="723" /> another £31 million for the payment of more unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>Much as I see the difficulty arising from the provision, the measures as proposed are equitable although in some cases they mean a reduction in actual social welfare payments.  I am quite prepared to stand over them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon's comment is correct <Col N="724" /> in that pay-related in relation to £9,500 or £190 per week at 40 per cent is £63.  Pay-related benefit after April on £11,000 at 25 per cent is £46 per week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister is taking an extra £9.5 million by cutting down to 25 per cent.  It is substantial.</P>

Is it proposed that the health boards should continue to collect this money?  The health boards make the point, quite validly, that they are not collectors.  The money does not go to their revenue; it goes to the central Exchequer.  Has the Minister notified the health boards yet?  If not, when does he intend to do so?  We are coming to the end of March.</P>

      <P>: I confirm to Deputy O'Hanlon that the health boards, certainly in respect of the current year, will be collecting these moneys. As Deputies know, the regulations provide that for farms the liability will be assessed on a factual basis as in the case of self-employed persons and the effect will be that farmers will be assessed on the basis of profits or gains from farming activity less any expenses incurred in earning those profits and less any superannuation contributions which they may have paid.  Therefore, I am hopeful that as a result of the changed basis of assessment there will be a significant improvement in the collection rate and for the time being the health boards will have direct responsibility.  Perhaps a change will occur in 1984 or 1985 but for the current year it will rest with the health boards.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Noonan (<i>Limerick West</i>) on 22 March 1983:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to restore the funds recently withdrawn in respect of aids and services for farming development <Col N="734" /> and to lift its suspension on the Farm Modernisation Scheme immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would like to re-state my support for the motion proposed last night so eloquently by my colleague, Deputy Noonan.  He is a man of knowledge of the farming scene, having served in the farm organisations as President of Macra na Feirme and he has been also a practising farmer all his life.  Therefore, he must know the practicalities of farming in detail.  This practical and intimate knowledge of agriculture and his experience with the farm organisations give him the qualities necessary to make a good Front Bench spokesman and very soon an excellent Minister for Agriculture. Last night Deputy Noonan was referred to as a hurler on the ditch.  I suggest that a hurler on the ditch is far better than a teacher on the ditch.  In this case the hurler happens to be a farmer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan outlined in detail many reasons for Dáil Éireann to call on the Government to restore funding which was recently withdrawn from agriculture in respect of aids and services for farming development.  He also put an excellent case for lifting immediately the suspension of the farm modernisation scheme. I hope I will strengthen the case still further for reverting to the Fianna Fáil policy on agriculture, which always has been one of recognition of the contribution of farming and agriculture to the economy, and of the potential of agriculture in our economy with proper support and encouragement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone here will accept that agriculture can grow much more and faster if we steer the proper course.  This growth will <Col N="735" /> stimulate our ailing economy by injections of finance as a result of exports and the creation of much-needed employment. We have heard already that more than one-third of our exports &mdash; 40 per cent &mdash; are agricultural, and that the export of agricultural goods is far more profitable than ordinary exports because the import content is practically nil.  Our greatest asset is still that six inches of soil. This fact is not recognised by this or previous Coalition Governments.</P>
    <P>Let us briefly contrast the attitude of the two Governments &mdash; Fianna Fáil who have been in power for 40 of the last 50 years, and the Coalition who, by default or otherwise, spent ten years in Government. Agriculture has grown enormously with great investment and development taking place.  The only periods of stunted growth were when the Coalition Governments were in power.  In 1974 when a farmer went to the mart in the hope of selling one calf no bid was made.  There were many instances of farmers returning home with two or more calves in their trailers.  The price of calves was such that farmers were literally giving them away. This situation came about because of sheer ignorance and carelessness on the part of the Coalition at a time which should have been our most beneficial years in the EEC.  The advantages which were there for the taking were thrown to the wind.</P>
    <P>In 1981 a conglomeration of Fine Gael, Labour and Jim Kemmy formed a Coalition Government, until Jim dropped them like a hot bun in January 1982. What was their performance in relation to agriculture?  It was one of downgrading. They were only minutes in office when the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dukes, announced cuts of 5 per cent in the farm modernisation scheme and decided to discontinue the mobile equipment grants entirely.  From that date to this the agricultural service industry of farm machinery has deteriorated very significantly.  I was taking to a dealer today who told me he sold 78 tractors in 1978 but last year he sold 13 and this trend will continue.  The trend of lessening interest in agriculture continued until <Col N="736" /> that Government's real Taoiseach, Jim Kemmy, decided to pull the plug on that fateful January day, and that Government refused to update the costing of the farm modernisation scheme.  Those costings were not updated by Deputy Dukes.</P>
    <P>The present Coalition Government were only hours in office when they brought down the guillotine on agriculture. The farm modernisation scheme was scrapped and they tell us it will be reintroduced in the autumn.  The only way that will happen is if Fianna Fáil are back in power, and the way things are going that is a strong possibility.  Never have I seen so much unrest among farmers. When the next election comes the Minister will get his answer from them. I believe this Government have no intention of reintroducing this scheme.  Their ploy is to soften the blow to the farmers. My suspicions were enhanced last night when the Minister for Agriculture refused to answer definitely when I asked if the scheme was to be reintroduced in the autumn.  He dithered and then said smartly that no politician ever gives a definite commitment.  I would change that slightly and say that no politician in a corner ever gives a commitment, and that Minister is in several corners.</P>
    <P>The Minister said when the schemes are with us a while change is no harm, and then suggested a review would be desirable.  That is a weak argument. Surely we do not scrap a scheme when we are reviewing it, but that is exactly what is happening.  To all intents and purposes this scheme is being scrapped.</P>
    <P>This Government have decided to tax all farmers knowing full well that at least two-thirds of them do not have a taxable income.  For the first time they introduced a VAT rate on farm diesel oil.  They have increased VAT on contracting charges. They have decided to close the five farm home advisory colleges and to impose massive charges on farm development for planning permissions.  The other Coalition Governments were bad but this one in their first 100 days in office have proved to be an absolute disaster.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, Fianna Fáil always redressed the imbalance in agriculture on our return to Government.  In February <Col N="737" /> 1982 we restored the farm modernisation scheme to its original level and reintroduced the mobile equipment grants.  We prepared a four-year plan having heard the voice of farming.  Then we negotiated the £100 million loan for farmers to increase the national herd.  On our return to Government we will recognise agriculture as our greatest resource.  We will nurture it back to a stage where the country, the economy and the people will benefit.</P>
    <P>It is hard to understand why Fine Gael as a partner in Government ignore the plight of the farmer.  It is hard to understand why they insult their supporters by removing aids and services which yielded handsome dividends and massive returns to the Exchequer.  On the other hand, the Labour Party, or what is left of it, the other party in Government, is much easier to understand.  Labour had to be paid off in some fashion for voting for the Social Welfare Bill even though every constituency council of the Labour Party advised against this.  The Labour Party make no apology for their anti-farmer approach.  Indeed, one of their leading members called for a nationalisation of all lands.  The farmer will have to suffer on while these partners share Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister last night questioned figures which Deputy Noonan gave as part of his argument.  Deputy Noonan claimed that £147 million would be taken out of agriculture as a result of the budget.  As always our figures are accurate and of course, now that all farmers are in the tax net, there is an obligation on them to give a proven statement of income which means they will have to employ an auditor at a cost of an expected £400 per farmer.  This alone is a massive withdrawal from agriculture.  Conservative estimates give a figure in excess of £40 million.  This will be no advantage to the State but the Labour Party will be happy.</P>
    <P>I should like now to quote from the <i>Irish Farmers Monthly</i> of March 1983. Under the heading &ldquo;Cuts in Agricultural Expenditure&rdquo; it says:</P>
    <P>(a)  Suspension of grants under the <Col N="738" /> Farm Modernisation Scheme, £10.3 million.</P>
    <P>(b)  Abolishing group fodder scheme, guidance premiums, mobile equipment grants and farm account grants, £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>(c)  Suspension of Farm Retirement Scheme, £1.0 million.</P>
    <P>(d)  Suspension of Boyle and Dunkellin drainage schemes, £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>(e)  Phasing out of ACOT services &mdash; Farm Home Management/Poultry / Amenity Horticultural Services, £0.5 million.</P>
    <P>(f)  Abolishing Wool Council, £0.06 million.</P>
    <P>(g)  Closing Munster Institute, £0.027 million.</P>
    <P>(h)  Restriction of National 5% Interest Subsidy Scheme, £2.0 million.</P>
    <P>(i)  Reduction in Disease Eradication Hardship Fund, £1.85 million.</P>
    <P>(j)  Reduction in income limit under the disadvantaged areas scheme, £0.5 million.</P>
    <P>(k)  Abolishing Bull licensing, £0.134 million.</P>
    <P>Total £21.371 million.</P>
    <P>On &ldquo;Farm Taxation&rdquo; it says:</P>
    <P>(a)  1983 Income Tax yield as estimated by Government will increase from £24 million in 1982 to £47 million in 1983.  £23 million.</P>
    <P>(b)  1% Income Levy.  This levy will apply to farmers gross incomes which amounted to £940 million in 1982.  £9.4 million.</P>
    <P>(c)  Youth Employment Levy.  This levy has been in existence since 1982 and applies to all income and farmers therefore come within the net.  It is based on a rate of 1% of gross income. £9.4 million.</P>
    <P>Total £41.8 million.</P>
    <P>Under &ldquo;Services&rdquo; it reads:</P>
    <P>(a)  Increased inspection fees at <Col N="739" /> export meat factories on live cattle exports at dairy premises £1.0 million.</P>
    <P>(b)  Fees for visits by ACOT and Farm Development Services under the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>Total £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>Under &ldquo;Inflation Impact&rdquo; it reads:</P>
    <P>The budget will contribute 4% to the consumer price index, or in other words result in a 4% increase in the inflation rate.  It has been estimated that each 1% in inflation adds £10 million to farmer costs.</P>
    <P>Total due to inflation £40.0 million.</P>
    <P>Later on it reads:</P>
    <P>The following summarises the total cost of the budget to the farming sector.</P>

    </table>
    <P>These were the figures we offered last night and since they come from the <i>Irish Farmers Monthly</i> I take it that all Members of the House would accept them as being accurate particularly as they have not been rejected by the Government to date.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, said in 1977 that investment in agriculture yielded a 14 per cent bonus. If this is applied to the withdrawal of £1.47 million from agriculture it will demonstrate the massive losses to our economy.  The Minister is probably sorry that he ever said that.</P>
    <P>I would like to challenge the Minister to put forward figures that would contradict those we have produced or else to admit that he knew absolutely nothing about such figures when he was talking last night.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Farmers Monthly</i>is representative of the farming view whether the farmers are big or small.  It says again in the March issue:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> It is amazing to see a Government abandoning the grant for farm accounts when farming is emerging from the most serious economic recession ever.  One of the main features to emerge from this recession was the lack of financial management on farms, and the necessity for the monitoring of their farming and financial activities by way of farm accounts was never more needed.</P>
    <P>The suspension of the farm retirement scheme is a clear indication that the Government has abandoned the whole concept of structural reform in agriculture and has reduced any possibility of any land mobility in the future.  There is no doubt that the farm retirement scheme needed to be updated by an increase in the level of grants offered, but abandoning it is effectively turning their back on land structural reform, which was one of the major disappointments of Irish agriculture in the first decade in the EEC.</P>
    <P>I am glad that here tonight we have the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Connaughton, who claims that he is proposing massive changes in land mobility and land structure generally.  I now challenge him to come forward with his ideas and to tell us how the scrapping of the Farm Retirement Scheme will be of any benefit to his proposals.  The <i>Irish Farmers Monthly</i> says:</P>
    <P>The inclusion of farm drainage under the Farm Modernisation Scheme clearly demonstrates the Government's lack of understanding of the current situation in Irish agriculture. In 1982 there was an estimated 5.8 million livestock units in the country, while the stock carrying capacity of Irish land at low levels of nitrogen use is estimated at 8 million livestock units.  So, therefore, this clearly demonstrates that land quality is not a constraint on increased agricultural output as we are at only 70 per cent of the national average grazing capacity of the country at the present time.</P>
    <P>That is one of the main reasons why our <Col N="741" /> party had proposed to raise a £100 million loan in order to increase the national herd.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the disease eradication hardship fund demonstrates the Government's lack of commitment to disease eradication and their unwillingness to help farmers in serious trouble due to TB or brucellosis.  In 1982 there were 43,000 full-time farmers in the tax net. As a result of the raising of the threshold there are now an extra 80,000 full-time farmer in the tax net and an additional 50,000 part-time farmers.  Farmers paid an estimated £34 million in tax in 1982. The amount due in rates would have been £18 million.  However farmers withheld the rates because of the pending PLV case in the High Court which subsequently ruled that the system was unconstitutional. Very few farmers therefore paid rates in 1982.</P>
    <P>In his budget statement the Minister said the removal of the threshold would result in an increase of about £2.5 million in farm taxation in 1983.  This is a blatant misleading of the public and the Dáil.  It can be clearly shown that farmers will pay an additional £23 million in income tax in 1983 as against 1982 if he, as he states, expects a total income of £47 million in the total income tax yield from farmers this year.  However, this figure could be much higher when the income tax from farming is taken into account from those engaged in part-time farming.  The Minister may like to contradict these statements made by me, statements backed up by the <i>Irish Farmers Monthly</i>.</P>
    <P>I would like now to go on to the farm modernisation scheme and deal briefly with the effects of that scheme.  Investment aids, grants for investment in farm buildings and fixed equipment are suspended until further notice.  Farmers issued with approvals by the farm development service for development work on or before 9 February are not affected by the suspension.  Guidance premiums for development farmers are terminated. Farmers whose plans include guidance premiums approved on or before 9 February are not affected.  I do not accept the Minister's comment last night that this scheme has been an unnecessary one. <Col N="742" /> Grants to development farmers for mobile equipment are terminated. Approval issued by the farm development service on or before 9 February are not affected.  Likewise, with this scheme I believe the intention was that the scheme would be an incentive to farmers to keep machinery in a reasonable state.  All the surveys carried out by many county committees of agriculture will show farm machinery at this stage at an all-time low. We have yet to see the results of that policy.</P>
    <P>Under the interest subsidy scheme for existing applicants under the national interest subsidy scheme, aid will be limited to a subsidy on the interest due for one year only.  With regard to charges for farm visits, a charge will be introduced for the first time for farm visits by the Department of Agriculture and ACOT staff in connection with the farm modernisation scheme.  This charge will be implemented by way of a deduction from grants which are payable under the farm modernisation scheme.  This charge, I understand, will affect all works for which approvals were made before 9 February.</P>
    <P>Here I should like to challenge the Minister once again on something he said last night.  He told us two visits would be sufficient to accommodate all grant projects. I would like to tell him now, as a farmer and as one who has gone through all this business on many occasions, that in a drainage project an inspector would have to call on at least six occasions.  My figures would suggest then that it will cost £120.  I appeal again to the Minister to make himself aware of the situation, to listen to farmers and not to lend his ear too rigidly to the Department because the person on the ground who has gone through the mill will know more than anybody else.</P>
    <P>I am absolutely disgusted with this Government in their decision to close the five farm home advisory colleges.  These colleges prepare girls interested in agriculture for farming.  This preparation has proved to be a wonderful success.  At least 50 per cent of those trained in such colleges went back to farming.  That is surely proof of how successful these <Col N="743" /> colleges were.  It is recognised now that a farmer's wife has a vitally important role to play.  Everyone will accept that two heads are better than one and the more educated a wife is the better it will be for that particular farmer and, overall the better for the country.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all members to support our motion.  I believe it will help to save the economy instead of sending it in a reverse direction.</P>

      <P>: First of all, I apologise to the House for a very bad head cold.  I would be very sorry not to be in a position to-night to reply to some of the points made by Deputy Byrne.  Yesterday evening the Minister outlined the position in which we found ourselves on last budget day.  Anybody who forgets what went before that, particularly in the preceding five or six years, is living in cloud-cuckoo land. There were things done in the budget that most did not like.  There are things done in most budgets that people do not like.  This was a particularly hard budget but there was not a man or woman in Fine Gael, in Labour or in Fianna Fáil who did not know in their hearts that it was time someone stood up and took the country by the scruff of the neck and decided to do the sort of thing Fianna Fáil should have done in 1977, could have done, but certainly did not do.  They went for the soft option and we found ourselves in the years coming up to this budget in a position in which we had borrowed out of hand.  If there was a crisis we ran for additional foreign borrowing and we wound up in an utterly untenable situation.  We just could not continue because of the grip of that huge foreign deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain things that must be cleared up here.  We are in the grip of a vice at the moment.  Indeed some of the things I heard from Fianna Fáil last night and again tonight would not lead me to believe that a return of Fianna Fáil, however unlikely that might be, would be a good thing for our farmers.  Yesterday evening Deputy Byrne said that Fine <Col N="744" /> Gael always had good support from the farming community.  There was a practical reason for that and Deputy Byrne knows that well.  That support is very likely to continue.  In the years 1978, 1979 and 1980 farmers' incomes fell by 40 per cent in real terms.  What happened? There were deputations and pleas to the Minister for Finance at the time, Deputy MacSharry.  We had a particularly bad summer in 1980.  The depression in agricultural circles then was five times worse than it is today but after many hours of bargaining with Fianna Fáil we succeeded in getting a subsidy of £20 on one ton of nitrogen.  That is all that came from Fianna Fáil in those very bad times. Because of the budget deficit being so high we were forced into taking measures that would enable us to pay off the international bankers but at the same time we are ensuring that we do not impede agricultural production.  We all know that the land of Ireland is the only real asset we have.</P>

      <P>: Fianna Fáil have been in office in this State for longer than any other party but we are now no better off than we were on the day we joined the EEC.  At that stage most people, including myself, thought that our membership would be a launching pad that would open up new horizons for us.  We looked forward to the various EEC aids and to not being confined to the cheap food policy of the British market.  My party have been in office, too, during some of the past decade but we have not succeeded in making the progress that we would have liked to make and we now have the greatest debt we have ever had. Consequently, we must ensure that we get value for every pound of taxpayers' money we decide to invest in any sector. Certain cutbacks, however unpalatable, had to be made in agriculture as in all other Departments, but we have minimised the hardship and are giving a <Col N="745" /> chance of extra production.  I will refer later to the positive steps that the Government are taking and will take in the near future.</P>
      <P>All farmers should have a detailed look at the Farm Modernisation Scheme. There was a budgetary decision to suspend farm modernisation grants and this will result in a saving this year of £10.3 million.  We may not be getting the best value for money invested in farm buildings. As a farmer, Deputy Byrne will understand what I am talking of.  Many farmers in the past ten years have embarked on huge capital building programmes but they have found out at the end of the day that in order to qualify for grants very big investment is required. One might argue that the buildings erected were too elaborate.  An important factor was the failure to achieve the expected increase in stock numbers and farmers found themselves in great difficulty as a result of their borrowings.  In any new programme of grants account will have to be taken first of the actual cost involved and, most important, of the size of the investment that any farm can carry.  From the Exchequer point of view we will have to consider the question of the value that we get for the money invested.  Down through the years sufficient notice was not taken of the problem of out-wintering cattle.  Successive Governments seem to have turned a blind eye to this problem.  It is not sufficient to say that there were grants for slatted cattle houses.  Everybody in the agricultural area realises that for most small farmers the cost of these buildings is prohibitive.  Recently I was informed that 70 per cent of all store cattle in the north-west are out-wintered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I know at least as much about agriculture as Deputy O'Keeffe knows.  It has been found necessary to suspend the grants relating to the guidance premia.  These relate to farm accounts and mobile equipment. Not very many farmers took part in the guidance premia arrangement.  In principle the scheme appeared to be all right but, as every rural Deputy knows, it was extremely difficult for farmers to qualify and it took a good deal of time and effort on the part of the staff involved at all levels to put the scheme through.  This was because of the amount of red tape involved.  I am not sure who was responsible <Col N="747" /> for negotiating that scheme but it involved too much red tape.</P>
      <P>There are a number of factors in relation to agriculture that the people opposite have failed to refer to so far.  Let us concentrate for a moment on the western package.  The budget will not hinder in any way the grants in respect of drainage in the west.  There is a backlog of applications for participation in the western drainage scheme.  This backlog has been building up for the past 12 to 18 months. There is a survey in progress for the purpose of determining how much land in this category is in a limbo situation.  When the survey has been completed we will estimate how much money would be required to continue the programme.</P>
      <P>I should like everyone to be aware that there are grants of 40 per cent available under the western package which up to now have not been utilised.  The western package that was negotiated about two years ago has not seen the light of day.  One wonders why, after all the negotiations that were involved, this package was not properly sold.  One might say that most people were not aware until the past couple of months of what the package contained.  The western package is basically a pre-development scheme for farmers who are not in the development category.  There is a wideranging scale of grants for farm buildings and so on and the package does not exclude totally dairy farming because certain farmers with a certain number of cows would be eligible for participation in the scheme.  In addition, there are land reclamation grants under the Farm Modernisation Scheme and there are other services and funds involved in the western package to the extent of £300 million over a ten-year period for the development of agriculture.  Included are such services as roads, water supplies and electricity.  Aid is also being provided for agricultural marketing and processing, agricultural training and forestry development. Farmers anxious to avail of these grants should contact their ACOT advisors who have the appropriate application forms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Not particularly. Another item under the western package, the calf to beef scheme, has never been promoted and I wonder why.  Under that scheme a farmer would be entitled to get what amounts to an interest-free loan of £100 per animal provided he rears calves from calf to beef.  That scheme can be promoted with success in certain areas.  I accept that there are certain areas in the west where it will not catch on but it will prove successful elsewhere.  There are three types of land improvement grants under the package, the division of commonages, mountain and hill pasture and low land reclamation.  Those important aspects were not referred to in the course of the debate.  Farmers should acquaint themselves about the schemes that are available.</P>
      <P>In the budget the VAT rebate for farmers is to be increased from 1.8 to 2.3 per cent.  That represents about £10 million for farmers and offsets the extra VAT they will have to pay on inputs.</P>

The oil arrangement for those involved in the glasshouse industry is also being continued. <Col N="749" /> Although we are in difficult economic times the Government saw fit to make a special allocation in the form of an AI subsidy and lime subsidy.  They were not included in Fianna Fáil's Book of Estimates.  Fianna Fáil should tell the farmers why they decided that there should be dearer lime and AI charges. The Government are providing £93,000 to ACOT to assist the agricultural college at Ballinafad, County Mayo, because they believe that it is important to have an extra college in the west.  That college ran out of money and this caring Government ensured that they got their requirements for this year.</P>

      <P>: Deputy Byrne said the Coalition, like the last one, does not care for the farming community.  He accused us of bringing in legislation that would be against the farming community only hours after we took office.  Deputy Noonan declared on one occasion that Deputy Lenihan when he was Minister for Agriculture brought home the greatest single price package from Brussels in 1982.  Percentage-wise the Deputy was correct but it must be remembered that inflation in Ireland in that year was the highest it has ever been.  No matter how one wriggles the figures around one cannot say that the farming community were compensated last year.  Our inflation rate is being brought under control and the percentage increase that will be gained by our Minister in Brussels will prove to be good compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago Fianna Fáil introduced a 2 per cent levy on production, a peculiar move for a party that claims to be concerned about the farming community but, if I remember correctly, that levy had to be withdrawn.  Deputy Byrne also mentioned that we had decided to cease the hardship payments under the bovine TB eradication scheme but he did not explain to the House that for the first time since 1977 the Government provided an extra £3 million to increase the reactor grant.  It is important to note that £95 was added to the value of certain <Col N="750" /> animals.  That was long overdue and I am surprised farmers had to wait until now to get that assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>: The former Minister for Agriculture in Portumna announced that there would be greater grants but he did not go through with that.  One of the important factors as far as agricultural production is concerned will be our ability to get land mobility under way.  Little progress has been made in this regard.  We have had reports, meetings, seminars and surveys but all proposals finished on the dusty shelf.  The Government are in the process of tackling that huge problem.  If we are to get a reasonable return from our farms we must ensure that farmers are given every chance either as owners or as lessees. Some years ago an attempt was made to initiate land leasing.  The farm retirement pension scheme did not work for a variety of reasons.  It has been suspended but I have no doubt that if it is reintroduced in a way that will encourage elderly people to accept it it will represent a good day's work.  Without mobility of land agriculture will not reach its peak and that is why I am supporting efforts to organise a scheme to encourage farmers to get involved in a retirement pension scheme. There is also a great future for short-and medium-term land leasing and land rearrangement. We have many problems of fragmentation and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have taken the type of steps which had to be taken, given the position in which we find ourselves. Farmers will see this budget for what it is &mdash; a genuine effort to set the ship of State on the right course while continuing the work of increasing production on the land.  The Government will be seen in that light.  The Opposition would have us think that nothing was done for Irish agriculture other than by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Over the years there would have been much greater production and we would have had much higher livestock figures if the Fianna Fáil contribution had <Col N="751" /> been even half as good as Deputy Byrne would have us believe.  Who takes the blame for the buffeting suffered by farmers in the 1978-80 period?</P>
    <P>The measures taken by this Government will be seen as sensible efforts to ensure increased production.  During the next few years we will give the necessary leadership to the agricultural sector. When we go to the nation at the next election in four-and-a-half years' time our policies will be seen to have been right.  There are difficult times ahead but our priorities are right and we will achieve increased production.  Given the necessary time to implement the policies I have outlined I will have every confidence in standing before the farmers in a thriving agricultural economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>: I support the motion.  I am amazed that the Government have put down an amendment asking the Dáil to support the measures they are taking.  We have not heard what those measures are. The Minister for Finance stated in his budget speech his intention to cut State spending on agriculture by £14 million and that farmers would pay an extra £23 million in income tax.  These are not measures designed to help agriculture. The Government are completely anti-farmer. The farm modernisation scheme which was so important to farmers has been suspended in order to save £10.3 million.  This and other schemes have been funded by the EEC and I would ask the Minister to tell us how much money we are losing because of the suspension of the scheme.  These EEC funds helped not only the farmers but the nation generally. When will the Minister be in a position to tell us how much money we are losing in EEC funds?  He told us last night that he was not a hurler on the ditch but would tell us the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also told us last night that there was no outcry against this Government but the Munster President of the IFA, Mr. Michael Slattery, stated in last week's edition of the <i>Farmers Journal</i> that he and the farming sector are very sceptical about the Government's commitment to agriculture, which has seen a <Col N="752" /> 50 per cent drop in income since 1978. This is a very clear criticism of the Government.  Mr. Slattery went on to say that a measly £0.5 million was saved by reducing the off-farm income eligibility limit for headage payments from £5,400 to £3,500.  The Minister knows very well that this is a very severe blow to farmers in the west.  It means that farmers who have had to get off-farm employment will not qualify for any headage payments. That is not an incentive to farmers to increase livestock numbers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture also said last night that he did not favour a levy because it would be a form of taxation. Is it not the fact that the £20 farm visit fee by Department staff is a form of taxation? It is an extra cost on top of the income tax which the Minister for Finance states all farmers will have to pay.  It is a levy of the worst sort which will save the Department £1.5 million but which will also have the effect of breaking down the very good relationship which exists between Department staff and farmers.  The costings which are being used for grants under the farm modernisation scheme are out of date, so there is a double blow.  The grants have fallen behind and now there is an extra charge for a farm visit.</P>
    <P>Another cutback will save £2 million on the national interest subsidy scheme. The only good news in the budget was that there would be an increase of £3 million in reactor grants but even that news was clouded by the announcement that there would be a saving of £1.85 million in the hardship fund.</P>
    <P>We should also consider what other Minister are doing.  We hear that they are making more severe cuts than the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for the Environment has imposed a minimum fee of £40 for planning applications in respect of farm building.  That charge will increase by £1.75 for every square foot over 400 sq. ft.  The Minister for Social Welfare has said that all small farmers will be assessed by a means test and that the notional system will be abolished. Some years ago the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, was a Member of the Seanad and he told the House <Col N="753" /> that Fianna Fáil intended to abolish the farmers' dole.  It is ironic that it is his Government who are abolishing the notional system.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West)</i>: Unfortunately, half an hour was taken from our time.  I am not blaming you.  It was due to circumstances outside everybody's control.  My colleagues have referred to what the Minister for Agriculture said <Col N="754" /> last night.  I will go into a few things he said and how he misinformed the House.</P>
      <P>I was very disappointed to hear what the Minister of State said this evening because I always regarded him as a good practical farmer who had forthright views.  He spoke for 25 minutes and did not say anything.  He had not any positive thinking for agriculture development.  I do not blame him because he has been working under constraints.  It was not really the Minister of State who was talking but a section of the Government who have, unfortunately, been manipulated by the Labour Party.  I want the Minister of State to be his own man and come out fearlessly on behalf of the farmers as he did in the past.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State spoke about disease eradication and said his approach was positive.  He knows this was in our Programme for Government.  I cannot reconcile the Minister of State's disposal of reactors with his Government's reduction of the allocation for disease eradication by £1.5 million.  It is not possible to reconcile one with the other.  He also spoke about the agriculture college at Ballinafad.  He very conveniently omitted to say who financed this college initially. It was the Fianna Fáil Government when Deputy MacSharry was Minister for Finance.  Deputy Hugh Byrne said colleges which are essential to the development of domestic economy are being closed.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture deliberately misinformed the House during the debate yesterday evening.  I said yesterday:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Directive 159 the suspension of the Farm Modernisation Scheme is contrary to the terms of the Treaty of Rome and I understand the Commission have written to the Government asking for reasons why the scheme was suspended ... The action of the Minister for Finance in suspending the Farm Modernisation Scheme will put the Minister for Agriculture at a disadvantage when he is negotiating prices, when it will be seen that our Government have not the political will to provide <Col N="755" /> the necessary capital to invest in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied as follows:</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan alleged that we were being severely censured by the EEC for having suspended portion of the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  I do not know where he got that information. He may have seen it in a newspaper, but we all know you cannot believe everything you read in a newspaper.</P>
    <P>He then stated:</P>
    <P>We have heard no objection from the EEC regarding the suspension of portion of the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  In fact, we informed them of what we had done and there was no reaction.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply is either gross ignorance of the EEC dimension of his portfolio or else he deliberately tried to mislead the House.  He should know that Directive 159 obliges all member states to operate a system of selective incentives to farms suitable for development.  The Government's decision to suspend capital grants for farm buildings and fixed assets and to terminate grants for mobile equipment, farm accounts and the beef and sheep guidance premium effectively leaves farmers without any modernisation scheme as required under Directive 159.</P>
    <P>The EEC Commission, contrary to what the Minister claimed in the House, requested an explanation from the Government regarding the suspension of the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  Furthermore, the Government in the last few days sent a memorandum which was accompanied by a belated request for derogation.  The Commission have informed the Government that this matter will be discussed by the standing committee on structures in the European Commission, whose job it is to decide &mdash; the Minister should know this &mdash; if the decision taken by the Government was in conformity with the legislative framework within Directive 159.  I understand that the Commission are taking a very <Col N="756" /> dim view of the Government's action and may seek to restore the scheme in its original form.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise how the Minister for Agriculture misled the House yesterday evening.  I want it written into the record of the House that if this is the approach of the Minister for Agriculture, either through lack of knowledge of his portfolio or through deliberately misleading the House, I am afraid it is a sorry day for Irish agriculture that this Minister was appointed.  From what I know and hear I may be enlarging on what I have to say about him in due course.  This may be only the tip of the iceberg as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>I criticised yesterday and there is no point in doing that without giving an alternative.  My colleagues have also given alternatives.  How can our farmers face the future with confidence when the Government, who are cobbled together, are deserting rural Ireland?  This has been proved time and time again by the discontinuance of the various schemes which have been outlined.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil are returned to Government we will create a favourable environment for the development of agriculture &mdash; we were doing that when we left office in December &mdash; by lowering inflation and bringing down interest rates.  We will expand the national breeding herd by arranging a £100 million Euro-loan at low interest rates.  This was abolished by the Coalition Government. We will restore the Farm Modernisation Scheme, as we have already outlined.  We will increase the financial allocation to ACOT to enable them to support the development of agriculture leading to exports and increased jobs.</P>
    <P>I feel, with so much unemployment at the present time, that the only hope and the only way we can reduce unemployment figures, is to create jobs allied to agriculture.  As spokesman for agriculture for our party, I will be working on that.  When we have the next election we will have our policies outlined with regard to job creation in other industries based on agriculture.</P>
    <P>We will steadfastly resist any undermining of the basic principles of the Common <Col N="757" /> Agriculture Policy when we are back in office.  I have no confidence in the Minister for Agriculture resisting any such undermining.  Our record in Brussels, notwithstanding what the Minister of State said, was an excellent one.  We know Brussels is a tough bargaining place and our achievements have been noteworthy indeed.  There seems to be a belittling by the Government of the contributions of farmers to the national <Col N="758" /> economy.  Let this message go forth from here to all those directly or indirectly involved in farming: do not lose heart; we will shortly return to Government and will lose no time restoring confidence to the industry.  We will bring back the day when once again farming will be an acceptable career.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate . - Finglas (Dublin) Bus Vandalism .</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: I wish to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. With your permission, I would like to allow Deputy Tunney a few minutes to express his views also.</P>
      <P>For the third time in the past year, the Finglas area is without a bus service after seven o'clock in the evening due to the activities of mindless vandals.  Finglas is a very large, working class area and many people depend totally on public transport for getting to and from work and social venues.  The withdrawal of services is, therefore, causing considerable hardship to many people, especially shift workers, the disabled and the elderly.</P>
      <P>I spoke yesterday to a constituent who is visually impaired, and that person's activity is seriously restricted because of the lack of public transport.  He is forced to use taxis at night for essential trips into town.  He, understandably, is very annoyed and is demanding immediate, severe action against the vandals in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incident which led to the withdrawal of services on this occasion started with the burning of a car on Sunday night last.  A bus arrived on the scene, had to mount the path to try to get past the burning car, got stuck and was then systematically wrecked by a gang of youths with stones and concrete blocks, terrorising <Col N="761" /> the crew and injuring one of them in the process.  The crew decided to withdraw services after 7 p.m. from areas outside Finglas village as they considered their job did not warrant a risk to their lives and limbs, nor to those of their passengers.</P>
    <P>I have every sympathy with these bus workers.  They are poorly paid, work under appalling conditions and have to take all kinds of abuse from the public for the poor standards of service over which they have no control.  It is obviously outrageous that they should be subject to such physical attacks as occurred on Sunday night last.  I cannot blame them for believing that the protection which they were promised when they last restored full services had failed them.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Garda in the area have done everything humanly possible within the resources at their disposal to provide adequate control in the area, and there has been an improvement in the position there over recent months.  Having said that, it is obvious that the police resources are not adequate at present to cover an area as large as Finglas, which has a population in the neighbourhood of 50,000 and which stretches 10 miles out to the border of Ashbourne.  I emphasise also that only a tiny minority in the Finglas area, as in other areas of the city, engage in this type of attack.  The vast majority of the people of Finglas, young and old, would be a credit to any city or town.  They are concerned primarily about rearing their children and providing a proper environment for themselves and their families.  They deplore what has happened, not only because of the withdrawal of bus services but because of the damage it does to their own area and their efforts to raise their families in peace and dignity.</P>
    <P>A major contributing factor to the problem in the area is the misuse of alcohol and in particular the ease with which young people can get their hands on cider, which appears to be freely available in off-licences on the borders of the area.  These off-licences are selling it either directly or indirectly to under-age youths.  It is clear that the licensing laws must be changed to prevent this kind of <Col N="762" /> abuse, and I ask the Minister to indicate in his reply what plans he has to deal with that aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>Society in general and this House in particular must share some of the blame for the juvenile crime and vandalism. Many of those involved in this sort of activity come from homes which have severe social problems, and it would be pointless, as some people have done, to demand that the parents in this situation should be held responsible under the law. Obviously, parents have responsibility, but to hold them responsible under the law when such a course would not prevent the kids from going out on the streets again the next night or the night after, and to take them out of the home and lock them up simply would aggravate the problem even further.</P>
    <P>Again, it is the responsibility of this House.  The Government have today put through a Social Welfare Bill which will aggravate the problem faced by these disadvantaged families.  The education cuts which this Government have introduced which reduce the number of remedial teachers and guidance councillors will hit particularly hard at the working class areas such as Finglas.  It is also hitting at these disadvantaged families and will bring more and more vandals on to our streets in the long run.  The present Government and previous Governments have continually paid lip service to disadvantaged children, and while we have a very fine report of the task force on child care it seems to be gathering dust on some Department shelf.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I would make the point that the problem is not simply a matter of rounding up kids and trying to ensure that they are not on the streets and locking them up.  It is much deeper than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister will realise that an immediate step must be taken to control in some way the availability of cider to these youths, and to provide additional resources also to enable the Garda to provide adequate protection for <Col N="763" /> bus routes.  If he has any influence with the Minister for Transport I ask him to ensure that the bus workers who have been trying to get an insurance scheme established for injuries during work will see such a scheme introduced as quickly as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>: I did not hear the word &ldquo;less&rdquo;.  I will confine myself to two minutes. I am thankful for the opportunity given to me to associate myself with what Deputy De Rossa has said in respect of this appalling situation where a small band of thugs, who were not necessarily from the area, are depriving the good, tax-paying people of Finglas of a service which is theirs.  I said at a public meeting recently that as far as I am concerned the buses belong not to CIE or to the Government but to the people who directly and indirectly are paying for this service.  There is an obligation on CIE and on legislation to provide this service. If CIE feel inhibited they are obliged to call in any other State services so that it will be provided and the people who have no other means of transport to take them to their work, often shift work as Deputy De Rossa said, have the service to which they are entitled.  It is not an excuse to say because of this or something else that the people themselves do not control this. They pay in taxation for the protection which must be afforded.  The time is not available to me to do any more than say how happy I am that the matter has been raised here.  I anticipate that my colleagues, Deputy Flaherty and Deputy Michael Barrett are equally concerned about this and would plead with the Minister to restore the service to the people of Finglas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are all in agreement about the seriousness of this problem, which has two or three sides, most of which have been aired already.  Some of them are within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Justice and we hope he will reply to those.  The problem relates to a small group of people who are affecting the quality of life of a very large group of people, and the control and management of these is directly the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  Apart from that there is the problem of an insurance scheme for the workers in CIE.  We urge the Minister to do what he can in Cabinet and in his own area to see that these problems are resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): First of all I would like to reply to the points raised by Deputy De Rossa in the private notice question which gave rise to this debate on the Adjournment.  I have received a preliminary report from the Garda authorities on this matter.  I have been informed that on Sunday night last, 20 March, a bus was stoned in the Plunkett Green-Barry Avenue area.  On Monday, 21 March a Garda inspector attended a meeting at Broadstone CIE depot with union officials and the CIE district manager. Assurances were given that Garda assistance would be provided for the bus crews.  Notwithstanding these assurances, however, the buses did not run. The Garda inspector has made a number of suggestions to the CIE management about variations in bus routes and I understand that these are being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the concern of the Deputies who have raised the matter here tonight.  Deputy De Rossa made three points.  First he commented on the task <Col N="765" /> force report.  The Deputy probably knows that the Minister for Health is preparing proposals for legislation based on the task force report on child care services.  The second point he made was on the availability of cider to young people.  This would concern me deeply. It is not confined to Finglas, and I will be looking at that problem in a wider context. Otherwise all I can say is that this kind of incident is to be deplored by all of us.  I assure the Deputies and the <Col N="766" /> House that the Garda will co-operate in full to provide the service necessary to defend life and limb and to protect the bus crews as they have already offered, and to protect other people also naturally, including passengers in the buses who would be very concerned about this. I am glad to have had the opportunity to say these few words.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24 March 1983.</P>

      <P>: On 28 September 1982 the Department of Education indicated to the Commissioners of Public Works that it had decided that a new school should be provided at Killeigh, County Offaly, and that the manager of the school should be allowed to engage his own Architect to prepare the plans for the project.  Subsequently, the Department informed the commissioners that the manager was not in a position to appoint an architect and it accordingly became necessary for the commissioners to handle the case.  The site for the proposed new school has been surveyed but because of the large number of cases on hands it has not yet been possible to commence the preparation of sketch plans.  It is hoped to do this in about a month's time.  It is too early to say when building work will commence.</P>

      <P>: The proposal to extend Cloghan national school, County Offaly, was first raised by the Department of Education in April 1980.  Sketch plans were completed by the Office of Public Works in September 1980 and the Department of Education sanctioned a grant towards the cost of the project in December 1981.  Because of the large number of schools projects at various stages of planning it was not possible to commence preparation of contract documents at that point.  The contract documents have been completed and the approval of the Department of Education to the invitation of tenders is awaited.  It is too early to say when building work will commence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The transfer of responsibility did not result in any administrative changes apart from the fact that the staff assigned to the <Col N="643" /> board now has accountability to the Department of Health rather than to the Department of Justice.  Under the arrangements made by the two Departments, after consultations with the staffs involved, both the administrative staff and the social work staff assigned to the board will remain seconded by the Department of Justice for a period of two years from the date of transfer of responsibility. After that the individuals concerned will have the choice of transferring to the Department of Health or of remaining with the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>As regards specialist training, new members of the administrative staff receive on-the-job training under the supervision of the registrar.  The board's social workers also receive on-the-job training and instruction on appointment from the board's senior social worker.  In addition they are facilitated in attending relevant specialisation courses and seminars. Such facilities are also open to adoption workers and social workers attached to adoption societies and health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: The following table shows the number of persons on the live register at the end of December for each year from 1956 to 1982 inclusive.  it must be borne in mind that changes made in the administration of the social welfare regulations and other changes in the coverage <Col N="646" /> of the live register affect the comparability of these figures over time.  The following are the principal considerations which should be noted in this regard.</P>
      <P>1.  The figures for the period from 1966 to 1982 inclusive exclude persons on systematic short-time and persons aged 65 years and over &mdash; thus providing, in this sense, a series consistent with the revised coverage of the live register as introduced in January 1980.  Such person are included in the figures for earlier years.</P>
      <P>2.  The conditions under which persons are eligible for social insurance cover have been changed from time to time.</P>
      <P>3.  Following the introduction of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1965, smallholders were excluded from the live register as from January 1966.</P>
      <P>4.  The conditions which applied to single women and widows who were applicants for unemployment assistance were relaxed as from 1 October 1978.</P>

Before a division of the commonage could take place, acquisition of the property would be necessary.  In this context it is considered likely that difficulties in relation to price would arise.  Moreover, it is felt that, when a settlement had been reached with the person referred to in respect of the grazing rights held by him, the area available for afforestation would not warrant acquisition.</P>

      <P>: I am informed by CIE that, in view of local protest action in 1982 which led to a complete stoppage of work, they are reviewing, in consultation with the Office of Public Works and Wexford County Council, the previous method of excavating sand on the East Beach at Rosslare Harbour by earth-moving equipment and transporting it by road to Rosslare Strand.</P>
      <P>CIE have under consideration proposals to dredge 120,000 cubic metres (180,000 tonnes) of material at Rosslare Harbour using a trailing suction dredging vessel.  It is intended that the dredged material will be dumpted inshore from where it will be moved onto the strand by tidal action.</P>
      <P>The new method of operation will eliminate the use of lorries and mechanical diggers on the beach.  This, I understand, is the most efficient means of providing material to the strand and it will not interfere with the amenities enjoyed at either the beach or at Rosslare Strand.</P>
      <P>Arising from the introduction of new methods of operation, it has been necessary to postpone commencement of the work to May 1983.  The work will take about six weeks to complete.</P>

A maternity grant was issued on 12 January 1983.

He is accordingly entitled to unemployment benefit at the reduced rate of £48.80 and weekly payments at this rate are being made to him as they become due.  He is not entitled to pay-related benefit with his flat-rate unemployment benefit by reason of having no reckonable earnings during the income tax period 6 April 1980 to 5 April 1981 which governs his entitlement to pay-related benefit.</P>

      <P>: The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 14 January 1983 and his claim was allowed at the maximum rate payable to him £31.65.  Weekly payments are being made to him as they become due.  He is not however entitled to pay-related benefit with his flat rate unemployment benefit as he had no reckonable earnings during the relevant income tax period 6 April 1981 to 5 April 1982.</P>
      <P>It is presumed that the reference to arrears relates to his entitlement to pay-related benefit with his previous unemployment benefit claim during the period 1 November 1980 to 2 February 1982. During this period he was asked on numerous occasions to furnish details of his earnings during the relevant income tax period 6 April 1978 to 5 April 1979 but he failed to do so.  In the absence of information about his reckonable earnings his entitlement to pay-related benefit could not be determined.</P>
      <P>It has however been ascertained that his employer during the period 6 April 1978 to 5 April 1979 is no longer in business and that his present location is not known.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">

      <P>: The person concerned received the maximum amount of unemployment benefit to which he was entitled when he received 390 days benefit on 12 November 1981.  He then claimed unemployment assistance and his claim was allowed at the rate of £18.90 being the maximum rate in his case of £20.35 less means £1.45 derived from the value of board and lodging on his parents holding.</P>
      <P>However his claim was later disallowed from 28 July 1982 to 29 November 1982 on the grounds that he was not genuinely seeking work and this decision was upheld by an appeals officer.  It was subsequently learned that he was a smallholder and the disallowance of his claim will now be reviewed by an appeals officer. In the meantime his claim has been allowed from 30 November 1982.  He is being paid at the rate of £4.80 weekly being the appropriate maximum rate in his case of £17.80 less means £13.00 derived from the notional value of his holding.

      <P>: The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit at the weekly rate of £73.85 on the basis of 46 contributions in the contribution year 6 April 1980 to 5 April 1981.  Combined payments of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit may not exceed 85 per cent of a person's average net weekly earnings in the period from 6 April up to the date of claim and on the basis of his income tax form P.45, the 85 per cent limit was calculated at £63.48 a week in his case.  As the amount of his unemployment <Col N="670" /> benefit exceeded this figure pay-related benefit was not payable.</P>
      <P>However, it has now been established that he had been in receipt of disability benefit, including pay-related benefit, amounting to £589.19 during the relevant period, which he had not mentioned when making his unemployment benefit claim.  His 85 per cent limit has accordingly been recalculated at £77.40 and he is therefore entitled to pay-related benefit of £3.55 a week, bringing his combined entitlements to £77.40 a week.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been made to pay all arrears due to him this week.</P>
