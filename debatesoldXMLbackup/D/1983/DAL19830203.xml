      <P>The Referendum (Amendment) Bill, 1982, was introduced before the last Dáil fell and the Bill fell with it when it was on the Order <Col N="1010" /> Paper for the Order for Second Stage.

    <Title>Dáil Reform: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann resolves that its procedures should be reformed to improve efficiency and its control over the public finances.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Industry and Energy.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment yesterday I was expressing my thanks and satisfaction to the Minister for allowing this debate to take place.  It is a very <Col N="1012" /> important debate for this House, as indicated by the fact that so many people have spoken and that many more wish to contribute.  It gives an opportunity to new Deputies like myself to outline the experiences we have had so far in the House and how beneficial reform could be introduced.  I worry, as a new Deputy, about Deputies who are satisfied with the running and the performance of the Dáil. Some Deputies seem perfectly happy at their elevation to the status of TD. Others are happy to toil away at insignificant tasks in substandard accommodation and only enter this Chamber at voting time.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say I detect among my colleagues a new breed of Deputy who is not overcome by his new-found status, who is not on an ego trip, who has entered this House with serious intent, who wishes to make a contribution to improve the quality of life and who is not satisfied merely to attend and become lobby fodder for those few who see their role as holding down ministries and positions of responsibility.  However, if Deputies are not given the chance and if they are not invited and encouraged to participate, they will try to change the system and, if they are unsuccessful and beaten by it, they cannot in honour continue to be a member of this assembly.</P>
      <P>I refrain from describing it as an august assembly, although I am sure it is that, because I must admit I am less than impressed by what I have seen of the workings of the Oireachtas since I came here.  Like previous speakers, I discovered the loneliness and frustration of wandering aimlessly around this House having been chaired into it and then dropped to fend for myself.  The first task was to find a desk and a quite corner but this is not to be found because the accommodation is primitive, as other speakers have pointed out.  It resembles a slum, with conditions that would not be tolerated in private industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This leaves me to question the work rate that can be achieved by Deputies who have to work under these conditions. I have had some experience in the industrial engineering field.  It is my belief that our work rate will be affected when one <Col N="1013" /> has to share a room with ten people and with the noise of five or six typewriters banging around one's ears.  The rooms in question are suitable for two people.  It is obvious that the work rate must decrease in such conditions.  It also gives rise to unnecessary tension in the people who have to work in such conditions.</P>
    <P>I should have thought it essential for a legislator to have a quiet place to study and to think about what we are trying to do here.  Instead of that the day is filled with frenetic activity and much of the time is spent in trying to tackle hundreds of menial tasks that are not relevant to this Assembly.  My good cheer falters at the lifts when I contemplate the rabbit-warren conditions that await me on the third floor.  The offices are so overcrowded one cannot have a private conversation or interview a constituent privately. There are junior people in industry and in the civil service who have offices for themselves.  When one has occasion to visit them one is shown into an ante-room and then into the private office of the official concerned.  Some comparison must be made with the position of a Deputy and that of a professional person in industry or in the professions and one must come to the conclusion that a Deputy ranks at least in the position of a bank executive or a middle line manager in industry who would have private quarters in which to work.  I hope that the Deputies on both sides of the House who have complained about this will continue to do so until we get proper accommodation.  I do not know how we can work efficiently in present conditions. It is a reflection on all of us that we put up with such conditions which we know would not be tolerated outside. How can efficiency prevail when one is working in such conditions?</P>
    <P>The fact that we are politicians probably goes some way towards explaining the lack of assistance one receives in the beginning from one's colleagues and competitors and the subsequent stand-offishness. This compels one to become an achiever and it demands that we be given the opportunity to achieve.  I am glad this debate is taking place because it is a new beginning, as it were.  It is <Col N="1014" /> throwing down the gauntlet and there are many Deputies willing to pick it up.  If the economy is in a mess, is it not our duty to apply all our energy, talent and time to putting it right?  Is that not the reason for which we were elected?  Are we not legislators?  Why then are 90 per cent of Members of this Parliament beavering away in atrocious conditions at menial tasks that could be handled more effectively had we the courage and imagination to do so, instead of being over-protective with regard to our seats.  I am talking about tasks such as fixing street lights, contacting corporation and county council officials, dealing with all kinds of applications from licences to social welfare applications, removing abandoned cars and having roads swept.  We are doing these jobs instead of dealing with the most vital task facing the country, finding a solution of our economic ills.  It would be fruitless for me to call on Deputies in the offices upstairs and ask them to come into this Chamber to tackle this task because the Dáil is so badly in need of reform.</P>
    <P>I agree with a previous speaker, Deputy O'Malley, who said there would have to be a radical change in the system of election to release Deputies from doing so much mundane constituency work.  None of us objects to doing this work and to helping out our fellow men but we must remember why we were elected to the House and what we have been asked to do.  To me it more resembles a county council but without the power of a council.  That task is left to 10 per cent of Members who work exclusively on it to the exclusion of the rest of us except when we walk through the lobbies when directed to do so.</P>
    <P>This debate is about the total involvement of the elected representatives of the people, each one selected by his or her constituency and capable of doing the job.  If not he or she should be voted out &mdash; and I include myself in that &mdash; except in certain cases when a person is voted in on party lines and the Deputy does not measure up to the standards.  The county councillors and corporation members should remain as such but Members of the national Parliament should spend the <Col N="1015" /> bulk of their time as legislators.  The standards of county councillors and corporation members &mdash; I can speak only for Dublin in this instance &mdash; is not high enough for this House.  In fact, on reading of the decisions that have been made by Dublin County Council in the last few years one could not be happy with the results.  They have destroyed the county from Ballycullen to Baldoyle and from Cooldrinagh to Swords.  This message in regard to the involvement of a Deputy at county council, corporation and national level must be put across to the people and explanation given as to what exactly our time is devoted to.  There would be a general acceptance of the proper role of the TD were it so explained, and the assurance that we wish to devote our time to doing the task for which we are elected would be received well.</P>
    <P>There are Deputies who devote their time exclusively to county council and corporation problems and come into this Chamber only to vote.  Democracy of its nature produces mediocre parliamentarians. I have noticed however that in recent elections the people have been more selective in their choice of Deputies &mdash; not necessarily in their selection of me.  They have given a message to us in this selection.  They recognise the role and the problems and they are telling us to apply ourselves more seriously to our work.</P>
    <P>If one's objective is not to become a Minister, is it one's fate as a backbencher to fade away?  Shortly after I came into the House a very large stride had been taken which I was not able to appreciate because I had not been here before then. They appointed one secretary per Deputy.  As the secretaries were being selected I was handed a few applications and at the bottom of one of them was a note which said &ldquo;Secretary suitable for BB&rdquo;.  When I inquired about that I was told the person was selected on the basis that all a backbencher would require would be a typist.  Therefore, it was a commentary on one's future as a backbencher. That little incident speaks volumes for me because it is the role that is accepted for the backbenchers.  I will say <Col N="1016" /> more about that later, but I believe that it is necessary to involve the backbencher more in the workings of the Dáil and not just to take him for granted to be called in when the gong goes to walk through the lobbies.</P>
    <P>In the selection of a Cabinet many considerations must be taken into account, not the least of which &mdash; understandable nevertheless if the people react to it &mdash; is the geographical spread.  Consequently, many able persons are excluded from Cabinet and Minister of State rank.  It is possible, therefore, to have a person in a particular position who is not exactly the right choice, and I am not referring to the make-up of any Cabinet present or past.  In addition, the experience brought to such a post may not be adequate.  Sometimes what in effect is the equivalent of a multinational organisation with a multi-million pounds budget is handed to a Deputy with little or no experience in that field so that he becomes either a captive of the civil service or ineffective in his position and certainly no innovator, being unable to stamp his role on the position.  Therefore, should other able backbenchers be excluded from participation, responsibility and involvement?  If the talent is there, for heaven's sake use it.  We are not all on ego trips and the title of Minister or Minister of State is not an essential prerequisite for us to want to do that for which we were elected.  I could not help noticing on the recent appointments of Ministers of State that most of those selected were of a high standard and, delighted as I was at that, I was reminded of the examination results board at the university.  There would be a crowd around it and you would see some people jumping for joy and whooping it up but not sparing a thought for other people around the board who probably had failed their examinations.  I am pointing out the importance of not taking people for granted.  We know that the system is not perfect, and it is essential that we be given an opportunity to contribute and become involved.  By proper reform it is possible to make fuller and more effective use of the time and talents of elected representatives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> Perhaps consideration should be given to the use of backbenchers in Ministerial Departments which could be subdivided and under the control of a Minister.  Essentially we want to contribute.  I want to contribute and I will not be happy if I cannot do so.  Let me contribute.  By reforming this archaic, lack-lustre and inefficient Dáil we would be able to achieve that.  Most of all, communication between Ministers and Deputies needs improvement.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to the means of improvement in this House. Some people have suggested that the time limit for speaking should be examined. We know and it has been admitted that Deputies sometimes are asked to go in to a debate and speak for 30 or 40 minutes or an hour to keep it going.  At times they have to waffle in order to do that.  We should reach the point where one can stand up, say what is to be said and sit down.  In that way more Deputies would participate and more would be present during debates.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the Dáil could not be more businesslike.  We have objectives and the sooner they are reached the sooner the problems of our beleaguered people can be solved.  We have a duty to improve efficiency so that we can more easily help the unemployed, the poor, the sick, our youth, the old and the lonely.  Deputies should speak out more freely.  We have already seen that during this Dáil.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the Dáil and its environs that need to be changed. Take, for example, school visits to Leinster House.  It is bad enough when children from Dublin schools visit Leinster House but I often see buses outside the House with children from country schools who possibly expect great things from the House and expect to be impressed by it. Possibly they expect to go away having learned from what goes on here, having learned something of the history of the House and those who worked here before us.  I am sure they all go away with a bad impression because there are no visual or audio aids to describe the Dáil and its history.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> The tour for schoolchildren is very restricted.  They usually visit the Seanad which has a roomful of chairs with standing microphones inviting all the Senators to the use of backbenchers in ministerial through the picture gallery with its line of small out-of-proportion cheap prints. There is not a painting in sight of living artists who are on the breadline.  They then go through this botched and very ordinary Leinster House to this almost empty Chamber or pit as it has been described in the press.  Visitors can neither see nor hear properly.  This is an embarrassing impression to give schoolchildren although it is probably a true impression at the moment.  I hope with the reforms that will be introduced, we will also look at that aspect of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The House is full of Malton prints, busts and paintings of dead men.  If some of them do not haunt you their executioners by the brush will.  The Dáil Chamber and the environs of Leinster House have many corridors, the so-called corridors of power, where most of the plotting, scheming, knifing, chatting and congratulating takes place.  There must be about 100 yards of corridors.  The gallery adjoining this Chamber is devoted to former Taoisigh.  There are approximately five there at the moment.  If this trend continues I reckon that with one portrait per Taoiseach if each lasts the full term of five years and if each portrait is one yard wide it will take 100 to fill the corridors. It will take about 500 years to complete.  What a dull place we would have then.  It might be called &ldquo;Teach na ndaoine marbh&rdquo;, or something like that. Who would dare walk its corridors then with all those accusing eyes watching?</P>
    <P>What is wrong with the living?  The kind of set-up we have, with all the people in the portraits in their dull grey or blue suits, along the walls of the corridors, could be enlivened with a sprinkling of colourful art such as that from the current Project Arts Centre travelling exhibition with a Brian Burke &ldquo;Self-portrait with Crown&rdquo;, a Michael Mulcahy or a Charlie Cullen landscape, a Mick Cullen or Patrick Graham.  How interesting to relate in such a situation how you plotted to overthrow your leader under <Col N="1019" /> the watchful eye of Paul Funge gazing out of his landscape in disguise with cap and glasses over the title &ldquo;What do you spy, Mr. Funge?&rdquo; loaned for the occasion by CJH or under a Michael Kane lino-cut of the &ldquo;Butchers&rdquo; or it could be &ldquo;How I installed the Leader&rdquo; under his wall-hanging of &ldquo;The Dove&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Why do we not have hanging in the offices and corridors works of living artists to relieve the dreariness of the long hours spent in this House, works which could instil reflective thoughts on the commentry of our existence by those whose life and work are devoted to maintaining our culture and who are best able to comment on our society.  Instead of saying, for example, that your room is number 352 it could be described as the door beside Nano Reid's &ldquo;The Haggard&rdquo;, or a Nora McGuinness, a Gerard Dillon or beside Michael Kane's &ldquo;Head of Koposchka&rdquo;.  Why is not every school a rotating exhibition?  Why do we not have works of our living artists hanging in the corridors so that our young people can learn to appreciate works of art while they are still young?  When they grew up they would then be able to follow the careers of our living artists.  It would be a good thing to be able to recognise a living artist on the streets of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway or even in Connemara and then later on to seek out that person's exhibition and see what progress he or she has made.  We might then end up with works of art in our houses.  Very few houses have any original works of art.  Why should we leave all the adulattion to the rock stars?  Our youth have not been shown the way to do that.</P>
    <P>How many architects, for example, work in the Office of Public Works?  I believe approximately 150.  At a conservative salary of £15,000 each that amounts to approximately £2,500,000 a year.  How many artists work in the Board of Works? The answer is none.  How much do they earn out of it?  The answer is nothing.  We might ask what justifies 150 architects working in the Board of Works.  What buildings have they produced in the last year or two?  What do they do all day?  In courts in days gone by artists were <Col N="1020" /> appointed, but there are no artists appointed to the court of Leinster House. There is not expended the equivalent of one year's wages on works of art or on the works of any of our living artists.  This House could well do with decoration.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of reform of the Dáil is that of by-elections in the context of the effective use of the time of the House. I am referring to the conduct in the holding of by-elections.  Sadly, we are facing yet another by-election as a result of the untimely death of Deputy Coughlan.  As one in the same age bracket as Deputy Coughlan was, I was greatly shocked by his death.  Deputy Coughlan was very kind to me when I came into this House, as indeed were Deputies on all sides. However, to get back to the question of by-elections, it is the practice of the party whips to order the entire party into the constituency concerned at such a time. They remain encamped there for three to four weeks.  Even worse, the Government send the entire Cabinet to the constituency with the full entourage of State cars leaving the House to continue its deliberations with the help of just a few speakers.  This practice is a betrayal of the trust so far as the electorate are concerned. When we are seeking election we go before the electorate and assure them that if successful in our attempts to be elected we will work diligently and full time on their behalf and will endeavour to sort out the country's problems, but then when a by-election is called we desert this House for three or four weeks.</P>
    <P>I came into this House first as a result of a by-election and I welcomed wholeheartedly every Member who came out to the constituency to help me in my bid for election.  I welcomed them a thousand times.  During a by-election the advantage is said to lie with the party in power in that ministerial authority, in the sense of making things happen for the electorate, is considered to be an advantage.  I was elected on 25 May 1982 and I took my seat on 6 June 1982.  Shortly afterwards there was a by-election in east Galway. This meant that we were ordered to go to that constituency where we remained encamped for the duration of the campaign.  There were few Deputies <Col N="1021" /> left in the Dáil to speak at length about nothing.  Then the House adjourned for the Summer Recess and did not re-assemble until 27 October.  A general election was called in November and the Dáil reassembled for merely two days before adjourning for the Christmas Recess until 26 January.  Therefore, during the period from June 1982 to February 1983, a period of eight months, the House sat for 20 to 25 days.  That sort of situation, coupled with the laborious and outdated procedure of the House and the little opportunity one has to speak, is not good enough.  When one considers that there are 166 Deputies here and that backbenchers must give way to Ministers, one realises how difficult it is for a backbencher to get the opportunity of speaking. Before the last election I recall <i>Magill</i> magazine making what I considered to be an unkind reference to me. This was to the effect that I had not spoken in the Dáil up to then and that I was unlikely ever to get the opportunity again of speaking here.  I am glad that <i>Magill</i>, who should have known better, were proved wrong.  The people who write for that magazine should know more about the workings of this Chamber and, consequently, of the difficulties experienced by backbenchers in even getting the opportunity to speak here.</P>
    <P>One way of dealing with the by-election situation I have referred to would be to hold by-elections when the House is in recess but if, as has been suggested by the Minister, the recesses are shortened, this could be unfair to Deputies in terms of their free time.  But one might ask if anything is fair where politicians are concerned. Anything seems to be good enough for them &mdash; bad accommodation, low wages, long hours and constant and universal abuse.  These are all reasons why it is imperative that the Dáil be reformed.  For a start I should like the by-election abuse that I have referred to to be discontinued.  However, I realise that if by-elections were to be confined to one of the recesses there could be difficulties in the event of the party in power losing their majority but the limiting of speakers' time would help to stem the exodus of Deputies from the House <Col N="1022" /> during a by-election campaign.  If they were allowed to speak for not more than 15 or 20 minutes, many more of them would need to be here.</P>
    <P>In summing up, one might ask how much of a legislator is a Deputy.  Is he merely a rubber stamp?  This is a question that we should examine.  There is not enough input by Deputies so far as Bills are concerned.  The drafting is left to Government Departments.  It has been suggested that better and more fruitful use be made of committees.  There is not much point in extending the committee system if the civil servants finish up doing the work.  Committees should not be used as a substitute for action and responsibility.</P>
    <P>I agree totally with the Minister that the Dáil needs to improve its control of public finances.  I suggest that there be no decisions taken by the State sector before the Dáil makes its decision.</P>
    <P>Regarding the two means by which a Deputy can raise an issue, that is, by way of parliamentary question or the Adjournment Debate, it is ridiculous having to join the cumbersome parliamentary question queue.  While in many cases Deputies are serious in tabling questions, some of the questions asked and discussed are of such a minor nature as to be a waste of the time of the House. Because of the restrictions on backbenchers to participate in the proceedings of the House the parliamentary question is used by them in order to gain publicity and attention.  For that reason alone this is an area that should be looked at.  It is for us to reform the system and to ensure that each of the Members is given a fair opportunity of contributing.  That is why this debate is very important.  There is much talent on both sides of the House. There are many young Deputies who are anxious to do a good job here.  This debate heralds what we all hope will be the beginning of an eventful Dáil.  I look forward to many of the reforms that have been suggested being put into practice.</P>
    <P>Apart from the parliamentary question the backbencher is left with only the Adjournment Debate to raise an important topic.  These facilities should be improved and procedures changed to <Col N="1023" /> allow backbenchers to raise important matters.  The discussion of the Estimates should take place before the moneys are committed or spent and so erase the rubber stamp tag of the Deputy and we should not be used merely to walk through the lobbies.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Fine Gael policy document on the reform of the Dáil of November 1979, compiled by the Minister for Industry and Energy, and look forward to its implementation.</P>

      <P>May I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle and wish him a long and not too demanding or exciting time in the Chair, depending on the behaviour of Deputies?  I welcome this opportunity to speak as a new TD on this very important debate.</P>
      <P>Most of the practical details have been covered by more experienced Deputies and I will learn from what they said when I read the debate.  One of the big problems facing new TDs is Dáil procedure and precedents, which are almost a new language, and place Deputies in very difficult situations.  New Members often feel depressed, disillusioned, useless and ignorant when they first join the Dáil. That can be a great let down after the feeling of euphoria of having been elected after what was in my case and for many other Deputies a long hard struggle to get here.  I agree with Deputy Skelly and others who said that this feeling of disillusionment and uselessness will continue unless we bring this Dáil into the eighties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with great enthusiasm that I welcome the first major debate in this Dáil which is on Dáil reform, but we must all ensure that we do not just stand around, make speeches and then forget about it. We have a responsibility to act on the suggestions being made in this House.  To me Government and democracy are about leadership and authority and people recognising and exercising that role.  There is no sense talking about power being taken from us.  We allow power to be taken from us, and it is up to us to get it back.  We do that by recognising <Col N="1024" /> our authority while giving people their freedom.</P>
    <P>Our greatest problem is one of dependence, in economic terms.  Because of the structure of our society we have a large dependency with regard to the old, the young and a small working population. But there is a much more serious dependency. We have denied people the right to make their own choices and the right to get their own information.  Instead we have given them an intermediary, the TD.  What do we get?  We get rights.  We struggle and give people social welfare payments when they do not have the necessary earning power, but we deny them access to that information and they have to approach their TD.  This takes up a great deal of the TD's time.  What is more damaging is that we do not allow the TD to concentrate on legislation, which is the reason he was elected, and we allow people to believe that rights are privileges.</P>
    <P>If we are to reform the Dáil we must also reform some of our outside establishments. Knowledge is power.  Deny knowledge and people become dependent. Why do we not provide advisory bureaux?  Why do we not allow people to act independently and get the information they are entitled to, whether it be about social welfare, health or education? We do not have a network of health education clinics and there is a total denial of what I see as a right to family planning.  Yet &mdash; and I do not think it is coincidence &mdash; TDs set up clinics enhancing the idea of dependency, of not being in good health psychologically.  The TD finds himself or herself submerged or overwhelmed by queries which should be dealt with by citizens' advice bureaux and by media advertising.  This is one area on which I would like the Dáil to concentrate and allocate a certain sum each year.  It would be the responsibility of the Government to make changes in legislation, social welfare and so on, and the people should not have to depend on their TDs to learn about them.</P>
    <P>In Britain, when radical changes occur in the health or social welfare areas, advertisements are televised &mdash; television being the greatest communicator of all. <Col N="1025" /> People are encouraged to find out their entitlements at their local advice bureau, health or DHSS centres.  I am open to correction, but I have never seen anything as frank and communicative here. There is almost a conspiracy of silence, in the hope that if people do not know about it, they will not claim it.  There is not much point in this House allocating funds to the disadvantaged, disabled and unemployed if they are denied information about their entitlements unless they ask their TDs.</P>
    <P>Our dependency rate is frightening and reform must start here.  If we are elected to lead, to give authority to the decisions made in this House, it is up to us to show that leadership and authority.  This brings me to a point repeatedly made by Members: the psychological damage done to ourselves and to the country in not allowing freedom of choice of voting in the House.  I accept that in established areas of policy such as the budget or where deadlines may be attempted, we need to ask members of the party, in loyalty and agreement, to support a vote.  I cannot understand why it is seen as a great act of disloyalty, disunity, divisiveness, or even threatening the fall of a Government, if Members use intelligence, assessment, judgement and choice in voting daily on issues of legislative changes.  People will not have a feeling of authority as long as they are denied the choice of voting as they think fit, in conscience and in such a way as to reflect the needs of the electorate or their own vision of society. People opt out and the greatest opting out is not having to examine the issues or act according to one's conscience, by saying &ldquo;There is a Whip on&rdquo;.  One has just to go into the right lobby.</P>
    <P>Our Deputies have worked hard and long to be elected and have enough vision and idealism to wish to become elected to this most demanding job.  As well as working hard within the House and outside it, people have to put themselves in the vulnerable and exposed position of campaigning for election every three to four years, or more frequently.  There must be a drive and enthusiasm in politicians which urge them to accept this burden.  They could find an easier, better <Col N="1026" /> paid, safer way of living.  I appeal to the Minister, in reviewing the report of this debate, to give urgent attention to the heartfelt cries from most Deputies who spoke on this area of freedom of choice. As I have explained, my knowledge of the rules and procedures of the House is scanty and I cannot comment on how they should be reformed.  However, in this area, even on an informal basis, there could be a briefing session for new TDs, perhaps in an all-party way.  They should be introduced to the complexities of Question Time, Standing Orders, and the time needed to put down a question.  I have been told by many older and more experienced TDs that it has taken them years to get to know the rules and procedures, mostly learning from their mistakes and embarrassment.  If you enter an organisation or a firm, the first thing someone in personnel does is introduce you to the staff and brief you on procedures, so as to avoid the feeling of foolishness and ineffectiveness.  The more you know about procedures the more effective you become.</P>
    <P>I entirely applaud the use of broadcasting. This would bring a sense of openness and communication to the public about what happens in this House and a great deal of what happens is good and constructive.  Usually, the public only hear about divisions, the in-fighting, the sensational, or the Order of Business at the beginning of the day.  Not only would I welcome radio coverage of the business of the Dáil and Seanad but also of portions of committee business.  The setting up of proposed committees is welcomed by everybody.  The report being presented by a committee could be televised, so that it is being presented not only to the House, but to the electorate who have brought us into the House in the first place.  Certain issues and legislative decisions should also be broadcast or televised. Television is immediate and visual and people can identify with it more quickly than with the radio.</P>
    <P>With regard to getting on with the task for which we have been elected, some days might be set aside on the Order of Business to bring the House together for a report and review of the work started <Col N="1027" /> at the beginning of the Dáil session and of what has and has not been achieved since.  This would mark our progress, highlight what is coming from each working party or committee and, more importantly, remind us of how much remains yet to be achieved and how much more progress has to be made.</P>
    <P>I look forward to working in this House.  It is a privilege to have been elected to it.  The House deserves the respect and pride of the country and it is up to the Deputies to work towards that. We do this by communicating with people, making them feel a part of its procedures and decision making, by removing dependency and giving people access to information regarding their entitlements, without involving TD's. More than anything else we should inspire the young electorate for whom we have to plan and about whom we worry, so that they, in turn, will be encouraged and inspired to want to come into this House.  This need was brought home to me in a startling fashion when a couple of weeks ago I was speaking to a transition class of fifth and sixth year pupils in a comprehensive school about politics, about how vital they were and how important their reform was, so that our youth could feel a part of them.  I told them at the conclusion that I hoped that along the rows of seats I was looking at future TD's and Senators.  I was dismayed to be told quite involuntarily and with no personal hostility &ldquo;Not in this country, we won't&rdquo;.  That is not just sad, but serious. We have the opportunity now, as never before, to redress this situation because we are addressing ourselves as interested and enthusiastic Members to the changes needed.  Let us get down to the business of making these changes and getting this House working for the eighties and nineties of the twentieth century, not the nineteenth century as heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. M. Barrett Mr. M. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I wish to congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on being appointed to his very high office and also the Minister on his appointment. I wish you both well in your offices and <Col N="1028" /> hope that you will enjoy happiness and honour there for a long time.  I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate.  I too am a fairly new Deputy and have experienced great difficulty in extracting information.  I agree fully with Deputy Barnes when she says there should be some briefing sessions for new Deputies.  After all, when one goes into any business or place of employment one is usually shown around and familiarised with their procedures. But it seems that one comes in here absolutely raw and one feels lost for a considerable time.  I would hope that such briefing sessions could be included in the reforms we hope to effect.</P>
      <P>One of the matters that concerns me about procedures in this House is Question Time, to which we devote one hour of our business on each sitting day, which is a very expensive exercise.  I am told that it costs over £100 to have a Deputy's question answered in this House.  It is not good enough when one thinks that if that same Deputy wanted to save the taxpayer that amount he could simply instead write to a Minister or Department to extract that information.  But it seems that this Question Time procedure is engaged in by Deputies in this House in order to get publicity.  On many occasions the same Deputy may have twenty or thirty questions on the Order Paper.  One can readily see the cost to the taxpayer of having those answered whereas that Deputy could easily use the alternative method to which I have referred already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accommodation facilities in this complex of buildings was mentioned here this morning.  I am pleased to say that I belong to a party that went a long way in the past year in alleviating that situation.  I do not complain about accommodation because if there is accommodation in one room in which four or five Deputies can work that is adequate and such is provided.  Also the fact that each Deputy has been provided with a secretary is an enormous advantage because I remember that when I first came here I had to share a secretary with three other Deputies.  We experienced great difficulty at that time getting letters typed or our other work attended to.  Therefore, our secretarial <Col N="1029" /> facilities have been much improved in that respect.</P>
    <P>Much has been said here about Deputies helping constituents.  Irrespective of the criticism laid in that respect I feel that is part and parcel of a Deputy's work. Perhaps if there were greater efficiency in Government Departments Deputies would not be involved in so much of that type of work.  But I would be surprised to hear of any Deputy who would say he was not going to help his constituents in that way.  Indeed if an election was called I should be very interested to see what response such a Deputy would receive from those same constituents.  Some people have contended that Deputies should not be involved in writing to local authorities about abandoned cars on roadsides, about public lighting and so on.  It has been said even we should not help people, particularly the old.  Let us take the case of a woman who loses her husband.  She will be in great distress at the time of his death, does not know where to turn or to get the information she may require in many respects.  If her local Deputy is unable to assist her or is not prepared to do so, to whom does she turn then?  I know it has been the practice of many Deputies to flood certain areas with letters.  This is a practice engaged in continually.  Perhaps it is a practice that should be discontinued.</P>
    <P>I believe also that backbench Deputies should be involved in the workings of the Dáil.  Many of us do not seem to have any role in this respect.  There has been criticism levelled also at the selection of a Cabinet.  I am sure that every Taoiseach appointed does his best to select the best people available to him in this respect. However, in some cases it appears that that does not happen.  For example, geographically a Deputy may be situated in an area that may afford him or her a better chance of being appointed a Cabinet Minister.  In other cases where a Taoiseach may think a certain Deputy would favour him if there was ever a challenge to his leadership, that factor may well enter in also.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the use of State cars.  I understand that the cost of the provision of a State car is over £60,000 <Col N="1030" /> per annum.  How many of them do we have?  For example, all ex-Taoisigh have State cars with two drivers attached to each.  We have established also that the Attorney-General has the facility of a State car, as has the Chief Justice and many other notaries public.  There seems to be no concern expressed here about such cost to the taxpayer.  It may be that we should follow the practice engaged in in England in this respect, where there is a pool of cars which could be used by Ministers and their Ministers of State alike.  Indeed it has not been unheard of for a Minister to cycle to the House of Commons.  But here we continue this practice of providing State cars for individual Ministers while talking about effecting cutbacks.  Very bad example has been shown in this respect by all Governments. The sooner some Government decide to have a pool of State cars, thereby effecting considerable economy, the better.  In saying that I am not advocating that Ministers be paid equivalent expense in the event of the State car being taken from them because I am talking here about the saving of money.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies complain about communication between a Minister and a Deputy.  Even within our own parties, when in Government, we experience great difficulty in this respect.  I contend that no matter what Government are in power Ministers should be prepared to communicate with Deputies on all sides of the House; that is what they are there for.</P>
    <P>I fully agree also with the contention that a time limit be placed on Deputies' speeches.  It is ridiculous that a Deputy is asked to come in and continue to speak, sometimes about nothing, just to keep a debate going.  In this respect greater efficiency of our proceedings would be much welcomed.</P>
    <P>I might mention also the length of time involved in the preparation of legislation. We should endeavour to shorten considerably that preparatory stage.  In this respect I might say that for many years now we have encountered the serious problems of crime, vandalism, bank robberies, house robberies, people being mugged and beaten up until we have <Col N="1031" /> reached the situation in which it is hardly safe to walk our roads.  There appears to be no urgency about the preparation of proper legislation to deal with these criminals and thugs.  It is a free-for-all for them now.  I call on the present Government to speed up the introduction of such legislation so that it may be implemented and act as some deterrent.  The same case might be made in regard to the rules of the road.  For example, there are motor vehicles travelling on our roads that would not be allowed on any road in any other country.  I spoke before in this House, at Question Time, about the difficulty we in Dublin experience in having our motor vehicles taxed, when one may have to queue for two to three hours.  I have raised this matter also with Dublin Corporation but the problem seems to be passed from one to the other without any effective solution emerging.  We should do it through the post office as is done in other countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly said that by-elections should be held during the summer recess. We all have experience of elections and by-elections.  When we moved a writ for a by-election last November the present Taoiseach objected to it and said we could not devote the time of the House to it when we had important matters to discuss.  Yet less than a week later he called a general election.  We were canvassing at a time when the House is normally sitting.  We sat for one day on 14 December and after that did not meet until this year.  The shorter by-elections are the better.  It would be a good idea if they were held at a time when the House was in recess.</P>
    <P>Government Departments at present draft Bills but if Deputies had an input into drafting them and various forms, they might be simplified.  Some forms issued by various Departments are difficult to understand.  I welcome the updating of the rules of the House and hope this Government will not hesitate to bring in reform as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Social Welfare (Mr. F. O'Brien) Fergus O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Social Welfare (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate <Col N="1032" /> you, Sir, on your position as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  From the time you came to the House you were a great person for setting the highest standard and I have no doubt you will bring dignity and honour to the office you hold.</P>
      <P>It is important to have a debate on Dáil reform.  Nothing remains static and that is why we are having this debate.  Deputy Woods was critical of having the debate at this time because of the country's economic problems but if we had debated this topic some years ago we might not have these problems now.  The Minister is deeply committed to Dáil reform and is to be congratulated and complimented on his energy and drive.  We need to look at the procedures and see what changes are necessary.  Some people believe that the Parliament should be streamlined and engaged in churning out Bills.  Reform is not about speeding things up.  Passing legislation is a very responsible task and we must give an opportunity to as many people as possible to contribute to it.  If it takes longer to get Bills through under the new system I would not be unduly worried as long as there was a greater input by Deputies, particularly backbenchers. Sometimes they do not feel part of the legislative system but merely see their role as going through the voting lobbies and then going back to their rooms and getting on with constituency work.</P>
      <P>All Deputies want to play a greater role.  Government backbench Deputies always feel isolated because Ministers and Ministers of State take over the role of projecting the Government.  Backbench Deputies feel that if they are too vocal they may seem to be disloyal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a member of some committees which dealt with legislation, for example, the Misuse of Drugs Bill.  There was great understanding and unanimity among the people on the committees.  Very often this House tends to become political. People get edgy and touchy about their political affiliations and will often disagree for the sake of disagreeing when they know in their heart of hearts that what is being done is correct.  In a committee that attitude does not prevail. That is one advantage of the committee <Col N="1033" /> system.  All Deputies are sincere and want to see reform and play their part.  If we have a series of committees in which Deputies have a role to play and a sense of responsibility they will be keener and more aware and this House will be the better for that.</P>
    <P>I am sure a number of Deputies are not aware of the facilities that are available in the House.  They should be briefed thoroughly, particularly backbenchers, on all legislation and if they are involved in committees there should be briefing sessions on the Bill, the terminology used and the purpose of the Bill.  Armed with that knowledge they would have a greater interest and ensure that at the end of the day we had good solid legislation which would stand up.  As a result it would not be the Government who would put through legislation but rather the House and it would be done in the overall interest of the country rather than in the interest of one or other side of the House. Greater facilities are required for backbench Deputies for research on Bills, Questions and so on.  Researchers should be able to come to party rooms and explain to interested Deputies the fundamentals of a particular Bill.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see experts in various fields or interested people attending committee meetings and taking part in discussions. They would not have any part to play in the voting procedure but the committee would benefit from their expertise.  This would be preferable to the present system whereby written submissions are made and it would be good for democracy.  Let us involve people in the democratic process because the more dialogue there is the more protection there will be for democracy.  Committees should not exclude people who could play a major part simply because they have not been elected to this House.  That would be a very narrow view.</P>
    <P>Opposition front bench spokesmen should have a far better back-up service. A Deputy who becomes a Minister has a Department to advise him but when he finds himself on the Opposition side he is without any back-up facilities.  This is not good for the working of the House <Col N="1034" /> because often a Government are as good as the Opposition.  A hard-working Opposition can keep a Government on their toes and ensure that poor legislation is not pushed through.  It behoves this House to ensure that front bench spokesmen have the back-up service they require.  There is no point in having a one-sided operation.  Obviously it might suit the Government of the day to make things slightly easier for themselves but if we are serious about Dáil reform we must ensure that all Deputies participate to the full.</P>
    <P>Question Time represents a great safety value in the democratic system but it should be used to elicit information on policy rather than to find out when a person will receive benefit or when someone will have a telephone installed.  I am not objecting to these kinds of questions but they should be a last resort when the information cannot be obtained from a Department.  The whole purpose of Question Time should be to keep the Government on their toes and to find out about areas of policy.  We should discourage the use of Question Time as a means of obtaining mundane information from Departments.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should examine the information service provided by Departments to the general public.  If people have a problem there should be a means of getting the information they require. Of course, if the information they get does not suit them they tend to have recourse to the Deputy, who will get the same basic answer.  People should be able to go to offices of Departments where the information sought would be readily obtainable by electronic means.  Easier access to information by the public generally would help to reform this House. People should also be aware of their entitlements and the more knowledge we can pass on the more the Deputy will be relieved of the need to deal with queries. We should look at that area.</P>
    <P>On the suggestion that we should appoint an ombudsman I should like to remind the House that I put forward that proposal in Private Members' Business in 1975.  I accept that at present the economic climate is not good for establishing <Col N="1035" /> such an office but in my view the appointment of an ombudsman is a necessary arm of democracy and is long overdue. Similar appointments have been made in other countries and proved successful.  I do not contend that such a person would solve all our problems but at least those who feel they have an axe to grind would be able to refer their case to such an appointee.  An ombudsman would have access to all files in Government Departments and would be qualified to make a judgment on complaints.  That person would also be in a position to identify many of the problems that have grown up in Departments over the years and could refer to them in the course of an annual report.  An ombudsman could also suggest change in various areas of Departments.  The appointment of such a person should be considered in conjunction with any proposal for Dáil reform because it relates to the getting of information by Deputies.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of broadcasting the proceeding of the House and with the number of pirate radio stations operating throughout the country it should not be difficult to obtain a special frequency for parliamentary broadcasts.  Broadcasting could be done on an experimental basis and in this regard Question Time affords us an ideal opportunity.  People would listen to Question Time.  We should not be afraid of opening up the proceedings of this House to radio because it is important that the public get an opportunity to follow our debates.  Parliament is often under threat from cynics but the broadcasting of our proceedings would kill them off.  The televising of our proceedings might mean that we would have an Abbey Theatre performance, but at least we should experiment.  Major debates or statements should be televised on an experimental basis.</P>
    <P>Private Members' Business works well but it tends to become an occasion for Government-bashing.  Opposition tend to table motions for the purpose of embarrassing the Government and that defeats the purpose of Private Members' Business.  I am not saying that the Government should not be attacked and, <Col N="1036" /> if necessary, exposed; but Members should be given an opportunity of introducing reforming legislation, particularly in regard to our social code, on one day of each week.  That would be good for Parliament and would lead to debate on a wide range of topics.  Such a system operates reasonably well in the British Parliament.  If we introduced it we would stem some of the frustrations of minority groups.  The Government should bear in mind the views of all Members.  We must do what we can to ensure that the House is made more meaningful and opened to the public.  The public must be made aware of what is happening here.  From time to time we are told that parliamentary democracy is under threat, but that would not happen if we opened up our proceedings by way of broadcasting.  A proper committee system would also give backbench Deputies an opportunity to play a greater role in introducing legislation.</P>
    <P>I wish the Leader of the House every success in his efforts to introduce Dáil reform.  I accept that this will not happen overnight, but we must change.  I hope Members are not afraid to change the procedures.  One area that is in need of reform is the Constitution.  There is a great fear about reforming the Constitution and I do not know why.  After a thorough investigation we should make found necessary.  It is time we tackled this matter because there is no doubt that change is necessary.  We cannot hold on to old views because they were found to be good 30 or 40 years ago or because they were held by a certain person.  They are not sacrosanct.  If changes are found necessary we must grasp the nettle and make them.  We can only bring people with us if we reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that throughout the debate, with some pressure from the Whips relieved, the Whips themselves have been coming in for some criticism.  I gather there has been a form of public confession whereby various Deputies have wandered in and explained that from, time to time, they <Col N="1037" /> have been buttoned-holed by the Whips and chased into the Chamber to speak for 40 minutes or whatever time was required to keep going to the next division. I want to assure the House that no such instruction has been issued and, in part for that reason, I propose to be brief. In doing so I am conscious that a number of Deputies have made the point in this debate that the whole structure of our debates, with long set piece contributions, tends to inhibit debate and any genuine exchange of views.  For that reason I propose to put forward some suggestions and in many cases to leave the answers to others.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate to make any contribution without commending the enthusiasm of the person who initiated this debate, the Minister for Industry and Energy, whose enthusiasm in this area will serve us well, I hope, during his period of leadership of the House.  Lest that be seen in any way as being partisan, there is at least one other person who deserves tribute in this area, that is, the Leader of the Opposition, whose performance in this area has been admirable. In my 18 or 20 months in this House I have had a number of roles.  I started as a Government backbencher and then I was an Opposition backbencher.  Then I was on the Opposition front bench and I am now a Minister of State on the Government side of the House.  I have to say that during the eight months we were on the Opposition benches and Deputy Haughey was Taoiseach he showed himself to be open and generous to the Opposition when they requested time for debates on issues such as Poland and the Lebanon.  He facilitated us in making Government time available.  It is fair to say that during that time his Ministers were more open than has always been the case to accepting the validity of Opposition suggestions and amendments to legislation. At a time when perhaps things are not so easy for them, it is not inappropriate that some words of praise and commendation should be put on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us who come into this House find that there are two roles available to us.  One is as a constitutency representa <Col N="1038" /> tive and the other is to participate in a meaningful way in a legislative, deliberative and consultative assembly.  We have to face the fact that in many instances, there is a conflict between those two roles.  Those who apply themselves most assiduously to their legislative role may well find that their performance as a constituency representative suffers.  That conflict is very close to the roots of our problem.</P>
    <P>If that is so, we have to ask ourselves: from whence does that conflict derive?  I suggest that at least part of our problem may stem from our electoral system. Over the years this House has debated the electoral system on more than one occasion.  On more than one occasion the public have been invited to pass judgment. On each occasion the party of which I am a member supported enthusiastically the retention of our present system of proportional representation.  It has to be said that, with all its virtues, that system has contributed in no small measure to the problems we face as a Parliament.</P>
    <P>In our more honest moments all of us admit that at any election there are two contests going on.  There is the contest between the Government and the Opposition and in every party in almost every constituency there are contests, sometimes just as keen, between candidates of the same party.  Every Deputy knows that when he next goes before the electorate, apart from being standard bearer of his party, he will be joined on the ticket by other candidates from his own party.  He knows his seat is as much at risk to them as to anyone from the Opposition benches.  It is that pressure which causes Deputies to get involved in the paper chase which has been so criticised in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>In other jurisdictions a candidate knows he will be his party's standard bearer and thus his prospect of retaining his seat or losing his seat will depend on the esteem in which his party is held at the time.  For that reason, self-interest dictates that his primary involvement over the lifetime of the Government or the Opposition is to contribute to his party's development and to see to it that <Col N="1039" /> his party are held in high regard.  That means that, if he is on the Opposition benches, his role is to see that the Opposition party are regarded by the public as playing a constructive and effective role.</P>
    <P>A Deputy here enjoys no such luxury. Inevitably he is distracted from wider considerations by the harsh reality that when the election comes around others will be standing with him who may be in a position to offer a more immediate track record of service.  If we intend to shift the balance in favour of people acting as effective legislators, we will have to look seriously at the implications of our electoral system and we will have to consider the possibility, however unthinkable, of the single transferable vote or, perhaps, the list system which applies in much of Continental Europe.</P>
    <P>For Deputies who see themselves playing a role as legislators, what options are open to them?  Throughout the debate those who are even remotely happy with the <i>status quo</i> have trotted out the importance of Question Time, this invaluable weapon in the individual Deputy's armoury.  Just how effective is that weapon?  Whole areas of our life are excluded from consideration at Question Time.  For example, it is not possible to raise the day-to-day activities of our semi-State institutions.  Subordinate bodies like the VECs and health boards, which have an enormus impact on our daily lives, do not come under scrutiny at Question Time.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that the apparent ability to raise issues quickly and while they are still topical is frustrated by the sheer volume of questions appearing on the Order Paper.  I recall that in the immediate aftermath of the February election it seemed to me that it would be appropriate to obtain the views of the Government on the whole question of personation.  I tabled a question for what would have been the first sitting day after the change of Government.  I tabled it to the Taoiseach and the Government of the day transferred that question to the Minister for Justice.  From a situation in which it would have been answered on the first day, it would then have been <Col N="1040" /> some months before the Minister for Justice would have been required to answer that question.  Clearly the whole point of putting it down was lost.</P>
    <P>I remember when we were last in Government, for days on end the then Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare came into this House and occupied the entire duration of Question Time answering questions about individual applicants for benefits.  As a result, Question Time was closed to any Deputy wanting to raise issues of importance.</P>
    <P>There has been justification of the manner in which Private Members' time operates.  But let us be honest about this &mdash; there is no such thing as Private Members' time in this House.  The three hours in our week that are so described in Standing Orders are not in fact Private Members' time, they are the property of the main Opposition party or, when Fianna Fáil are in Government, the joint property of the Fine Gael and Labour parties, to be allocated between them. There is no opportunity available to any one Deputy in this House to consider an area that is of particular interest to him and to try to bring forward legislative proposals for reform.  If you take it a step further, the likelihood is that the Government of the day would be less than enthusiastic about any such measures and would regard legislation as being very much their prerogative.  At the moment he never gets that far because there is no opportunity whatever for him to publish his legislation and no time afforded within the weekly business for individual Deputies as distinct from the parties in Opposition.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous that, at present, The Workers' Party do not fit into the schedule and do not have an opportunity to present their proposals to be considered so that the Dáil can decide whether to enact those proposals into legislation.  We must look at that position again.  The first thing we must do is to accept that the parties in Opposition are entitled to time within the time table as of right and that the time made available to them should not impinge on the time that was intended to be the property of individual Deputies.  What happens at <Col N="1041" /> present is that the Opposition parties know they have three hours.  Clearly during that period, or two such periods, they are not going to pass any legislation so they do not even try and the three hours is used simply for a motion condemning some aspect of Government policy.  That is a ludicrous position.  The suggestion that only the Government are in a position to put forward legislation which would be of benefit to the community, inherent in present Standing Orders, is nonsensical and cannot be justified. If we are to be serious about Dáil reform we must give the Opposition parties time as of right and we must give individual Deputies an opportunity to advance their proposals in the form of legislation.</P>
    <P>We wonder sometimes why the Dáil is critised by the public and seen as being irrelevant and why the balance of public attention has shifted towards pressure groups.  Let us consider what the track record is of those who have sought to use this House and the other House to implement reform.  On a whole range of issues that have been debated in every drawing room and discussed in every public house over a decade, as matters of public concern, this House has failed to respond.</P>
    <P>On the hoary chestnut of family planning and contraception, how many years ago is it since the then Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, spoke about the obligations of this House to grasp nettles?  From where did change actually emerge?  This House never even got around to discussing the issue until the Supreme Court took on its responsibilities and struck down the legislation in the 1937 Act. There are other matters in the area of adoption where for years it was known that the inhibition on couples of so-called mixed marriages from adopting was a cause of national scandal.  This House failed to respond and, again, it was left to the courts to intervene.</P>
    <P>Every Member of this House knew that the rent restrictions legislation was operating to create injustice, that the failure to amend it was causing absurd anomalies, but because of the political sensitivity of the issue, nothing was done.  Successive Governments were happy to let the <Col N="1042" /> issue slide and those who had in the first instance come into this House saying that here was a problem that must be acted upon went instead to the courts.  If we are serious about our role we must re-assert that it is to this House that those who seek reform and change must come and that they should look to us as legislators to respond to their needs rather than finding it necessary to create some sort of test case to bring to the courts.  It is interesting that, in so many areas, the first thought of any group seeking reform is not to sponsor a Private Member's Bill or to interest the Government in bringing forward legislation but to see if they can find a suitable applicant who will serve as a plaintiff in a test case.  They will then bring it to the Supreme Court or to the court in Europe.  I have mentioned three or four areas in which that has happened and I could mention another half dozen just as easily, so is it any wonder that the relevance of this House is being called into question?</P>
    <P>If we reform the Dáil, life will be substantially less comfortable for the Government and all Governments must recognise that.  That is the price we pay for making the institutions of democracy relevant and vibrant once more.  There should be no more enthusiastic proponents of reform than those who sit on the Government backbenches and whose role in the legislative system is so peripheral. I recall with some misery the few months we were in Government, between June and February.  On that occasion whenever there was a debate of importance the Government were anxious to get their legislation through and time for debate was naturally limited and curtailed and time for contributions from Government backbenches was the area that was the most available to squeeze. In contrast, if there was a debate in which there was very little interest, the opportunities for contributions were endless. Any effective Dáil reform is of greater benefit to Government backbenchers than to almost anybody else because an involvement with the committee system provides them with an opportunity to participate and to contribute to Government policy of legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> I want to respond to a specific invitation that was put forward by the last speaker, Deputy Fergus O'Brien.  He made the point that if we were to evolve a committee system it should not simply be a committee of parliamentarians and that it was important that those with expertise should have access to those committees.  I want to refer specifically to the Government's commitment to establish an Oireachtas youth affairs consultative committee.  It is the Government's view that all parties in the House would benefit by having direct access to the organised views of young people.  Young people and their youth organisations would benefit from hearing at first hand what our concerns are and what factors inhibit us from responding as promptly as they would wish.  With that in mind it is the intention of the Government to establish a joint Oireachtas committee, drawn from the Dáil and the Seanad, and having substantial youth representation.</P>
    <P>In the course of a speech shortly after my appointment I suggested that youth representation might consist of a number of nominees of the National Youth Council, representatives of USI, young farmer interests and young trade unionists. The speech raised the hackles of Senator Eames who, I understand, is the youth officer of Fianna Fáil.  I think he took that speech as representing the last word on the composition of the committee. I wish to state quite clearly it did nothing of the kind.  If that committee is to function effectively it must have not just the acquiescence but the enthusiastic support of the party opposite.  For my part I would be delighted to consult with the Opposition spokesman in this area on the most appropriate composition of the committee in terms of Oireachtas Members and on what youth interests should be represented and how they should be selected.  This is an area where we see movement taking place as a result of consultation, discussion and agreement rather than on the basis of the Government coming in with a blueprint, saying &ldquo;take it or leave it.&rdquo;  If any part of my speech appeared to give the impression that we pre-designed the composition <Col N="1044" /> without reference to the Opposition, I want to correct that.</P>
    <P>We govern at a time of economic difficulty, when the options available for grandiose schemes involving extra public expenditure are limited in so far as they exist at all.  That imposes a special responsibility on us to reform in those areas. They do not cost money; in fact, savings can be achieved.  The fact that this Dáil is beginning its life by seeing how its own institutions work and how value for money can be obtained and by seeing to what extent we control public expenditure is appropriate and is a happy omen. I congratulate the Minister on his initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>For once I am glad that the complaint we level against so many Dáil debates is one that we can level against this debate, namely, that it seems to be quite interminable.  I am glad so many Deputies have taken the opportunity to express their views on an area that is of vital concern to backbench Deputies such as myself.</P>
      <P>I have been in Dáil Éireann for 18 months but very little of that time has been spent in the House.  Much of the time has been spent canvassing for the several elections that have taken place. It is clear to me that Dáil Éireann as it is organised at present is wasting a good deal of its potential.  There are 166 Deputies but approximately only 30 are involved in decision-making and in legislation to a significant degree.  Opposition spokespersons have a certain amount of involvement, generally directed at harrying the Government, but the average backbencher, particularly on the Government side, experiences considerable frustration because of his or her lack of involvement in what is going on. It is an extraordinary waste of talent.  In every party there is very considerable talent, experience and knowledge but this is not being drawn upon to a significant degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This waste is inexcusable.  It has risen because we have failed to reorganise ourselves and to accept the fact that many politicians are full-time professional politicians. We must also face the fact that <Col N="1045" /> we have a much more complex system of government.  We have talked about reforming many areas of public administration and I am very glad we are starting here.</P>
    <P>The nation pays the salaries of the people who serve in Dáil Éireann.  It is important for the nation that public representatives here be allowed to work and it is also important for the satisfaction of the individuals who have sought election to Dáil Éireann.  As long as the role of Deputy is frustrating we will have more exhibitions of the type we have had in Dáil Éireann over the past months.  In the past years there has been development in the growth of client politics.  The role of a representative is an important one but the situation has developed that Deputies spend 95 per cent of their time in this role with very little time left over.</P>
    <P>This has happened because there was no demand and no opportunity to do otherwise.  If they are to find time for any other worthwhile contribution they must fight against the system.  The average Deputy has very limited influence on serious policy matters or in the administration of the various services.  Consequently, there is a tendency for people who have talent and who have something to contribute to become involved in the kind of destructive activities we have seen around the House where people become unsettled and dissatisfied and spend their time putting down 40 or 50 questions to a Minister.  For many reasons it is important that we tackle the matter of Dáil reform.</P>
    <P>The kind of reform I should like to see is touched on in the document on Dáil reform put forward by the Minister.  It is a very good starting point.  The essential element is the reform of the committee system.  I should like the committee system to shadow all major areas of Government action and policy.  I should like to see Deputies being obliged statutorily to belong to one or two, at the most, committees and I should like the committees to be given power, subject to the authorisation of the Minister, to influence policy formulation and the administration of schemes.</P>
    <P>A matter I consider important is the <Col N="1046" /> authority to have civil servants of all ranks attend at those meetings and they should also have access to the full range of semi-State bodies.  The Minister's document refers to the right to call members of the public, but the biggest difficulty between the backbencher and the Minister, as I know from my experience in both positions, is the lack of access by the Deputy to information about the Department and about schemes on which information is readily available to the Minister or junior Minister.  At present the only form of access is the slow process of letter-writing or the parliamentary question.  This opportunity of having senior civil servants responsible for all major areas of administration and of government in attendance at these meetings as well as Ministers would be an important break-through.  This would not necessarily involve any clash with the overall authority and responsibility of the Minister but the committee would represent a very important sounding board for the development of policy as a support to the Minister.  Such committees could interest themselves in many areas of work.  Obviously the preparation of legislation is the primary function of a legislature, but we also have responsibility for overseeing the general administration of laws that have been passed in the past, of the various systems of education, social welfare, agricultural grants and the full range of Government activities. There is a great deal of scope for the individual Deputies to be involved in an overseeing role in the administration of these schemes.</P>
    <P>The Department I know best is the Department of Social Welfare.  When one attends an ard fheis of a political party or a conference of a social services organisation and then listens to the debates on the Estimates here in the Dáil one hears reiterated the desire to see a great humanising in the whole operation of our social services and their modification and reform, but that task never seems to be done.  People often comment on the atmosphere in unemployment exchanges.  Why are they so bleak, desolate and unappealing, making the already difficult situation of having to <Col N="1047" /> receive unemployment benefit doubly difficult by the circumstances in which they operate?  That sort of problem has been with us for a very long time but somehow with the pressure of urgent business, major legislative changes, Government meetings and involvement in the full range of Government decisions Ministers very often do not get round to handling this detail.  This sort of detailed reform would be particularly suitable for committees, and it would obviously be vital that civil servants of the OPW and the Department of Social Welfare should be involved also.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the recent problems we have had in the dispute in the courts.  It is extraordinary and regrettable that this dispute has continued without a major initiative or change over so many months with all the consequent hardship and difficulty it has caused for many people.  I would envisage that a committee operating in the area of justice and law reform would be able to maintain a regular and constant pressure to ensure that policy proposals emerge and constant initiatives are taken in an attempt to break a deadlock such as that.  We know the kind of crises that emerge in the Department of Justice, especially in recent times, and it is obvious that the time a Minister can give to them is limited.  This level of involvement could easily be transferred to a committee and thus be of value to the system, the Minister and the individual Deputies involved.</P>
    <P>The value of all of these types of development would be extensive.  The first benefit would be that the country would get better value for the Deputies it has in the House and those Deputies would have a more satisfying role.  I have had experience of the committee system on Dublin Corporation and, while Dublin Corporation may be a much maligned body as are many other county councils, for the individual member of that corporation there is, through the committee system and the more limited time spent in general sessions, a genuine opportunity to influence the schemes, to change policy.  Here in this House it is extremely important that such opportunity be given <Col N="1048" /> to Deputies and that the influence, talents, energy and knowledge that they have be brought to bear on the various schemes affecting the lives of people in so many ways.</P>
    <P>The experience at the clinic work which is so much a part of a Deputy's life now and which has become the subject of some debate as to whether it is good or bad &mdash; bad perhaps because it develops dependence on politicians &mdash; has something to be said for it, although as far as possible people should be able to get the services they seek at these clinics without coming to politicians.  However, politicians develop from this a type of expertise in a variety of areas.  They become mini-social workers and mini-legal experts. This talent in a county council can be translated into policy or into modification of existing policies and schemes.  That linking up of experience on the ground, knowledge of individual problems and translating that into modification of existing policies, laws and schemes, does not exist for the person as a Deputy.  If it existed we would have much more constant and rigorous examination of the various schemes that affect the people so much.  I have mentioned social welfare as a suitable example.  I could talk also about education schemes, about the legal system, the whole system of grants and the need for a system of grants in the agricultural area.  All of these could benefit from the individual experience and knowledge of the Deputies and we would have better laws if that experience was being used to modify and develop schemes.</P>
    <P>We would also have the benefit that here in this House when an emergency or difficulty would crop up in an area, instead of the whole House having to stop whatever business would be in progress to discuss the problems of, say, the fuel voucher scheme or because a dispute has arisen in one Department or another, this could be dealt with effectively and with less loss of time to this House if it were dealt with in committee.  Another benefit would be that the Ministers would be less isolated.  They would have an all-party committee on whom to sound out their ideas initially and, because many of the <Col N="1049" /> ideas would be tested by and perhaps even come from that body, fruitless bickering and party political wrangling would be reduced, and that could only redound to the benefit of every Member of this House.  Over the past months our public image has suffered a good deal in the public view that that is what we engage in in Leinster House.  Largely it has become a correct view because of the frustration of the way in which we organise our business.  With more continuity at changeover of Ministers and a greater pool of expertise in the parliamentary body here, all Deputies, through an exchange of ideas with Ministers and civil servants, would have a complete idea of the demands of Government and of administration.  There would be greater coherence, balance and generally a more constructive attitude.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the general points that have been made by many people, the little frustrations, although these may be quite large from time to time.  These arise from the lack of a proper structure that four months after a budget we can still be discussing it.  It is law by then.  One of the greatest shocks of my political arrival here was to find four months after the event we were still discussing it.  Everybody day in and day out made the same points.  There were long-winded speeches repeating what had already been said many times.  It is extraordinary that we have allowed this situation to go on for so long.  We have the typical picture at the moment of the Chamber empty for 90 per cent of the day apart from one or two representatives from each side.  At the moment there are representatives from only one side of the House.</P>
    <P>These sorts of annoyances would be radically altered if we developed a proper committee system.  I envisage in that committee system an important role for the press.  It is important that they are present and that those committees are open to them.  Part of politicians' work is to be seen to be doing the work for the people they are serving.  There would be great benefit in terms of performance and sharpness and by the feeling that they are <Col N="1050" /> the only link with the outside world for much of what we do in the House.  If we develop a new area of significant activity in the committee system it is important that the press are present.  While there are many other areas that have been well covered in the Minister's document on Dáil reform this particular area of the committee system for Deputies, the Minister and the country as a whole, is the most important element as far as I am concerned in relation to Dáil reform.  I wish to see it become a central part of the new reform proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it is particularly appropriate that I make my contribution to this debate because I am the first Cabinet Minister assigned sole responsibility for the public service.  The reason for this is because the Government felt that the question of reform within the public service based on the report headed by Liam Devlin in 1969 had not received as full attention as it should have over the years.  The question of reform of the public service is inextricably linked with reform of the Dáil and its institutions. That is why I feel it is particularly appropriate that at this stage the Dáil should discuss its own reforms so that, in conjunction with whatever new methods of procedure are introduced for the Dáil, we can begin to invite the public service to examine ways in which it also can become more streamlined and efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been impressed since this debate began at the number of Deputies who have taken the time to come in here to make contributions.  I have been particularly impressed by the number of new Deputies who have used the occasion to vent their frustration at the lack of facilities and the conduct of Dáil debates and procedures.  I believe that all Deputies, whenever they became Members, were taken aback at the structures and method of operation.  We have heard those who were elected during the last 18 months express their frustrations.  Those are frustrations which all of us who are longer in this House or the other House have felt at various stages.  It is good, however belatedly, that the Dáil has at long last <Col N="1051" /> faced up to the question of its procedures and operations.  We operate a system here, like many other parliaments, based on the Westminster model.  It is interesting to reflect, when one looks now at how that parliament has been operating in recent years, that it has introduced many reforms of its own which have not been copied here.  We are basically operating in the eighties a system which was devised for Victoria's Westminster and which has not received the attention of this parliament or an examination as to how appropriate it is to the Ireland of the eighties.</P>
    <P>I believe nobody realises better than the Ceann Comhairle how out of date the Standing Orders under which we operate are.  The House has only to look at the small number of occasions and the relatively small number of areas in which amendments have been made to Standing Orders over the last 20 years to realise that a House, which has to undertake the review of legislation, and the very complex rapidly changing nature of our society and our work, could hardly be expected to operate efficiently when the basic guidelines under which it operates should have been allowed to become so completely out of date.  I believe this is accepted by Deputies of all parties.</P>
    <P>I was heartened during the lifetime of the last Dáil when, through my membership of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I found a great willingness by all the members of that committee, representing all the parties in the House, to set about the task of revising Standing Orders and reforming Dáil procedures. The election last November meant that the work done in relation to that by the committee was very small.  However, the discussion in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has been a useful contributor to bringing about this debate.</P>
    <P>It is untenable that matters of really urgent public importance&mdash;I use those words in their real context rather than in the context which the Ceann Comhairle is obliged to apply to them&mdash;which are the issues of the day for the man-in-the-street, issues of concern to large sections of the community, can be talked about at <Col N="1052" /> every crossroads, every work place, in the homes and wherever people gather throughout the country but this parliament is usually the one place where discussion of the matter is prohibited.  If a Deputy puts down a parliamentary question relating to an issue of the day to a Minister who has just finished his turn at answering questions and consequently finds himself back at the end of the list, that precludes all other discussion on the matter until that question is answered.  If it is answered tomorrow or if in the sequence of questions it is not answered for three or four months this House, this Parliament, through its rules, precludes itself from having that matter discussed. That is ludicrous.  There will be many who will say that under Standing Orders there are devices by which matters of urgent public importance may be raised, but previous occupants of the Chair have found themselves spancelled by Standing Orders and, perhaps, more importantly, by the book of rules or precedents as to what constitutes urgent public importance.</P>
    <P>One of the best examples of this predicament that I can recall in recent years was the time of the bitter and protracted dispute involving the postal services. There was much frustration then on the part of all of us because of our inability to raise the matter here.  In the various radio and television programmes when the difficulties being caused by the dispute to the various sectors were being reported, that was sometimes the first item on the news but invariably the second item was that Deputy X or Deputy Y had endeavoured to raise the matter in the Dáil that morning but had been ruled out of order by the Chair on the basis that it was not a matter of urgent public importance.  Could anything have been designed to bring the institution of Parliament and of its members into more disrepute in the eyes of the public than for that situation to have continued for several months?  There must be devised a method whereby matters of that nature can be discussed fully here, the place where they should be discussed.  In that way the public can be confident that when they return Members to the Dáil those <Col N="1053" /> Members have the opportunity to discuss the real problems within the community.</P>
    <P>In relation also to the question of the Order of Business we have seen, in recent years especially, attempts made by Deputies regularly to use the Order of Business in an attempt to raise matters which they cannot raise otherwise.  Clearly, that is wrong within the terms of Standing Orders which should be for the purpose of announcing what the business of the Dáil is to be for the day.  However, when there is no other method open to them people will resort to such devices in an effort to make their point.  Consequently, for some time past, the Order of Business, which some years ago was an item dealt with in one or two minutes, has disintegrated in chaos and a shambles and where very often up to an hour after the Order of Business is announced Members leave the Chamber discontented and with the thought that once again the House has made a show of itself.  That situation must change.  Without intending any disrespect to my colleagues I suspect that the uncertainty of the situation in the last two Dálaí by reason of the constant sword of the possibility of yet another general election hanging over the heads of Members invited them, perhaps even in a subconscious way to get the best possible publicity at what was the best time of day so far as that was concerned.  Undoubtedly whenever there is to be a row or some other excitement in the House, there are most people on the Press Gallery.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Members, very often the row on the Order of Business or the quick sharp exchange is not a reflection of what goes on during the long tough hours of committee work.  It does not reflect the real work that is done in the House during the day.  To some extent also the general public&mdash;I refer to the 99 per cent who do not visit the House regularly&mdash;have a distorted picture of what happens in Parliament. It would not be unfair to suggest that many people think that Members spend the first half of the day arguing about what is to be discussed for that day and the remainder dreaming up sharp questions in an effort to trip Ministers in a series of supplementary questions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> We all know that a lot more than that goes on here but it might be fair to suggest that that is the way in which the business of yesterday is presented in today's media.  In the past year or two I have suspected that the morning radio programme, <i>What it Says in The Papers</i>, is a large contributor to the length of time taken on the Order of Business.  I say this because many Members on their way to Parliament and listening to that programme get the idea that if they could in some way be associated with the items mentioned on the programme for that morning, they would have a chance of mention on the 1.30 news bulletin.  That may be all very well from the point of view of the individual Member but it is no way to run a railroad.  It is certainly no way to run a parliament.</P>
    <P>It was an interesting reflection on the whole question of the Order of Business that during the course of a short debate here some months ago it was suggested that the Order of Business for each day should take place at the cessation of business on the preceding day.  In other words, the business for today would have been ordered at 8.30 p.m. yesterday. That suggestion was put forward, I think, in the belief that at that time of day Deputies might be less acrimonious and less likely to be seeking the full glare and attention of the media than if they were to use the Order of Business in the manner that we have been experiencing.  It would be unfortunate if the House had to resort to that device in order to have its business laid out properly but at the same time I would not rule out such a possibility because Standing Orders for any institution ought to be drawn up on realistic and workable lines, on a pragmatic basis. If there is no way of dealing with the Order of Business other than having it ordered at the conclusion of the preceding day's business, then let us use that device.</P>
    <P>The few words I have said on this matter are really a reflection on a much deeper problem, that is, the belief Deputies have of having no other method whereby they can raise certain items with which they are genuinely concerned. Consequently, whatever changes we may <Col N="1055" /> make in relation to the Order of Business must be accompanied by changes which allow a forum for Members who have genuine complaints to make those complaints in an orderly way at the appropriate time and to allow sufficient time to discuss them.  This is something that we need to give urgent attention to.  In the course of each week there will have to be a time set aside for non-office holders in which they can raise matters which are of genuine concern to the public or in the case of an individual Member matters that are of particular importance to his constituents.</P>
    <P>From time to time in the last number of years it has been suggested that the system of parliamentary questions is both cumbersome and expensive and ought to be either modified radically or eliminated. That is not a suggestion to which I would lend any support.  The system of the parliamentary question constitutes one of the most important and fundamental rights available to a Member of this House, especially for those who are non-office holders.  It is a system that should be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>However, if we look at the Order Paper for any day for the past number of years we find a substantial number of questions being tabled for written reply. Without naming them, there are several Departments which feature more prominently than others in relation to these written questions.  There is only one reason why Members table written questions to certain Departments, and it is a reflection on the administrative efficiency of those Departments.  Over the years Deputies have discovered that in relation to certain items on which they get large volumes of representation, they do not get an adequate service and reply.  In substitution of the system where they write to Department X and receive a reply three to nine months later, they table a written question to the same Department who are obliged under the rules of this House to reply within three sitting days of the Dáil.  That works perfectly &mdash; and I confess to having used that device myself &mdash; but only for as long as the House is sitting.  Once we are into the <Col N="1056" /> recess Members are forced to write to the Departments who are specialists in non-replies.</P>
    <P>When we talk about Dáil reform we ought also to talk about reforming the system whereby Departments provide a service to Deputies.  The reason why the Departments' administrative machinery has apparently come to the point of a virtual breakdown or where they are not in a position to supply the services they are charged by law to provide reflects on Government.  It is better that I do not mention the Departments, but Members know the two Departments which stand out because of the length of time they take to reply and whose list of questions always feature prominently on Dáil Order Papers.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made by the Minister for Industry and Energy some time ago of allowing Members to table questions for written reply during the recess is worthwhile and should be explored.  I am not suggesting it should be introduced merely to allow Deputies to get a reasonably quick reply to their representations on behalf of individuals, but during long recesses when matters of importance and general interest arise, Members should be able to put a question to the Minister responsible and receive a reply from him. It does not appear to present any great administrative difficulty for the House to decide to make that important and small reform.  There may be some resistance to it by the Government of the day but that ought not be a reason why the Dáil should not institute reforms of its own.  The Dáil is the forum whereby elected Members, on behalf of their parties and constituents lay down the rules under which they work, and the rules should be written to facilitate the Members rather than the Government or the civil service.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly support the suggestions that there should be much more use made of the committee system.  It has been very interesting to note the limited use made of that system in the past few years.  The Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies have had spectacular success in reviewing the operations of a number of State-sponsored bodies.  I recall talking to the chief executive of a <Col N="1057" /> body which had been examined by the Oireachtas committee and he spoke about the report they produced.  That State-sponsored body had had a number of reports published on every aspect of its operations over a number of years &mdash; some of them published at enormous expense to the taxpayer by international consultants.  The chief executive said the report published by the Oireachtas committee was the first to show an understanding of the role and function of that organisation and of their difficulties and it was the first report which had made serious, worthwhile and constructive suggestions about how they might operate more efficiently.  In itself that was total justification for the establishment of that committee.</P>
    <P>There is need for a greater number of such committees and they should be allowed to examine specific areas, such as health, education and major Government spending.  The committees should not be used by Members to vent their annoyance because those bodies are not providing a particular service but, more importantly, they should be given the opportunity to sit down and examine the programmes in each service area to decide on the validity or continuation of particular programmes or to decide whether it might be better if the service were scrapped and the resources diverted to another area.  If that happened Members of the Dáil who are not office-holders would get a greater insight into the rationale for having particular services continue in existence and from their local knowledge they would be able to make worthwhile contributions about how these services could be provided most efficiently and with the greatest benefit to their constituents.  This, in turn, would contribute greatly to the adoption of Estimates and the operation of Government in any one year.</P>
    <P>In relation to major legislation in certain areas, I believe there is also great justification for the employment of the committee system to which specialised Bills can be referred.  That has happened to a very limited extent over the last number of years.  You, Sir, were involved in several of those committees and you <Col N="1058" /> will appreciate the worthwhile work that can be done by Members from all sides when they sit down together in committee to constructively examine a Bill.  The committee system would also help the operation of this House because a large part of the time of this Chamber is taken up by Committee Stage debates.  These are also the times when there are fewest Members in the House.  The Minister responsible, the chief Opposition spokesman and maybe one other Member, may be the only people here, painstakingly going through the Bill section by section, line by line, and sometimes comma by comma.</P>
    <P>This is the area which receives least public attention and reporting in the media.  I do not blame the media for that because reporting the Committee Stage of a Bill must be very difficult.  Assuming the Opposition spokesman and the Minister have done their homework and are going through the Bill in detail, the people in the Press Gallery would have great difficulty following the detailed debate and presenting in the following day's newspapers an interesting report of the proceedings.  For that reason, it is appropriate that the Committee Stage of complex Bills be examined through the committee system rather than a committee of the whole House as at present.  If that concept were accepted, some attempt should be made to have a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad rather than have both Houses separately examining a Bill on Committee Stage and in detail.  In any Seanad a large body of expertise is available which would be useful in considering complex legislation under a joint committee system.  This could be examined by the body undertaking reform and the implementation thereof of the procedures of the House.</P>
    <P>Many amendments put forward by Members are rejected by the sponsoring Minister, not always on the basis of their not improving the Bill, or not having substance or validity, but on the basis that the Bill is the Minister's and he will pass it without accepting amendments from anyone since the acceptance of amendments seems to infer that the Bill was faulty at its introduction or that the <Col N="1059" /> item incorporated in the amendment should have been included by the Minister or the civil servants involved.  Nothing is further from the truth.  In many instances, a Bill adequately fulfils the purpose for which it is introduced by the Minister.  However, amendments put forward by Members have the effect either of improving the Bill or in some small way of widening its scope.  It should not be taken as a reflection on a Minister or his Department if amendments from the Opposition are included in the Bill.  I urge on Government and Opposition to accept the principle of amendments being included in Bills where those amendments can clearly be shown to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>On the matter of reform, there has been some talk of extending the sitting hours of the House and operating on the basis of a four-day sitting week.  That may be necessary and ought to be one of the options open.  However, I would be concerned if, in a presentational attempt to introduce reform, the Dáil decided to extend the sitting hours without examining how it spent those hours.  I am not at all convinced that the Dáil needs to sit an extra day a week in order to reform and improve its procedures and get more work done.  It would be regrettable to decide on a permanent four-day week in the belief that this will convince the public that we are working more diligently. We need to examine how we work and how to employ ourselves as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>If a large part of committee time were taken out of the House and referred to special committees of the House, clearly that would leave a considerable amount of additional time for other business more appropriate to the Chamber.  I have already said that a certain amount of time must be set aside each week for the presentation by Private Members of matters of public concern.  Time is needed for this.  There is also need for a specific amount of Private Members' time and by that I do not mean the present system operating for an hour-and-a-half on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, usually followed by the ritual vote at 8.30 p.m. <Col N="1060" /> which is almost always on the ritual Government amendment to the original motion.  When I say &ldquo;Government&rdquo; I am talking about Governments in general and not one Government in particular. Wednesday night ends with the adoption of the bland Government amendment to the almost inevitable implicit criticism in the Private Members' Motion.  We are going through a charade during Private Members' time.  It could not be further from Private Members' time.  The time given that title traditionally over the years is the time allocated by the Government for the main Opposition party to have its weekly attack upon Government policies.  The main Opposition party spend a fair amount of their time working out the areas of maximum political embarrassment to the Government and devising an appropriate motion, so that, as a political party, they can air their grievance, have a vote and hope to embarrass the Government on the Wednesday evening.  That is time allocated, not to Private Members but to political parties.  I am not saying that that time should be done away with or that political parties do not need to have time allocated to them to present their point of view, but individual Private Members of the House should have time allocated to them during which they can table motions or enter legislation in which they have a particular interest.  This system operates in Westminster, basically on the principle that most of Fridays is allocated to any Member of the House who wishes to table and sponsor legislation in which he or she has a particular interest and which is not a matter of pressing concern to the Government who do not undertake to include it in their legislative programme.</P>
    <P>Many Members of this House who spend a considerable length of time here leave the House never having had the opportunity of bringing influence to bear in order to have a Bill covering a particular area in which they have an interest actually sponsored by the Government. Such interests and demands have not been allocated time in the House.  One hesitates to give personal examples but I shall give one to illustrate my point.  For <Col N="1061" /> some reason best known to the author of the legislation, two harbours in my constituency &mdash; Balbriggan and Skerries &mdash; were assigned by legislation to the responsibility of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Whether that board did or did not want control of those two ports, and Bullock Harbour as well at that time, I cannot say.  However, there is nothing surer now than that the Dublin Port and Docks Board want nothing to do with Balbriggan and Skerries harbours.  Also, the fishermen using those harbours will have nothing to do with the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  This is quite understandable because that legislation had enshrined in it &mdash; although one should never include figures in legislation &mdash; that the maximum amount which the board could charge for the use of the harbour was ten shillings per year, which now amounts to 50p per year.  With a fleet of 25 fishing boats operating from Skerries harbour, that does not produce anything like a realistic income from which the Dublin Port and Docks Board can maintain the harbour.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the suggestion was made that the local authority involved might take over responsibility, negotiate proper landing charges and maintain the harbour properly.  Everybody concerned was in agreement, but this could not be done because in law the Dublin Port and Docks Board are responsible for the harbour. The result is that that board do nothing about Skerries harbour, which is falling into disrepair.  The local authority are prepared to take it over and the fishermen are prepared to pay realistic landing charges in return for a service.  There is goodwill on all sides, but nothing has happened, or is likely to happen, because the Department responsible do not consider it an urgent matter in the context of all the other things for which they are responsible.  They do not see how to fit it into the legislative programme and use the well known cliche, &ldquo;We will include an appropriate section the next time we are introducing general legislation&rdquo;. Mind you, general legislation is never introduced.  The Department in reply to a query say, &ldquo;We have prepared many Bills.  However, they were not general <Col N="1062" /> legislation, but were about specific problems with which we had to deal, so were not appropriate to your case.&rdquo;  It is a daft state of affairs that after all my years in this House I cannot introduce a single section Bill at some stage, getting the House to agree to assign to the local authority the responsibility now resting with the Dublin Port and Docks Board.</P>
    <P>I am not giving that example to advance my case.  There are numerous such cases throughout the country where legislation has become outmoded through the passage of time and events and where individual Deputies could well serve their constituents by being allowed to sponsor small Bills which would update the law, which would not be objected to by the Departments concerned, and which are not matters of great party political moment.  There should be time allocated to those Members to allow them do so.</P>
    <P>Contained within that time there should also be an opportunity afforded Deputies to sponsor legislation that does not impose a charge on the public purse and which, in their view, represents an improvement in the social fabric of our society, which could be voted on on a non-party basis.  Whether they were accepted or rejected they would not be seen as a reflection on or criticism of the Government of the day.  That is essentially what happens at Westminster every Friday.  And there are many votes on various issues.  Very often, in the context of the size of the membership at Westminster, there are small numbers of people voting, perhaps 30 for and 20 against out of a total membership of 600-odd.  But nobody is concerned about it.  If the 34 happened to be a mixture of Conservatives, Labour, SDP and Liberals, and the 30 against happened to be a similar mixture nobody thinks it strange, reflects on it or even comments on it in the media.  Yet this is the Parliament on which we based our Standing Orders, on which we modelled ourselves.  When it had the good sense to update its method of operation we did not follow suit. Whether it was appropriate for us to have based our system of operation on it in the <Col N="1063" /> first place is another matter; the fact is that we did.</P>
    <P>What we need to do now is devise Standing Orders appropriate to the Ireland of today and to the needs of Deputies and their constituents.  If we are going to sit on Fridays &mdash; and I do not accept necessarily that there is a need to sit on Fridays &mdash; then we must first reform our procedures on the days on which we sit at present.  But if we do sit on Friday, then a large part of that day should be devoted to business entered by private Members, voted on by private Members and on which the vote would not be taken as casting a reflection on the Government or any particular political party in the House.  That is something that would be welcomed by people on all sides of the House and would afford opportunity to private Members who do not have such opportunity at present.  Contained within that proposal is the idea that we will all have to grow up sufficiently to realise that the concept of a free vote does not contain within it an implicit criticism of whoever may be in Government at the time.  Over the years we have allowed ourselves become too hide-bound, too tunnel-visioned into the idea that all votes must be under the aegis of the party whips.</P>
    <P>That is not the first time I have made that appeal in this House.  Certainly, especially in relation to social areas and areas that normally would be called matters of private morality I would tend to feel that there are many matters of private morality upon which it is not correct that the State should be seen to interfere. I suppose to a large extent that is dependent on our respective definitions of what is public and private morality.  There is always perhaps difficulty in getting a consensus as to where the dividing line lies. But, in relation to matters which are clearly ones of private morality, then clearly this House should have a free vote in relation to all of those matters.  It does not redound to the credit of the political parties, and certainly not to the credit of Parliament, that areas of private morality generally have been used as political footballs, sometimes used by political parties <Col N="1064" /> in endeavouring to cause maximum political embarrassment for other parties by the adoption of particular public stances, with party endorsements, in relation to certain of those areas about which I speak.  It is long time that we grew up in this House and accepted the principle of the free vote.  Contained within that we should allow realistic time every week to private Members to sponsor either small matters of administrative concern &mdash; such as the example I have outlined &mdash; or, alternatively, to sponsor legislation which, in their opinion, helps to improve the social fabric of society.</P>
    <P>There have been quite a number of comments on the charade we go through annually in relation to Estimates, where the Estimates are published in such a form as to make it extremely difficult for the average Deputy to understand the services for which they are providing money.  Certain Estimates will be discussed at a particular time of the year interminably to such an extent that the majority of Estimates, containing hundreds of millions of pounds, are then nodded through without any discussion on the last day set down by law for so doing.  In that regard I am very pleased that the Minister for Finance has announced the concept of having his Department publish a programme presentation aimed at highlighting the important areas of public expenditure, that these 20 programmes will contain, for each programme, a summary of all attributable costs, a description of the activity in question, an indication of policy direction, where appropriate, and details of activities and appropriate assessments of performance where feasible.</P>
    <P>That is the way Estimates ought to be published, so that they explain to people what they are all about.  I was for many years a member of a large local authority. Quite frankly the manner in which they discuss their Estimates every year, the manner in which their Estimates are presented and the services described is light years better than the manner in which the government produce their Estimates on an annual basis at present.  And the discussion on the estimates for the provision of services at local authority level is a far <Col N="1065" /> more realistic and constructive one than the discussion on the Estimates for the operation of Government Departments at national level.  I have participated in both of those discussions and know which is the more realistic.  It is time for us to become, not any more, but just as realistic as are local authorities, health boards and other bodies in relation to the discussion of the operation of the spending of Government finances.  There was an improvement effected by the outgoing Government last year by the earlier publication of the Book of Estimates and they deserve commendation for that. That was subsequent to a commitment given by the present Minister for Industry and Energy, when Minister for Finance, to have the Book of Estimates published, if possible, by September in every year so as to allow a realistic discussion of them before their actual adoption and implementation. I hope it will be possible for such changes to be introduced.  But equally important is the concept announced by the Minister for Finance yesterday of a description of what services the Estimates actually cover. That would be vitally important so as to allow realistic and worthwhile debate.</P>
    <P>I have some embarrassment in making my final point.  I came in here with thoughts I have expressed at various times over the years to various people.  I too firmly believe there should be a time limit placed on all contributors in all debates here because, in debates in respect of which there is not a time limit placed on Members, there is not placed on one the same constraint to get one's thoughts in order, present them cogently and use the time available to make the maximum number of points and the most constructive speech.  In that context I should apologise to the House for the fact that I have spent exactly twice the length of time in speaking here today.  I am quite sure I could have made the points I did in at least half the time had the constraint been placed on me at the start.  That is the kernel of what we are all about.  Our Standing Orders should be designed to make us operate effectively and efficiently.  They must be fair to all Members, especially to the non-office <Col N="1066" /> holder, and in turn be seen to be fair to the general public whom they endeavour to serve.</P>
    <P>Many Members of the House rarely speak in debates because of pressure of constituency work.  They put aside the idea of speaking until tomorrow and tomorrow they have more representations to make.  Then they decide to speak next week but next week they have more work to get through and they do not speak that week either.  Over the years I have seen many fine young men and women who believed they had an eminent parliamentary career ahead of them and they left either never having spoken or contributing an odd interjection during Question Time.  They worked hard but the point is whether they worked hard as Members of Parliament or as social workers.  I am not saying Deputies should not make representations or look after their constituents, but if we reform the Dáil we must also reform the public's attitude towards the role of the public representative.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to all the views expressed by Deputies regarding what a Deputy ought to be allowed to do in regard to constituents.  The concept that a Deputy can get something to which a person may or may not be entitled is wrong.  In relation to appointments made by the Civil Service Commission it is wrong for people to think that if they visit their local Deputy they will get preferential treatment.  There are many people who believe that.  They would prefer not to go to a Deputy but they are afraid that if they do not another applicant for the job will do so and will get the job.  We all take part in a charade.  A Deputy writes to a Minister, a Minister writes to the commission, the commission say they decide on the issue and will announce the decision in due course, the Minister writes back to the Deputy, the Deputy writes back to the constituent, and if the constituent gets the job he is never sure whether he got it on merit or because of the Deputy's intervention.  If he does not get the job he blames the Deputy and decides that he must not be as influential a person within his party as he thought he was and so will not vote for him again. <Col N="1067" /> On the law of averages there are more people who do not get jobs.</P>
    <P>To what extent are we the authors of our own misfortune?  The first day the first person decided to run five clinics &mdash; he is still a Member &mdash; he placed inexorable pressure upon his constituency opponent who was chided by his party organisation.  His opponent decided to go one better and ran six clinics.  The third Deputy within three weeks had ten clinics going and within a year the three had 20 clinics each a week.  Are we really providing a service to our constituents if we send out thousands of letters saying we will be at point A or B or at Mary Mac's front room or the back snug of a pub at a certain hour at a certain day so that they can visit us and ask us to get them something to which they may not be entitled in the first place?  We have participated in conditioning the people into the mentality that they must go to a Deputy to fill up a form for them never mind getting the item concerned.  How much of a kick do we get out of attending to the lady who comes in and asks if we can get the local authority to send a foreman and plumber in a van 20 miles from the depot to replace a washer on the ball cock of her toilet?  Is that what we were elected to Parliament for?  If we are to reform the Dáil perhaps we ought to think about our duties as public representatives and whether we ought to be trying to reform the mentality of the public and their perception of the role of a Deputy and what he ought to do on their behalf.</P>
    <P>If we are to bring this Parliament and country into the twentieth century it is time, not only in relation to the economy but in relation to life generally, we grew up.  If people have a real problem they will get in touch with us.  To clarify a point in relation to the example I gave of a Deputy writing to a Minister and a Minister writing to the commission, I have instructed my Department not to write to the commission or to go through the charade because technically if I write to the commission the person involved is disqualified.  I am giving that information free of charge to the few people who are in the House.  There is no point in any <Col N="1068" /> Deputy writing to me asking me to do something which I cannot or will not do. That is a start.  Perhaps we should all examine our conscience and see if there is not a better way of being Members of Parliament as well as making Parliament a better place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend good wishes to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and hope he will remain in office for many years to come.  The previous speaker spoke very eloquently for almost an hour.  He covered almost every area of parliamentary procedure.  There is very little left for anyone to say.</P>
      <P>I avail of this oportunity to express my disenchantment at the way in which matters are debated.  The length of time assigned to each Member in a debate of this kind is far in excess of what it should be.  I served in the Seanad for a short while.  There was a limited amount of time given to different motions.  A person should be able to say all he wants to in a short and concise fashion as is appropriate to debate.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the frustrations of being a backbencher on the Government side and the lack of opportunity to speak on various issues.  I will confine my remarks to the motion that the procedures of this House should be reformed and that control of public finances should again be in the hands of politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If businesses were run at the same level of efficiency as this House, they would go to the wall.  Many businesses have collapsed in spite of being far more efficient than the House.  There has been talk about Friday sittings but if this means simply an extension of existing procedures it will be even more frustrating for Members.  I congratulate the Minister on having the foresight to introduce this motion.  Only by involving people in this debate can we ascertain their views.  The previous speaker referred to ambitious new Members coming here and going away after a period having achieved little or nothing.  He spoke also about the burden of constituency work but in order to achieve the honour of being a Member of <Col N="1069" /> the Oireachtas one must prove oneself at local level.  Many a good legislator has forgotten this fact and suffered for it in an election.</P>
    <P>When I entered this House there was nobody to explain the intricacies and complexities of Bills or to tell me how to use this Parliament to advance the views of my constituents.  When I became a Senator I did not know the various stages through which a Bill must pass.  I had to feel my way as best I could.  I have seen legislation being passed which subsequently needed amendment and politicians are castigated for this.  A recent example was the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill.  The purpose of this Bill was to clarify the social welfare code but shortly after the passage of the Bill the Oirerachtas had to rush through amending legislation.  There was clear evidence that there had not been a significant input by Members when the original legislation was going through and the amount of information available to rank and file Members was insufficient.</P>
    <P>I know that it would be almost impossible for every Member to stay in the House for the duration of a debate.  I am learning that Deputies usually leave after the Order of Business and their presence here then is due to the fact that there might be a division on the Order of Business. A Deputy who raises something contentious will be ruled out of order but the press will report assiduously the raising of any such issues.  The Chair is powerless to prevent this.  I was for a time chairman of a local authority and even at that level it is extremely difficult to contain members who try to bring in extraneous issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider some form of advisory service related to the Bills going through the House so that Members could participate fully in debate.  At present this can only be done by those who have legal training but it would be a sad day if such training were a prerequisite for entry to this House. The people are best served by Deputies from various walks of life and we cannot all be experts in every field.  I strongly advocate an information service for Deputies and there should be no attempt <Col N="1070" /> by any Government to steamroll legislation through the House.  The Telecommunications Bill is now listed on the Order Paper.  It is a very important Bill containing over 700 sections.  There are many other areas of the public service in need of reform and there is a lot of legislation that should be updated.</P>
    <P>Since I was elected to this House I have discovered that Deputies do not get much opportunity to propose changes in legislation. The House has passed many non-contentious pieces of legislation, but when a Dáil is dissolved and one looks back at its achievements one cannot be impressed.  I can recall that Members from my constituency introduced a motion last summer concerning the closure of an important factory.  A lot of time was devoted to the debate on that motion but the only people interested were Members from the constituency and those who came to support them and were listening in the Public Gallery.  The debate lasted for three hours and, when the Minister had replied, people in my constituency felt that Parliament had decided to keep the factory open.  We knew that that was not the case and it was found later that the Minister did not have the power to put into effect the direction he was given by Parliament. Our procedure should be reviewed and reformed.</P>
    <P>Very few Members have the expertise to deal with legal documents or frame amendments.  That is an intricate matter and one must be trained in that aspect of Dáil procedure.  I accept that the Leader of the House is anxious to ensure procedures are reformed to meet the needs of the twentieth century and he should be given the co-operation of all Members in his efforts.  Although there has been a great advancement in technology in recent years we are still adopting the same methods as those used 200 years ago in the British Parliament.</P>
    <P>There is a need to restrict Members in the amount of time allocated to them to make a contribution.  I accept that the mover of a motion should be given sufficient time but for reasons of political expediency debates are often dragged out in order to ensure that there are sufficient <Col N="1071" /> Members present should a division be called.  If there are not sufficient Members present the House should be adjourned so that the public are aware that there was a lack of interest in the legislation being debated.  There are many demands on the time of Members in their constituencies and in the House with the result that very few debates attract a full attendance in the Chamber. Visitor in the Public Gallery must find it hard to understand how there is so little interest in debates.  The report of the debates is made available to Members on a regular basis, but they take up so much space that after a short time one must get rid of them.  I accept that a facility to check on past speeches is available in the Library.</P>
    <P>The Committee Stage of Bills could be dealt with in a more expeditious manner at a meeting of a special committee. However, I believe it would still be difficult to get people involved.  For example, there are only five Members present now.  We do not have a quorum but I do not know if it is necessary to have one because I am not conversant with the procedures of the House.  If we agreed to deal with Committee Stages of Bills at a special committee Members would have more time to raise issues of public importance in the Chamber.  Few people realise the amount of time a Member must devote to the preparation of speeches, research and so on and that must be done in conjunction with answering letters from constituents and meeting deputations. While Deputy Boland may be correct in what he said about clinics it must be remembered that Members must make themselves available to meet constituents on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Looking through the record of recent Dáil sessions I have noticed that some of the questions tabled in the middle of last year have not been answered.  That is a terrible reflection on the way work is done here.  It happens on occasions that by the time a Minister replies to a question the problem complained of has been rectified.  Loans and grants have often been paid out a long time before a Minister even acknowledges receipt of a <Col N="1072" /> question from a Member and I have often found that work has been carried out before a Minister has replied to the query.  Members, since they were given private secretaries, feel obliged to keep those people tapping away on their typewriters with the result that the offices of Ministers are overloaded with letters. Obviously, Ministers will have to be given additional staff to deal with such matters, although a lot of those queries could be dealt with at local level.  I agree with Deputy Boland that Members concentrate on that type of activity with the result that they do not have a lot of time to deal with legislation.</P>
    <P>The Order of Business, I believe, should be fixed at the end of each day for the following day.  If Deputies were sufficiently up to date with what was happening, and if they were in touch with the clár, they would be in the House to make sure that if they wanted to raise something on the Order of Business for the following day they could do so.  People may not agree with that.  If a Deputy wanted to raise something important, perhaps he could submit it in writing to the Chair an hour before the proceedings started and then it could be raised by the Ceann Comhairle.  There are many ways in which the whole matter could be looked at.  At the moment there is an atmosphere of friendship between both sides of the House, but that could change and there could be great conflict on extraneous issues.  Sometimes several Deputies jump up at the same time as if they were schoolchildren, and nothing is achieved other than a few headlines in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>I would recommend the use of the radio during important debates, but people can make use of that medium to their own advantage.  Some people are expert at getting newspaper headlines.  I know that the press have a job to do.  I congratulate the national and local press on the coverage they give to politicians. It is vitally important that politicians should be seen to be operating in the best interest of the country at large and of their own communities.  The press provide an excellent service for that purpose. Sometimes they lend themselves to <Col N="1073" /> reporting matters which are not as important as others, and which are not of great national importance in the long term while they may be of short-term benefit for the selling of a newspaper.</P>
    <P>When the Opposition Whip replied to the Minister's introductory speech it became obvious that there is a widespread feeling in his party that there is a great need for reform.  Yesterday Members of The Worker's Party tried to raise a point on the Adjournment and there was a certain measure of frustration.  Perhaps there was a way around it of which they were not aware and therefore they lost out.  They are elected like the rest of us to represent the views and feelings of their constituents.  I may not agree with a great deal of their political philosophy, but I believe we should facilitate anybody who wants to raise an important matter.</P>
    <P>Another matter raised was control over the public finances.  I have had experience of finance at local authority level over a considerable period of time. When we are presented with estimates we have the opportunity of suggesting certain amendments.  To some extent we are constrained because we must stay within the budget.  The same is true of public finances <i>vis-á-vis</i> Government expenditure.  To present Estimates after the money has been spent is a useless exercise and is a repudiation of what this House should be all about.  There has been an improvement in that respect. The Estimates were presented at a difficult time.  The election took place and the House did not have time to go into them in any great detail.</P>
    <P>I have noticed that when estimates are produced at local level, that is it.  That is your programme for the year.  We cannot find out how the programme is working out, how effective it is, or whether it is achieving the desired results.  We should have some type of committee, a watchdog committee, to preside over Government expenditure programmes and to see whether they are achieving their purpose. The annual budget has been referred to as a cosmetic exercise in attempting to balance books at the end of the year. There may be developments we would like to see in education or in our roads <Col N="1074" /> system.  In 1979 there was talk about £1,000 million for road improvements. The local elections were coming up at that time and this was a great figure to see written across the papers.  Travelling from Waterford to Dublin I cannot see where any of that money has been spent on that section of the roadway.</P>
    <P>We cannot find out what happens to what we get from EEC sources.  We should be able to pursue this in the House to see whether our programmes are on target.  A committee set up to deal with this would be more than valuable.  They could try to find out where there is waste of our resources in the public service.  An amount of money is being poured into various areas, but the real return in road improvements or elsewhere is very small.</P>
    <P>I would not support an extension of the sitting time of this House if we are to have a continuation of what I have seen so far.  We should make better use of the time we have.  All sides of the House should get together and make the necessary recommendations to update and improve our methods of dealing with legislation and matters of crucial importance. Because the Government lose a vote they should not necessarily have to go to the country.  We should be allowed a measure of freedom to debate important issues.  Deputies on all sides of the House agree on how certain things should be pursued when we want to achieve a certain political advantage.  I am glad to have the opportunity of making these points and I hope that, before this session is over, this House will be a more efficient instrument of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to inform the Deputy that at that meeting, before agreeing to the package put forward by the Commission to the Council, I sought assurances from the Commission and the Council in relation to certain aspects of the policy as proposed, the most important being the possibility by the Danish fishermen of the establishment of rights to fish in future in Irish waters.  This undertaking was given to me and was included in the declaration.  I will quote the relevant sentence which concerns this point&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Council notes that, in this context, Denmark renounces its claims regarding Western mackerel.</P>
      <P>This, basically, is the position and, furthermore, to ensure that this declaration was not open to misinterpretation, a further declaration contained the following&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community TAC for Western Mackerel is reserved to the fishermen <Col N="1076" /> of the Member States that have traditionally fished on this stock.</P>
    <P>That puts beyond yea or nay the possibility of the establishment by Danish fishermen of a right in the future to fish Western stock mackerel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that a common fisheries policy has been agreed by ten member states, of which Denmark is one.  If we are to abide by a collective decision made within the Council by ten member states, I must assume that the undertakings given and included in written declarations are to be taken at their face value.  Obviously, if difficulties arise at a later stage it will be a matter again for the Council collectively to decide on what action might be taken in the form of penalties or whatever. However, we must take the declaration at face value and I assume that this problem has now been resolved, to my satisfaction at any rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the state of the industry in this country by comparison with other member states is not good. We have a great deal of ground to make up in the industry and I have always felt it is within the framework of a common fisheries policy that this kind of development can come about.  We now have a common fisheries policy and, prior to its emergence, there was recognition by the EEC that our industry was backward in relation to other countries.  For that reason, in relation to structural measures, they agreed to a 50 per cent grant towards structural aid when the normal grant applicable to other countries was 25 per cent.  There is recognition within the EEC of our position and I hope that <Col N="1077" /> some benefits will accrue to us from that recognition which has been there since 1976.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the reason for the proposed ban on the use of mono and multi-mono filament netting by Irish fishermen; whether other member Governments of the EEC intend to introduce a similar ban on their fishermen; and whether he considers that the use of such nets should be encouraged while restricting instances of overfishing by other methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the use of monofilament and multistrand monofilament netting in fishing for salmon.  The use of these types of netting for salmon fishing has been prohibited since 1 January 1977 under Bye-Law <Col N="1078" /> No. 590, 1976.  That bye-law prohibits also the possession of nets made up wholly or partly of such materials with a mesh size in excess of 1 13/16 &rdquo; knot to knot.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any similar national provisions applicable in other EEC member countries but the United Kingdom is the only major salmon producing country in the EEC.  In that regard there is no national prohibition on the use of monofilament netting for salmon fishing in England, Scotland or Wales.  In Scotland, however, fishing for salmon by drift net, other gill net, trawl net, seine net, troll or long line is prohibited.  In England and Wales ten regional water authorities have responsibility for the conservation of freshwater fisheries and two of these prohibit by bye-law the use of monofilament netting for salmon fishing.  In Northern Ireland the use of monofilament netting for salmon fishing is also prohibited.</P>
      <P>I am firmly of opinion that, for conservation reasons, the use of monofilament netting for salmon fishing should continue to be prohibited.  There is however, no objection to the use of monofilament nets for sea fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to get into the area of inconsistencies.  My concern is for the conservation of the salmon stock in this country.  That is my sole concern and I will ensure that adequate steps will be taken to ensure conservation because salmon are suffering grave diminution in numbers over the past number of years.  It does not concern me what other countries do to conserve their salmon stocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the quantities of weedkiller containing the chemical 2, 4, 5-T, which were used by his Department during 1982; and if, in view of the established danger to health from this substance, he will consider prohibiting its use by his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of 2, 4, 5-T used by my Department in the 15-month period ended 30 September last was 690 litres.  The formulation of this particular chemical, used under the strictest control by my Department, conforms to the safety requirements of international bodies such as the FAO and the WHO. Moreover, I understand that the Department of Agriculture are satisfied that the formulation available in this country does not pose a threat either to man or the environment.  In the circumstances I cannot accept the inference in the second part of the question.  Nevertheless, in order to allay public apprehension, even though this apprehension is ill-founded, my Department have decided to phase out its use and no new purchases have been made for some years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that information.  All the information I have is what I have stated, namely, that the formulation used here is in conformity with the standard laid down by the FAO and the WHO.  The compound contains a substance known as dioxin which in its pure form is a highly dangerous deadly poison.  This has been the experience unfortunately in Viet Nam and in Seveso in Italy where an accident occurred resulting in this becoming a health hazard and severely injurious to people.  The formulation used here conforms to safety regulations.  While I assume there is a <Col N="1081" /> dioxin content, it is of such ratio that it seems it poses no threat to the environment or to man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole problem with 2, 4, 5-T is that it contains dioxin and that is 150,000 times more toxic than arsenic. An unnamed spokesman for the Department of Fisheries and Forestry on 14 January indicated that amounts of 2, 4, 5-T were in use in forests in the State.  Can the Minister give an assurance that this material is not in use in forests that are open to the public, that are used as nature trails and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The unnamed source mentioned by the Deputy was quite right in stating that this formulation of weed-killer is being used.  I have said we have not ordered stocks for some time.  We are phasing out its use just to allay public fears which have been ill-founded.  The only controls I refer to are those of the FAO and WHO.  The Department of Agriculture have stated publicly that they have accepted that this particular formulation is not harmful to man or the environment.  The question infers that the use of this substance in areas where there are nature trails to which the public have access could be injurious to them. From the information available to me I could not accept that.  I cannot give the Deputy an undertaking that it is not being used in these places because I have not got information on file.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>Again the Deputy is inferring that this substance is harmful but I must reiterate what I have said that it is not regarded as harmful.  It is in conformity with standards laid down by the FAO and WHO.  To allay ill-founded fears we are not reordering any further stocks and we are phasing out existing stocks.  However, if the Deputy wishes I will inquire to see if what he suggest is <Col N="1082" /> possible and I will get in touch with him on the matter.</P>

However, it may meet the Deputy's requirements to know that the aggregate value of the contracts for the period in question amounted to £500,000 approximately. As all servicing of chainsaws is carried out in the Department's workshops the question of service contracts does not arise.</P>

I have considered this and I do not think it satisfactory to have a discussion on a matter when the Minister has answered it by way of tabular statement.

If it was established that badgers were responsible for the infection of cattle in any area appropriate steps, including killing if considered necessary, could with the Minister's permission <Col N="1085" /> be taken to deal with the problem.

With the vast amount of money spent and the major arguments which are currently going on in relation to the budget and the capital programme would the Minister not be prepared to give some of the reasons?

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if an emergency telephone service will be provided in Fettercairn Estate, Tallaght, County Dublin, having regard to the fact that the nearest public telephone is a considerable distance away and consequently, in emergency situations, the estate is isolated; if this will be dealt with as a matter of priority, having regard to the fact that there are a number of children in this estate with serious medical conditions and that some form of telephone service or communication system is absolutely essential; and if as a temporary measure he will consider making the emergency telephone service available in one of the <Col N="1099" /> houses in the estate if an offer is forthcoming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <P>It is planned to provide two telephone kiosks to serve Fettercairn estate within the next three months or so. These kiosks are in replacement of two kiosks provided in February 1981 which were destroyed by vandals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is an intolerable situation to leave a large corporation estate like this one without any form of telephonic communication and would he take into account the fact that there is no private telephone in this estate where, as in every other estate, there are some very sick children?  Therefore, as an emergency measure and pending the provision of the kiosks, would the Minister arrange at least to install a telephone in a private house especially in what Deputy Mac Giolla refers to as communications year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the policy of the Department to provide as an emergency a telephone in a private house.  To do so would create difficulty for the public in terms of availability of service on a round-the-clock basis.  There might be the problem of nuisance calls to the household in which the telephone was located and in addition there would be the question of liability in the event of someone using the phone being injured in the house in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that objection not be overcome in the event of a householder agreeing to accept the responsibility of having the phone in his house? It is absolutely essential in this day and age that in the event of an emergency there is access to a telephone.  No estate should be left cut off in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy says but as I have stated it is not feasible to have a public telephone installed in a private house.  As indicated in my reply, there were two kiosks provided in the estate in question in 1981 but they were wrecked.  We are endeavouring <Col N="1100" /> to provide replacements for those as quickly as possible and we will try to do that in even shorter time than the three months mentioned in the reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his efforts in trying to have the matter expedited; but regarding his point about a public phone and its location, is it not the position that many coinbox public telephones are installed in places other than in street kiosks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but the Deputy is talking about a private house. There are public phones in such places as public houses but these are always installed at the request of the proprietors and they are generally treated as public telephones.  It would be almost impossible to have the sort of situation that the Deputy suggests.</P>

      <P>I agree that the delivery office in Tallaght needs to be replaced.  Arrangements to do so have been delayed by financial constraints but I expect tenders for fitting out the new premises to be sought shortly.</P>
      <P>The lease on the new delivery office at Broomhill Industrial Estate commenced on 1 May 1981 and the Department took possession of the property on that date. It is not the practice to disclose rents.</P>

Under the revised systems general practitioners as a group are given priority attention for maintenence during normal working hours but consultants on call and other key medical personnel in the major hospitals continue to have the same level of priority as previously.  The change in the arrangement was discussed with the Irish Medical Association and the special arrangement regarding consultants and key medical personnel agreed with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús comhgháirdeas a ghabháil leat, a Cheann Comhairle, as ucht tusa a thoghadh mar Cheann Comhairle agus táim cinnte go dtabharfaidh tú cothrom na féinne do gach Comhalta sa Teach.</P>
      <P>On my first opportunity to address the House in this new session, I wish to congratulate the Chair on his election.  I am confident that he will show fairness to all Members of the House.</P>
      <P>Although I do not often see fit to agree with my colleagues on the other side of the House, I must commend the initiative of throwing open an area such as Dáil reform for discussion.  Judging by the opinions of various speakers on all sides of the House, this is an area which was under scrutiny prior to the introduction of this debate and which has caused much frustration and disillusionment, particularly among new Deputies.  During my previous seven months here, I found the workings of the House cumbersome and that on many occasions issues which came to the fore as matters of serious public concern could not be moved speedily to the floor of the House.  Since this was the only way in which legislation could be formulated or existing legislation amended frustration developed and Deputies sometimes very quickly became disillusioned and failed to bring before the House those issues which had been brought to their attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of Dáil reform, the various mechanisms by which Members can approach community, national and international problems should be scrutinised very seriously by the Joint Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to enable people who, like myself, are not acquainted with mechanisms and procedures by which we can get around various Standing Orders, to air our views and bring our concerns before the House in an effective manner and at a time of most relevance.  I was interested to hear previous speakers refer to the frustration of individual Deputies with no allegiance to political parties who from time to time try to raise matters and are frustrated by the procedures and unable to make their <Col N="1131" /> input because the Whips of the main parties, Government and Opposition &mdash; perhaps in the interests of efficiency or out of concern for the processing of legislation &mdash; had to make arrangements which, by their nature, seemed to eliminate the viewpoints and contributions of Deputies who do not have Whips to represent them.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the viewpoints expressed by a number of previous speakers on their frustration at being presented with Standing Orders five minutes before the business of the Dáil commences.  I was particularly taken by a suggestion by the last speaker on this topic before Question Time that this should be done on the previous evening.  That would give an opportunity to Deputies who are not too well acquainted with the process to make a more relevant contribution and in a manner which takes up the minimum amount of Dáil time.  I came into the Chamber about three-quarters of an hour before Question Time with the intention of addressing myself to a few areas and voicing concern in relation to these and I will be very brief.</P>
    <P>One area which is the cause of on-going frustration and disillusionment &mdash; an area which is currently treated with cynicism and a sense of hopelessness by the public generally &mdash; is that of law and order.  This comes within the ambit of the Department of Justice.  Amendments to legislation in the field of law and order &mdash; some of which come within the ambit of the Department of Health in the context of juveniles &mdash; cannot be constructively and effectively dealt with on an on-going basis under the existing departmental system.</P>
    <P>The Dáil recognises ministerial responsibility for the introduction of legislation and the Minister, in turn, depends upon consultations with senior civil servants within his Department.  With regard to law reform and the Department of Justice, it would be far preferable for Deputies to have an on-going input into this area.  There is now great concern that the legislators are unable to come to grips with the very serious problems of vandalism and burglary, a general feeling that lawlessness is pervasive, that the <Col N="1132" /> Garda who, with the best will in the world attempt to bring thugs, vandals, indeed rapists to justice, are frustrated by an extremely complex system and by the process and procedures of this House for whatever reason &mdash; and I am not well enough acquainted with these to identify the areas causing difficulties.  There is a conviction, particularly in urban areas, that successive Governments have fallen down in this respect and that whatever overall reform is needed, it is most urgently needed in this contect.  This community concern should be brought quickly and effectively to this House, whether by way of committees with a direct input into legislation or by way of an extension of Dáil time.  Problems, as they are seen to arise, can be dealt with effectively and quickly.  In that way also public concern, frustration and a sense of hopelessness can be quickly allayed.</P>
    <P>Another matter of growing significance is that of economic management. In referring to economic management one identifies immediately a number of variables which can be very volatile and change just as the circumstances relating to them change.  I have heard Deputies on many occasions express concern about their awareness of changes in some of these variables, about their inability to effect any changes themselves in the course or direction of our economy.  One suggestion emanating from the opposite side of the House meriting my attention is that of the earlier publication of the Book of Estimates.  The Book of Estimates should be published well in advance of the budget, with opportunity being afforded in the House to have them debated thoroughly before any definite formulations are made by the Minister for Finance or his Department.  This would generate growing confidence among Members of the House generally, the feeling that they would have an input, that they would be motivated to take an interest in this area.  They could also feel, justifiably, that they had the facility to influence, perhaps even in the slightest way, the general direction of the economy.</P>
    <P>It was always my belief that in being elected to this House one was being <Col N="1133" /> elected to be a legislator in some form or other.  I have wondered since coming in here if that is the case.  I find my position as a Deputy very remote from legislation or from any positive, practical input into legislation.  In this regard I should like to refer to some of the opinions expressed by the Minister for the Public Service.  I should say that when that Minister occupied his previous Ministry I did not have many opportunities to agree with him in many of the views he expressed then.  But certainly in relation to the conflict of roles to which he referred today I find myself in agreement with him in a number of areas.  There is a kind of mystique which public representatives have woven around themselves over the years.  They have, I feel deliberately, set out to create a mystique as to their powers, their influence, their ability to effect changes in decisions taken within Departments or local authorities.  I might refer the House to an interview I gave <i>The Irish Press</i> in February 1982, an interview which, if you like, created somewhat of a panic among my constituents in Dublin North-East. When asked by the journalist what I felt I could do for constituents, what changes I felt I could bring about with regard to Government decisions and local authority decisions on individual and community bases, I stressed that public representatives, when elected, could influence, by way of discussion, by way of strengthening a case, by way of highlighting the advantages or disadvantages of particular issues.  But I said I felt that one could do no more than that.  In summary I said at the time that by and large people get what they are entitled to and no more.  Therefore I blame Deputies themselves for having created this mystique. I blame them for quite deliberately in the past creating the impression among the public that anything is possible, that it only took the scribble of the pen of a Deputy to have the magic wand waved. I object very strongly to this kind of misleading impression being given.  I am very concerned about it.  I am stating my concern for a number of reasons.  One is the costs that have been incurred by the State, by different Departments, different local authorities over the years arising <Col N="1134" /> from the conviction felt among the electorate in any constituency that all they had to do was go to their public representatives and the magic wand would be waved immediately; that if it was not it was because somebody held in greater favour than him or her had had the magic wand waved some short time previously and that therefore this constituent was being neglected deliberately.</P>
    <P>Many public representatives must examine this area.  It might be a good idea that an initiative mentioned by the Minister today could be discussed by the joint committee.  I am prepared to abide by the views of the joint committee in this respect.  I am prepared to abide by the views of my own party in relation to issues such as the termination of representations by Ministers.  But it is my view that in many instances what a Deputy is doing is merely writing a letter for the sake of a reply and of being in a position to convince his or her constituent that he has put pen to paper because there is no other purpose being served.  In order to enable the facility of representation to continue I would be very anxious that senior civil servants within Departments and senior officials in local authorities be seen to be more readily available to Deputies, on deputations or on representation, so that the full facts of cases could be ascertained at a more personal level and that constituents who would be concerned about approaching their public representatives would not be frustrated by being prohibited from so doing.</P>
    <P>I would not agree with the Minister for the Public Service when he decries clinics as directly creating the mystique to which I have referred.  By and large I feel constituents like to feel their public representatives are available to them, that they can speak with them, can voice their concerns on community, individual and family problems to them.  Indeed, there are many amendments to legislation which arise directly out of such clinic discussions.  Therefore the whole idea of clinics, while not necessarily subject to a decision by this House, should not be knocked out of hand.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of our procedures warranting our consideration also. <Col N="1135" /> One such is Question Time.  My colleague, Deputy Ahern, voiced some of the concern I feel.  Question Time should be devoted to dealing effectively with the main national and community issues. This is not the case primarily because many of the questions submitted for oral reply are individual questions.  There is a facility for written reply and there are many categories of questions, such as those in relation to telephone service and the payment of grants, which do not merit Dáil time in terms of an oral reply.  We should look at what kind of questions are put down for oral reply.  In many cases a comprehensive written reply would be satisfactory.  That way we would have more time to raise community and national problems at Question Time.  At present there is an hour per day allocated to Question Time.  This is inadequate. We should give consideration to extending Question Time by at least another half-an-hour.</P>
    <P>The question of broadcasting Dáil debates has been raised here many times. I am not in agreement with many of the views expressed on this.  The Dáil is where the people have their views, opinions and apprehensions expressed through the medium of their respective Deputies.  It is where national and international issues can be thrashed out in a logical, comprehensive way and it is where all the measures to introduce legislation and amend existing legislation in accordance with the needs of the day are undertaken.  When one brings visitors into the Public Gallery they have a sense of awe.  There is an aura of mystique about the House.  They expect the essence of debate and constructive argument but what they see at best is four or five Deputies in the House.  As a result they are disillusioned.  When students leave the House and discuss their visit with their teachers they are very disappointed that there is not greater pressure on public representatives to play a more effective role on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>New Deputies are not familiar with Standing Orders and so on.  I suffer from a lack of familiarity with Standing Orders and the methods and mechanisms which <Col N="1136" /> might or might not be available to Deputies to legitimately circumvent procedures or bring urgent issues before the House.  New Deputies should be able to acquaint themselves with the various means by which they can bring problems to the House.  They would then have a greater motivation to participate in legislation and deal with the various issues raised.  These are some ideas to which the joint committee should address itself and I hope they will be taken into account by it.</P>

      <P>Since this is my first opportunity to speak in this newly-elected Dáil I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your elevation to your position as Ceann Comhairle and I wish you many successful years.  I first entered this House in June 1981.  Like many other people who come to the House of Parliament I was a little idealistic and naive in the sense that I thought as an elected Member, particularly when my party was in Government, I would have a major role to play in the introduction of new legislation and amending existing legislation. The reality was very disappointing. As is the practice, backbenchers in a Government party are discouraged &mdash; there are good reasons for this &mdash; from putting down embarrassing parliamentary questions.  While I agree with this, it has the effect of stifling what could be constructive debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Estimates have been compiled Government backbenchers have no useful role to play until after the introduction of the budget.  There should be some time when backbenchers on all sides could come together and make submissions which they consider to be for the good of the country.  The only way to do that is through the committee system, which hopefully will come to pass. During the debate many people decried the fact that the level of debate and the standing of the House is often relegated to that of a county council.  In most county councils the length of contributions we have here would never be contemplated. The first thing I tried to learn when I was elected here was how to speak for half-an-hour or more on a subject that <Col N="1137" /> could be dealt with in ten minutes.  We must tackle this aspect soon.  Unless we do so public interest will wane and our role as public representatives will diminish in importance.  While it is argued that many subjects raised here are insignificant and could be dealt with by way of letter or at county council level, by the same token the length of contributions can have a great bearing on how the public view our role.</P>
    <P>Let us compare the role of the county councillor with that of the Dáil Deputy in relation to Estimates. The county councillor can enter into a meaningful debate when the Estimates are published and can bring about an amendment without any loss of time and without the loss of taxpayer's money.  Such is not the case in the complicated system used in this House.  I do not suggest that we should deal lightly with the Estimates but immediately following their publication there should be an opportunity for open debate either in Committee or in the House.</P>
    <P>The public perception of the role of a Member of the Oireachtas needs to be changed.  It is believed that Members have a tax-free salary and a restaurant where they can eat and drink free of charge.  It is also believed that their travel expenses are paid in full and that all their activities are at the cost of the taxpayer. This is not so and it is a sad reflection on us that we have not been able to create a better understanding of our role.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to set other than a good example with regard to the length of speeches.  There is often much repetition and if proceedings were broadcast I fear the TAM ratings would take a sudden nosedive.  The committee system seems to provide the best opportunity of allowing everybody to make a constructive contribution and it would be a worth-while reform.</P>
    <P>The role of the Deputy has diminished and he often finds himself regarded as no better than a messenger.  It is, however, essential that the Deputy should keep in constant touch with his constituents and that he should operate a number of advice clinics so that he can be aware at all times of their needs, not only as <Col N="1138" /> regards domestic issues but also the need for new legislation to help his constituents.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that we have a public service which is highly sophisticated and well-staffed, it seems to have become unwiedly and hence the reason for repetitive representations and Dáil questions. The Minister for the Public Service mentioned the case of Mrs. Murphy who had to write to a Deputy in order to have a washer put on the ballcock of her toilet. He said that the Dáil Deputy should not have to deal with such matters, but I think it is sad that she should have to enlist aid to have the matter attended to. There are various bodies and institutions who should respond to the needs of people and there should be no need to approach a public representative who must incur the large expenditure which usually follows.  We find ourselves in the role of ombudsmen dealing with matters which should be attended to without the need for representations.</P>
    <P>The only way to overcome this problem is to remove some of the bureaucracy which has become a stumbling block for the ordinary constituent.  I am gravely concerned about this matter.  While on the one hand it can be argued that clinics, Dáil questions and representations should be cut down, I believe there are many people who would not get their rights unless someone took up the cudgels on their behalf.  I have seen numerous instances of this.  It is not that they would be deliberately deprived of their rights; it is merely that the system has become impersonal.</P>
    <P>Members of the Oireachtas are supposed to think about the people whereas the bureaucracy we have allowed to grow around us is completely impersonal.  I am sure all Members have dealt with personal matters on behalf of constituents and have found they were pushed around from one section to another in a disgraceful manner.  We have all been shocked at the way representations have been dealt with.  It is up to us to ensure that in conjunction with the reform of the Dáil we insist on a reform of the other institutions of State.  I am opposed to Members getting something for constituents <Col N="1139" /> which they are not entitled to such as jobs in State-sponsored bodies or in the public service.  Those matters are effectively dealt with by the Local Appointments Commission, a body that should not be interferred with.  There are other areas where it is necessary for Members to intervene in order to ensure that constituents get what they are entitled to.  Members could make a useful contribution to the work of the House if we dispensed with some of the archaic systems that operate here.  Those systems were effective when our population was small and when we had fewer representatives but they are out of date now.  I am looking forward to a reform of the Dáil and the institutions that deal with the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate because it affords new Members an opportunity to express their views on the situation they have found since their election. Since I was elected 18 months ago I have come to the conclusion that the House has not kept pace with advancements outside.  For example, very few Members are in the Chamber to listen to the contributions today.  In other words, my contribution will only be heard by those who are in the Chamber awaiting their turn to contribute to the debate.  I agree with Members who have expressed the view that contributions are too long. When I was first elected to this House I expressed the view that there was too much repetition and that speakers tended to repeat what others had said.  That was wasting time.  I do not think my contribution will be taken into consideration by the civil service or Ministers and we have distanced ourselves from the civil service in many ways.  If I had to sit through a debate and listen to the waffling I would be tempted to go to sleep. I certainly would become oblivious of what was being said.  I accept that we are not putting on a show for the public but those who visit the Public Gallery should see that we are doing an adequate job.  I have no doubt that those who visited the Public Gallery today will tell people at home that there were only three Members in the Chamber for this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> It would be difficult to insist on short contributions because it would mean that occupants of the Chair would have to keep a close check on the time.  I accept that the present occupants of the Chair pay attention but I have known of former occupants who had the ability to sit throughout a debate without listening.  I do not blame those people because debates have tended to be repetitious.</P>
    <P>When people have asked me to arrange a visit to the House I have always suggested that they should endeavour to be here for Question Time.  It is like football matches long ago, if a row was expected to occur a big crowd would turn up.  The same applies here.  If people expect a good interchange between both sides they will turn up but many people have left saying that the Dáil was not what they expected it to be.  On many occasions while I was engaged in constituency work in my office my Chief Whip has approached me with a request to go to the Chamber and make a contribution to fill in time.  That should not be.  If I have to enter a debate with the intention of just filling in time my contribution would not be sincere.  If we have a contribution to make we must prepare it and that involves research.</P>
    <P>Most of my time here is spent dealing with constituency work.  I did not seek election to the Dáil solely for the purpose of writing letters to and on behalf of constituents, I was anxious to make a contribution as a legislator.  We must redress the balance because we are devoting more time to constituency matters than to legislation.  I welcome the decision to provide Members with a private secretary.  However, my office is on the second floor of what is known as the old building while my secretary is based in the College of Art building and some secretaries are based in Molesworth Street.  That ridiculous situation must be corrected.  Sometimes when I am looking for a secretary I walk down the stairs and go to the College of Art.  She is coming to meet me and she goes up in the lift and we miss each other.  She is in my office and I am in hers.  Sometimes it takes three or four trips before we meet.  That is nothing short of crazy.  As an aside, there <Col N="1141" /> is a pothole outside the College of Art building.  Dublin county councillors are to be criticised for that.  Will somebody fill it in?  I tripped over the bumper of a car the other night in the dark and had to take an early shower.</P>
    <P>We should be regarded as the top elected representatives.  Many people are anxious to enter this profession.  We should be given the opportunity to provide a professional service.  In the circumstances I have outlined this is not possible. We should be able to save time.  We should not have this ridiculous situation in an organisation which should be above reproach and which should be absolutely professional.  If we cannot be professional here, how can we expect others to be professional?  Shame on us.  We should not imagine that the problem will go away.  It would be worse if Deputies got used to the procedures and ceased to complain.  When people come here to see us they should be able to see professionalism within the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The idea of a committee system is excellent and research should go into it. We should not just jump into it.  We should not establish committees for the sake of establishing them.  There should be some criteria for the composition of committees.  People should not be put on committees if they have little to contribute to them.  When we are selecting members of committees, let us select the best people so that they can come forward with the best ideas.</P>
    <P>My only worry is that the debate may be taken out of this House.  That would not be necessary to some degree.  When a committee have proposals to make, they should come back to the House and, within our time limits, time should be found for them.  Being publicity mongers politicians might have some apprehensions about these committees.  They are an excellent idea and they will give people who are interested a chance to make an input.  As a relatively new Deputy I have not had an opportunity to make an input since I came into the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The role of a backbencher is very disillusioning. I had little opportunity to make a contribution, particularly when we were in Government.  I was advised, <Col N="1142" /> almost under threat, that I could not put down embarrassing questions.  When the Government put forward new ideas they should try to accommodate the backbenchers and make their role more meaningful. A five-day week has been mentioned. Rural Deputies, and most Deputies who serve on local authorities, would find it very difficult to attend in this Chamber for five days a week.  I live in County Wexford which is 110 miles from here and is a good three-hour journey. A five-day week should not be introduced automatically.  The position of all Deputies should be taken into account. I sit on a local authority and I have the right to continue to do so.  Usually their meetings are held on Mondays or Fridays and in some instances on both days.</P>
    <P>With streamlining and by cutting out waffle and repetition, there would be sufficient time for us to do our business.  I would hate to see a five-day week being introduced for its own sake, or just for the sake of doing something new.  I am sure people outside would say: &ldquo;The Government are wonderful.  It is time these Deputies did a little work.&rdquo;  They imagine that the three days we spend here are the only days during which work is done.  Possibly the three days I spend in Dáil Éireann are the three easiest days of the week.  We have to look after our constituents.  That is our primary function. If we are not in our constituencies for a reasonable amount of time during the week, we cannot look after our constituents. Our procedures should be streamlined.  The debates should be curtailed and more to the point.</P>
    <P>Today during Question Time about 15 questions were answered which were of an individual nature.  I am not critical of those who put down the questions, but we must have an adjudication of some sort so that an individual does not take up the time of the Dáil.  Questions of a general and national nature should appear on the Order Paper for oral answer.  Question Time is not and has not been as effective as it might be.  It could be made far more effective.  The time allotted to Question Time should be extended.  I welcome this debate.  My greatest crib about the Dáil is basic: long <Col N="1143" /> debates, waffle, repetition.  I suggest that the Government should take action accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, may I commence by extending my congratulations to you on your appointment and wish you every success?  The debate on this motion dealing with Dáil procedures is now in its third day, and obviously most of what should be said has been said already.  We have had a good deal of repetition.  Obviously the few points I wish to make have been made already and, therefore, I run the risk of repeating some points made earlier this week.</P>
      <P>This debate has been described as very important as far as the Dáil is concerned. I do not agree with this point of view.  To some extent it is important, but we have many other urgent and important problems to solve and we have spent three days discussing Dáil reform.  Unemployment and the economy have not been discussed yet and I do not know if the Government will allow time for discussion on these matters.  Of course we have the budget next week and that will afford us time to debate the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What exactly will come out of this debate?  I understand a select committee was set up in the early seventies to investigate and look into possible Dáil reform. That was over ten years ago and nothing has emerged.  I fully agree with Deputies who said that the House is stifled with bureaucracy.  Major Bills are passed with little or no contributions from the vast number of Deputies in the House.  The ordinary backbencher is too concerned with his constituency work to become involved with legislation.  It is not his fault, because when a new Deputy comes into the House he does so in the knowledge that if a Deputy is not a good constituency worker his term in the House will be short lived.  That has been proved in many cases.  There is an old saying regarding Deputies who have been unfortunate enough to lose their seats that they talked their way out of the House.  That is because they became involved in debating legislation and perhaps to some <Col N="1144" /> extent were seen to be neglecting their constituencies.  A Deputy who comes into this House and who is seriously concerned with debates runs the risk of not retaining his seat after the next election. This is something that any committee set up to investigate Dáil reform must consider. We have too many outdated rulings which frustrate ordinary Deputies.  Items of immediate importance are not allowed to be debated.  The Chair rules a Deputy out of order if he tries to raise a matter of major or national importance.  There is no point in coming into this House three or four weeks after a major catastrophe or strike has brought the country to a standstill and discussing it then.</P>
    <P>A number of arguments have been made for committees and committee work.  I have worked on quite a number of committees since I came to the House in 1977 and the success of a committee depends on the input of the Deputies concerned. In many instances I have seen the unfortunate clerk of the committee running around looking for Deputies to form a quorum for a meeting to start.  If committees being set up are going to operate in a haphazard fashion we are wasting our time because there will not be any improvement in the present system.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned Deputies who must work in their constituencies.  Earlier this evening Deputy Durkan made the point that many Deputies waste their time on representations which the ordinary people could look after for themselves. Of course, red tape hinders the public and it is extremely difficult for an old age pensioner or a social welfare recipient to obtain benefits to which they are entitled. It is a shame that a Deputy must make representations to the Department concerned to ensure that that person obtains his or her rights.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to Question Time.  Today there were approximately 275 questions on the Order Paper.  In many cases the information sought could be obtained by written reply or by representations to the Department concerned. I understand that the cost of a question now in the House is about £40 and that does not include the cost of printing or time taken in seeking information from <Col N="1145" /> local authorities or outside bodies.  The cost of questions today was £11,000 of the taxpayers' money.  We must devise an alternative system.  It is totally irresponsible of Deputies to fill an Order Paper with questions about when Mrs. So&mdash;and&mdash;So will get her telephone or when will service be restored and so on. I repeat the plea from other speakers that an adjudicating committee be set up to look at questions before they appear on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>At Question Time the Taoiseach, quite rightly, receives priority.  After that, senior Ministers take precedence for questions. This means that if a Deputy wishes to raise a matter through a parliamentary question to a lesser Department he may have to wait months before receiving that information.  This is an area that should be looked at.</P>
    <P>The working conditions of Deputies have been referred to and I fully endorse all the comments which have been made. If the public could only see the conditions under which many Deputies have to work in Leinster House they would be appalled.  I doubt if any other profession would tolerate these conditions.  I have raised on a number of occasions during the terms of office of the last three Governments the question of facilities on the top floor of the old House.  There are two cubicle toilets for 38 people on the second floor.  The local health authorities would not accept those conditions elsewhere. Nothing has been done about these conditions although there are frequent complaints.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, for providing adequate secretarial facilities to Deputies.  When I first came to the House in 1977, one typist was working for seven Deputies.  It was extremely difficult for any Deputy to work under those circumstances and so I would like to compliment the former Taoiseach for changing that situation and enabling each Deputy to have his own secretarial facilities.</P>
    <P>The image of Deputies so far as the public is concerned is anything but good and I regret to say that much of this is due to the irresponsible media.  I have read on a number of occasions articles by <Col N="1146" /> a certain journalist in an evening newspaper who spoke at length about Deputies using the restaurant and bar, who referred to the carpets in this House and many other comforts.  It was never mentioned that most Deputies work 15 hours a day for six or seven days each week. Deputies are under extreme pressure in many cases.  In fairness to the Oireachtas and its Members, the media should give Deputies a break now and again rather than create this wrong impression which does not enhance the image of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I hope a select committee will investigate how the affairs of this House can be improved.  As I said at the outset, I am not too optimistic we can change the system too quickly or too much but both Government and Opposition should come together on this.  Fianna Fáil assure the Minister of State of every co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> I am very pleased to have the opportunity to be associated with this motion put down by the Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy J. Bruton. I came here with some notes prepared but having listened to other speakers I consider it better to answer the points that were made.  I listened on the monitor on a number of occasions when the Whips were being blamed for many of the things that happened in this House and I have no doubt that some of the criticism was right.  During the years the Whips have had to agree on Order Papers and keep debates going.  As the Government Chief Whip I recognise that there must be some changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the changes should begin with the Whips themselves but unfortunately we cannot do that unless we get some order into the voting procedure and the manner in which we vote.  I cannot see any reason for snap votes.  The possibility of a snap vote has often meant that people had to stay around in the corridors or in their offices when they could be carrying out research work or something worth while.  Surely in 1982 we can devise some system whereby we can vote on <Col N="1147" /> various issues between certain hours which would be agreed by the parties and set out before the House.  We have been elected to represent the people.  The fact that a Whip can catch the Government by calling a snap vote does not reflect the views of the people.  The situation could arise that five Deputies might be caught in a traffic jam in Kildare Street.  We should start by agreeing on some system. Surely we could come to some arrangement about having divisions in certain hours?  If this were possible we would know where we stood.  It would make for a better atmosphere in Dáil Éireann and it would allow people to participate in committees or to do other necessary work.</P>
    <P>Apparently there is some stigma if the House adjourns before the appointed time.  I heard some Deputies making the suggestion that we add another day to our working week.  I listened to the speakers and thought about the matter and my personal feeling is that it would be a pointless exercise to sit for four or five days if there is not sufficient business or if it means simply expanding debates to fill in the extra day.  If we happen to get through our business at 3.30 p.m. that is that.  I do not see any benefit in carrying it on until 5 p.m. simply to satisfy some understanding built up during the years.</P>
    <P>When we discuss this matter at the conclusion of the debate perhaps we could agree on the way that certain things are done.  Neither I nor the Opposition Whip should have to shunt four or five people into this House to keep a debate going until 5 p.m.  If the debate finishes at 4 p.m. that is the end of the matter and there should not be any stigma attached to the Government or the Government Whip on that account.  Equally, I do not think it is smart to call for a snap vote. We should have a debate and if it takes two hours we should allocate two hours or whatever time is required.</P>
    <P>There is an understanding that a Deputy is a failure if he does not speak for at least 30 minutes.  If a Deputy puts down his name to speak in a debate and if there are four or five people ahead of him, he knows it will be at least two hours <Col N="1148" /> before he gets in.  He must also take into account that there may be the same number of Opposition speakers and he can calculate it will be five hours before he gets an opportunity to speak.  His attitude is, why should he sit in the House for five hours when he has other work to do. However, if there was some restriction on the time allowed for a speech, perhaps that would give Deputies an opportunity to speak a second or third time.  I suggest that Deputies would sit in the House and listen to other viewpoints if they had the opportunity to speak a second time perhaps for five minutes.</P>
    <P>It is quite easy to see why this place is empty for much of the time.  It is simply because of the understandings and traditions that have built up about procedure. There is the understanding that the Dáil must sit until 5 p.m. on Thursdays and if this does not happen the Whip or the Government are failures.  We should do our business efficiently, giving everyone who wishes an opportunity to contribute and eventually have a vote.  The Opposition should have a proper input in the committee system and their views should be sought.  I do not believe that one side has all the brains.  There is no reason why we should not have a committee system where the Opposition members could express their views and debate the Minister's proposals.  That committee should deal with a Bill in a constructive manner and it should be then brought before this House.  Urgent matters should be dealt with in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Some people have suggested that this debate has gone on too long but I do not agree.  It is good to hear differing views. I do not think we should stop anyone from expressing a view on this matter. Had we agreed to take the debate on one day, 40 or 50 people might not have had an opportunity to express their views.  We took a gamble and it has been well worth while.  People recognise that we do not want to repeat ourselves and continuously go over things that have been said, but anything that has been said has been said constructively and in a very responsible manner.  I hope that when we get together we can find a way of making certain that what happens here is meaningful <Col N="1149" /> that we use our time constructively, that we allow all elected Members to have their say, that we use the talent available on this side and on that side to get proper legislation, that we can fight our party differences at election time but, when the people decide who they want, it is our job, as on this occasion, to run the country.</P>
    <P>However, that does not mean that once we get in here we must try to shut up the Opposition and that the Opposition must try to act in a destructive manner to try to get us out again or that the backbencher on the Government side should have a proper say or be afraid to ask a question.  That does not make common sense and it should not happen.  All the debate I have listened to over the last couple of days is to the effect that each Member has stood up and said that it does not make sense, they do not understand it and that to spend hours in here in a worthless exercise.  Therefore something is radically wrong.  Deputy Brady has doubts as to whether we can change things.  I do not share that pessimism.  If there is a will we can overcome the problem. The public perception of the politicians must be changed, but the only way it can be changed is for politicians to begin the change themselves.  Arising out of this debate, we can begin together, not with the Coalition coming forward with proposals and trying to ram them through the Dáil, but we can listen to and work with Members of the Opposition to get an effective forum for debate so that ultimately what comes out of here will be best for the people we all serve.</P>
    <P>Another thing that struck me applies to the unfortunate Ceann Comhairle, or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who is in the Chair at the moment.  I am talking about having to continue business.  I, a Government Chief Whip, am afraid that a debate will collapse and that somebody is not ready to take over and if that is so the House will adjourn.  Surely that does not make sense.  In any walk of life you go out and do your job and when you are finished one portion of it you settle down and begin the next.  If we come in here, order business, get through it and perhaps have allowed half an hour over the <Col N="1150" /> time we thought would be needed to carry out that business, if the Minister who is to take over the next business is not present, surely we can have a five-minute break and allow people in and out to get themselves organised again.  The situation brought about by the rule that we must be here &mdash; people are running in and out, perhaps the debate will collapse and we will have to go home in disgrace &mdash; is wrong.  We should take a serious look at this together and try to come up witha new system in which, when we are finished with item 1 and have to wait five minutes to get people organised for item 2, we do it efficiently.  A typical example of what I am talking about is my colleague sitting beside me.  We thought that this debate would be finished at about 3.30 p.m. today because we felt that there would be no further contributors.  I, as Government Chief Whip, had to contact my colleague to tell him that he was on next and to make sure to be around.  As a result of that he has been hanging around here for an hour-and-a-half waiting to get on to the next item.  That is a total waste of time.  Surely we should have a system under which, when I am finished, somebody can go out and ring his office to tell him that he is on next, that he has about five minutes to get here. That is the sort of structure that needs to be changed drastically and immediately.</P>
    <P>I have listened with great interest to a number of people speaking about the role of politicians in today's world and the public perception of them.  Like Deputy Brady, I feel that Members can talk themselves out of this House, and that is a terrible shame.  Think of how people are elected to the Dáil.  Either you are a very good local man looking after your constituents, sending out circulars, doing all the necessary things at local level or you are a front-line politician who happens to get wide publicity on television, radio and in the newspapers.  But if you are a hard working, middle-of-the-road man your chances of being elected are very dicey unless towards the end of the term you start to go one way or the other. That is the way we have tuned the public in to electing people, and that also is a terrible shame.  I have seen people on <Col N="1151" /> both sides of this House losing their seats and I thought those people had a tremendous amount amount to contribute towards the welfare of this nation.  We have got ourselves into a terrible rat-race of encouraging people to believe that if they come to my clinic and they go to the clinics of my four colleagues in the constituency, between us we will write five letters to the same Minister and we will get five replies and if the problem is solved, if ever, the chances are that the constituent will have got between 15 and 20 letters.  We are all judged on how often we can do that and on the number of circulars we send out.  That all stems from what is happening in here because the opportunity for the backbencher to be involved in the working of the Dáil here is very restricted.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I hope that whatever committee is formed, whatever gathering comes about as a result of this debate, we will use all the suggestions that have been made here over the past number of days and that people who have contributed will not feel that their time has been wasted.  I have that at the end of it all within a very limited period we will have a new beginning and be seen to be a body who will be constructive and deal with the problems, that people will have the opportunity of raising important issues here, that Question Time will be used properly and not in inquiring whether Mr. and Mrs. So-and-So will get their phone repaired.  I hope that the Opposition will be, and will be seen to be, constructive and have participation in the formation of legislation and ultimately in the passing of it.  I hope that we will get about doing our business properly.</P>
    <P>I am going to sit down now because I want to give my colleague an opportunity, as he has been waiting for an hour-and-a-half. He is entitled to a few minutes to commence the motion.  The Minister will wind up the debate on Tuesday and I hope that we can get together shortly to do something constructive.  I thank everybody who has taken part in this debate.</P>

    <P>The twelve months covered by the 19th and 20th Reports were exceptionally difficult and even depressing for the Community and its individual member states. The challenges presented by the world economic crisis, by the growing spectre of widespread unemployment, especially youth unemployment, by inflation and by balance of payments difficulties, were posing serious problems everywhere.  It was not a particularly auspicious time, therefore, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome &mdash; apart from the wider economic context, the actual development of the common market was at a standstill.  Yet it has been at times of crisis, and worse, that in the past European countries found the courage, the commitment and the political idealism to reach out beyond their parochial and protectionist concerns and <Col N="1153" /> build on their individual and collective strength and experience.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ivan Yates asked this morning to raise on the Adjournment a special item in connection with flour.  Permission has been granted.  I presume the Deputy realises he has 20 minutes and the Minister has ten minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Chair for his kindness in allowing me to raise this very important matter, which is literally a bread and butter industry and is strategically vital for the continuation of supplies of bread here.  It concerns the Irish flour milling industry and the enormous threat to it because of the growing level of imports of flour.  I would like briefly to outline the background to this situation.  Prior to our EEC entry there was a system here whereby the Department of Agriculture licensed all Irish flour millers and flour producers and voluntary quotas operated.  There were effective trade barriers.  The price and the production of flour could be controlled and monitored.  There was also a tacit, unwritten agreement among different countries that there would not be a cross-border transfer of major shipments of flour.  This held right up to our entry into the EEC.  With the free trade situation in the Treaty of Rome Ireland's protection system no longer pertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1982, when imports had apparently been at a level of 1 per cent &mdash; they were specialty flours such as Italian flour for pizzas and so on &mdash; Britain started to export flour here at alarming levels.  The basic reason why this happened was because there are underlying fundamental reasons why they can produce flour cheaper than we can.  This has to be realised in trying to deal with this problem. There are companies such as Hay Gate, Spillers, ABS Ltd. and two others in Belfast <Col N="1154" /> who are presently exporting.  The level is deviating between 11 and 15 per cent of the market share.</P>
    <P>The first reason why they can always sell flour cheaper than the Irish flour is in relation to wheat.  It takes 1.3 tons of wheat to produce a ton of flour.  The basic cost ingredient of flour is wheat.  There are two types of wheat, soft wheat and hard wheat.  The hard wheat comes from America.  Other countries, such as Britain, have deep port facilities which means they have a cost advantage over us.  We have to ship the wheat to Rotterdam and then bring it here with obvious extra shipping costs.  We have no deep port facilities to allow the straight-forward importation of hard wheat.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in relation to the soft wheats, which are grown in the EEC, such as Irish wheat and so on, we have an agreement with Irish farmers who grow wheat that they get paid the full compensatory amount for the cost of imported wheat.  In effect, they get the full price.  The second reason why Britain have an obvious advantage in selling flour here is that interest rates are cheaper.  It is a capital intensive industry.  The cost of a stamp, electricity and telecommunications are cheaper in Britain and they have that obvious edge on cost competitiveness here.</P>
    <P>The third reason why imported flour will always be cheaper is because at present a price war is going on with flour in Britain.  It was announced yesterday amongst retailers in the UK that there is a further escalation of this price war.  This means that British flour millers are doing extra marginal cost production, putting on a third shift, where they do not have the prime production costs.  They can sell cheaper flour because it is done on an extra turnover basis.  We cannot compete on that basis and we must realise it.</P>
    <P>That is the reason levels of imports have risen from 1 per cent to 3 per cent and to 15 per cent.  The reason for my raising this this evening is the situation in relation to Ranks.  We can go from 15 per cent importation of flour to in excess of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Ranks who are 74 per cent owned by Ranks in Britain have a 32 per cent market <Col N="1155" /> share in Ireland.  They have mills in Limerick and in Dublin with 300 employees. They are supposed to be closing tomorrow.  I understand the Government are having talks with Ranks and certain requests have been made, such as requests for financial assistance, a clampdown on imports and sufficient profit margins to ensure that they can obtain viability.  Possibly all or some of these are unacceptable to the Government or unrealisable from the Government's point of view.  The situation will then be, with this 32 per cent market share, that there could be a number of inevitable consequences which could be disastrous for our economy, for Irish bakers and Irish flour millers.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ensure that 50 per cent imports of flour are not reached?  He can do that by ensuring that Ranks keep operating and milling their flour here or the Government can take whatever steps are appropriate to ensure that Irish flour millers can take up the vacuum from the market and ensure that the extra capacity of other Irish flour millers take up this market share.  This would mean, in effect, that there would be cheaper Irish flour because the type of marginal cost production I spoke about earlier in relation to UK flour can be done by Irish flour millers with the extra production and extra turnover.  I do not wish to get involved in the negotiations which are going on between Ranks and the Government. I appeal that Ranks do everything possible, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and its Minister, to ensure that they keep open.</P>
    <P>I wish, having outlined the situation, to raise some other side issues in relation to the level of flour imports.  This serious matter was raised with the previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Lenihan, in July 1982 and again in September 1982. I wish bluntly to accuse the former Minister of gross negligence and inaction in this area.  This is verified by the fact that in 1982 a member of the European Parliament, Deputy Tom O'Donnell, tabled a parliamentary question asking the Commission what steps were being taken in view of the Irish difficulties relating to <Col N="1156" /> flour milling.  The reply was that the Commission were unaware of the Irish difficulties. It was not until that matter was raised that there was any action from the Government.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister for Agriculture and his Minister for State in the present Administration are meeting the relevant commissioner on Monday.  I also understand that all avenues are being explored in that regard.  I wonder if we had had the same commitment by the holders of office in the period between July and September last year, when this matter was first raised, if we would be in this situation now.</P>
    <P>With regard to my constituency I wish to declare my personal interest in one of the independent millers, David Moss Limited, who have a turnover of £12 million and have 175 employees.  This firm are part of the 27 per cent share of the independent flour millers.  They have made an enormous contribution to the local agricultural economy in County Wexford, having bought last year £1 million worth of Irish wheat from County Wexford farmers.  In terms of local purchases and spinoff to the local economy the effects of the closure of such a large traditional firm will be devastating.  One could not under-estimate the difficulties that would follow in the event of an increase in the level of imports by Ranks or others.  The present rate of sale, which is only a breakeven rate and which is unsustainable, is approximately £318 per tonne whereas the import price would be approximately £300 per tonne so that within months most if not all independent flour millers would be put out of existence. In addition there would be a number of small bakers who would be put out of business apart from the number of jobs that would be lost directly in the flour milling industry.  There would be also the loss of revenue to local farmers because of their wheat not being bought.  Another matter for consideration is the side benefit in relation to the provender millers who engage in the production of compound products for animal feedstuffs. With most flour millers, pollard is a side product.  It is an essential ingredient in compound feedstuffs.  In the event of a <Col N="1157" /> further erosion in the number of Irish flour mills we could be facing a situation in which we would be importing an extra £4 million to £5 million worth of pollard with the obvious job losses in provender milling and the consequential loss to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>There are dangers also in the present situation in relation to other Irish flour mills engaging in a cut-throat price war whereby in the short term they would reduce interest in an effort to take up the market share in the vacuum situation of Ranks.  Such a situation would not be sustainable.  It would put independent flour millers out of business.  Therefore, I raise the question of the attitude of expediency being adopted by some of these people.  I ask the Government to monitor that situation so as to ensure that short-term measures will not supersede the long-term overall advantages of restraint and rational consideration on the part of all existing Irish flour millers.</P>
    <P>There is a need for rationalisation in the flour milling industry.  There is surplus capacity production and there is an acceptance among the Irish Flour Millers Association of this, but the question is whether the rationalisation that must take place in the next three to five years will take place in a reasoned and orderly way or whether there will be a war of attrition between the bigger Irish flour millers and the importers with the independents being squeezed.  That is a question that faces not only the Government but which should concern the consumers also because in such eventuality we would not have supplies of flour during, for example, a strike or a war situation.  I am talking of the level of imports exceeding 50 per cent of the market.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is no clear-cut area in which the Government can simply introduce legislation or invoke an agreement with other trading partners to ensure that this matter will be resolved but there are some steps that I am asking the Government to take.  First, I urge that at EEC level flour be made such a top priority that we would have a situation where in the regular trade-off situation between other member states, whether in terms of beef or of butter, <Col N="1158" /> steps be taken to negotiate a situation in which the strategic indigenous flour industry be protected and that direct representations be made to the British Minister with a view to his putting pressure on the British Flour Millers Association to review their position.  Their long-term gain on the small Irish market is very limited.  There arises the question also of whether our Government should not approach, for example, the appropriate French Minister to ask if the French would be prepared to consider breaking tacit agreements, exporting flour into Britain and undercutting their market by such dumping.  That trade-off situation should be examined fully with the Council of Ministers and with the respective Ministers of Agriculture of the other member states.</P>
    <P>There must be a direct case made to the EEC Commission in relation to the need for this country to have the capacity, the warehousing storage facilities, to retain essential amounts of flour so as to ensure an essential supply for bread production and baking in the event of an emergency.  We must protect this industry because we need bread.  If we fail to protect our own flour milling industry we will not have bread in the event of, say, a dock strike, a war situation or a blockage of the seas.</P>
    <P>I urge also that the present payment by the Government of a subsidy on the loaf of bread be reviewed and that consideration be given to switching this 15½ pence subsidy per loaf to flour.  If this were done it would allow the possibility of a situation whereby measures in terms of regulations at the ports, in terms of technocratic bureaucracy and of technical trade barriers could be addressed in a very discreet manner.  We all wish to be good Europeans but there are times when we need to take reasonable and practical steps such as the review of the payments of subsidies or the timing of such payments.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Government also to impose VAT on flour at 18 per cent.  Such a move would bring about an immediate reaction of shock and horror since it would have obvious consequences for the users of flour but it would ensure that <Col N="1159" /> there would be no VAT on bread.  All Irish flour millers could claim a rebate in respect of that VAT but the imposition of the VAT at the point of entry would affect the importers.  It would affect the cash flow and would remove the advantages enjoyed by those who are importing flour.</P>
    <P>Finally, I reiterate what I consider to be the major consequences of failure to take action in this area either by the Government or by other Irish flour millers, all of whom have an obligation and a responsibility in the new situation of the 32 per cent market share.  I urge the Government to ensure that at all costs this market share will not be taken up by imported flour.  If that were to happen the implications in terms of bread supply, in terms of the small bakers, in terms of the rest of the flour millers and in terms also of employment and of the farmers who are producing the wheat would be disastrous.  That is the simple logical conclusion. The Government must act and ensure that the 32 per cent market share is taken up by Ranks, modernising and continuing in operation, or by other Irish flour millers who have the capacity, the will and the capability to do it.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this very serious matter. I am aware that other Deputies unsuccessfully tried to raise it earlier this week and I hope the commitment shown by the Minister in meetings with the Irish Flour Millers' Association will be continued and that effective action will result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Yates and agree with many of the sentiments he expressed.  As a sovereign State we are very limited in what we can do with regard to flour imports from the EEC. We are arranging a meeting with Commissioner Andriessen, hopefully on Monday, to ascertain whether Britain is breaking the rules, and this investigation is already in progress.  Of course we are very concerned about the present situation. I have had several meetings with Ranks, made concrete suggestions and <Col N="1160" /> was helpful, but having met Ranks (UK) in conjunction with Ranks (Ireland) I got the impression they were not very interested in staying.  It is clear from investigations being made in my Department that we have adequate milling capacity. That is one big worry sorted out.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's wish to see all our flour requirements produced within this country.  Mr. Breen of the IFA is adamant that this be the case.  We can produce our own requirements and have been doing so.  Our flour is of top quality and I appreciate the Deputy's concern that nothing must be allowed happen to that very valuable industry, but a lot will depend on our competitiveness.</P>
      <P>We cannot ban or restrict flour imports from other member states of the Community. To do so would not only be in breach of the Treaty of Rome, which would undoubtedly evoke a prompt reaction from the Commission, but also could have very serious consequences for our own agricultural exports.  This is all the more relevant when it is realised that we export over £600 million worth of beef and dairy products to other member states.</P>
      <P>Flour imports have increased from 2 per cent in 1979 to around 14 per cent in 1982.  This has come about largely because of price differences.  We must put ourselves in the strongest possible competitive position by producing top quality wheat and flour as reasonably as possible and make every effort to get our costings right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons I welcome the announcement made yesterday by one of our leading milling groups that they are going to lower their flour prices.  In other words, they are making a good commercial decision to take on competition and I, and I am sure, every Deputy in this House wish them every success in facing up to the challenge which imports present. In the final analysis this is the only thing to do.  No matter what area in which one is involved, one's best hope of success is to be competitive.  The flour we import from Britain will have to be at realistic prices, not dumping prices.  The British farmer has to be paid for his wheat <Col N="1161" /> and they also face additional transport costs.</P>
    <P>Many commentators have suggested that under the Treaty of Rome there are provisions under which we can stop flour imports when they begin to hurt.  It is not as simple as that.  When we joined the Community ten years ago we accepted not only the benefits which stemmed from membership but also the responsibilities. I have asked the EEC commission to investigate as a matter of great urgency the whole question of these imports which I accept are posing a threat to our flour milling industry.  In the agricultural area we are faced with similar threats and, to a greater degree, in the horticultural industry.  Some of our producers of fruit and vegetables are faced with almost a blitz situation because of <Col N="1162" /> overseas competition.  As Minister with responsibility for this area, I will ensure we get a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>With regard to my visit to Strasbourg on Monday, I cannot say what the outcome of the investigation will be but it is important that no avenue be left unexplored in our efforts to get a satisfactory solution to this serious issue.</P>
    <P>It is a source of great disappointment to myself and to the Government to learn of Rank's decision to close their mills at Phibsboro and Limerick.  However, I am aware that the company have had financial problems and that their decision to close was one which they took themselves and is not a matter in which I can interfere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. M. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>My responsibility in relation to the &ldquo;tapping&rdquo; of telephones extends only to &ldquo;taps&rdquo; carried out on foot of warrants issued by the Minister for Justice.  However, while I have to make that point formally because of the terms of one of the questions, nothing hinges on it in practice because the House may take it that, if there were any evidence of tapping otherwise than under warrant, it would be the Government's policy that that should be investigated by whatever means were appropriate and effective.</P>
      <P>The procedures in relation to the issue of warrants have already been set out in statements in this House in the past and more recently in a public statement which was issued by me on 20 January.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I included in my recent public statement information about two particular cases. I did so because those cases are, to the best of my knowledge, unique in the sense that they involved the issue of warrants in disregard of assurances that had been given to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I could not, however, agree to say in any other case whether a warrant is or is not in force.  The reasons for that policy are those that have been given on a number of occasions in the House and any erosion of it by me would sooner or later lead to a situation where a refusal in a particular case to say that a warrant was not in force would be tantamount to a disclosure that it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the record, may I say, as far as concerns the offices of political parties, <Col N="1114" /> that there has already been at least one explicit refusal in the House to give information, namely, on 17 February 1972, where a question was asked about the headquarters of the Labour Party (Dáil Debates, Vol. 259, cols. 2136-2145).</P>
    <P>The position is, on the face of it, somewhat different as far as concerns Members of the House, in that it could be said that there is a precedent.  However, I do not think that there can be any doubt about the entirely exceptional nature of the circumstances which prompted the then Taoiseach, in 1970, to give an assurance that at that time there was no warrant in force in respect of the telephone of any member of the Oireachtas.  In fairness to the House, I think it right to mention that that particular assurance was in fact repeated on, I believe, two other occasions but it was repeated in the same general context as in 1970 &mdash; the circumstances were interlinked &mdash; so that, effectively, it was really only a single exception and it is clear that the assurances given then were not intended to be repeated.</P>
    <P>While I cannot agree to give the particular assurances sought, I of course recognise the disquiet and concern that have been occasioned by the recent disclosures and I am glad to have the opportunity to repeat in the House the assurances I have recently given in public and that I believe are much more important than those sought in these questions.  The main assurance is that a new and much more formal system of control will be introduced, a system that will be &mdash; and will be seen to be &mdash; fully adequate to protect legitimate rights.  Such a system &mdash; which to achieve its objective must have an independent element &mdash; will be introduced with all possible speed, though I should make it clear that it cannot be done immediately.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, to cover the period between now and the introduction of the new system, I am glad to repeat to the House an assurance I have already given in public namely that I will not operate the system except fully in accord with the commitments given to Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>The entire situation in Cyprus continues to give the Government cause for great concern.  The Government believe that allegations of violations of human rights by any of the parties concerned should be fully and impartially investigated and Ireland has joined in international initiatives and statements to that end.</P>
      <P>With our partners in the European Community we welcomed the establishment, on 21 April 1981, of a Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus under the auspices of the United Nations.  This committee consists of one representative of each of the two communities on the island with a representative of the International Red Cross.  Ireland, along with the other members of the Ten, has expressed regret that the committee has not proceeded with the substance of its mission and hope that it will soon overcome its remaining procedural difficulties and begin its work.</P>
      <P>The United Nations 37th General Assembly on 17 December 1982, adopted a resolution on missing persons in Cyprus which reaffirmed the basic need of families to be informed, without further delay, about the fate of their missing relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The General Assembly invited the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances of the Commission <Col N="1118" /> on Human Rights to follow developments and to recommend ways and means to the parties concerned to facilitate the effective implementation of the investigative work of the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus.  The General Assembly also requested the Secretary General to continue to provide his good offices with a view to facilitating the work of the Committee.  Ireland, which is now a member of the Commission on Human Rights strongly supports these efforts.</P>
    <P>The Government have not made direct representations to any of the parties involved, and has no immediate plans to do so, as it believes that pressure to ensure the effective operation of the international investigative machinery mentioned above, is the best approach to the question in the present circumstances.</P>

The company have already begun to recruit staff and it is expected that employment will be provided for 100 people by the end of this year, with the prospects for a further increase in employment as the project develops.

      <P>Following the successful completion of the Cork-Dublin pipeline the allocation of a supply of natural gas to the provincial centres which have existing town gas industries would be the next logical step in the development of the premium market for natural gas provided, of course, that both technically and economically viable projects can be planned and executed.  For any of these centres, a technical, managerial, marketing and financial plan must be tabled for examination by Bord Gáis Éireann and my Department by the promoters of the project.  I must be satisfied that any such projects have a high probability of commercial success, before I will approve an allocation.</P>
      <P>Kilkenny Gas have submitted to me a preliminary viability study based on receiving supplies of natural gas.  This study which deals only with financial and marketing aspects is still under consideration by BGE and by officials of my Department.  However, I anticipate that further detailed technical and economic assessment will be required before any decision can be made on this matter. While it is my intention that this assessment should be completed as soon as can be, Deputies will appreciate that it would not be possible at this stage to indicate any definite time scale for the extension of supply to the Kilkenny area.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for a qualification certificate which is a prerequisite for the receipt of unemployment assistance on 11 August 1982.  The application has, however, been disallowed on the grounds that he has failed to show that his means do not exceed the statutory limit of £2,350 per annum.  He failed to reply to the request of the social welfare officer for particulars which would enable his means to be assessed.</P>
