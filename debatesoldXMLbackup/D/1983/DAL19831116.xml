      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 6, 7 and 8.  By agreement it is proposed that notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, statements in relation to the progress of the negotiations now under way within the European Community, with particular reference to the proposed introduction of a super-levy on milk, and the question of the future financing of the Community, may be made subject to: (1) no Member shall make more than one statement, (2) the statements of the opening speakers from the Government and the Opposition shall not exceed 45 minutes, (3) the statement of each subsequent speaker shall not exceed 30 minutes and (4) the concluding speaker who shall be a Government speaker shall have 45 minutes and will be called on at 4.15 p.m. tomorrow.  Business will be interrupted at 3.30 p.m. today to take these statements.  By agreement, Private Members' Business will be No. 11.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach in a position yet to tell us what is the situation in regard to the publication of the Book of Estimates for 1984?  May I remind him in that connection that in the <i>Programme for Government</i> published by the two parties now in office there was the promise that Estimates would be brought forward in September for discussion by the <Col N="2438" /> Dáil.  It was pointed out in that Document that the early publication of the Estimates was a central matter in the purported programme of Dáil reform put forward by the Minister for Industry and Energy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is just a reciting of facts.  On the last time on which I raised this matter the Taoiseach indicated that the Estimates would be brought forward in November.  Can he tell us now what exactly is the position with the Government in this regard?  Have the Estimates been settled by the Government and have they gone for printing?  When will the House see the Book of Estimates, having regard to the fundamental importance of the Estimates at this time for economic policy in 1984?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The work of preparing the Estimates is virtually completed and there is a timetable thereafter for printing. So far as we can calculate, the Book of Estimates should be available to the House by early December.  The delay arises from the fact of the requirement of the Minister for Finance particularly, but of other Ministers also, to attend a series of Council meetings in relation to the EEC proposals regarding the super-levy. This has eaten seriously into Government time and is the reason for the delay in bringing forward the Book of Estimates.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I must be afforded an opportunity to talk in the House.  We cannot be muzzled.  I will be very reasonable in my question to you.  I do not doubt Deputy Bernard Allen's sincerity in raising the matter, not at all, I totally concur with him.  But surely the Adjournment is a time that is afforded to the Opposition.  I raised the question of Cruise missiles last week. You would not allow a debate on that matter.  Yet a question appeared on the Order Paper the following day.  As members of the Opposition are we not in a position in this House to raise matters on the Adjournment?  Can I ask you that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy <Col N="2442" /> will sit down I will answer that question. In so far as yesterday was concerned, I might say that Deputy Allen first sought to raise the matter that he was granted permission to raise yesterday on the second of this month and he sought on practically every day since the second to raise it.  Secondly, there is no ruling, Standing Order or precedent giving the right exclusively to the Opposition to raise matters on the Adjournment.  But I hasten to say that I am very conscious of the fact that the bulk of the Adjournment debate should be given to the Opposition. That is my thinking and understanding of it.  That is how I am operating. Since the Dáil resumed the Government have had two days and the Opposition have had the rest.</P>

    <Title>Control of Exports Bill, 1983: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue in force, on a permanent basis, the statutory powers in the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, as renewed from time to time; to provide that orders made under the legislation may be of permanent duration; to extend the time limit within which proceedings for summary offences may be brought, and to provide for increased penalties for offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956 was enacted originally for a period of three years.  As the need for the legislation has continued to exist the Act has been renewed under various continuance Acts.  The most recent of these was the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956 (Continuance) Act, 1982 which <Col N="2443" /> extended the operation of the 1956 Act for a period of one year until 31 December 1983.  That measure was the eighth renewal of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Act empowers the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism to prohibit, by order, the export of industrial goods of any description save under licence issued by him.  In accordance with the Act such orders have a life of 12 months only and may be annulled by a resolution of either House of the Oireachtas at any time during that period.  Control is at present exercised on a range of goods under the Control of Exports Order, 1982, copies of which were presented to the House in December 1982.</P>
    <P>I wish to inform Deputies that I am satisfied that there is a continuing need for this legislation for four main reasons. Firstly, it enables us to comply with our obligations under European Economic Community law to restrict the export of essential materials to third countries where such action is necessary and for the benefit of Irish and Community processors generally.  At present these obligations require the exercise of restrictions on the export of certain scarce scrap metals to conserve supplies and to maintain conditions of comparative price stability in the Community market.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it provides the Government with the legislative authority necessary to ensure that strategic materials are not exported from or through this country to destinations where they could be used for undesirable purposes.  Export control on material classified as strategic is not operated at Community level.  By arrangement members of the European Economic Community and some other countries control the export of such materials under their national legislation. This Bill will enable this country to continue to do likewise.  Our participation in this international strategic control is based on this country's need to import certain high technology industrial materials and components required by more sophisticated industries which in latter years have been established here and which contribute significantly to our <Col N="2444" /> exports.  Since the movement of these materials to Ireland is contingent on our participation in the strategic control arrangements it is essential that the Minister should continue to control the export of materials of a strategic character to ensure continued access to the materials and components concerned to the extent that they are needed and thereby ensure that employment is maintained in the industries which use them.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, Deputies will agree that it is only prudent for any Government to have immediately available to them a means of dealing quickly with any emergency which might deprive the country of essential materials during any period which might be required before corrective legislation could be enacted.  For example, excessive export trade which would leave Irish industry short of basic raw materials, such as scrap metals and certain kinds of timber, might, in the broad national interest, need to be curbed at short notice.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is essential to have the authority to control exports to any country if such action were required by our foreign or other policy considerations.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this legislation has been renewed by the House on eight occasions. It has now been in operation for over 26 years.  I am satisfied that the reasons for its retention which I have just outlined will continue for the foreseeable future.  As no practical difficulties have arisen during the entire period of its operation I consider that the time has come to make the legislation permanent and, in addition, to provide that orders made under it are also permanent.  My proposal should also appeal to Deputies for the reason that permanent legislation will remove the need to take up the time of the House with future routine renewals.</P>
    <P>In addition to making the legislation permanent, I would now like to draw the attention of Deputies to two other changes in the existing legislation which are included in the Bill.  The changes concern penalties for offences and the time limit on institution of summary proceedings. The present maximum penalty, <Col N="2445" /> which was fixed in 1977, for making a false or misleading statement in order to obtain an export licence is £500.  I consider that this is not an adequate penalty because of the fall in the value of money since then.  In addition I believe that a more effective deterrent is needed by way of imprisonment and value related fines to discourage misrepresentations particularly in the area of high technology.  The value of such goods can often be very substantial and unauthorised exports of strategic goods could put Irish industry, and employment in jeopardy.  High technology sales abroad are now making a major contribution to the growth in our exports and the seriousness of any act which would put this contribution at risk cannot be overstated.  In the circumstances I consider that the penalties outlined in section 3 of the Bill will be effective and at the same time be fair in that they are not excessive in the light of the considerations involved.  I should specify that these penalties are:</P>
    <P>For summary conviction a fine not exceeding £800 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both the fine and the imprisonment; and for conviction on indictment a fine not exceeding £10,000 or three times the value of the goods for which the licence is sought, whichever is the greater or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>With regard to summary proceedings, experience has shown that the normal six month period allowed under the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, for the initiation of such proceedings and which has operated in the legislation up to now is inadequate.  In the area of export control there can be a considerable time lapse between the date of commission of an offence and its discovery and completion of an investigation.  For that reason it is proposed in section 3 (9) that summary proceedings may be commenced at any time within two years of the date of an offence.</P>
    <P>Apart from the changes to which I have referred, this Bill is the same as the <Col N="2446" /> export legislation which has been in force for many years and for the reasons which I have outlined I commend it to the favourable consideration of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>Ba maith liom cuidiú leis an Aire i leith an Bhille seo.  Ní reacht conspóideach é agus is féidir liom glacadh leis an méid atá ráite ag an Aire ar chuid de mhíreanna an Bhille.  Ba mhaith liom ceisteanna a chur air níos deánaí maidir leis sin, ach níl mé ag cur in aghaidh an Bhille in a iomlán.</P>
      <P>This is not controversial legislation. This matter has been considered many times in the past 26 years.  Having a brief look at former speeches made by different Ministers under various Administrations, this Minister's speech today is more or less a rephrasing of those speeches, apart from the changes in the latter part of his speech concerning new penalties that will be imposed.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that this is non-controversial legislation, it has a certain importance; and that importance is increasing rather than diminishing.  Since 1956 there has been a considerable change in the industrial environment of this country. What might not have been of serious consequence in 1956 has developed and is now a matter of major concern to the industrial development and growth of our economy.  In the intervening period our industrial base has developed and our sophistication in industrial development has improved considerably.  We have now reached the technological age and the major part of our worthwhile industry is based on technology.  Consequently there is a greater predominance of effect so far as this legislation is concerned.</P>
      <P>Those involved in the 1956 legislation had a certain amount of foresight.  It is important to point out that this legislation does not affect agricultural products or fishery products because they are covered under other legislation but this Bill covers all other exports.  It is well to put it on the record that all exports, irrespective of the form they take, can be covered by this legislation and can be subjected to licence issued by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable to expect that today, 26 years later, we need a definitive measure <Col N="2447" /> to deal with exports at this level.  Our experience has shown that there has been no undue difficulty with any of the licences issued, and it is not anticipated that there will be, but that is not to say that there has not always been a need for the most careful consideration of certain types of exports.  That, I understand, is the basis for this legislation.</P>
    <P>The national interest has to be protected, particularly as far as strategic metals are concerned.  While people do not normally regard scrap or waste metal as of strategic importance it can very well be so, particularly in an emergency.  For that reason it is important to have under our control the means to maintain in our own jurisdiction basic raw materials for industry.  Previously the mention of strategic goods would have led to the question of arms and why we do not have any manufacturing capacity in arms production. Some people felt this was an area in which we could have been very gainfully employed.  Should we ever get involved in the area of arms, this legislation would be of particular relevance.  I presume this would also cover ammunition.  I do not think we have any manufacturing capacity in that area, apart from commercial explosives, and I presume they are covered here too.</P>
    <P>Electronic and precision instruments come under the heading of high technology and industries based on electronic and precision instruments have been the fundamental base of our industrial strength over the past few years.  The Minister may smile when I say this, but former Administrations, particularly the party to which I belong, can take heart from the fact that they provided considerable funding for the development of this type of technological industry, which is the mainstay of our present industrial base.  It is important that we encourage the development of these products and that we would not place in their way anything that would deter them from increasing their development and exports.  I am sure the Minister does not have in mind using this legislation to inhibit the development of these high technology industries.  The practice has <Col N="2448" /> not been to do so.  I take it that the control of strategic metals would be used to protect this technological development.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to needs, which have not changed, and the question of our EEC obligations in this area.  It is important that we maintain price stability at home.  I imagine there would be a great tendency for exporters to get involved in exporting waste and scrap metals to third countries where there is a ready market for these products.  Those countries are at the stage we were at in 1956.  It is important that this legislation be used judiciously to maintain a price structure that will enable our technical advance to continue unhindered.</P>
    <P>There is a special reference in this legislation to the export of strategic materials from or through this country.  I am particularly anxious about the trans-shipment of certain materials through the country and, on Committee Stage, I will be asking the Minister precisely what means he has of monitoring trans-shipment as against something that might be produced here for export.  A great deal of the waste materials referred to could be utilised for undesirable purposes should they get into the wrong hands.  I take it the Minister will be able to satisfy me about this matter.</P>
    <P>While there is no EEC direct legislation on a global basis to deal with these kinds of exports, there is <i>quid pro quo</i> between the various interested governments and I presume that ours takes it on the basis that for our technology industries to increase their output and to improve their situation in world markets it is necessary for us to import technical material and particular metals and materials of high technology to maintain and develop our technology industries.  I can well understand that if we are allowed to import from other countries the kind of technology and materials that we require for our industries it would be only normal to expect that we would have to control our exports to the suppliers' satisfaction. However, I warn in that regard that, while we might require materials and components for the use of our high technology industries, at the same time I <Col N="2449" /> would not like to feel that the Minister was over-anxious to placate the desires or demands of those countries exporting to us what would be imports for our high technology so as to restrain us as to where the exports might go.  I ask the Minister to keep in mind in allowing the licences, that as long as the third countries to which our exports would be going would not have an undesirable purpose in mind, he should be generous enough with the licences in that regard.</P>
    <P>The main reason for introducing this legislation is the emergency situation and that we could very well have shortages here that we might not be able to deal with in the absence of this legislation.  It is interesting and a little disturbing to note the mention of the word &ldquo;timber&rdquo; as suggested in the Minister's statement.  It is not acceptable to me or, I think, to the Irish people that the thinnings, which could be regarded loosely as the waste part of timber, the waste section of the industry, can be exported at £1 a tonne, I presume under licence.  But if so, I would like to think that the day is fast approaching when the Government will take direct action to see to it that it is a strategic material as far as we are concerned. It is alarming that we can be exporting timber at £1 per tonne in any form and that we cannot maintain a viable production unit here to utilise that strategic raw material that we ourselves are growing.  It has been going on for some time and these arrangements had been entered into with another Department, but the Minister could well look to it to see that this export is not abused and if a licence is required to export it the most stringent regulations should be attached to it.  Timber will be a major issue in this and other economies in the next ten years.  I see it as a strategic material and the time should be approaching when no licence will be issued for the export of any of that product.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) of the legislation is in regard to our foreign policy requirements, which should have a great bearing on several of the licences that the Minister might be asked to recommend.  However, as the question of exports is under <Col N="2450" /> discussion and is very topical now, it might be no harm this morning to refer to other exports and to the need for increased exports and their importance in the economy at present.  The Bill is headed &ldquo;Control of Exports&rdquo; and we have other legislation to deal with the development of exports, but the label &ldquo;Control of Imports&rdquo; might much more appropriately be attached to it.</P>

      <P>The figures outlined in a recent report dealing with a whole range of exports-imports of this country indicate that our exports are up about 19 per cent in value for the first nine months of this year and our imports are up 3.5 per cent in that nine months.  However, bearing in mind that retail sales have been down 5 per cent in the first six months, it is only when the whole thing is taken in a packet that we realise that while the balance of payments might look well on paper it is no indication of the health of the economy when consumer spending is dropping through the floor.  The figures might look well in the short term but there is no doubt that if there is ever to be an upturn in this economy imports will increase greatly and that will bring us to a situation worse than we have had already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to make it obvious that the Minister should not take comfort from these figures.  He can take comfort in the export figure, as we all can, and we hope that that trend continues; but it is only in a particular area of activity, the area of activity that this Bill will in the main apply to, the question of high technology industries. It is the only area of exports that is really making a significant impact on the balance of payments now.  We read today reports about an economic turn-about in the economy nationally and internationally, but there is no indication in many of these reports of the strength or duration and it is quite unclear as to whether there will be any duration in that initial turn-around in the world economy. It is well to put the general public on notice that whatever turn-about in the world economy exists now is unlikely to <Col N="2451" /> affect Ireland in the short term and, I take it, in the medium and long term, that is up to two years.</P>

I am pointing out to the Minister that statements which are somewhat misleading are appearing in the public press and they would lead people to believe that there will be increased spending power in the economy for the individual in the next financial year, particularly with reference to those who have a job.  I would like to think that the general public would recognise that what is required of the Government now is some action of the Government to prevent further unemployment and a further reduction in the living standards of the Irish people by generating increased exports under a whole range of headings.  If the only attitude we get from the Government at this time is that there is to be serious capital expenditure reduction next year this will have an enormously damaging effect on the whole economy.</P>

There is a sharpness in your attitude and in your observance of the rules that is not always visible at this hour of the morning. However, you are quite right.  Export promotion and the whole question of an economic debate is not suitable to this Bill and I do not intend to prolong this except to draw attention to recent reports in the newspapers that there is an upturn and that we can expect improved standards of living next year.  I notice that is not so, unless what the Government have in mind is another serious attack on the disposable incomes of the general public by way of cutbacks in services and in capital expenditure next year, something which will have the most disastrous effects on job creation in the building industry in particular.  The Minister, as a member of the Government, must create an environment which will entice investment and increase our exports.  That is what this whole discussion is about.</P>

I would like to think this Bill would be disposed of without any undue difficulty.  There are some matters I shall raise on Committee Stage, some aspects on which I should like more information.  I wish to thank the Minister for introducing the Bill in order to have a definitive measure put on the Statute Book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I came in with what would appear to be a simple, limited Bill and ended up with an Adjournment Debate.  A number of points were raised, some of which did not bear very much relationship to the Bill.  However, I shall try to answer those that did.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Flynn's approach in so far as he spoke to the Bill.  He recognised the desirability of having permanent legislation giving the Government legislative authority to control exports and ensure that our industry has the protection that authority would afford.  As I said in my opening statement, the Bill is in fact only confirming on a permanent basis what has been in operation and has worked well for the past 26 years.  The exception in the Bill is the review of the penalties for anyone who seeks to obtain a licence for export on the basis of misleading information.  The question of people trying to use trans-shipment to this country is, in fact, covered in existing legislation.  Section 1 covers definitions only.  &ldquo;Exportation&rdquo; is defined to include trans-shipment as it is particularly desirable to have power to control trans-shipment because of the danger that this country might be made a base to which strategic goods might be trans-shipped to undesirable destinations.  That is covered in the Bill.  It is an important aspect of the Bill and I welcome Deputy Flynn's drawing attention to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He raised the question of growth in attracting industry engaged in high technology and the contribution that has made to our exports over the last number of years.  I assure the Deputy the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the contribution high technology has made to our exports continues because, if we were not in a position to control exports, many of <Col N="2454" /> these high technology industries which are dependent on importing certain materials would be adversely affected and employment in these industries would be cut very seriously indeed. Unless we comply with the requirements of this Bill we would be putting high technology industry at serious risk. Instead of hindering industry this Bill is to ensure its continuance and, indeed, its growth.  All possible assistance, and I am sure Deputy Flynn will agree with this, will be given to ensure that our exports continue.  The only restriction on that would, of course, be our own interest from the point of view of the retention of raw materials here essential for our own use and compliant with our international obligations.</P>
    <P>The question of exports was raised and also the question of living standards.  I take it Deputy Flynn was there referring to a report by the ERSI published this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not go into great detail.  The matter was raised in regard to exports and I think it is only right to put the record straight.  This year our exports are likely to reach a figure of £6,850 million. That is almost £200 million more than was expected at the beginning of the year.  That figure speaks for itself.  If the economy is to recover&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of this high <Col N="2455" /> technology industry, as the Deputy is aware, was attracted to this country between 1973 and 1977 &mdash; not all of it, but a great deal of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of who attracted it, the important thing is that it is contributing very substantially indeed to our exports and there is no doubt, if we are to achieve economic recovery, the thrust of that must be in the field of exports.  Also, the importance of our general exports, not only in relation to job creation but to job retention, is not always recognised by the general public.</P>
      <P>To comply with the wish of the Chair that I should not go into any great detail on some points raised by Deputy Flynn, I do not intend to elaborate any further. However, it is fair to say that when a Minister comes into the House on the basis of a very limited Bill and any Member of the House seeks to widen that very considerably indeed and in such a way as to use it as a vehicle for scoring political points, it is incumbent on the Minister taking the Bill to ensure that those points &mdash; some of which are totally inaccurate or distorted on many occasions &mdash; should be countered.  In order to facilitate the Chair, it is not my intention to do so on this occasion; but when a limited Bill is used as a vehicle for a full economic debate the latitude which I requested should definitely be forthcoming.  It would be my intention on further occasions to avail of that latitude to reply to Deputies, which latitude I am sure the Chair will afford me.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I thank Deputy Flynn for his contribution on those aspects which relate to the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy expressed his view on Second Stage.  It is a view which is shared by a number of people.  Since Second Stage was passed in this House there has been some comment in the newspapers to that effect.  Deputy Molloy should be aware that the Government cannot ask the President to undertake what he has suggested. The President has absolute discretion in this regard.

Any action that would result in the outcome of a democratic ballot being challenged is not in the interests of democracy, irrespective of who has the good fortune, or misfortune in these present times, to win that election.  This would need to be clarified beyond all doubt and I support the view expressed by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Minister has reiterated the points I made on Second Stage. It is for that very reason that it is imperative that the Bill be referred to the courts.  It would be a very invidious position for the country to be left in after a general election if somebody were to contest all or several of the results in different constituencies.  The whole democratic process would be brought to a halt and we cannot allow that situation to develop. We cannot allow doubts to remain.

However, it is recognised that a respectable body of legal opinion has expressed doubts in relation to its constitutionality, and because of the nature of the legislation involved and the potential implication of a challenge which could arise following a general election it is desirable from everybodys' point of view that any <Col N="2458" /> remaining doubt in relation to this matter be resolved in the only manner in which it can be resolved, which is by reference to the Supreme Court.</P>

That raises questions about which I am uneasy.  It is a very unspecific type of measure which is open to a wide interpretation.  I fear it may lead to some abuses.  To a layman like myself the measure seems to place some onus on a defendant to satisfy the Garda as to his innocence when being questioned.  That seems to fundamentally alter two of the overriding principles in our criminal law system, that the accused is innocent until found guilty and that the duty lies on the State to prove his guilt in court and not anywhere else.  If we are seeking to set up the Garda as some type of quasi jury we are establishing a dangerous trend.  I have read what the Minister said about the background to the section and the importance he attaches to it but on balance the alleged advantages are outweighed by the dangers.  For that reason he should reconsider that measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the sections <Col N="2460" /> relating to trial procedure.  Section 19 proposes that an accused must give notice of his intention to put forward an alibi which had not been mentioned previously. That makes good sense and is fair all round.  The idea of an accused at the last moment in court trumping up an alibi does his own case little good and often leads to long and unnecessary adjournments.  It seems to frustrate the legal process.  If a person has a reasonable and valid alibi it cannot possibly hurt his case to have to give prior notice of his intention to produce such an alibi.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of majority verdicts in criminal trials.  I should like to emphasise that we are not talking about simple majorities but overwhelming majorities, ten out of 12.  That is a good measure.  It is good that in the case of a person found not guilty the question of whether the majority was unanimous or not is not disclosed because if a person is not guilty he or she should not be put in the position of appearing to have had a less than unanimous view on his or her innocence.  The Minister has introduced a good safeguard.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in section 26 to provide for the tape recording of questioning. The Minister is to issue regulations in due course about that matter.  That procedure is welcome in principle not only because it will safeguard the accused but also because it will safeguard the Garda.  I hope the Minister will make it mandatory that there will not be any questioning without a record of what transpires on tape.  Section 27 provides for the fingerprinting of those convicted of serious offences. Unfortunately, it is a fact that those who are involved in serious crime tend to get involved again and again.  It is entirely prudent and reasonable that fingerprinting of people who have been convicted of serious crimes should be kept.</P>
    <P>In the course of his Second Stage speech the Minister referred to the pros and cons of providing for searches of private homes and so on.  All western democracies &mdash; Ireland in particular &mdash; would be loath to agree such a measure if it was not necessary.  The prospect of the police barging through the door of a <Col N="2461" /> person's house is something we would be apprehensive about and it is clear that the Government are apprehensive about it also.  No proposal has been included in the Bill but the Minister has asked us to consider the question.  He has told us that his view is that where a person is suspected of having committed the most serious of crimes, murder, assaults involving grievous bodily harm, kidnapping and rape, provision should be made for entering and searching premises.  I have some sympathy with that.  One could hardly not have sympathy with that view but on balance the right of search should not arise until after a person has been charged.  That would limit the value of a search in occasional cases but it would be a better safeguard and would obviate almost entirely a search of a totally innocent party.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about the operation of criminal justice in the only area about which I know in any detail, namely, the Cork region.  While this Bill is welcome and is necessary, it is a hollow enough consolation to many people, to the Garda and the forces of law to find that the situation that exists in the courts in Cork has not been dealt with to any great extent.  The Circuit Criminal Court operates on the basis of four to five sittings per annum in Cork.  That covers a wide area, not just Cork city.  The court sits between 40 and 50 days a year and, on average, criminal cases take two or three days.  Thus, perhaps 25 or 30 cases per year are dealt with.  There are two broad categories involved.  Cases where people are remanded in custody have priority and generally they are up-to-date. However, in practice that has meant that those remanded on bail are put on a long waiting list.  I understand that now the Circuit Court is starting to deal with the 1980 cases, or will do so at the end of this year.  We are practically four years in arrears.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  We say a person is innocent until proved guilty.  In effect, we are condemning the innocent to four years of mental torture.  When on remand they are not told to forget about the matter for four years.  The process requires the defendant to appear at every <Col N="2462" /> session throughout that period and also to be legally represented with all the consequences as regards costs.</P>
    <P>I raise the matter here because I consider it has been going on for too long throughout the term of office of successive governments.  The situation is getting worse.  It will remove respect for the law and for this Bill which every reasonable person will welcome in its broad aims and objectives.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the situation that exists in Cork, which may well be repeated in other parts of the country.  For the Minister to complete his long work on this Bill and to leave the courts in the state that exists at the moment would be to only partly do the job.  I accept that the Minister is operating under difficult financial constraints but justice must be seen to operate promptly and efficiently as well as fairly.  I mentioned the agony and torture endured by innocent people for up to four years in this remand process.  There is also the other side of the coin: those who are subsequently found guilty are effectively roaming free for four years having perhaps committed very serious crimes.  In addition, it must be extremely frustrating for the victims and for the gardaí who have worked hard to get the cases to court to find that three or four years later the cases have not been dealt with.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not in any way a cure-all nor is it intended to be such.  Our vastly increased crime rate is a many-sided issue and presents a very complex problem. Some speakers have almost put that forward as a reason for not bringing in these measures but I do not think it is logical or fair to the Minister or the Bill before the House.  The crime problem has been and is being exacerbated by our current economic difficulties but there is little evidence to suggest that crimes are committed exclusively by the unemployed or the underprivileged.  The idea that economic problems automatically mean an increase in crime is not completely the case because the matter is considerably deeper and more complex.  Our crime problems are also exacerbated by the example of nearly 15 years of sickening violence, alienation and despair in <Col N="2463" /> Northern Ireland.  That has an inevitable spillover here.  Nevertheless, it is ironic that the undeniable material improvements of the past 30 years, in living standards, in education and in social services, have been accompanied recently, at any rate, by a rising wave of crime and a breakdown in standards of behaviour towards and respect for one another, particularly in built-up areas.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in any sense, will not reverse that trend.  It is a much deeper national problem which the Government, the churches, sociologists and the people in general must address and try to solve in the years ahead.  But in the meantime the Minister is right, and I think all sides of the House agree that this Bill is long overdue.  It provides some of the tools and aids, both practical and psychological, by way of deterrents and detection, which will be of great value in the front line battle against serious crime and hardened professional criminals.  Therefore, I welcome the Bill, though with some reservations, and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be brief because the Fianna Fáil approach to the Bill was set out fully by Deputy Woods in his substantial contribution earlier.  I should like to point out a few problems that occur to us.  I agree with Deputy Conveney that though the legislation is welcome, legislation of itself can do very little to combat the sort of crime wave with which we are faced.  This is not just Ireland's experience &mdash; it is being experienced throughout the world.</P>
      <P>When we come to deal with crime, particularly the serious professional type, we require a far more sophisticated police investigation system and better trained personnel.  We need a more efficient prison system of which, recently, we saw a breakdown.  We need a more efficient judicial system to cope with offences when they come to trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the three elements necessary are more personnel, a more efficient police system and the courts.  In regard to the courts, I suggest that we should have greater utilisation of them and greater <Col N="2464" /> use made of the time of judges and district justices.  There is a notable lack of despatch in regard to bringing people to trial and the sentencing of them.  For instance, we have not considered a new radical approach whereby a judicial system would be available for 24 hours a day in metropolitan centres, as exists in London, where people can be brought promptly before the courts for a whole range of minor offences that do not require trial by jury.  In London and in other British cities, and almost universally throughout the world, courts sit around the clock.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why our courts, concerned to deal with petty crime and vandalism which occur during the night in metropolitan areas, could not sit around the clock to try them and hand out sentences immediately?  Therefore, I would welcome the appointment of more district justices in the metropolitan area, longer sittings in which several judges would participate because I realise we could not expect one district justice to sit around the clock.  We also need more courthouse facilities, but above all we need the assurance this would give to the Garda who are now frustrated by delays in bringing offenders to trial.  To provide this 24-hour service, justices would have to work on a rota or shift basis.  This would get rid of the continual adjournments, procrastination, the delays, particularly in regard to minor crime which, oddly enough, affects people most&mdash;stealing cars, assaulting people, minor larcenies and burglaries.  That is the type of crime that takes up so much of the time of the Garda and which frustrates them.  Apart from the provision of proper prison facilities, a key element is speedy trial and conviction in respect of minor offences.  I appreciate that when a crime merits more than five years' imprisonment the procedure should be slower.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil would have liked to see side by side with this legislation a Bill to deal with the complaints procedure. We appreciate it was not possible to incorporate details of such a procedure in this legislation but we should have a parallel Bill so that we could consider both simultaneously.  That would have <Col N="2465" /> shown evidence of goodwill by the Minister and it would have set many people's minds at rest because they could then see the whole picture of the penal procedures in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is much detail in the Bill which can be given detailed examination on Committee Stage.  This is obvious from the attitude we on this side have adopted. In broad principle we agree with the Bill subject, of course, to Committee Stage scrutiny.  We agree with the Government that some legislation to strengthen the hands of the law authorities is essential. Indeed it is rather ironical that when I was Minister for Justice 15 years ago we had the bones of this Bill ready in the Department.  However, it is better late than never.  Perhaps it took the crime wave of recent years to underline the importance of the matter.</P>
    <P>One of the main features concerns detention and we agree in principle with that aspect.  We may have some ideas on Committee Stage in regard to detail but certainly it is necessary to have a period of detention for serious crime, that is, crime meriting five or more years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Due to a Supreme Court decision some years ago there has been a difficulty with regard to the granting of bail.  That decision was based on an interpretation of the Constitution and it was found that bail was a matter of right.  One way of dealing with the problem would be by an amendment of the Constitution, but that would be a rather heavy handed approach.  We have at present the ludicrous situation where people are getting bail for the asking and then proceeding to commit other offences while on bail, in many cases putting themselves in funds for their legal defence.  An attempt is being made to deal with the problem by providing in the Bill for consecutive rather than concurrent sentences for offences committed while on bail, thus getting rid of the present anomaly whereby the sentence for the offence committed while on bail is concurrent with the sentence for the original offence.  There are further penalties for failure to surrender to bail and the sentence for that also will <Col N="2466" /> be consecutive.  This is a reasonable approach.</P>
    <P>New penalties apply to two areas of crime which have reached very serious proportions, particularly in Dublin.  I refer to the stealing and damaging of motor vehicles and to the alarming increase in the use of firearms.  These areas are specifically dealt with in the Bill and increased penalties are provided.</P>
    <P>The feature of the Bill which has aroused the strongest criticism from the legal fraternity relates to the right to silence.  I can understand the reasons for this and I agree that the right to silence will no longer be the absolute right it has been heretofore.  For many years there has been in common law an absolute right to silence on the part of an accused person. That right was protected in the courts because no reference could be made to the fact that the accused person made no statement on his apprehension. The court and the jury could not comment on that aspect.  Under this Bill inferences can be drawn by the court from the failure of the accused to mention or account for certain matters.  Up to now no such inference could be made but the court or jury may now draw inferences as appear proper if the accused offers an explanation at his trial which he could reasonably have been expected to mention to the Garda when being questioned or charged, or if he fails or refuses to account for any object, substance or mark or for his presence in a particular place at or about the time at which the offence was committed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the right to silence, the only thing that is provided in the Bill is that the absolute right to silence, which has existed up to this and was such an absolute right that it could not be referred to by the court or brought to the jury's attention, is now being modified. While the accused still has the right to silence certain inferences can now be drawn from that by the court and by the jury.  There are certain protections written <Col N="2467" /> into the section that no inference can be drawn unless the accused is told in ordinary language at the relevant time what the effect of such failure might be. There is a specific provision that the accused may not be convicted solely on such an inference.  At the same time it is an important change in the law.</P>
      <P>I suggest that some change in the law in this direction is necessary for a very important reason.  The big danger to society from modern crime is that much of the serious crime is no longer of a casual nature.  Serious crime tends more and more to be a professionally organised business where people go into it for big commercial profits like in the drug pushing area.  Those people are fully advised and are fully calculating.  They approach the whole matter in a very calculated way.  The most obvious thing for them to do as professional criminals is not to say anything, do nothing, point out nothing and not give any explanation, just total non-co-operation with the police force. If that is done in a calculated and professional way and no inference can be drawn from it in regard to an explanation not given that is a very serious deterrent regarding the ultimate conviction of the person concerned.  The evidence must be strictly limited in that type of case to what the police found on the particular scene. Provided the accused person says nothing, points out nothing, and does not give any explanation, provided his trial is defended on that basis with the type of skill a professional criminal can hire, it is difficult to get a conviction.  That is the reality in regard to serious professional crime at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is an attempt to deal with that. It is an attempt to allow the court and the jury to draw inferences from a non-cooperative approach on the part of an accused person while at the same time providing that that alone is not sufficient to convict a person.  There must be the hard evidence that is required in all such cases to prove a case but the fact of silence and the fact of non-co-operation can be raised by the court and brought to the attention of the jury for them to draw their inferences from those facts as ancillary <Col N="2468" /> evidence to the main evidence of hard proof, which will always be essential.</P>
    <P>This is a very difficult concept to bring into our law in the sense that the common law has traditionally held its right of silence.  It has been in the European system of law for centuries.  It is a step towards the inquisitorial system which operates in continental countries.  I welcome this provision but we must look at it very carefully on Committee Stage.  It is an important legal step in the amendment of the criminal law as it existed for many years.  Section 16 takes up a whole page, section 17 also takes up a page and section 18 takes up almost a page.  The drafting of those sections appears to me to be cumbersome.  I appreciate the difficulties involved in this very important change in our criminal law.  We will have to look at it carefully on Committee Stage because I have a feeling that those sections will be a lawyer's paradise at some future date in regard to interpretation. We may find ourselves getting into deeper legal trouble in regard to interpretation and we may find that we are not getting to the problem which needs to be dealt with.  That is a matter for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In principle I am in favour of the attempt to grapple with this problem.  I recognise the need to do something about this because of the growth of professional crime.  I am making a cautionary few remarks and saying that this will have to be examined very carefully on Committee Stage unless we leave a legacy which will find these sections going up and down from Criminal Courts to Courts of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court and so on over a period of years.  We do not want that.  We have waited long enough for this Bill and it is important that we get it right.</P>
    <P>The other major area of reform in regard to court procedure lies in the actual trial procedure reforms which are set out from section 19 on.  These reforms are generally welcome as far as we are concerned.  The important one, which is the most radical from the point of view of making a change in the criminal law, is that majority verdicts are now being <Col N="2469" /> introduced for the first time.  This is not really a radical departure in the sense that ten jurors out of 12 must vote for conviction.  Indeed there is an argument for having a nine to three majority and ten to two is a modest departure from the present unanimous majority verdict.  No real injustice will be done if ten people find for conviction.  There is no doubt that it will get rid of the odd crank who sometimes sits on juries, who digs his heels in and refuses to agree with the majority even though the evidence may be overwhelming against the accused. This can cause a serious injustice when you consider the cost of apprehension and bringing to trial a criminal who is obviously guilty.  As far as we are concerned this is a welcome provision.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise our support for the Bill in principle, especially in regard to crime in the Dublin metropolitan area where, with 30 per cent of the population we have 60 per cent of crime.  This is very alarming and is causing serious social disturbance and apprehension to the ordinary citizens of Dublin city and county.  It is a situation that any government would have to cope with and, because we recognise it as a serious social problem, the Government should be facilitated with this Bill subject to amendments which we will suggest on Committee Stage.  We recognise the basic need for a Bill of this kind to strengthen the hands of the Garda Síochána, the courts and everyone associated with the apprehension, bringing to trial and conviction of criminals.</P>
    <P>I should like to come back to a point which I made initially that, however welcome the principle of the Bill and even if the legislation will be effective, it is only an umbrella.  The real work has to be done in the area of administrative reforms, the Garda Síochána, the prisons and the courts.  We do not want legislation for that, it means better training, better equipment, more personnel, a more sophisticated approach, more court sittings, more judges, more courthouses and more immediate and speedy trials. The whole area of administrative reform in regard to the operation of our legal and judicial system is far more important than any legislation this House can bring <Col N="2470" /> in.  Legislation can be a help but, unless the basic administrative judicial machine is working effectively and efficiently, then society will not be able to get to grips with the crime that exists at present in our urban areas, particularly in Dublin.  Unless we get this area right within the next few years, there will be no economic investment or jobs in this country.  The important thing as far as jobs, investment and social progress are concerned, is that we live in a free society where citizens as a normal rule behave and, when they do not, they are brought to justice quickly and fairly.  Unless that last factor is operating and seen to be operating effectively by people at home and abroad who wish to live and invest here, we will not make economic or social progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons for this Bill and the total explosion in our crime levels today are startling.  If we look at the statistics for crime from the crime reports by the Garda Commissioner to the Minister for Justice from 1980 to date, we can see that crime is the fastest growth sector in our economy.  How tragic this is.  The total indictable offences committed and recorded &mdash; this excludes of course the number of unrecorded crimes &mdash; in 1980 was 72,782; in 1981 it was 89,400 and in 1982 it was 97,626.  If we look at the sub-division of these very serious crimes we will see that in 1980-81 larceny and fraud had the highest growth under the overall heading and in 1981-82 we see the viciousness of the new crime wave in terms of violence against people and property as the highest growth rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Underlying all this in the urban areas we see the startling situation in relation to drugs.  The number of seizures in 1982 over 1981 increased by 55 per cent, from 1,204 to 1,873 and the number of persons found with drugs in their possession increased by 26 per cent, from 1,256 to 1,593.  We do not need to look at the statistics to analyse how serious the problem is and how fast it is growing.  We see the total waste of resources that the Government have to expend to deal with the problem.  Expenditure for the Garda Síochána in 1980-82 was £191 million. <Col N="2471" /> This had to be increased in excess of £21 million to £213 million to combat the crime wave.</P>
    <P>In relation to the prison service, expenditure is now at the rate of £48.3 million and the total expenditure to fight crime is almost £300 million.  This is a terrible waste of money which could solve many problems including expenditure in productive areas in industry and agriculture. However, building up our resources in terms of education and community facilities cannot be tackled because we have to fight this malaise in our society.</P>
    <P>I come from a constituency in County Wexford that might be perceived to have a very placid relationship with crime. Unfortunately, if we look at the figures for 1981 and 1982 from the same report on crime, we see that outside the Dublin metropolitan area, Wexford as a county and a Garda subdivision has the fourth highest crime rate.  When one considers that the first, second and third outside the Dublin metropolitan area is Cork-Limerick, Louth and Meath, we see that outside major urban and Border areas, the reality is that County Wexford has a very serious crime rate in relation to and in comparison with other parts of the country.  For 1981 the total number of indictable offences was 2,643.  That was a 15.4 per cent increase on 1980.  In 1982 there was a reduction of more than 6 per cent when the number of indictable offences was 2,478.  Although there was substantial improvement in the detection rate between 1981 and 1982, the situation in this regard is not satisfactory.  In that time the detection rate in Wexford increased to 39.8 per cent.  This figure is above the national average and to that extent the Garda in Wexford are to be complimented but the reality is that the level of detection is about one-third of the crimes committed.  What satisfaction can any member of the public have in reporting crimes to the Garda if there is only a one-in-three chance of a successful follow-up and prosecution?</P>
    <P>If we look at the overall situation in relation to violence we find that the rate is of epidemic proportions.  No matter how serious crimes are we tend to forget <Col N="2472" /> about them quickly irrespective of the media coverage given to them at the time. How many people, for instance, can recall the name of the young girl whose picture appeared in the Sunday papers after her face had been burned badly by other young people?  I recall that her name was Victoria Mullarkey but I cannot recall the name of the adolescent who was knocked down during a car chase which followed a post office robbery in Malahide.  The point I am trying to make is that unless there is a very serious crime, such as a murder, it goes almost unnoticed and unreported.  This is because society today is conditioned to crime. There are no figures available in respect of the level of non-reported petty crime so we can only gauge that the rate in that respect is at least double, if not treble the statistics that are on public record in respect of serious crime.</P>
    <P>The question is what the Government can do to ensure that there is a level of law and order.  There was a three-pronged approach to this question in our <i>Programme for Government</i>.  The first aspect related to the introduction of the Bill that is before us now.  Then there was the recommendation that there be better community policing co-operation facilities while the third facet was the establishment of a Garda authority who would be independent.  I wish to put on record my total personal opposition to any such proposal.  The Minister for Justice has a vital role to play in the relationship between the Oireachtas, which represents the basis of our democracy, and the Garda in carrying out their duty.  If the Minister were to remove himself from that role by way of the setting up of an independent Garda authority, he would be taking a very dangerous step and one that would reduce public confidence in the Garda.  Therefore, I call on the Minister to ensure that that aspect of the Government programme is not pursued.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there are areas in which the establishment of a police commission could be considered, something on the lines of the Royal Commission in Britain, a commission that relate to the management and the effectiveness of the police force in the context of the force being run <Col N="2473" /> on a businesslike basis.  I would applaud any similar move here but an independent police authority would not be welcome.</P>
    <P>Regarding the public attitude as to how the crime rate is to be dealt with, it is interesting to note the results of a poll conducted by Irish Marketing Surveys in April this year.  Very startlingly, by comparison with any other poll in any other area, that poll showed that 81 per cent of all those questioned considered the administration of justice by the courts to be too lenient.  Only 2 per cent indicated that they considered the system to be too harsh while 8 per cent said they did not know whether it was too harsh or too lenient.  That figure of 8 per cent is remarkably low but the reaction of the 81 per cent in saying that the administration of justice is too lenient provides this House with an overwhelming mandate to proceed with legislation such as is contained in the Bill before us.  If one examines the figures closely one finds that the common trend of four-fifths of those questioned being supportive of extra powers for the Garda was common among the various socio-economic groups.  One might expect young people, for instance, to be more liberal or people from a rural background to be more lenient in that they do not have to experience the very high crime rate of Dublin and other cities but that was not the case.  The same applies to the different socio-economic groupings.  Whereas one might think that people coming from the socio-economic group from whom a large proportion of criminals are alleged to come, would consider the present situation to be adequate, there was no such indication in the survey.  Those people also considered the present situation to be too lenient.  Therefore, there is public support for the Bill and I am glad there is all-party support for it, too.</P>
    <P>However, some Members have said that some of the measures in the Bill are not only draconian but that the Bill does not address the fundamental problems, the socio-economic reasons for the commission of crime&mdash;unemployment, deprivation, bad housing and so on.  Most of the Members who have expressed those <Col N="2474" /> views happen to belong to the legal profession.  I am not insensitive to these various problems.  The Government as a whole must be concerned about them but it is worth repeating time and again the reality that wrong is wrong.  Regardless of circumstances, there is no excuse for anyone to commit a crime against a fellow human being.  There is no excuse for taking the law into one's own hands.  If a Government become soft on the fundamental principle of self respect and of respecting others as one respects one self, they sow the seeds whereby society will eventually perish.</P>
    <P>On the Bill itself, it is my opinion that for some years past the balance of the administration of justice as between the victim and the criminal has been lopsided. This Bill will redress that imbalance. On the one hand it proposes effective deterrents and detection measures in relation to the investigative powers of the Garda but that is balanced with the continued provision of measures that are in many cases embodied in the Constitution. I contend the balance within the provisions of the Bill between the fundamental rights of individuals and the improved powers to the Garda are maintained. In dealing with the various sections. I hope to illustrate that that balance is maintained, is fair and will meet the desired objectives.</P>
    <P>The Bill had been promised by every Government since 1976.  Indeed in 1967 we can recall the abortive Bill of the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Moran.  Some speakers have said there should have been a White Paper issued as a prerequisite to publication of the Bill.  There has been enough talk, sufficient commitments. Deputy Lenihan said that the bones of this Bill were being prepared in the Department of Justice over 15 years ago, when he was Minister for Justice. The reality is that there have been many commitments, many tangible, party election commitments since 1976.  Now is the time for action and to have the Bill passed.  There is no need for any such prerequisite.</P>
    <P>Many speakers in relation to this Bill and indeed to others &mdash; one thinks immediately here of Deputy John Kelly &mdash; compared our situation with that in <Col N="2475" /> Great Britain and to what they are doing to deal with their problems.  Some speakers have contended that we simply copied their system.  Some contended that Britain had tried various aspects of extra powers in relation to bail, inferences and so on and that they have not proceeded with them.  I should like to illustrate the difference in our respective situations in relation to the background to this Bill, the difference between what has happened in recent years between Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>As we are aware, they have no written Constitution in Britain.  They have had a regular review and updating of their criminal law which included also amendment of the judges' rules, which incorporated various police Acts, Prevention of Terrorism Acts, Ministerial Orders by the Home Office and continuous adjustments by the Royal Commission in relation to the management and effectiveness of their police.  In Ireland there has been no major criminal law reform since 1951. Any adjustments effected have been solely in the area of dealing with subversive crime.  Here one thinks immediately of the emergency powers provisions, the Offences Against the State Act.  The reality of our situation is that the Garda have had to use these powers, they being the only ones available to them, in the rigours of their investigative work basically under a false pretence in so far as perhaps such crimes bore no relationship to subversive activity.  Such provisions were the only straws the Garda could clutch at and operate under.</P>
    <P>Compared with the British gradual tightening up and progression of their criminal law, here there have been major reversals of our criminal law in relation to constitutional Supreme Court decisions.  One recalls the Justice O'Callaghan decision in relation to bail in 1966 under which bail could no longer be denied any suspect seeking bail on the basis that he would commit another crime while on bail.  Effectively that decision led to a situation in which, as Deputy Lenihan said, there is a direct incentive to people to go and pay for their expenses <Col N="2476" /> by committing another felony while on bail.</P>
    <P>The second area of legal judical change here relating to the Supreme Court was in 1965 when it was decided that confessions, incriminating statements and so on by a suspect and used as evidence in the court case would be considered inadmissable by the courts because they were there on unlawful detention.  The only way the Garda could get the evidence was by asking a suspect voluntarily to give evidence.  Therefore, between the 1965 Supreme Court decision and the other court decision of 1981 &mdash; which ruled that a suspect must be totally informed in common language of his or her rights &mdash; the reality of the situation is that the Garda have had both their hands tied behind their backs; they cannot operate.  If we contrast that with the British system we can see readily that it is not fair to draw any comparisons until we get the fundamentals of our criminal law and administrative justice on a par with theirs.  There is a major difference between the two systems, British and Irish.  We have a lot of catching up to do in order to deal with our crime rate the way they have done but we can use their experiences usefully and constructively for our purposes.  I hope this Bill will go a long way towards redressing that difference in our respective systems.</P>
    <P>The powers of arrest and detention in section 3 and other sections have caused most controversy amongst the media and other interested groups.  These provisions have been much criticised.  But I maintain that the particularly tough provisions of this Bill are balanced.  I might recall, first of all, that the 1978 O'Briain Report recommended that these powers of arrest and detention be implemented.  But the present reality is that if a garda suspects somebody of a certain crime and has certain, shall we say, circumstantial evidence of that suspicion, the time scale within which the Garda have powers to arrest, charge and get the suspect to the court is so limited it constitutes an impossible condition imposed on them.  The reality is that the current investigative faciflities of the Garda are simply laughable. But if one accepts the argument <Col N="2477" /> advanced that these are draconian provisions that will impinge on the basic fundamental civil liberties of the individual, I would contend that they are balanced in many ways.  There is, first of all, the right to information in relation to one's rights.  There is then the right to inform a third party, be that one's solicitor or whoever.  There is a balance maintained also in relation to the provision with regard to tape recording and other facilities.  There is then the right to have recourse to the independent complaints tribunal to which I shall refer later.  There is also the right to a written notice of when questioning commences and ceases.  There is also the right to rest periods without having any stop-go harassment. The powers of detention are reasonable, balanced and incorporate the basic provision of having a responsible superintendent or a chief superintendent &mdash; in relation to re-arrest &mdash; show reasonable cause and produce necessary evidence as to why a person was detained in the first place.  I would maintain that all of these constitute an effective balance.</P>
    <P>There are, then, the provisions in relation to bail and stiffer penalties, the consecutive sentencing &mdash; to abscond on bail being deemed to be a felony in itself. There are also the provisions contained in section 12 dealing with the theft of cars and those in section 13 dealing with penalties for certain firearms offences.  Basically these are non-controversial provisions. Bearing in mind one of the more recent robberies in Galway when £184,000 was robbed from a post office it will be seen that the day and age in which crime at that level is perpetrated by amateurs has gone.  Rather they arrive with submachine guns, invariably dressed as gardaí, and nobody will be allowed to remain in their way very long.  In regard to the theft of cars, the joy-riding situation is one in which there is serious potential danger to the public, innocent bystanders, ordinary civilians, and is such that no penalty would be sufficiently tough.  However the provisions of this Bill go some way towards alleviating that situation.  Also the reality of the situation with regard to most robberies is that stolen cars are used which occasions delay <Col N="2478" /> and makes matters more difficult for the Garda in following up such cases.  These provisions, therefore, are the bare essentials required.</P>
    <P>One other provision which has been much criticised is that of the right to silence.  The media, the Council for Civil Liberties, the conference of major religious superiors and other groups all have been lobbying us contending that this constitutes a fundamental change in civil liberties.  I might remind such people that the provisions of sections 15, 16 and 17, relating to inferences, are along the lines recommended by the O'Briain Report in 1978.  Furthermore, I would suggest they do not impinge on the rights of any individual. I reject the allegation that there is any new principle involved here.  If there is a disparity between the evidence given by somebody in a Garda station and that given by that person in court surely it is only commonsense that people will draw an implication therefrom.  If somebody is seen in a certain place at a certain time surely it is only commonsense that inferences will be drawn from that.  For example, if somebody is seen with, say, blood stains on his shirt, or whatever&mdash;incriminating circumstantial evidence&mdash;this should be used also as evidence by implication and inference. The reality of the situation is that the present procedures in our courts already take account of that.  This Bill may spell it out in certain terms but the reality is that there is no fundamental change involved here.  This is a commonsense provision that prevents people getting off on a technicality.  Again I would contend that the balance to preserve the fundamental rights of our accusatorial system exist, namely, the inferences provision here cannot constitute the sole cause of a conviction.  That is a fundamental right of a suspect.  Therefore there must be other evidence, evidence given by another person that will indict.  Suspects are advised from the beginning in the Garda station of the implications of their different evidence in court and so on, so they are under no misapprehension.  The third point is that they still retain the total, consistent right to silence.  They may say nothing from beginning to end. <Col N="2479" /> Nobody can force them to speak.  Therefore to contend that there is a basic infringement of the right to silence is incorrect.</P>
    <P>Finally I would contend that the inferences that can be drawn in a court case can be drawn only on the recommendation of a judge.  They cannot be drawn at the whim of a crank juror.  They can be drawn only on the basis of the experienced and shrewd opinion of the judge who is doing his best to ensure that the punishment fits the crime.  People have alleged that the fundamental aspect of our accusatorial system is being changed to an inquisitorial one, where the shift of onus is such that people have to answer to their accusors, is such that people are no longer innocent until proven guilty.  I reject that allegation totally.  There is inbuilt in the provision sufficient balance to retain the rights of a suspect which will overcome the reality of so many people getting off on technicalities. People cannot draw logical conclusions from circumstantial evidence given to the courts.  It is a commonsense change only.  The reality is that many people are getting off on technicalities because people cannot draw logical conclusions from circumstantial evidence given to the court.  That is only a commonsense change.</P>
    <P>There are other basic provisions in the Bill dealing with trial procedures that are non-controversial&mdash;the ten days' notice for an alibi is only compatible with the same constraints that are on the Garda in relation to the book of evidence.  The majority verdicts of juries is a commonsense provision, and I have not seen anybody oppose it; and the abolition of the unsworn statements is also non-con-tentious. These measures are up-dating criminal justice law.</P>
    <P>Even if it was draconian or was an avenue for the Garda to abuse their powers and pursue a rigorous course of injustice, as some Deputies mentioned, the reality is that the fundamental provision and commitment to retaining all sections of this Bill by ministerial order on the basis of agreement by the independent complaints tribunal&mdash;could not be said to <Col N="2480" /> lead to a shift in onus that denies people their fundamental constitutional rights. This raises a question mark over the ulterior motives of those who are casting such a slur on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Our society is protected and defended by the Garda.  Before I was elected to this House I always worked on the principle that I would never ask anybody to do what I would not do myself, but the reality is that we ask the gardaí to do what many members of the community, including Members of this House, would not do.  The gardaí are the front line of our defence.  They are unarmed, unprotected and constrained by law as to what they can and cannot do.  It would be remiss of me not to pay a public tribute to the Garda for the work they have done.  We have a lot to be thankful for. I would like to put on record my appreciation of the ability and commitment of Mr. Derek Nally, who is about to retire as general secretary of the AGSI.  He has tried to ensure that the provisions of this Bill will be enforced.  He has done terrific work and is to be commended.  I will refer briefly to the statement on this Bill issued by the AGSI, although I will not go into the list of amendments they propose in detail because time does not permit, but on Committee Stage these matters can be considered.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Independent Complaints Tribunal there should be the fullest possible consultation, deliberation and agreement with the AGSI and other Garda representative bodies to ensure that the time table within which this will operate will not put this House in a position where, if legislation is not required, we will not have a chance to comment on it.  I hope the Minister will make a full statement on the matter at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>The AGSI make the point that the tape recording of interviews should be done on the basis of full consultation.  They point out also to omissions in the Bill.  As these are the people on the ground dealing with these crimes, their views must be respected.  They have said that there are no general provisions in this Bill for hot pursuit searches.  They are tied up in red tape.  We cannot have a pilot scheme for <Col N="2481" /> the hot pursuit of a murderer but in certain areas we will have to trust the Garda and allow search of premises without warrant in cases of murder where the Garda have reasonable grounds to suspect that a person or material evidence is in such premises.</P>
    <P>The carrying of knives, flick knives and similar articles with intent to commit a felony should be described as offensive weapons.  People who carry such weapons would have nothing but malicious intent and it would be a good thing if it was made clear to these people that carrying these weapons, even to threaten people, is wrong because there is a certain inevitability about it and sooner or later these weapons will be used.  We should concur with the AGSI on this matter.  Another point they raise relates to the judges' rules.  It is unclear as to what power the Minister for Justice has in relation to the amendment of the judges' rules but, where appropriate, discussions should take place with the appropriate representative bodies of the Judiciary to ensure that whatever rules need to be amended to enable Garda to get fair play, should be amended.</P>
    <P>I have made my substantive comments on the Bill and would like to mention some specific proposals of my own to combat crime.  In our <i>Programme for Government</i> there is a commitment to enforce the proposals published earlier this year by the AGSI for community policing. Coupled with this is the question of night watch committees.  We have seen the involvement of vigilante groups especially in urban areas and people are almost taking the law into their own hands.  This must be rejected and it can only undermine the work of the Garda. However, the suggestions in relation to a community watch are positive, helpful and constructive and should be pursued by way of some sort of public forum which should be open to everyone in the country where people can put forward their proposals in conjunction with the Garda, where they will be listened to at local and national levels and whereby a policy will be implemented to build up a relationship between local communities <Col N="2482" /> and the Garda.  The Garda cannot be everywhere and because of the strain on their purse and resources proper watch facilities should be provided.</P>
    <P>The second proposal which should be implemented outside this Bill to deal with the crime rate is the professional management of the Garda and their whole efficiency.  We have the Conroy Commission proposals of 1970 and the Ryan report.  These reports make many recommendations in relation to recruitment, training, management, efficiency changes and so on.  The provisions of these reports should be implemented.  A police commission should be set up on an on-going basis to look at inefficiencies in the Garda.  If I go into a Garda station I may see a garda typing with one finger, as I would myself if I had to type.  What a waste of Garda resources that is.  We have CAs, COs, clerk typists and so on who should be decentralised from other State Departments, where they are possibly underutilised, and put into Garda stations and used effectively so that the management and effectiveness of the Garda, given their existing resources, can be improved.</P>
    <P>In relation to the crackdown on crime, there is a need to look at the whole area of parental responsibility.  Over the last 17 years we have seen a threefold increase in juvenile crime.  I define juvenile crimes as those committed by offenders under 17 years of age.  In 1981 convictions for juvenile crime amounted to approximately 20,000.  In our constituencies we see that crimes such as smashing of telephone kiosks are taken for granted.  In such cases the continental method of making the parents of juvenile criminals responsible for paying for damage done by their children should be considered. We have provision for malicious damages and the reality is that the State picks up the tab for these offenders. There is here a great argument for law reform and placing a proportion of the responsibility on the parents who would be more effective in dealing with their youngsters, straightening them out and ensuring that they do not repeat the crime than would any number of outsiders such as gardaí or administrators.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2483" /> Another area which is not dealt with in this Bill &mdash; I am not saying it should be but it needs to be dealt with &mdash; is white-collar crime.  The growth of fraudulent financial criminal activity is alarming. The Companies Act, 1963, and the Copyright Act, 1963, need to be amended because the penalties they provide are simply ridiculous.  The House is probably aware that, for instance, under the Copyright Act the pirating of tapes &mdash; videotapes, films and so on &mdash; brings in vast profits.  What is the penalty for conviction under this Act?  It is a fine from a minimum of £5 to a draconian maximum of £100.  An amendment should be introduced immediately in respect of both of these Acts to multiply all the fine amounts by five or ten to deal with this level of white-collar crime, which is hard to detect and by the time it is detected in the books the people responsible have long since absconded with their money to some sunny part of the world.  This must be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>There is enormous potential for dealing with crime in the area of private security firms.  Given the real constraints on public expenditure at present we must look at the way armed robberies have developed.  They started off with jewellers and about two years ago every newspaper you picked up had news of some jeweller being robbed.  The Garda and private security firms tightened up on security for jewellers and the robbers moved to the banks.  Then the banks tightened up, they employed security firms with their vans and closed circuit television and the criminals then moved to the post offices.  It might be no harm if someone in the Garda did a little market research on where these criminals will go next.  That may sound a little like turning the argument on its head, but professional criminal activity will find another loophole.  With the limited Department of Justice and Garda resources there is a strong argument for using Templemore Training Unit to train private security firm employees and to use the private security firms on the basis of an overlap, so that where malicious <Col N="2484" /> damages claims are made against the public the insurance companies, the security firms and the Garda could have discussions at national level to come up with some system whereby the Garda and security firms would do routine protection. There should be the fullest co-operation and business interests should negotiate their security needs in conjunction with private security firms and the Garda.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the prison situation.  The Minister for Justice said earlier this year that 1,200 people would be released from prison before the end of their sentences would be reached.  I understand that the numbers in our prisons at present are approximately 1,500 and that we have the third lowest detention rate in prisons in Europe.  We have passing through our prisons about 7,000 per year aged between 15 and 29 years most of whom are serving sentences of less than one year.  We have 11 prisons.  Mountjoy Jail has a capacity for 430 persons and at present is housing 475.  There are alarming stories of drug trafficking in St. Patrick's Institution and Mountjoy. There are 1,500 prison officers.  There is something radically wrong with the prison service.  All the public information to date suggests that we cannot hold convicted criminals long enough, if at all.  We have not enough jails.  We have too many prison officers.  We have approximately 1,500 and some times fewer&mdash;prisoners and we have 1,500 prison officers.  That is a one to one ratio.  I cannot understand that.  Some of these prisoners are only just passing through.  I am not reflecting on the present dispute.  I am just saying there needs to be some form, whether through the media or elsewhere, of major investigation into our incarceration needs in terms of prison security.  There needs to be a major public report as to why the ratio of prison officers to prisoners is so low and why we cannot detain prisoners. We have the lowest detention rate in Europe.  We have dangerous criminals being let out because we do not have enough prisons to hold them.  We are spending approximately £50 million. What is happening?  There needs to be a major restructuring and enlargement of prison facilities.  We need to have discipline <Col N="2485" /> all along the line through the Army, the Garda and the prison officers.  We need an interaction between these three vital arms of national security.  We need proper training and management, plus a programme of development, in our prisons. All the provisions in existing legislation, all the provisions in this Bill, will be useless unless we have the back-up facilities.  The statistics I have studied do not add up.  They portray an alarming story of mismanagement, bad policy decisions and an urgent need for action. I hope that sooner rather than later this action will take place.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Garda, it was announced about a year ago there would be a national rural communication security system.  I understand this works on a radio telephone link with a rural Garda station interconnected with 18 other stations. There is two-way communication. In tourist resorts in the summer the problem of crime is many times worse than it is in the winter and these proposed facilities should be put into operation then to ensure communication between the public and the Garda and to ensure there is a better utilisation of the personnel on the ground.  To my mind this is a cheap way and the best way of getting an effective service on the ground.  There should be no delay in implementing this system and I trust the Minister will comment on this when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>There is a report that there are strict overtime limits on the Garda Technical Bureau.  After five o'clock in the evening and over weekends there are severe limits imposed.  Given the constraints on the Garda outlined, I would ask the Minister to deal with this allegation because it highlights to me an extremely dangerous situation.  Would it be possible to work a rostering system to ensure the availability of the full technical expertise requisite to deal with prfessional criminals after five o'clock in the evening and over weekends?</P>
    <P>There needs to be a change of attitude towards the Garda.  I am appalled at the reaction of quite a number of people who, if they hear of a minor impropriety, are so willing to impute something quite major against the Garda.  One hears a <Col N="2486" /> story of a certain level of impropriety taking place in a barracks and then one hears someone like Deputy Andrews yesterday reading out a letter from a constituent who was picked up by a Garda car and beaten up.  Too many of us have this very strange willingness to believe these allegations.  I wonder why.  I am not saying there is not a small minority who may from time to time abuse their position, but I maintain that the vast majority are reasonable, responsible, law respecting individuals doing a good job.</P>
    <P>But attitudes seem to have changed and, as I say, too many people are willing to believe any and every allegation.  Possibly it may arise from the fact that student demonstrators of the 1960s are now leader writers in newspapers or perhaps it is some sort of disillusionment of the middle classes or whatever; but there does need to be a public relations job done on the Garda to allay what are, in my opinion, falsities in relation to their operations.  One of the practical ways of doing this, as well as a public relations exercise would be for the gardaí on the ground to use their discretion.  One often hears stories of someone who is stopped by gardaí flashing a light&mdash;I was actually stopped myself one night recently&mdash;and the gardaí looking for bicycle lights, indicators working properly, sidelights and all the rest of it.  They ask why one is not wearing a seat belt and so on.  They are dealing with ordinary people and, while these things are important in their own way, I believe there could be a greater discretion exercised.  The goodwill of the public is dependent on the exercise of discretion.  The full resources of the Garda should be used against serious criminals and not directed towards ordinary people.  I know they use their discretion, but all their resources should really be directed against the criminal.</P>
    <P>It is important, I think, that gardaí should reside in areas of social deprivation where they would be part of the community instead of living in suburbia in nice, cushy middle class areas.  The result is they do not understand the problems in deprived areas and they may have a biased attitude.  There should be a positive policy and houses should be provided <Col N="2487" /> for them in certain areas to enable them to familiarise themselves with conditions as they exist.  Again, I believe it would pay a dividend if gardaí invited the media to travel with them on their day's work.  That would improve communications and help in bettering relations generally between the public and the Garda.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the arguments both for and against this Bill.  It has been alleged by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties that the administration of justice will in future be removed from the courts to the police station.  I regret that argument on the basis of the arguments I have mentioned and on the reality of the situation in that there will be this independent tribunal.  We have had no criminal law reform of a major character since 1951. Our criminal law in that period dealt only with subversives.  Review is long overdue. With the erosion of power as a result of Supreme Court decisions our only powers are those dealing with subversives. Here today we are updating the criminal aspect <i>in toto</i>.  This is timely and proper.  The Garda at the moment have both hands tied behind their backs.  They are dependent upon voluntary statements, on people offering to come into the station and saying: &ldquo;Yes, I did it.&rdquo; They have no other way of getting the evidence.  Again, there is the time-scale limitation.  They have to get the submission together &mdash; the arrest, the charge and so on &mdash; straightaway.  The provisions in this Bill will result in giving a balanced view to the public and will ensure that the system is fair and we can crack down on crime.</P>
    <P>Only last week in Massachussets there was a debate as to when a police officer should fire his gun.  The conclusion was drawn that for certain felonies the policy should be to shoot first and ask questions afterwards, but the consensus of opinion was that he should shoot the second time he got the impulse.  If this House is bypassed by the godfathers of crime, if people see fit to take the law into their own hands and the ordinary, decent, law-abiding citizen's protection is disregarded, in years to come we will have no choice.  If people can arrive in Eyre <Col N="2488" /> Square, in Galway armed with submachine guns and revolvers, the Garda will be armed likewise.  It is unthinkable now that our Garda force would be armed, or that special task forces would become commonplace.  However, unless responsible, remedial measures such as in this Bill are taken, that will be the result.  On the basis of prevention rather than treatment, i commend this Bill to the house and assure the Government of my support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this legislation, the most important to come before the House for a very long time.  The issues are very complicated and wide-ranging. When this Bill is finally passed it will be seen by the public, the Garda force and all concerned as the attempt of this House to deal with a very difficult problem in our society.</P>
      <P>In the period from 1972 to 1981, crime increased by 127 per cent.  Rapes alone increased by 96 per cent and that includes only the reported cases.  It is widely believed that the majority of cases of rape are not reported because of what the woman would be subjected to in bringing the case to court.  The crime detection rate in 1972 was 43 per cent; today it is 33 per cent.  In 1981 the detection rate for murder was 100 per cent; today it is 75 per cent.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of my responsibility as a Member of this House to ensure that all aspects of this Bill are looked at. Some will say that we are not going far enough and that we are too conservative. We must examine every section and sub-section, so that in the final analysis the legislation will be in the best interests of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many groups representing the underprivileged in our society.  The cause of the recent growth in crime and conflict are deep-rooted and longer-term solutions are needed and must be tackled in a more resourceful way than at present. We must realise that we have now a very serious problem on our hands.  Contributory factors such as unemployment, broken homes, drugs and excessive use <Col N="2489" /> of alcohol are used as reasons for committing crime.  I do not accept those excuses.  The majority of law-abiding citizens who go about their business in an orderly way are entitled to the protection of the State.  It is our obligation to ensure that they get that protection.  Unfortunately, at present that is not so.  People believe that just because they are unemployed or because they have problems at home, they can behave as they like.  I would prefer not to have to be speaking on this legislation, but this is the reality. Unless we are seen to do something very quickly, we will not be able to walk the streets in safety.</P>
    <P>The public look to the politicians as being entrusted with the keeping of law and order.  If we do not face the realities of the situation and bow to the force of the pressure groups who are continually pointing out the disadvantaged in our community, we will have failed in our duty.  We are all concerned in this House to make this a better place for all to live in.  Up to now the Garda force have been totally frustrated in their dealings with criminals.  The criminal has been seen to be at a big advantage because of the bail system, the courts system and some decisions of the courts.  The public think all these are in favour of the law breaker, which must be corrected.  This Criminal Justice Bill will come in for much criticism but it is necessary as our present laws are totally inadequate for dealing with present problems.  Some people believe that they are a law unto themselves and have no respect for their homes, families, and communities.  They beat up old people, attack young people, steal and vandalise without any sense of remorse or responsibility for the damage they do to society.  We cannot allow that to continue.</P>
    <P>Some members of the public are reluctant to co-operate with the Garda in helping to prevent crime and this very important area must be given a lot of attention by the Minister.  Members of the Garda force are at present performing duties for which they certainly were not intended. They obtain statistics for the Statistics Office; they visit farmyards to count the number of animals; they help to carry out <Col N="2490" /> the population census and also many duties for the Department of Social Welfare. They do the work of traffic and litter wardens.  To see a Garda putting a ticket on a car does not help towards good relations between the Garda force and the community.  We must look at the role of the Garda in the community.</P>
    <P>There is a complete breakdown in communication. I worked with a member of the Garda Síochána in Cork who became a member of the local community association and then an officer of it. During that time his contact with the young of the district was of a great advantage to him and them, bringing about a good relationship between them.  They knew each other by first name and I have no hesitation in saying that that was a great help to that district.  For far too long one has regarded the Garda as people to be feared when one is passing by car or on foot, in case they ask questions.  Co-operation between the public and the Garda force works both ways and the role of the Garda in the community is very important.  He is dealing with problems the causes of which are often outside his control, so he must have every assistance in carrying out his job in the way that he wants to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Special Border Areas Programme, which is centrally administered by my Department, involves a number of Government Departments, local authorities and State agencies.  I am satisfied with the level of co-operation between the various Departments and other bodies concerned. My Department have instituted a procedure for convening at regular intervals meetings of the various Departments to ensure that there is more effective co-ordination and co-operation in the administration of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the take-up of the allocation from the Special Border Areas Programme Fund, there has been a considerable improvement in the position this year.  At the end of 1982 there was an unused balance of over £2 million in the fund.  With the 1983 allocation of £2 million the total available for use in 1983 was over £4 million.  On the basis of the most up-to-date estimates from the various <Col N="2492" /> Departments and agencies concerned, I now expect that the total available in the fund will be taken up practically in full this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Was this improvement due to the Minister's intervention following the debate we had here on 21 and 22 June this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The improvements to which I have referred were already in train at that stage.  I had a further review of the measures that were in operation following the debate we had this year and I believe it has helped us very substantially to ensure particularly that the agencies other than State Departments have been a bit more diligent in the take-up of the funds that have been made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that he was concerned on that occasion at the poor take-up and that it seemed to be a great pity, considering the state of the country in relation to unemployment, that this money was not taken up within the period?  It is a five-year programme and in all probability we may not be able to get that extended when the five years expire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate to which the Deputy has referred and on occasions previous to the last debate we had here, I made it very clear that I was rather dissatisfied at the fact that the take-up of the funds was not what we might wish it to be.  I am very glad to say that we will now arrive, as I said, at a situation this year where the total amount available in the fund for this year of £4 million will all or practically all be taken up during the course of this year.  I hope we will be able to continue that for the remainder of the lifetime of the fund.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister state if those co-ordinating meetings were taking place before that debate when I asked him to put in the boot wherever he felt there was some slackness?  Were those co-ordinating meetings, particularly with the outside bodies, other than direct <Col N="2493" /> State control bodies, taking place before that debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the fund was set up my Department have been concerned to ensure that there was proper co-ordination between all the bodies.  The co-ordination was, as I said, in train before the debate.  Following the debate and the concerns expressed on both sides of the House we looked at it again with a view to ensuring that the co-ordination bit more deeply and had to a greater extent the effect we desired to see.</P>

I would remind the Deputy of what I said in my reply to the original question from Deputy Leonard, which was that my Department have instituted a procedure for convening at regular intervals meetings of the various Departments to ensure that there is more effective co-ordination.

In view of the fact that a number of Government authorities, as he has indicated, are involved in this, can the Minister assure us that there will be no wasteful duplication in the course of the examination by these various authorities to ensure the maximum impact of these funds?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy does not need me to remind him of the rules and procedures governing the operation of the Regional Fund in this country and the Special Border Fund is part of the overall Regional Fund.  The intention of expenditures under that fund is to ensure that the total amount of capital investments that will be undertaken will be increased in each member state of the Community, including this State, by the amount that is made available through the fund on the simple proposition that without the assistance of the Regional Fund there would be less available in total for capital investment.  That applies to the Special Border Areas Fund, which is in the non quota part of the Regional Fund, as it does to the overall Regional Fund.  There is no doubt, and I know the Deputy is aware of this, that the assistance we get from the Regional Fund increases the total amount of investment that is carried on in this country.  As to the question of duplication&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the question fully, Deputy.  As to the question of duplication, I am not sure what the Deputy has in mind in that connection. A number of different agencies are involved in the operations that are covered by the Special Border Areas Programme. We have a number of local authorities &mdash; for example Bord Fáilte &mdash; involved and each is involved in a different kind of operation.  That is the case because the intention of the operations of the programme is to cover a variety of things and that is where co-ordination becomes important.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that there <Col N="2496" /> is no duplication in the operation.  As to the question of priority, the public capital programme each year is set out in accordance with what are considered to be the priorities for investment generally in the Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The EEC Regulation which governs the Special Border Areas Programme restricted aid from the non-quota section of the European Regional Development Fund for tourism promotion to three years of the five-year period of the programme.  Since the allocations to Bord Fáilte in 1981, 1982 and 1983 were partly applied for promotion purposes, the provisions of the governing regulation preclude any further allocation in respect of the promotional element from the Regional Fund aid after 1983.  I would add, however, that all other Bord Fáilte activities will continue to be eligible for Regional Fund aid for the full duration of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The last sentence of the reply does not take the sting out of what goes before that.  When did the Minister become aware of the fact that aid for cross-Border promotional activities was being withdrawn from Bord Fáilte?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in my reply, the regulation governing the programme restricted aid from the non-quota section of the Regional Development Fund for promotional purposes to three years.  That is Council Regulation No. 2619 of 1980, which governs the operation of the non-quota section and which was passed and published in October 1980.  Article 4 deals with things which qualify for assistance.  Article 5.1B says that aid for operations for the promotion of tourism under .2 of Article 4 and covering part of the operating costs of the bodies shall last for three years.  It was written in the regulation which was passed in 1980.  It was, therefore, known since 1980.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;along the Border. What has the Minister done since he <Col N="2498" /> came into office to try to have this regulation rescinded or to make some effort to see that this could be extended for a further two years, especially in view of the fact that there is a fund to the tune of £15 million and that by the end of 1985, when the ERDF runs out, we will not have spent half of it?  On numerous occasions over the last 12 months the Minister has expressed himself as being concerned about the Border areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The last question which the Deputy asked after his speech is a very different question.  As far as the original question is concerned, as I have already said, the operation of the fund is governed by the regulation of 1980 which specifically provided that tourism promotion would be covered for three of the five years.  I do not propose at this point to look for a change in that regulation.  I do not propose either to try to renegotiate any part of it because I do not think that would be either wise or useful.  I make the point, however, that all the other activities in which Bord Fáilte are engaged in the Border area will still fall to be assisted by the fund.  That, as far as I am concerned, is about as much as a nod don eolach as I can give in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, without changing the regulations and the criteria, his Department could approve the appointment of an <Col N="2499" /> administrator or co-ordinator who would administer that fund on the ground since the lack of such an administrator has been a weakness in the fund?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Special Border Areas Programme, which is centrally administered by my Department, is being implemented by a number of Government Departments, local authorities and State agencies.</P>
      <P>The total allocation from the Exchequer envisaged in the special programme over the five-year period 1981-1985 is IR£21 million approximately, of which 50 per cent will be reimbursed from the non-quota section of the European Regional Development Fund.  To date a total of £10.045 million has been provided by the Exchequer for the implementation of the programme.  On the basis of the most up-to-date estimates from the various Departments and agencies concerned, it is expected that the total amount provided to date will have been spent practically in full by the end of this year, leaving a further £11 million that will fall to be provided by the Exchequer during the remainder of the programme.</P>

This is reflected by the fact that at the end of this year the total amount of money allocated to the programme from the Exchequer and from the European side will have been used and used usefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confusing a number of matters.  There is no such thing as an industry that would in any way be either satisfied or dissatisfied with this programme.  However, if the Deputy is saying that the agencies, the local authorities and other prople involved in the programme are not satisfied with its operation, I will be very happy to discuss the matter with him.  As he is aware, I have discussed it with him and with a number of his colleagues from that side of the House as well as with a number of Deputies on this side and also with representatives of the various interest groups involved.  From all of those discussions I have concluded that the kind of action we have taken to ensure a proper takeup of these funds is the kind of action that is required most.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are a number of committees working in the area of cross-Border co-operation <Col N="2502" /> who are deeply interested in the question of the expenditure of this special fund.  I have in mind in particular Bord Fáilte.  In the east Border region, which comprises the counties of Down, Armagh, Monaghan and Cavan and where we have a natural blend of the two hinterlands, would the Minister consider actively encouraging the formation of administrative structures for the joint promotion of tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is much dissatisfaction among the local authorities concerned because of the slow progress in the Border region in so far as the fund is concerned? Would he not agree also that the whole administration of the many funds in the Border area is becoming very unwieldy?  Is it not time that an economic study of the whole border region was undertaken and the economics of the entire region studied in detail?  Perhaps then we could arrive at a decision on how to administer these funds more beneficially? It is accepted that if one compares the funds as they are administered on our side with the situation on the Northern side, we get the worst of the bargain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction about the way in which the funds are being managed. I would accept, though, that there is a certain amount of confusion and that this is fuelled partially by some of the sort of remarks that have been made here today.  As to the exact role and function of this fund, it is one which involves a number of Departments and a number of different agencies.  It is sometimes the case that those who have ideas in mind for projects that would be beneficial in the area are not always very sure of where to go to find out in what way the funds can assist them.  This is a problem but my Department are available always to give <Col N="2503" /> advice in that regard.  The other agencies involved, too, are always very open to giving advice where possible so far as their side is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if there has been any change in the work practices of the staff of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to (a) the collection of large amounts of unpaid taxes, (b) staffing levels and (c) the practice of the acceptance of the <i>prima facie</i> validity of accounts submitted by companies and private individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Work practices in relation to the collection of unpaid taxes are kept under regular review and I am advised by <Col N="2505" /> the Revenue Commissioners that there is now a greater degree of selectivity in pursuing cases of unpaid taxes as a result of which there is more concentration on cases involving large amounts of tax outstanding.</P>
      <P>As regards staffing levels, 104 additional staff have been assigned to Revenue this year.  It is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to manage their resources, including the additional staff numbers made available, in the most effective way.  As a consequence, the commissioners have, from time to time, made some changes in various areas within their office, including the collection area.</P>
      <P>As to the &ldquo;acceptance of the <i>prima facie</i> validity of accounts submitted by companies and private individuals&rdquo;, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are having discussions with inspectors of taxes with a view to ensuring that the assessments of companies and individuals are dealt with in a more efficient and expeditious manner.  This review of current practice is being undertaken as part of a programme of clearing up arrears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of extra staff made available is 104.  The use of those staff members is a matter for determination from time to time by the Revenue Commissioners in the carrying out of their duties and in their care and management of the tax system.  I might advise the Deputy &mdash; as he knows very well &mdash; that his reference to £1,100 million outstanding is an inaccurate one, that is the amount assessed not yet collected, finally determined, or under appeal or for collection, which is a different subject.</P>

      <P>The question is whether the additional staff allocated to the Revenue Commissioners are being put to work on collecting that £1,100 million, or sorting out precisely how much of it is owed.  Could the Minister also indicate discussions he may have had with the Revenue Commissioners with a view to the introduction of some kind of a sampling system which would lead to a more efficient elimination of the type of general assessments that are made and which he claims cannot be collected, presumably because they are not correct?  Could the Minister indicate in what way the Revenue Commissioners are being brought into the modern age of tax collection so that every year we are not faced with the same situation?  Last year, for example, we were told there was £900 million uncollected; this year we are told there is £1,100 million uncollected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>One hundred and four additional staff were made available to the Revenue Commissioners because there was clear need for additional staff to carry out the existing duties and systems the Revenue Commissioners had in operation prior to the beginning of this year and also to deal with the extra burdens and requirements placed on them this year by a number of provisions of the Finance Act.  We made the extra staff available in order to improve the response of the revenue machine to the situation as we found it.  The specific use of those extra heads of staff is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners themselves to determine.</P>

Contrary to what the Minister believes, the average taxpayer feels no effort is being made to collect this outstanding <Col N="2507" /> tax, no effort whatsoever.  Could the Minister inform this House what he will do with tax evaders?  He said in his budget speech that he would jail them.  Is he or is he not joing to jail them?</P>

      <P>On that series of questions I would remind the Deputy that I have already said there is an on-going review in the Revenue Commissioners in relation to current practice.  That is part of a wider programme for clearing up arrears. The second point I would make is that, in this year's Finance Act, we effected a number of changes in the appeals procedure which will have the effect in time of speeding up the clearance of arrears and the processing of outstanding cases.  As to the operation of the penalties provided for in this and previous years Finance Acts, they are applied when the legal process produces a situation in which they can be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, no stamp duty is liable where a spouse transfers the family home into the joint names of both spouses.  In all other cases lifetime transfers of property between spouses are liable at half the usual rates of stamp duty.  Given that the rates of duty may vary depending on the circumstances surrounding a particular transfer, I would not accept that serious hardship is likely to be incurred in this instance and no change in the charging provisions referred to above is contemplated at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the Minister that no hardship can be caused.  Would he not agree that where a house, because of a separation agreement, divorce or annulment, is being transferred from the name of the husband to the wife or <i>vice versa</i>, it is unreasonable that stamp duty should be paid, even at half the rate?  This is a question of a family home and the Minister should give serious consideration to the situation where the family home is being transferred from one spouse to the other.  In one case of which I am aware almost £600 is being demanded from a woman in receipt of social welfare benefits.</P>

      <P>As I said, in all cases except those where under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, a spouse is transferring the family home into the joint names of both spouses, duty falls to be paid on lifetime transfers.  That means that where there is not the kind of separation referred to by the Deputy, where people stay married and living together, there is a duty chargeable on lifetime transfers of property. I do not think the circumstances of the case mentioned by the Deputy would justify changing the practice.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>Miss Bernadette Grogan has been appointed as my personal secretary and Mr. James Reilly has been appointed as personal assistant to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both officers are on secondment from the Houses of the Oireachtas where they served as secretarial assistants.  They have remained on the pay scale applicable to their former posts and in addition they are being paid a temporary allowance. Details are as follows: Miss Grogan's present salary is £119.52 per week plus an allowance of £11 per week and Mr. Reilly's present salary is £130.46 per week plus an allowance of £40.43 per <Col N="2511" /> week.  The overall cost to the taxpayer is £6,805 per annum in respect of the personal secretary and £8,910 per annum in respect of the personal assistant.</P>
    <P>The appointments, which were made under Civil Service Commission excluding orders, are temporary and will terminate not later than the date on which the present Government cease to hold office.  The appointees will be required to carry out any duties which may be assigned to them at any time by the Minister for Finance or the Minister of State at the Department of Finance respectively as appropriate to the posts.</P>
    <P>The situation has changed in only one respect since my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 699 of 26 January 1983 and No. 212 of 9 March 1983 in that Mr. Reilly's terms of remuneration have been settled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting that the cost to his Department is comparatively moderate, is the Minister not concerned about the answers given to a similar question from many of his colleagues? As Minister for Finance is he not concerned about the costs incurred by some of his ministerial colleagues providing advisers and secretarial assistants particularly in the case of the Minister for Labour whose annual cost is more than £85,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As was pointed out this morning, a number of factors have contributed to the delay in the publication date of the Estimates this year.  One of those factors is the fact that since the end of August we have been involved in four special EEC Council meetings dealing with the financing of the European Community, with the proposal for a super-levy on agriculture and so on. Those meetings required a certain amount of intensive preparation both by individual Ministers and by the Government. They have taken up time which would normally have been used for Estimates purposes.  In addition, there is the normal concern of ensuring that the decisions reached fully take account of the difficult economic and social situation in which we find ourselves.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.  I have considered having investigations made into the source of the reported leak to the media of my Department's confidential circular on the 1984 Estimates.  That circular requests Departments to prepare their Estimates for Government consideration and lays down guidelines for this work.  Since many individuals in Departments and in other bodies in the public sector participate in drawing up the Estimates, the circular is seen by a large number of people.  I have therefore concluded that an investigation into the source of the leak could be both costly and unproductive.</P>

He might inquire first in the course of his investigations from them.  Will he also acknowledge that a Government decision, which this is purported to be, can come only from Government?  Because of that will he confine his investigation to the colleagues immediately with him around the table from the senior to the most junior level?</P>

With regard to the leak now suggested &mdash; as distinct from a handout to spokesmen through whom this Government work &mdash; it makes two points; first, a 6 per cent cutback across the board and, secondly, a freezing of the capital programme for last year's Estimates.  Will the Minister assure the House that we will not find such a non-selective decision on the part of this Government as a 6 per cent cutback across the board which will in no way reflect the priorities for Government allocation as between, for instance, the productive areas and the wasteful administrative areas of this economy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now less than three weeks from the European Council in Athens. The special negotiations initiated at Stuttgart last June by the Heads of State and Government have been intensifying. The member governments of the Community have the Athens Summit very much in the forefront of their preoccupations as indeed do the national parliaments and the European Parliament.  It is, therefore, opportune and right that we should have this debate in this House today.  Already there has been a debate in the Seanad on the present special negotiations and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Jim O'Keefe, availed of the opportunity of his statement in the Dáil last week on the 21st Report on Developments in the European Communities to address himself briefly to these negotiations. Since then the Special Ministerial Council has met again in Athens, a meeting where I was accompanied by the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture. One more meeting of the Special Council <Col N="2564" /> is planned &mdash; on 28th November &mdash; before the Athens Summit.  So the timing of our debate today comes at a very crucial time indeed.</P>
      <P>I feel that at the outset of this debate I should sound a note of warning.  The pace of the special EC negotiations has indeed intensified in the past week or two; we are indeed at a very crucial stage with so little time remaining before the Athens Summit.  But it would be foolish, it would be illusory to think that member states have made such progress on the major issues in the negotiations that they are on the point of substantive agreement. Far from it.  Progress has indeed been made.  The issues of the greatest importance have been identified and there is a considerable amount of agreement that these are the issues on which the Heads of State and Government should concentrate next month in Athens. There are also a number of other issues on which agreement is emerging that they should continue to be dealt with under the normal Community processes and procedures &mdash; but hopefully with a renewed political commitment and impetus from the Athens Summit so as to ensure that the necessary decisions for action on these particular issues are reached in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, above all, there is a gratifying consensus that the Athens Summit must not fail; that its outcome must not consist, as has regrettably been the case in all too many European Councils of the past, largely of a series of declarations without the essential political results reflecting the will, the commitment of member governments to tackle effectively the problems that beset the Community and to move the Community ahead towards its further substantive development.  It may well be &mdash; and this view is admittedly gaining ground &mdash; that the final, definitive decisions on the important issues involved in the special negotiations will not be reached in Athens.  But the very minimum that must be achieved at the Summit is a series of concrete, political guidelines which will enable, indeed which will ensure that the necessary operative decisions can and will be taken in the months immediately following, <Col N="2565" /> that is, during the French Presidency of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Stuttgart Declaration is now so well entrenched in the currency of the Community that it is taken for granted. But it would, I think, be salutary to remind ourselves that the successful outcome of the European Council in Stuttgart was not by any means assured in advance and that its achievement was all the greater when one considers how very close it came to failure and what disastrous consequences for the Community and its future such a failure would have had.</P>
    <P>How profoundly more disastrous would be the consequences of a failure at the Athens Summit.  Stuttgart demonstrated that the member states were able, in the face of unprecedented difficulties and challenges for the Community, to renew that political will necessary to enable these difficulties and challenges to be overcome.  The Heads of State and Government at Athens must demonstrate that they accept, seriously and unequivocably and with all it entails, the relaunching of the Community, to which they committed themselves at Stuttgart. This will entail the necessary political decisions being taken and the necessary concrete guidelines being given if the Community is not once again at best to grind to a standstill or at worst to face another crisis, but this time one from which it would find it very difficult to recover.</P>
    <P>There must be no winners and no losers at Athens next month.  If there were to be, both the spirit and letter of the Stuttgart Declaration would have been set to one side.  Stuttgart spoke of relaunching the Community and of providing a solid basis for its further dynamic development during the rest of the decade.  This must not be done at the expense of any one member state.  To attempt to do so would be to undermine the very basis of the European Community &mdash; and we claim, justifiably in my view, to be a Community and not just a loose grouping of states.</P>
    <P>The Treaty establishing the Community affirmed unambiguously that the essential objective of member states must be the constant improvement of the living <Col N="2566" /> and working conditions of the people of Europe.  The text goes on to underline the need to ensure the harmonious development of the economies of member states by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions.  This is fundamental Community philosophy.  These are the principles and objectives that created so much excitement, so much belief in a new start, such a short time ago in Europe.  They are as relevant and as essential today as they were on the establishment of the Community. Indeed, they are more so.  They are given full protection in Article 5 of the Treaty which insists that member states shall abstain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the objectives of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>I believe it essential to put Ireland's stance in the present negotiations in the above context in case there may be some who feel that our approach may be motivated only by narrow national considerations. This is absolutely not so, and I will return to this point in a moment.</P>
    <P>Each member country has, of course, vital national interests to protect within the Community.  Britain has, for instance, in pursuance of its national interest, introduced a new concept into Community language, that of net budgetary imbalances.  I am not going out of my way to be critical of the British Government in saying this.  Like most member states, we have a conceptual difficulty with net budgetary imbalances. But, in the endless discussions on this issue over recent years, we have shown understanding and flexibility in trying to find a fair and balanced solution for this issue.</P>
    <P>The Federal Republic of Germany has a particular problem with the Commission's proposal to dismantle monetary compensatory amounts.  At a recent Special Council, the German delegation went so far as to state, very forcefully, that the Commission's proposals in this area were both intolerable and unacceptable. Other delegations have expressed considerable concern about the Commission's proposals in other areas.  Again, we understand their concern.  With our <Col N="2567" /> partners we shall seek, where real difficulty and serious economic damage are involved, to find fair and equitable Community solutions.</P>
    <P>All member states, in short, are motivated by strong Community considerations but we all, likewise, have vital national interests.  Our respective approaches to any particular Community issue of substance must be a balance between the two.  This balance can, of course, change from time to time.  However, there will always be in any Community a very small number of issues where the national interest is so great&mdash; so overwhelming on any objective basis &mdash;that it must also assume a direct Community interest.  In other words, a Community such as ours cannot afford to damage fundamentally and disproportionately any of its members without doing serious damage at the same time to itself.  The Treaty in a sense, as I implied earlier, saw the danger of this happening and specifically spoke out against it.</P>
    <P>All this leads me on to say that I believe that the proposals for a super-levy on milk now before the Special Ministerial Council raise a problem of the most far-reaching and fundamental importance for Ireland.  Milk constitutes, exceptionally and uniquely, some 9 per cent of our GNP.  The direct importance of milk output to the Irish economy is five times greater than the average for the Community as a whole and two-and-a-half times greater than in any other member state.  For historical reasons, this sector has been chronically under-developed. With yields well below the Community average, and even more so below those in other comparable regions in the Community, milk production here has not yet reached anything like its reasonable potential.  I cannot accept, at this stage of the development of this sector, that Community rules might be changed in a way which would have a disproportionate and indeed disastrous impact on this country. There is, in other words, a vital national and a vital Community interest involved here for Ireland.</P>
    <P>At the Special Ministerial Council in <Col N="2568" /> Athens last week, I told my colleagues that the application of either of the proposals for a milk super-levy would create an unacceptable situation for Ireland.  I believe I would have been failing in my duty if I had not conveyed this stark truth and reality to the Special Council and individually to my Community colleagues. During the remaining crucial period before the Athens Summit, the negotiations will obviously be at their most delicate and intense.  I have made our position clear.  I know that I can count on Deputies today, as in the past, to support strongly and unitedly the Government's position.  Such a united voice can only give our stance added strength and credibility in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>I would like to say, however, that our case on the milk super-levy has been consistent, coherent, objective and statistically supported.</P>

      <P>It has, after much effort on the Government's part, won a great deal of understanding in the Community for the scale of our problem.  I see this daily in the reports from our embassies; I have been told it at first-hand by ministerial colleagues in the Community. Indeed it is reflected in the Presidency document to last week's special Ministerial Council.  This recognised, and I quote: &ldquo;the special role of the dairy sector in the Irish economy as a whole and developments which have taken place in recent years&rdquo;.  While the Presidency proposal that Ireland should have a guarantee threshold equal to its milk production in 1983 is not acceptable, it was, in proposing special and more favourable treatment for Ireland, a very positive indication that our case was understood and had merit.  In this connection, I would invite the attention of Deputies to the <i>European Diary</i> in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 12 November last, where it is stated that &ldquo;The Irish case against the super-levy now amounts to an impressive portfolio probably comprising of the most exhaustive defence of Irish agriculture ever mounted by an Irish Government&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, who will be speaking at the end of the debate, will deal in detail with other aspects of the negotiations on the CAP.  I would like to emphasise at this stage however &mdash; as I have done consistently at the Special Councils&mdash;that many of the difficulties in so far as structural product surpluses within the Community are concerned arise, in part at least, from failure to apply the established mechanisms of the CAP, from the maintenance of special concessionary import arrangements and from the operation of monetary compensation amounts.  For instance, in two sectors, milk and cereals, departures from the principle of Community preference, in the form of inadequate import regimes, have been a major contributory cause in increasing surpluses. In the case of cereals, imports of substitutes are replacing domestically produced cereals, which have then to be exported at considerable budgetary cost. As far as milk is concerned, widespread use of cheap imported concentrated feed has resulted in much of the surpluses being produced by large-scale intensive units which, arguably, do not need Community support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was never the intention of the CAP to confer on certain producers, already well-placed geographically, advantages which flow essentially from shortcomings in the market organisations.  These shortcomings operate to the detriment of the objectives of the CAP; their budgetary cost is also considerable.  At the same time, regions such as Ireland, with natural <Col N="2570" /> advantages for milk and beef production, are adversely affected.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the non-agricultural issues in the negotiations.  Stuttgart, as I said earlier, was essentially about a new beginning, a relaunching, a new relevance for the Community.  This is about much more than action for controlling milk surpluses, although such action is understandably needed.  The Community needs and needs urgently, to radicalise their range of action and their relevance. The Stuttgart Declaration, which has been deposited in the Library, speaks for itself in this regard.</P>
    <P>The negotiations themselves can be broken down into four areas:</P>
    <P>&mdash; future financing, including budgetary imbalances;</P>
    <P>&mdash; adaptation of the Common Agricultural Policy;</P>
    <P>&mdash; review of the structural funds (Regional, Social and FEOGA Guidance), and</P>
    <P>&mdash;development of new policies.</P>
    <P>In the special negotiations, I have argued from the beginning that parallel progress on all four areas is essential if Athens is to achieve a balanced and equitable package. This has now been accepted fully on all sides.</P>
    <P>On the question of the future financing of the Community, the fact has to be faced that the Community are fast running out of money.  Already, some payments have had to be deferred.  New own resources, when agreed, are unlikely to be in place before 1986.  There is going to be a major problem, therefore, on the financial and budgetary front next year and in 1985.  If we can reach the necessary agreement on new own resources at Athens, we may find the added political commitment to take some interim steps to allow us to come through 1984 and 1985 successfully.  But if we fail to find consensus at Athens, I would have grave doubts about the necessary political will being there to provide adequate funding for the next two years.</P>
    <P>There is a further reality to which I would like to direct the particular attention of Deputies.  The creation of additional <Col N="2571" /> own resources requires a unanimous decision of the Council.  A number of countries &mdash; most notably Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands &mdash; are insisting on certain pre-conditions being met before they will agree to give their consent to such a move.  And if they do not give this consent in the near future, the implications for the operation of existing Community policies are very grave indeed.  This makes the Government's negotiating task all the more delicate and difficult. Indeed, I personally believe that, given the existing financial and economic climate in Europe, and in particular the imminent exhaustion of existing own resources, these negotiations are probably more difficult than those we faced before accession.  We are, however, equipped with the commitment, the very firm resolve and, most importantly, the objective arguments to face up to this fundamental challenge.</P>
    <P>Turning to the individual chapters, it is very regrettable that we have to date made little progress in the negotiations &mdash;even in principle &mdash; on the extent and timing of new own resources.  No Community could succeed in standing still &mdash; in even maintaining the <i>status quo</i>&mdash; without adequate resources.  This is, above all, the situation in the case of the European Community where the total budget is extremely limited in overall Community terms and the existing range of policies clearly inadequate.  And it cannot just be a question of curbing agricultural spending.  We cannot fund new policies &mdash; even if this were financially possible, which it is not &mdash; at the expense of the one fully-developed common policy existing in the Community.  The Community is a vehicle for change, not for creeping paralysis.  We have so much to do if we are again to convince the peoples of Europe that we are relevant, that we have answers, that we can act effectively through common and co-ordinated policies.  And these policies should not, and will not if properly planned, overlap with national policies.  They will complement and supplement them.  And in doing so, because of economies of scale, there <Col N="2572" /> should be overall savings, as well as more effective and responsive policies at the operational level.</P>
    <P>The amount of additional own resources to be put in place is an issue of very great importance.  We need an adequate breathing space in the Community in which to consolidate after the present crisis.  We need time to build on the consensus that will, we hope, emerge at Athens, and on the relaunching that will be set in motion there.  We above all, need to avoid having to face again in the near future the type of crisis negotiation which we are now going through.  I believe, therefore, that the Commission proposal of an immediate increase to 1.4 per cent in the VAT limit is the very minimum requirement for the Community in the short term.  But, for the Community's undoubted requirements beyond the short term, we believe that an overall increase to 1.8 per cent, as proposed by the Presidency, or 2 per cent, as has been suggested by Italy, might be more realistic.  The Minister for Finance will, however, be able to elaborate in his contribution to the debate on our thinking in this general area and on the question of budgetary imbalances.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to address the central issue of new own resources without crossing over, as I have had to do, into the area of new policies.  Achievement in this area will be an accurate test of the value of our negotiations.  The Community at the moment is limping along on a severely limited range of common policies, however significant their individual merits and achievements may be.  We urgently need to make this most testing time for the Community as innovative, and as responsive to the pressing needs and aspirations of our peoples, as any of the earlier periods.  We need, as I have said before, a qualitative leap forward, and quickly.  Some of these new policies may benefit this country; others may not but, if they are needed in their own right for the further positive development of the Community, we will support them.</P>
    <P>At Athens, I would like to see firm decisions taken on a specific, selected number of new policy areas.  This would include the development of a Community <Col N="2573" /> strategy for Research and Development and the provision of adequate resources for this purpose; the speeding up of technological development and competitiveness in Europe, in particular in the fields of information technology, telecommunications and biotechnology; and the further development of the internal market.</P>
    <P>The Government attach considerable importance to the full realisation of the internal market.  We are fully committed to the further economic integration of the Community.  We believe that the remaining intra-Community trade barriers should be broken down as quickly as possible.  As a trading nation, this is in our interests.  There should, for instance, be a considerable simplification of frontier checks; the elimination of obstructions to trade caused by different technical standards which are being used, in effect, as non-tariff barriers to trade; and the application and extension of Community rules on state aids and public procurement.</P>
    <P>The question of public procurement policies by certain member states has indeed, as Deputies will be aware, been of particular concern to the Government for some time now and is a matter which we are pursuing directly and bilaterally with the Commission.</P>
    <P>We accept fully the need to equip European industry to compete effectively, especially in the areas of new technologies, with the United States and Japan.  The necessary environment must be created, the necessary incentives provided, conducive to enabling European industry to so compete.  There are, for example, proposals for the creation of European enterprises.  But, as far as Ireland is concerned, we must ensure that, in pursuing these desirable objectives, no barriers are created which would diminish our opportunities for attracting more industrial investment from the United States and Japan to Ireland.  We have made this quite clear to our partners in the special negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Presidency document for the Athens Special Council last week argued that the policy objectives of the Structural Funds should be threefold:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2574" /> (i)&nbsp;to help make up the ground where development is backward;</P>
    <P>(ii)to speed up conversion in both industrial and agricultural regions in decline; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  to combat unemployment, especially youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>The document also proposed a very considerable increase in real terms in the resources available to the three funds between now and 1990.</P>
    <P>The detailed discussion on the Structural Funds at the Special Councils has tended to concentrate on the Regional Fund.  The review of the Social Fund has recently been completed and a satisfactory outcome achieved which will be of benefit to Ireland.  In general, the Commission proposal is that the Regional Fund should be concentrated more on the achievement of Community objectives. Accordingly, Community objectives themselves should be clearly specified. There should, in addition, be greater co-ordination between member states and the Commission in the use of the Fund to achieve these objectives.</P>
    <P>A second major emphasis is on the abolition of the distinction between the quota and non-quota sections of the fund, the Commission maintaining that the substitution of Community objectives for those of the member states should lead logically to the abolition of quotas.  A geographical distribution would initially be determined on the basis of quantitative, indicative guidelines rather than by quotas.</P>
    <P>The Government's precise position on this new thinking will be finalised in the light of our detailed examination of the new draft Regulations for the Regional Fund which have just been presented by the Commission.  We do, of course, strongly support the provision of adequate resources for the Structural Funds. These would hopefully enable the Community, however belatedly, to make some worthwhile impact on the grave problem of mass unemployment, especially youth unemployment, and on the achievement of convergence between the least and more prosperous economies of the member states.  We want to see <Col N="2575" /> increased resources for the Regional Fund concentrated where they should be &mdash; on the less-developed regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>As we enter the final stages of the Stuttgart negotiations, we must not, as I said at the outset, harbour any illusions. Many of the objectives of which I have spoken today have been before the Community for years.  They have not moved forward because, essentially, the political will to take far-seeing positions, to plan for the development of the future rather than to shore-up the inadequacies of the present, were lacking.</P>
    <P>Stuttgart tried to change all this.  It gave clear-cut and far-reaching political objectives.  If the European Council in June had the political will to set out these objectives, the hopeful presumption is that the December Council will ensure that this political will can be translated into substantial, concrete and imaginative decisions.  The choice is clear.  It is between relaunching the Community and allowing it to sink into a deep crisis of morale and of confidence.  No-one who has the least regard for the extraordinary achievements of the Community over the past 25 years could possibly countenance the latter development.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I would like, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, to thank the Taoiseach and the Government for giving the Dáil an opportunity to discuss the proposed restructuring of the CAP with particular emphasis on the proposal to introduce a super-levy on milk production.  I would like to point out to the House that this party have been looking for this debate since we came back from the summer recess and we have had a motion on the Order Paper about it.  I am glad that the Government have at long last given Government time to discuss this very important subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that this party will support every effort made by the Government but we will be critical of the Government's approach on certain aspects if they do not live up to our expectations and to the expectations of the <Col N="2576" /> country.  During my contribution this afternoon I will be rather critical of the Government's stance and their negotiations up to date.  There is a report in today's <i>Irish Press</i> that the Minister for Agriculture said yesterday that he remained hopeful that a deal was possible at the highest political level.  So far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, no deal is acceptable apart from total exemption and total derogation from this proposed super-levy.  As the dairying sector is the basis of agricultural development in the country and as the agricultural sector is the basis of our whole economy, the importance of what I have said cannot be over-emphasised.  In the course of my contribution I will be placing emphasis on the super-levy and its implications for this country.  Other members of my party will examine further aspects of the restructuring of the Common Agricultural Policy and I shall also deal briefly with them.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil were in Government, there would be no need for this debate. In the past, these proposals were on the table at the Council of Ministers and were resisted by Deputy MacSharry in 1980 and in 1981 when these proposals were put forward by the Commission. The negotiating hands of the Government, the Taoiseach and especially the Minister for Agriculture were somewhat weakened by the presence of the Labour Party in Government because we all know that that party opposed our entry into the European Economic Community and, therefore, perhaps any approach or defence by them now must ring very hollow. The importance of agriculture, especially the dairy industry, cannot be over emphasised.  It is worth mentioning that Ireland only produces approximately 4½ per cent of the Community's total milk supplies and our dairy farmers get a price for their milk which is low by European standards.  We certainly are not creating any butter or skimmed milk powder mountains.</P>
    <P>The super-levy proposal would unfairly penalise the smaller, weaker and less well off Irish industry because the problems are caused directly by the <Col N="2577" /> larger, stronger and better-off Europeans. Furthermore, the gallonage of milk per cow produced in these milk factories is already so high and the financial return so great that the financial loss in their case resulting from this levy would be relatively much lighter than in the case of the Irish supplier and farmer.</P>
    <P>With the imposition of this super-levy you are not comparing like with like.  You are not comparing some of the bigger farms and producers in Europe with the smaller and less well organised producers here.  These proposals from the European Commission are no longer a farmer issue only.  They strike at people in towns and cities as well as those on the land.  This is a national issue which calls for a unified stand by all our people.  The proposed super-levy on milk, based on 1981 output, spells disaster for our economy.  The huge reduction in family farm incomes would have repercussions throughout the economy, lower everybody's standard of living and add to our already massive unemployment.  We all know that the dairy industry is the bedrock of our national income.  The exports of dairy products and the supply of upwards of three-quarters of the calves that form the raw material for the beef industry has a significant influence on the standard of living of every home.  The inequity of this imposition on dairy farmers is bordering on the criminal.  In the past, dairy farmers, especially in this country, responded magnificently to the call for increased output and now they will have to face a harsh penalty for that response, especially as 1981 was below normal output as a result of adverse weather conditions.</P>
    <P>There is no merit in point scoring.  I did not do it in the past and I do not intend to do so in the future.  Nevertheless, I must question the attitude of the Commission in relation to the understanding and sympathy with a small member State like ours, which, through no fault of theirs, will be penalised to a very high degree.  Ireland's dependence on dairying is unique in the Community and this must be recognised by the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the Government. The magnitude of the issue is far too serious for any compromise.  As the <Col N="2578" /> Minister for Agriculture pointed out in Strasbourg yesterday, it is far too serious for any deals.  In any event, deals will not be accepted by our party.  It is not a time for weakness.  The fibre of our people is being put to the test and the nation expects leadership at this crucial time.</P>
    <P>Many of the European Commission's proposals on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy would, if implemented, be disastrous, not just for farmers but for the economy.  I wish to refer to the Taoiseach's statement in this House on 22 June 1983 in which he said that the outcome of the Stuttgart Summit was strikingly positive.  He also said that the Minister for Agriculture and he were successful in preventing damage to Irish interests in the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Taoiseach has a total ignorance of Irish agriculture and he should have seen the writing on the wall at that stage.  However, these proposals and a final decision on them will not be taken before December at the very earliest at a summit meeting of the Heads of State. There is still time, given the political will of the Government, to influence the decision that will be taken there.  The other member states must be left in no doubt that Ireland sees these proposals as a disaster for our economy and that they fundamentally affect our position in the Community.</P>
    <P>These proposals are far-reaching and relate to a number of products and to a number of measures.  A major disappointment is the weakness with which some propositions are put forward by the Commission especially those that would obviously make a significant contribution ot the budgetary problem.  We realise that there is a budgetary problem but the imposition of a super-levy in respect of this country is not the solution to that problem within the EEC.  One example of the significant contribution that some of these proposals could make to the budgetary problem is in the cereals section.  There is much but vague hope of curbing the imports into the Community of cereal substitutes.  It is well known now that these imports have a doubly bad effect on the Community's funds, directly by way of their impact on the cereal economies <Col N="2579" /> of the Ten and indirectly by way of their influence on the production of milk in some member states.</P>
    <P>Again, in dealing with sheep meat, the Commission suggest rather tamely that there should be an examination of the possibility of negotiating for a reduction in the quantities to be imported from third world countries.  The Commission shelves the question of the imports of butter from New Zealand to the UK.  I am disappointed regarding the proposals to abolish the calf premium.  A former Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Lenihan, was the one who fought for the introduction of that premium.  His efforts ultimately were successful.  Apart from the financial loss involved, uncertainties and instabilities of this kind are damaging in terms of effective planning by farmers.</P>
    <P>Our cattle and beef industry needs not a blow but a boost, not merely in the interest of the farmers but in the interest of workers in the beef plants who have recently been put on short time.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the proposal to retain the suckler cow premium.  Undoubtedly, the proposal that has aroused the greatest resentment in this country is the proposal for a super-levy on milk production.  This must be resisted but the arguments that are put forward must be sustainable and must be supported by strong political action.  The core of the Irish case must be to demonstrate that the levy would impose an unduly severe and unjust penalty on Ireland.  The dairy industry is of much greater importance to our economy than is the case in any other member state.  Our cattle industry is heavily dependent on calves for the dairy herd. A fall in dairy cow numbers that would result inevitably from a penal levy would hit our beef trade very hard.</P>
    <P>This country produces not more than four-and-a-half per cent of the Community's milk supply.  The price that our farmers receive for that milk is low by European standards.  Therefore, we are not creating any problems in Europe in terms of skimmed milk powder mountains or anything of that sort.  Of the total milk output in the Community 30 per <Col N="2580" /> cent is delivered by 77 per cent of all farmers within the Community.  The glut is being caused by the milk factories in Holland, Denmark and in Germany in particular.  These countries base their milk production largely on the heavy feeding of cows with concentrated feedstuffs. These feedstuffs are mainly cereal substitutes imported free of duty from outside the Community.  The quantities fed to each cow are large so as to force very high milk yields.  The quantities fed to each animal are very much higher than the average of 15 to 16 hundredweight per animal in this country while the quantities of the concentrates that are being imported have trebled in the past decade.</P>
    <P>The Commission, too, could attack MCAs and that would result in an artificially higher price being available to farmers for milk in Germany and in the Netherlands particularly.  Therefore, the super-levy proposals would penalise the smaller and less well-off Irish industry for the problems created directly by the larger and better-off European farmers.</P>
    <P>The gallonage of milk per cow produced in these milk factories is so high and the financial returns so large that the financial loss resulting from the levy in the case of these other countries would be relatively much less than it would be in the case of the Irish supplier.  This country must be exempt from any such measure.  The proposal is contrary to the spirit of the Treaty of Rome in that instead of the strong economies helping the weak, the weak ones would be penalised for the over-production of the strong.</P>
    <P>There is still time, given the political will, to bring our influence to bear in relation to these proposals.  I assure the Government that they will have the full support of Fianna Fáil in any action they take to this effect.  The Taoiseach and the Minister, without further delay, must veto any further imports of butter from New Zealand.  I understand that the contract in that regard comes up for renewal at the end of this year.  We must seek also the elimination of all MCAs as they provide an unfair advantage for several member states at the expense of the Community. We must seek a ban on cheap <Col N="2581" /> feeding stuffs from third countries and we must call on the Commission to impose a levy on milk factories in Europe.  In addition, the Minister for Foreign Affairs should recall all our ambassadors to EEC member states for the purpose of giving them clear instructions for a unified strategy to defeat these proposals.</P>
    <P>The Government should make it clear that Ireland will use the veto if necessary against these proposals.  Their effects would be so serious that there is no room for discussion on them.  We must clearly state our position, that a super-levy on milk production will not be accepted by us under any circumstances.  These proposals represent the greatest crisis for Irish economic interests in the Community since we joined.  It must be remembered that the present level of income and potential for future development of our agricultural industry are at stake.  The super-levy proposals would discriminate heavily against us, favouring the interests of some of the larger member states.</P>
    <P>This proposal has arisen directly from instructions given to the EEC Commission by the EEC Summit held in Stuttgart attended by the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Indeed the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs subscribed to the very conclusion of that summit giving the EEC Commission authority to put forward proposals of this kind.  As a result the confidence of our farmers in their judgment, and that of the Minister for Agriculture to negotiate on our behalf, must have been considerably shaken.</P>
    <P>The implementation of this proposal to impose a super-levy on milk would be disastrous for us and would have serious repercussions on output and employment in our milk-processing plants.  This proposal also ignores the basic fact that Ireland is responsible for four to four-and-a-half per cent of the milk production of the Community whereas we are dependent on agriculture &mdash; this is the point completely lost by the Commission &mdash; for 48 per cent of our total economic output.</P>
    <P>The European Commission are guilty of adopting a biased approach to the <Col N="2582" /> problems of dairy surpluses by refusing to take any action against other factors contributing to the problem in the form of imports, and by concentrating instead on reducing the output and income of the Community natural producers such as ourselves.  Notwithstanding the fact that they have contributed to this present development the Government must now demonstrate their total determination to resist this proposal.  We will give the Government all the necessary support in any efforts of persuasion.  But it must be clearly communicated to our partners that under no circumstances will we allow our vital national interest to be damaged and that we shall have no hesitation in utilising the veto should it come to that point.  It should be made clear that our Government will not give in on this issue of major national importance.  I hope other Government speakers will confirm this point, that under no circumstances will they give in on this major issue of national importance.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil offer the Government full support in their fight against this present EEC milk super-levy and will back all effective efforts made to defend our vital national interests.  Our Government must not allow themselves be intimidated by the statements of members of the Commission. It should be remembered that the Commission have the right to make proposals only, that decisions are reserved for member states and that we cannot agree to unbalanced proposals which totally ignore our vital interests. The present EEC Commission appear to be increasingly responsive to the interests of the richer and some of the larger member states rather than taking into account the interests of countries with less developed economies.</P>
    <P>If our Government decide there is no alternative &mdash; in the overall national interest &mdash; to their using the veto until equitable measures for limiting the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy are agreed Fianna Fáil will support such a decision.  We totally opposed the imposition of the super-levy on the Irish dairying industry in the past.  The only acceptable solution now is one that will allow the Irish dairying sector to develop and <Col N="2583" /> expand to a level commensurate with European production.  The imposition of the levy on Irish farmers must be resisted &mdash; I repeat, and this should be repeated again and again &mdash; to the point of invoking the veto, if necessary.  If implemented, this levy would spell disaster for our economy and would reduce Irish farm incomes by 15 per cent next year. That is the reason this levy must be opposed.  Its impact would be particularly harsh on our small dairy farmers.  Our economy could not possibly provide compensation and aid for such a reduction in farm incomes.  Restricting Ireland's milk output would also curtail expansion in the important beef sector.  It should be remembered that the contribution of our dairying sector to GNP is five times greater than the Community average and almost eight times more significant than in Germany or the United Kingdom.  The significance for total agricultural output of the Irish dairying and related cattle industries is twice as great here as in the rest of the Community.  Dairying constitutes by far the most important sector of our agricultural economy in the context of our future development as a nation.  It should be remembered also that our dairy farmers have not had the same opportunity for development as have their counterparts on the Continent.  Therefore the full potential of the industry is far from having being realised.</P>
    <P>Certainly our milk production cannot be held to be the culprit in the context of EEC milk surpluses.  Community average yields per cow are 26 per cent greater than in this country.  Higher levels of milk output per acre, particularly in The Netherlands and Denmark, are related to high production costs, especially to purchased concentrates, while Irish dairy farms are grass-based and low-cost enterprises. It is important to point out also that most cereal substitutes imported for milk production in Europe are brought in without payment of the common external tariff, thereby encouraging expansion in milk production.  Because of the principle of Community preference, non-Community activities which contribute directly to current difficulties must first be eliminated. <Col N="2584" /> In this context it was interesting to note that while 87,000 tonnes of New Zealand butter are imported into Britain, Britain's own production of butter has risen from 97,000 tonnes in 1973 to approximately 250,000 tonnes this year.</P>
    <P>Ireland produces only 5 per cent of Europe's milk supplies, yet this super-levy imposition would call us to meet 10 per cent of the cost.  Is that fair treatment for a small country?  There is blatant imbalance when one recognises the fact that we are responsible for less than 5 per cent of total milk production in Europe, yet we would be asked to contribute in excess of 10 per cent of the total cost. The total increase in 1983 alone will be greater than our total production in any one year.</P>
    <P>We must never lose sight of the fact that the cheap cereal substitutes coming in here account for about 3 per cent of the total surplus.  Added to this is the importation of butter from New Zealand into the United Kingdom, which amounts to £90 million each year, and our average yield of 720 gallons per cow as against 1,100 gallons in Holland and more than 1,000 gallons in the United Kingdom and Denmark.  From this one can see that this country is not contributing to the problems in Europe.  Another fact worth mentioning is that Holland, which is the size of Munster, is producing two-and-a-half times what we produce.</P>
    <P>Because of the effects this super-levy would have on the Irish economy this party are increasingly concerned that our total opposition to it is not being effectively communicated in Europe by our Government.  The establishment of the Commission's task force is not necessarily reassuring and may indicate that Ireland is to be bought off with a few marginal concessions.  It is important therefore that this country will not be bought off with any marginal concessions for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Recently I took it upon myself to have a meeting with the Commissioner Dalsager and found there was a certain appreciation of the special circumstances of the Irish dairy industry.  However, I was left in no doubt by the Commissioner and other senior members of the Commission <Col N="2585" /> that the Commission intend to pursue their proposals without exemption and that they have the support in principle of all the other member states. Following my detailed discussion with several parties I was left with the distinct impression that the Irish Government have not convinced either the Commission or the member states of Ireland's vital national interest in this matter. Whatever might be said at home, the Irish Government have not pursued the issue strongly enough at European level. However, there is still time for the Government to make up lost ground by putting forward the strongest case possible not only for Irish dairy farmers but for the country as a whole and at every level and at every available opportunity. In doing this they will have the support of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>From my discussions in Brussels it is clear that there is no appreciation that Ireland would contemplate such drastic action as using the veto to protect our vital national interest.  This must be brought home forcefully to the Commission and to the other member states.  I am convinced that the only way out is for the Government to take a strong line and to maintain it to the end.  This was done in the past by a former Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture and at the end of the day he won out.  Provided this Government can remain steadfast to the end and maintain that strong line, we will win out, but it needs sustained effort.</P>
    <P>I pointed out to the Commissioner that, as spokesman for Ireland's largest political party, I regarded the proposed super-levy as totally unacceptable to the Irish Parliament and the Irish people.  I also said that this party would support the Government in resisting the imposition of the super-levy.  As a dairy farmer I was able to show him the impact it would have on individual dairy farmers and to explain the effect it would have on the dairy processing and related industries in terms of employment and output.</P>
    <P>This party accept that the EEC face genuine financial problems.  I pointed out to the Commissioner that the levy was contrary to the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy, contrary to the <Col N="2586" /> accepted principles of economic efficiency and discriminatory against this country because, as I said, we produced only 5 per cent of the total milk supplies and under the super-levy we would be asked to contribute 10 per cent of the total cost.  The other nine EEC countries will produce an increase in milk output this year greater than Ireland's total annual output.</P>
    <P>As this party brought Ireland into the EEC against some opposition, and since we now feel that the conditions of entry are being dishonoured, as custodians of the interests of the Irish people there is an obligation on us to act in this matter. I explained to the Commissioner that the dairy sector was more important to Ireland than it was to any other EEC country and that we had a comparative advantage in low cost dairy production.</P>
    <P>One may ask where we stand, because in my view this Government do not have a cohesive policy and their approach is changing daily.  Ireland is losing its national will.  It is sad to note that within 48 hours of the Chequers Summit with Mrs. Thatcher, the United Kingdom Minister for Agriculture was opposing very strongly the minimum concession put forward by the Greek Minister for Agriculture, which was totally unacceptable to Fianna Fáil.  The Taoiseach told the House he was restoring normal Anglo-Irish relations.  So much for his so-called friends in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is clearly evident that a lot of work remains to be done.  One may ask if this Government are selling out the future of Irish farmers.  The action of the Taoiseach and some of his senior Ministers is increasing the barriers for his Minister for Agriculture at the negotiating table. This generation does not have the right to sign the death warrant of future generations of dairy farmers by accepting this super-levy by way of derogation for a limited number of years.  As I said, the imposition of this super-levy would devastate Irish agriculture bringing ruination to 8,000 dairy farmers and their families and making Ireland a barren and neglected outpost of Europe.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate that the only acceptable solution to the problem of surplus <Col N="2587" /> dairy products in Europe is one which allows the Irish dairy sector to develop to the level of its European counterparts.  If total Irish milk production was to reach the current level of Dutch milk output it would result in an extra 1,500 million gallons of milk being produced in Ireland, thereby ensuring the future of 70,000 dairy farmers and an extra £1,400 million in dairy exports.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> That would make a massive contribution to our balance of payments and would create in the region of 10,000 extra jobs in the dairy processing industry at a time of massive unemployment.  Indeed, I note with sadness that only one organisation, the ESRI, has supported the use of the veto as a last resort.  Fianna Fáil policy is to protect vital interests of national importance.  If the Minister cannot deliver this package it is a clear indictment of the Government's agricultural policy, and their negotiating capacity must be brought into question.</P>
      <P>Confidence is necessary and this Government's policy with regard to agricultural policy at present has not the confidence of the Irish farmers.  Agriculture can provide the mainspring for the recovery of our economy.  We have a young emerging population.  We have the processing facilities to develop the added value products of the raw materials available. I am calling for a united national campaign which will include farmers, their organisations, marketing organisations, all our people, all sections of Irish society, to resist this levy and certainly they will have the full support of the Fianna Fáil Party throughout the country. The dark cloud of the super-levy must be removed to allow Irish agriculture to make its contribution to the rebuilding of this great nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>First I emphasise that we are fully behind the Government's efforts to oppose this super-levy.  I said in a speech last September that we opposed it because it was penalising the most efficient and productive farmers, and also because the 1981 base for the super-levy discriminates particularly against Ireland because our agriculture is less developed than that of other EEC countries and therefore needs greater scope to expand production.  Particularly because of investment in recent years in dairy farming and the still underdeveloped nature of our dairy production, we believe that the super-levy as imposed at present would be discriminatory against Irish farmers and could pose severe problems, but we believe that similar problems are brought down on us because of the Government's agricultural policies &mdash; or lack of them &mdash; pursued over recent years and because of central adopting of EEC policies without any national policies being pursued by Governments here in relation to farming.  Therefore, the whole area of EEC benefits to farming has not been used to bring Irish farmers to an efficient stage and to ensure that they would survive in Europe against any competition. It was obvious from the time we joined that, while there would be some good years in the intervening period, in a decade we would be really up against more productive farmers in the other EEC countries.  Therefore, a decade has not been used in the way we believe it should have been used to enable us to be in a position to compete.  In the circumstances in which we find ourselves now we must oppose this super-levy in an effort to ensure that the crisis for farming which it would create and the disaster to those who have put in such high investment do not occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The artificially inflated farm prices under the CAP are potentially ruinous for the EEC and will swallow up the entire Community budget next year leaving nothing for the Regional or Social Funds which are vital to Irish industrial and infrastructural development.  It is important that when we are discussing the super-levy we look realistically at what is happening in the EEC.  What are <Col N="2589" /> Germany and the UK up to?  Why do all the other EEC countries come down so hard on us now?  What is changing in the EEC?  Have we noticed what has been happening over the past two or three years when we were reaching this stage? High food prices are bad for consumers and for ordinary working people who are struggling to meet the cost of living.  They are bad also for industry through pressure on wages and so on, and they are bad for the food processing plants because they make them uncompetitive in the export markets on account of the increase in costs of their basic input.  Real increases in farm income, therefore, should come from increases in production rather than from regular food price increases.</P>

      <P>There are enormous changes taking place within the EEC and in the whole CAP structure for which we must prepare and of which we must be aware and in regard to which we must formulate a policy.  That does not seem to be happening with this Government; £1 in £10 of our income now comes from the EEC in the form of grants, subsidies and so on.  The problem is that countries which are paying out more to the EEC than they are getting out of it are seeking cuts in their contributions.  Presumably the recession is hitting them as well and they are not therefore going to continue to fund CAP to the extent to which they were.  We must therefore reorganise our agriculture in preparation for the time when this support is cut down much further even than is being considered at the moment.  It is obvious we must make preparations and produce what will sell. We should be discussing how we can produce what we are producing more profitably and then find what other products we can move into, that will sell on the open market.  Obviously more profitable milk production is something we did not achieve in the past decade.  It is something we should have achieved, namely, more gallons per cow rather than more cows to ensure the efficient production of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of the EEC budget is actually spent on milk and milk products. <Col N="2591" /> I think it was the last speaker who said that Germany and other EEC countries have much higher incomes per farmer and can, therefore, be more efficient.  That is not true.  It is true of Holland but it is not true of Germany.  The figures show Germany has more small dairy farmers than Ireland has.  In the one to nine cow numbers, 54 per cent of Irish farmers are in that category and 52 per cent of German farmers.  In the ten to 19 cow numbers the figure is 20.7 per cent of Irish farmers and 29.5 per cent of German farmers.  In the 20 to 29 cow numbers the figure is 10.7 per cent of Irish farmers and 11.7 per cent of German farmers &mdash; about the same.  In the 30 to 39 cow numbers the figure is 5.9 per cent in Ireland and 4 per cent in Germany.  In the 40 to 49 category the figure is 3.4 per cent in Ireland and only 1.5 per cent in Germany.  As it goes up to 100 cows Germany goes down far below the Irish position.  There are more Irish farmers in that category; 2 per cent of Irish farmers 50 to 59; 2.5 per cent 60 to 99 and .6 per cent of Irish farmers have 100 or more cows.  Nobody in Germany has 100 or more cows and only 5 per cent have 60 to 99 cows so German farmers are not bigger dairy farmers than the Irish dairy farmers.  They are simply more efficient small farmers and their efficiency has, of course, been built up over a long number of years, a period during which Irish agriculture was in great difficulties.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, in the past decade of the EEC more could have been done to raise the efficiency of the Irish dairy farmers. That has not been done.  EEC dairy experts are of the opinion that a dairy herd of at least 30 cows is needed to have efficient exclusive specialisation in the milk production area to make it profitable. Only 11 per cent of all dairy farmers in the Community come into that category. They produce 40 per cent of the milk and that is the efficient production of milk area.  There is great difficulty and great inefficiency being supported therefore, and not just in Ireland but in other EEC countries as well.</P>
    <P>In relation to EEC funds by far the greatest amount has gone to farming. <Col N="2592" /> What have we to show for it?  In the beginning on our entry into the EEC it was widely recognised that agriculture needed a huge investment of funds and it was accepted EEC funds would be concentrated mostly on agriculture.  It was expected this would build up over a period and less and less funds would be needed for agriculture and more and more could be diverted to the Regional and Social Funds, something to which we all looked forward.  Right up to 1982 the European farm fund, the guaranteed section and the guidance section, amounted to £405 million.  The Social Fund got £97 million and the Regional Fund £79 million.  There is no comparison. The Social and Regional Funds are approximately half the amount that goes to agriculture.</P>
    <P>We are still in a situation where our agriculture, although it is benefiting from the EEC fund, is not showing the benefit and I think people are now wondering what is happening.  What have we now to show for all the EEC money farmers have received?  The milk area has increased in productivity; based on 100 in 1972 farmers had reached 144 in 1980, a 44 per cent increase.  What is really surprising is that cattle numbers have actually gone down. In 1973 we had 6,536,000 and in 1982 the figure is down to 5,783,000.  Where was the development?  Where was the productivity? Where was the more efficient use of land and so on?  Where were the increased cattle numbers on the land? Side by side with that we have less development in sheep, pigs, poultry and so on. Dairy farming has developed at the expense of other areas.  This is very disapointing. It is even frightening.  We have not developed right across the board to improve efficiency in farming to enable us to stand up to what is happening now in the EEC where we are beginning to get the knock at the expense of European farmers.</P>
    <P>The proposed super-levy and the escalating cost of the CAP underlines the need for a new and fresh approach to Irish agriculture and its contribution to the national economy and the policy being pursued by Government.  Major changes are required to make use of our <Col N="2593" /> national advantages, soil and climate. These have not been used and the Government have not come up with a policy to utilise these.  In the short term the use of EEC funds should be as an investment in agriculture rather than as an income supplement or a sort of farmers' dole.  EEC money will be distributed whether the farmers are being efficient or showing any increase in production or not.  The distribution bears no relation whatsoever to the productivity or development of farming.  The investment should be in development of agriculture rather than a simple income supplement. The incomes would, in fact, increase more with farm development and expansion.</P>
    <P>There should also be a switch from products for which the demand is falling. Demand has been seen to be falling for butter and hard cheeses in particular, and dried milk over a number of years. We do not produce soft cheeses for which the demand continues.  Our vegetable processing has been on the way down rather than on the way up over the last number of years.  The strengthening of our food processing industry is of vital necessity.  It is the area of greatest possible job creation here.  Food processing in the United States is their greatest industry while here it has generally been in decline and not putting the added value which it should to our farm production.</P>
    <P>We should ensure at least full production for the home market, so that we do not have to import eggs, potatoes and vegetables at the present enormous rates. Our farming community and the EEC are concentrating totally on milk and to a lesser extent on beef, with a small number of sheep.  After that there is no further policy, development or programme for our vegetable industry, poultry industry or any other area of agriculture.  The Government concentrate totally on what the EEC decide.  A net figure of approximately £500 million was received from the EEC last year and it has not been used to develop any of the areas to which I have referred.  We concentrate far too much on the products which are kept at artifically inflated prices.  This has been a <Col N="2594" /> reaction to the EEC, rather than a development of our agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>The processing industry should be strengthened to create the added value and employment which we need at present. We have the lowest rate of downstream employment on food products of any EEC state.  The export of live animals last year was up 11.1 per cent, while our meat factories were closing or on short time and many jobs were lost.  Exports of raw materials and fuels, amounted to £267 million last year, every single pound being a lost job opportunity.  Less than 25 per cent of the value of Irish agricultural production is added off the farm.  That is way below any other EEC country. Agriculture is not making anything like its potential contribution to the national economy.  For instance, our total exports last year were £5,688 million, of which manufactured goods accounted for £3,658 million &mdash; almost two-thirds. Food, drink and tobacco amounted to £1,535 million; raw materials and fuels, £167 million; live animals £169 million; and other exports £59 million.  Our agricultural exports are not making anything like the contribution they should after ten years in the EEC to our economy and our exports.  Food production and exports would be greatly increased if progressive policies were introduced to Irish agriculture.  The massive imbalance in the EEC budget in favour of farm price guarantees makes the EEC effectively an agricultural institution.  Its role as a force for industrial, social or infrastructural and even agricultural development is relatively insignificant.</P>
    <P>If there is any regional redeployment of resources from the higher income regions to the lower income regions, it is purely accidental.  By subsidising inefficient farm structures, it has retarded the development of real output in agriculture. The easy alternative of selling into intervention has produced an undesirable concentration of production within Irish agriculture.  The whole EEC system favours the production of bulk products, with minimal scope for value-added activities.  The Irish agri-business sector have been encouraged to concentrate on the production of bulk quantities of, for <Col N="2595" /> instance, skimmed milk and carcases for intervention.  The job creating potentials of consumer-ready products have been stunted in favour of the dictates of warehousing and cold storage.  The overproduction of CAP favoured products, in combination with the inefficiency of much of the Irish farming sector, has contributed to the worsening of our trade deficit.  We have become less self-sufficient in food since we joined the EEC under the Common Agricultural Policy. Our imports of food have increased enormously since then.  That is because we are not competitive in the agricultural field and the other EEC countries can undercut us on the home market.</P>
    <P>In a comprehensive study of the Irish agri-business sector called <i>Output and Employment in the Irish Food Industry to 1990</i> published in 1979, the Economic and Social Research Institute set out what they considered to be the likely path of development over the next ten years &mdash; that is from 1979 to 1989.  They said:</P>
    <P>If present trends continue, by 1990 the Irish food processing industry could be predominantly in the hands of multi-national concerns and could be producing about twice its 1973 output with less than 18 per cent more employees.  These trends can only be altered by a massive, co-ordinated effort of the major factors in the beef or dairy industry, or by large direct intervention by the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Expanding sales in the home market, and warding off competition from EEC partners may well become the top priority of the Irish food industry in the next decade.</P>
    <P>This report concludes:</P>
    <P>Sales expansion will be difficult if the European Community persists in an agricultural policy which keeps price above competitive equilibrium (so that large surpluses build up) and retains many less efficient producers in agriculture. We argue that a lowering of the real price of food would, in the long run, be most beneficial to Irish agriculture.  Many of the part-time or <Col N="2596" /> marginal producers throughout the Community would shift to non-agricultural activities.  Those farmers in Ireland who have a comparative advantage in farming would then be able to expand production, top economies of scale, increase their market share of other EC markets and get market opportunities in third countries. The food processing sector would benefit from an expansion in supplies of raw materials at a lower price and would, in turn, be able to expand markets for its finished products.</P>
    <P>That report, issued in 1979, was submitted to the Government and was met with only a stony silence.  Its projections are being shown to be very relevant today and its conclusions should be looked at again today by this Government in view of the crisis in farming which is now developing.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party argument is that the inflow of EEC money to agriculture should be redeployed in a productive manner, to raise productivity in agriculture and also in industry and the social sectors.  The employment creation needs of the eighties will require massive investment in roads, telecommunications, urban, social facilities and so on.  We argue that the £400 million which is now being paid by the EEC to individual farmers through the CAP should be redirected to promote better agriculture, to raise the capital for an efficient and cost-competitive food industry to benefit consumers and workers.  A reappraisal of the EEC and of the CAP is now essential. The reappraisal has been done by the major EEC countries.  Germany and the UK are very clear about what they want now.  They are contributors to the fund from which we draw and they will not continue.</P>
    <P>While we hope the Minister for Agriculture can perform a miracle this year, if that happens he certainly will not be able to do so next year.  We are not just talking about a passing crisis.  We are talking about a major crisis in the EEC, in the CAP and in agriculture.  We need a national policy towards the EEC and we need a Government policy for agricien <Col N="2597" /> culture.  It is extraordinary that it is only this year that the Government have taken the first steps to make some changes in the farming structure through changes in the letting system and the long lease system which is being developed now by the Minister for Lands.  We have retained the same structures throughout the decade of our membership of the EEC.  The Government must look at farming structures, farming production, farming output, markets for food, where those markets are irrespective of the EEC, what they do and what food we should be producing.</P>
    <P>The cost of the CAP next year, whatever the outcome of the super-levy negotiations are, will have swallowed up the entire EEC budget leaving nothing for the regional and social funds which on our entry to the EEC we felt would be vital for the development of our economy and would be a great boost to various regions throughout the country but which never came off.  We have only got fiddle sticks.  The whole impetus of the EEC is now lost.  There were no direct benefits to any areas in Ireland except agriculture. The other areas accepted this and said agriculture needed it and they would get the spin off but this has not happened. Consumers have paid an enormous price for the benefits to farmers and they do not want to pay them any more.  That is why consumers will buy food as cheaply as they can get it wherever they can get it, irrespective of our farmers or they will stop buying meat altogether.  In fact, the vast majority of the people are doing that now.  There is a drop of 10 per cent in meat consumption in the EEC generally and this is probably greater here, which means less production again for farmers.</P>
    <P>The high food prices and the whole impetus of the EEC have to be altered now.  We have wasted 10 years in the EEC just grabbing what we could, with no Government policy for the development of farming to the stage where we could stand on our own.  The Minister should produce a White Paper for the EEC and agriculture.  We have to face up to a major change in our farming policy and in our attitudes to the EEC whatever the outcome of the super-levy negotiations <Col N="2598" /> is.  The Workers' Party give the fullest support to the Minister in the negotiations because we believe this is a major crisis which has to be overcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to be finished within my time limit of 30 minutes because I believe this debate should enable as many Members as possible to air their views.  If I speak for less than 30 minutes there is a tendency to interpret that as meaning that I do not feel the subject is as important as other speakers do who take much longer.  I hope there will not be any further calls for a quorum which loses time in this very important debate.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to repeat the well-stated and well-known facts about the proposals to reform the CAP, the disastrous effects which those proposals will have on the country and the repercussions down along the line.  I believe those are well-known and they do not need to be repeated in the House.  There is a necessity to get that kind of information across to other sections of the community but that can be done other ways without going through things in the House.  Agriculture is our major industry.  We differ from other countries as practically our total economy depends on agriculture whereas in the case of other members of the EEC agriculture is just part of their economy.  More employment and more people's livelihoods depend on agriculture and the well-being of agriculture in Ireland than in any other country in the EEC, so nobody should be surprised at the amount of concern and opposition throughout the country at the proposals to make certain changes in the CAP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is general agreement in the House about the after effects of these proposals and there seems to be general agreement for support for the Government in their negotiations to try to prevent these proposals being implemented, particularly the super-levy.  I go along with what the Fianna Fáil spokesman said that there is no merit in point scoring. Unfortunately, after saying that, he went on to make a very serious allegation which I cannot let go without comment. He said that the presence of the Labour <Col N="2599" /> Party in Government weakens the case of the Government in these negotiations. That is a very serious statement to make. He did not elaborate on what he meant when he said that.  It is true that the Labour Party opposed entry to the Common Market on the terms that were then negotiated.  I do not want to waste time by bringing out files to prove what we said at that time and how right we have been proved since, especially in this review of the Common Agricultural Policy. We are the only party who have been proved right but I only mention it now because of the serious, untrue allegations which were made by the spokesperson for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Since the people of this country made a democratic decision to enter the Common Market, the Labour Party have worked consistently, constructively and positively to get the best possible deal at all times.  I challenge any Member on the opposite side of the House to produce any evidence of where we have not done that.  We have always voted for the best deal for this country in every debate and vote on agricultural matters in the European Parliament.  In fact, in the present crisis, we have been very active in ensuring that all our colleagues in Europe are made fully aware of the consequences that the proposals would have for us.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out also that, significantly enough, it was the Greek Government who have given official recognition to the fact that Ireland have a case and the Greek Government is a Labour Government, one out of two that make up the ten member states.  The other country is France.  Neither of those countries is causing great difficulties in our negotiations, the difficulties in the main come from the most right wing Governments in Europe.  It is grossly unfair and untrue for Fianna Fáil to be creating the impression that the Labour Party in Government damaged the country's chance of getting a good deal.  It is a preposterous statement and shows the depth of ignorance about the real problem which exists in Europe at present.  If they were aware of the facts, they would not make such a statement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2600" /> I went to Athens last week to meet Mr. Varsis, President of the Council of Ministers, also a member of the Labour Government.  I also spoke to the Prime Minister in Athens last week and, under great pressure, they made that statement. Our Minister for Agriculture has, rightly, totally rejected that type of compromise and I told Minister Varsis last week that it would be rejected.  However, the significance is that it concedes the fact that Ireland have a case and when we get an admission from the President of the Council of Ministers that Ireland has a case, we are taking some steps to reach a solution.  I hope that what has been said there will be the last comment of that nature because we need unity in the biggest fight which this country has ever had on its hands.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Fianna Fáil spokesman understands the situation, because he compares it with that which existed when they were in office and when the then Ministers, Deputy MacSharry and Deputy Lenihan, successfully negotiated a deal.  He forgot to mention Deputy Gibbons although he also as Minister negotiated good deals.  The deals they negotiated were made in totally different circumstances.  I do not know whether it is a failure to understand the implications of the present crisis when he tries to compare what is happening now with what happened then because, at that time, there was no problem with own resources.  The resources were in the Community and it was a question of negotiating and getting more money because it was there.  The money is not there now and that puts an entirely different complexion on it.  We must get this across to the people because there is no point in Fianna Fáil Deputies going to meetings of the IFA or any other groups and telling them that the Minister is not doing his job.  The big problem is that the Community now has no more money and must reach agreement on new recourses. Until they do this where is the money going to come from?  This is a new situation which was never experienced by any previous Government since we entered the EEC.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the problem, the own <Col N="2601" /> resources, was passed over by the spokesman for Fianna Fáil.  I am worried as to whether there is a clear understanding on their part of the magnitude of the problem which confronts our negotiators.  I am glad that I got the opportunity of coming back from the European Parliament in Strasbourg where this subject is being debated today.  I will be back to vote on it tomorrow but I am glad that we are also debating this question because, even among Members of this House, there is still some misunderstanding of what is involved.  I must defend myself and my party against the remarks made by the Fianna Fáil spokesman.  It is not a time for point scoring, it is a time for unity, but we must set the record straight.  It behoves all politicians to get the population united behind the Government.  From my meetings and contacts in Europe, I have no doubt that the Government and the Minister are getting the message across and there is recognition of our problem.</P>
    <P>We must address ourselves to where the money is to come from.  As we know, at least two countries, the UK and Germany, have said that they will not agree to any increase in own resources until a review of the CAP is carried out. It is a difficult situation because, if there is not a review of own resources, it will follow as sure as night follows day that there will be no more money left for agricultural development, so that one is as important as the other.  This own-resources question must be faced up to so that there will be money available to develop our agricultural industry further. One of the many failures of the EEC has been the over-dependence on agricultural policy almost to the exclusion of other policies.  Ironically, the crisis that has arisen now in agricultural spending has been caused by the spending in that area down through the years, spending which was to the detriment of other policies.  If more had been spent on, say, the industrial policy, countries such as the Netherlands, Germany and other northern European countries would have concentrated more on industry and would have left agricultural development to countries like ourselves who are best <Col N="2602" /> in that sphere.  We have the natural resources and we have the workers. Alternatives should have been put to those other countries instead of encouraging them to develop their agriculture and to turn them rapidly to the factory-farms type of activity.  These were set up simply because there was money to be made from them and because there was hardly any industrial policy in Europe, a factor which acted to the detriment of our agricultural development.  There was no food policy either.</P>
    <P>It is puzzling that the present crisis was not foreseen because the problem began to show itself about ten years ago.  It has become progressively worse and we are now at this very serious crisis point. There has been reference to the veto. The present crisis bears no comparison to anything that has been experienced before because the resources are not there now in terms of using a veto.  Much more negotiation must take place to resolve the situation.  As a former trade union official I have taken part in many negotiations.  The ultimate weapon of the trade union is the strike and the strike weapon can be compared with the veto in terms of reaching a stage where the ultimate must be considered but where a balance must be reached.  I have no doubt but that our negotiators will use the veto if at the end of the day they consider that to be the correct action to take.  We will all support them on that but first there must be further serious negotiations.  The Heads of State meet in Athens in a few weeks' time but since there are as many pessimists as there are optimists in regard to forecasting what the outcome of that meeting may be, it is difficult to get a clear picture of whether something concrete will result from it.  However, if nothing comes of the Summit, the result will be serious in terms of next year's budgetary problem in the EEC.  But if something comes out of the Summit and if agreement can be reached on the question of increasing own resources, the proposals would have to be brought back to the national Parliaments of the member states.  The Ministers who will be negotiating in Athens must bear that in mind. It is one matter for them to agree to <Col N="2603" /> proposals on own resources but it is another to have those proposals sanctioned by the relevant Parliaments.  We all know that throughout Europe most Governments are trying to cut back on spending.  Therefore, it will not be an easy passage for any Minister to get the sanction of his Parliament in terms of increasing own resources.  One cannot imagine a representative of the German or of the British Parliament having an easy and clear course in putting through a proposal that the own-resources contribution be increased, as the Greek Presidency proposed, to 1.8 per cent.  Understandably, such a proposal would get a clear passage through the House here because we are net beneficiaries of the Community.  In fact, it would pay us to put a lot more into it because the return would be manifold but the situation is not similar in other countries.  Time will be needed in order to persuade each of the member states to agree on such a proposal, even if it is to increase the figure to 1.4 per cent.  However, if the Heads of State agree on any such proposal I am sure that something can be worked out to ensure that the necessary finances are available to fund the additional contribution required.</P>
    <P>I would not wish the brevity of my remarks to be taken as an indication of the depth of my concern in regard to this whole problem.  I am in a position to be in touch with the problem and I am frightened that while other member states appreciate our predicament, there does not appear to be any great rush to help us in that regard.  I join with those speakers who have pledged their support to the Government in their efforts to bring about a solution to this very serious problem.</P>
    <P>We are talking of a problem that concerns the entire community and that is why I consider the remarks of the Fianna Fáil spokesman this evening to be most unfortunate.  We can do without remarks such as that the Labour Party are endeavouring to undermine because such remarks tend to divide the community on an issue of this sort.  I cannot think of another occasion on which it was more <Col N="2604" /> necessary to be united.  Never has it been more necessary to have the support of the trade unions and of the people in urban areas generally.  Europe consists of all shades of political opinion from the extreme right to the extreme left and we receive more support from those on the left than from those on the right, a situation that is hidden from our people.  We should unite in appealing to all these people to come to our aid.  Unfortunately, the Community of today is not like the Community of ten or 20 years ago when there were within the EEC leaders who saw the Community as a group of nations in which the strong would contribute more in an effort to increase the lot of the weak, with those at work helping those who did not have work.  The word &ldquo;Community&rdquo; may not be appropriate today having regard to the shape it is taking.  However, I trust that there will be a return to the situation I have outlined and to the kind of confidence which our people, and particularly those in the agricultural sector, showed in Europe.  We should all unite in our efforts to bring about such a situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be given this opportunity of contributing to this important debate and of recapping the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy which are: firstly, to increase agricultural productivity; secondly, to ensure a fair standard of living for those engaged in farming; and, thirdly, to stabilise markets ensuring reasonable consumer prices.  Of course the cornerstone of this policy is Community preference, that is preference for products produced within the Community.</P>
      <P>After ten years of membership it is enlightening to examine our performance nationally as a result of membership of the EEC.  In 1974 our total cattle numbers stood at 7,200,000 and they dropped continuously until they reached a figure of 6,700,000 in 1983, a drop of 6 per cent. In 1974 our dairy cows numbered 1,400,000 and to date they have increased to 1,600,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, also in the course of the past ten years, our beef cows dropped by 42 per cent.  In addition the total number of <Col N="2605" /> people at work in agriculture has fallen from 261,000 to 190,000.  Therefore I am sure Members generally will agree that our performance in our first ten years of membership has been fairly slow and sluggish.  However, I would point out to Members &mdash; in particular Deputy Mac Giolla of The Workers' Party who is not now present &mdash; that the reason for this slowness was our lack of development before our accession, which was due to our dependence on the British cheap food policy for several decades.  Therefore, we had an awful lot of leeway to make up.</P>
    <P>In this we were not helped by the relative lack of investment in agriculture by the Department of Agriculture.  In fact during those ten years real investment in agriculture dropped by 20 per cent. Despite the lip service paid to the development of our land, and the top two or three inches of our soil, the fact was that no real effort was made to fully develop that resource.  The fact that we had been tied to a cheap food policy for so long left agriculture in a very underdeveloped state before our accession to the EEC.</P>
    <P>Since joining the EEC we have virtually doubled our milk yield, but even at that we are still only at 75 per cent of capacity of the average in Europe.  Our better farmers are doing better than that &mdash; the top 30 per cent &mdash; but there is still a tremendous amount of ground to be covered.  The very minimum we seek is an opportunity to allow our industry to develop to the same extent as it has in the other dairying countries of the EEC.  I do not think that is asking too much.  We have been a full member only since 1978 and up to the year 1981 not a single pound of our butter or dairy products was in intervention &mdash; only 1 per cent of the total surplus has been created by us since our accession.</P>
    <P>Not alone is our dairying industry under assault because of the so-called restructuring of the Common Agricultural Policy, but our beef industry faces annihilation because our beef herd has been reduced dramatically.  It must be remembered also that our beef industry is dependent to the extent of 85 per cent on our dairying industry.  Therefore it is <Col N="2606" /> easy to see how difficult the situation will be for the beef industry if there is to be any curtailment of our dairying industry. Of course, ten years ago it should be remembered we were only 90 per cent self-sufficient in dairy products and about the same in meat products, whereas today we find there is overproduction on both commodities.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to point out that this over-production to a great extent has been caused by the importation of food products generally from third countries. Yet the cornerstone of the Common Agricultural Policy is supposed to be Community preference.  That is why we are members of the European Economic Community.  This chronic over-supply on the European market, which has culminated in mountains of butter and milk powder is being really aggravated by third country imports.  I see no justification for that.  The Minister should do all in his power, certainly more than he appears to be doing, to have that curtailed or eliminated altogether.</P>
    <P>As far as New Zealand imports are concerned, what makes matters worse is the fact that they are imported into the United Kingdom market, which is still our largest market for butter.  There the real problem is that the butter imported from New Zealand to the United Kingdom is sweet cream butter.  Ireland happens to be the only other major supplier of sweet cream butter.  As members of the dairying community here will appreciate, the Dutch and the Danes export ripened or lactic cream butter into the United Kingdom market, like the old farmers' butter.  They are not concerned about the importation of New Zealand sweet cream butter; it does not bother them.  In fact, they would be happy enough to see it come into the United Kingdom because it means that much butter removed from world markets where they are seeking export opportunities for some additional products.  That situation is compounded by the fact that New Zealand imports of cheese into the United Kingdom market consists mainly of Cheddar cheese which happens to be our main variety of cheese on the United Kingdom market.  Therefore with regard <Col N="2607" /> to butter and cheddar cheese we are discriminated against by the importation of a third country food product.  I would ask the Minister and his officials to point out in negotiations that technical anomaly regarding our position on the United Kingdom market.  I would ask the Minister in particular to strongly resist the increased share of this contracting market by New Zealand which is utterly unfair and discriminates against our producers.</P>
    <P>Our meat industry, in particular our lamb industry, is affected to a great extent by New Zealand.  The importation of cheap frozen lamb into the United Kingdom causes tremendous problems for our exporters in that when there is a surplus in the United Kingdom the UK itself exports fresh lamb to France where we have built up good markets, thereby disrupting that market.  Of the total meat importation into Europe 400,000 tonnes came from Latin American countries and New Zealand &mdash; almost twice our total export.  Any objective person examining that situation will recognise that we have a unique problem.  Indeed, our negotiators should have a relatively easy job advancing our position in that regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Common Agricultural Policy, there are two major problems. The first is the cost, and so far as the bureaucrats in Brussels are concerned, this cost is occasioned by increasing production and declining markets.  Of course, an ideal food policy would strike a balance between production and consumption which would be of advantage to farmer and consumer alike.  The present difficulty about the steps taken to sort out this problem is that only the production end appears to be tackled.  We hear about super-levies, systems to curtail production, reduce output at all costs; but there is not a word about increasing comsumption, and everybody knows that consumption can be increased.  We have sufficient substitute products, all sorts of substitute products coming into the Common Market and our country, that could be replaced by genuine food products. But, for some reason or another, the Commission have not put one single <Col N="2608" /> effort into improving or increasing consumption; all efforts are by way of curtailment of production, ensuring minimum production at all costs.</P>
    <P>There was an interesting contribution from Deputy Pattison of the Labour Party a while ago regarding the Labour effort to emphasise our case and ensure that it is properly heard in Europe.  I would refer him to a paper given recently by his colleague in Europe, Mr. Brendan Halligan, MEP, when he addressed the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society Conference at the Burlington Hotel on Tuesday, 8 November 1983.  He said:</P>
    <P>The forthcoming European Council in Athens will effectively determine whether or not Community membership is any longer of benefit to Ireland. The outcome of this historic meeting will for us depend on one factor and one factor only: the extent to which the unique problems of the Irish economy are understood and appreciated by the other member states of the Community. I greatly fear, on the basis of personal experience, that these problems are not understood and for that reason I am most pessimistic about the prospects of a special deal for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I assume when Mr. Halligan, MEP, speaks of &ldquo;personal experience&rdquo; he is speaking of his experience as a member of the European Parliament because he knows what goes on there.  He continues:</P>
    <P>This leads me to the conclusion that it is odds on we will suffer a net loss of revenue unless our Government demonstrates negotiating skills of which it has, so far, shown no evidence.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>There is no perception of our difficulties and we are regarded as being signally irrelevant politically.  The other difficulty is domestic.  The Government has lost out by refusing to engage in a bold and dramatic presentation of our case by taking it directly to each national capital in advance of Athens.  The failure to engage in a tour of capitals has been a bad blunder.</P>
    <P>I am alarmed to think that our negotiators <Col N="2609" /> have not got though to Brussels the seriousness of our appalling problem and our chronic situation.  Even at this late stage the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Agriculture or some of his Ministers of State, could do a tour of all the capitals and make absolutely certain that we are not treated as irrelevant and as an irritant on the north western periphery of the Common Market.  We are members of the Common Market and since we joined we have behaved impeccably.  We have adhered to the rules and we are only asking for our fair share of the cake, and not to be penalised for a chronic situation which has been brought about not by other members, but by third countries.</P>
    <P>We have not done our case any good at home for a number of reasons.  Early in February the Government decided to abruptly terminate the farm modernisation scheme thereby losing millions of pounds of EEC money which could have been used to build up and modernise our farm production units.  At that time we were far behind our European competitors. If we wanted to make the best use of EEC funds, we should have continued to modernise our farms because the levels of grants to Irish farmers were far behind those granted to our European counterparts, and the level of the grants had not been increased for several years.  The Irish farmer investing in milking parlours and farm buildings got a substantially lower grant than his counterpart in Denmark or the Netherlands.</P>

      <P>Yes.  In this House we have the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, which has not convened for two-and-a-half years.  This Committee is of vital importance because directives and regulations as they affect Ireland are debated and amended.  If we do not take ourselves seriously as Europeans, how can we expect the European bureaucrats to take us seriously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two further aspects of the EEC which we do not take seriously are the Regional Fund and the Social Fund allocations <Col N="2610" /> which should be of tremendous importance to rural Ireland.  We take the soft option and the easy way out because those moneys are paid directly into the Exchequer rather than being used for special projects in rural areas to correct some of the imbalances which exist there. It is much easier to put this money into the Exchequer and let the regions take care of themselves.</P>
    <P>To return to the heart of the present problem, namely, over-production of agricultural products and declining consumption, I would ask our negotiators to demand that the Commission put some effort into increasing consumption because, to use a cliche, they have not looked beyond the farm gate.  As a start I suggest that the title &ldquo;Common Agricultural Policy&rdquo; be changed to the &ldquo;Common Agricultural and Food Policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If you produce a product, it must be processed, marketed and made available to consumers.  There is no point getting 1,000 gallons of milk and converting it into the easiest product, namely butter, and making powder out of the remainder, dumping them into intervention and expecting everybody else to look after them.  I would ask the Commission to begin by improving processing and marketing facilities.</P>
    <P>Here at home we could make a start in this regard.  We convert 80 per cent of our milk into butter, which is a larger percentage than before we joined the EEC; we convert the skim milk into powder and most of the remainder into cheese, maybe a little into casein and a very small percentage, about 1.5 per cent, into liqueurs and yogourts and high added-value products.  I realise we have only a small home market but we could use it as a test market to develop and improve our products and then sell them in Europe.  If anybody doubts what I am saying he should go to the shops in this city or in any town in rural Ireland and look at the varieties of cheese and yogourts which are imported.  We have to get our house in order so far as consumer-oriented products are concerned.</P>
    <P>A start could be made by paying for milk on a total solids basis.  We are still <Col N="2611" /> paying for milk on its butter fat content. As I pointed out butter is no longer wanted.  It is piling up &mdash; 800 million tonnes.  It is associated with heart disease. The nutritional values are ignored as is the lactose which, in my constituency, is converted into alcohol.  This could be further refined and converted into energy of various kinds.  We should start paying for milk on its total solids content &mdash; fat, protein and lactose.</P>
    <P>This super-levy will be introduced at a 75 per cent rate on the increased volume of milk.  It is the constituents of milk that cause the mountains &mdash; butter, powder and protein.  As our milk has lower fat and protein contents than our European counterparts, we are being even more severely penalised.  If there is to be any degree of a super-levy at a future date, it should be on the solids content and not on volume because it is the contents on milk which have raised these problems.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister to make this tour of the European capitals and to ensure that our position is recognised and appreciated.  The total support not alone of the Dáil but of the Irish people is behind them because this is the single most serious matter likely to affect us that we have encountered since our accession to the EEC.</P>
    <P>If the Minister returns empty-handed from the negotiations regarding this matter we may as well put RIP over his desk when he is leaving because he will sound the death knell not alone for the dairying industry but for the whole economy.</P>
    <P>The job situation will be affected also because of this imposition.  When it comes to making a reasonable income there is virtually no alternative to dairying for the vast majority of Irish farmers because of the size of their farms, and the gross margins are lower in most of the other farming enterprises available to them.  Ireland must secure a derogation from the super-levy sufficient to allow further development in our dairy and agricultural industry at least to levels of output approaching European average levels.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of contributing to this very important debate and I welcome very much the opportunity provided to debate some very crucial matters.  This is the first in-depth discussion on the EEC and particularly on the CAP that I can recall for a considerable time here.  Before going on to deal with the Commission's proposals particularly in relation to the CAP and, more specifically, to the milk sector, I would like to say how much I welcome the opening speech by the Minister for Foreign Affairs here this evening.  The significance of his speech and the manner in which he approached the negotiations in the context of Article 5 and Article 44 of the Treaty have been overlooked in most of discussion that has taken place here.  Some of what he said is worth repeating, and I quote:</P>
      <P>The Treaty, establishing the Community, affirmed unambiguously that the essential objective of member states must be the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of the people of Europe.  The text goes on to underline the need to ensure the harmonious development of the economies of member states by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions.  This is fundamental Community philosophy. These are the principles and objectives that created so much excitement,...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister at the time rightly said that in <Col N="2613" /> 1972 on the referendum before our entry into the EEC.  Further on the Minister went on to deal with various aspects of Community policy in relation to financing and own resources, and he made reference to major decisions which will face the Heads of State in Athens next month. Very relevant to this country, the Minister has put the whole question of the super-levy and the CAP in their proper context of European regional policy and particularly in the context of the philosophy of the Treaty of Rome which pledged the Community to formulate and implement a coherent regional policy which would ensure that the gap between the richer regions and the poorer regions would be continuously narrowed.</P>
    <P>Looking back on the Community and remembering what the Minister has said, after four years as an MEP I believe it is time to call a spade a spade.  Despite the wonderful philosophical concept enshrined by the great architects of the Treaty of Rome, Konrad Adenauer, Schumann and De Gasperi and the pledge to help the poorer regions bring up their economies and so forth, improve the social lot of the people and try to narrow the gap, after a quarter of a century in existence the EEC has had one notable characteristic.  The various policies implemented, the various Community finances implemented, have all contributed to the situation whereby the rich regions of Europe have continuously become richer while the poor regions have continued to become poorer.  If there were a coherent regional policy and if the Community had given practical expression to the philosophy of the Treaty of Rome whereby the economic and social problems of poorer regions, particularly of the peripheral regions like Ireland had been taken into account, the Commission would never have come up with a concept of a super-levy which would be applied right across the board from the richer German and Dutch agricultural regions without any differentation between rich farmers, factory farmers and the smaller farmers in the poorer regions such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>The concept and proposal of the super-levy are symptomatic of the total <Col N="2614" /> failure of the EEC to put forward and implement a coherent regional policy.  I am delighted that the Minister has adverted to this and has indicated his position in relation to the battle we are fighting now in relation to this super-levy, something which we must emphasise again and again.  We have special problems in this country and, apart from the Treaty of Rome, it should be remembered that in the protocol to the Treaty of Accession at the end of 1972 special recognition was given to the entire island of Ireland.  The entire island was recognised as being an under-developed region in need of special assistance under various Community instruments, under the Regional Fund, the Social Fund, FEOGA and various other sources of finance.  In practice this has not worked out.  The proposal to introduce a super-levy right throughout the Community without taking into account the special economic and social factors operating in the poorer regions of the Community, such as this country, is a clear indication of an absolute departure, particularly by the bureaucrats in the Berlaymont building in Brussels, from the basic philosophy of the Treaty of Rome and also a flagrant breach of the protocol to our Treaty of Accession in 1972.  This must be emphasised again and again.</P>
    <P>In Athens the EEC will be at the crossroads faced with enormous financial problems.  The Summit in Athens in December will determine whether this Community will progress and develop as was envisaged by the Treaty of Rome or whether it will continue to be as it is now, in a financial quagmire, drifting from crisis to crisis and trying to find <i>ad hoc</i> and temporary solutions to major problems. In the debate on the budget for 1984 two weeks ago in Strasbourg we saw this type of stop-gap measure of robbing Peter to pay Paul financial policy where there were cuts in agricultural spending in order to increase the Regional Fund and Social Fund.  This is the type of day-to-day <i>ad hoc</i> policy.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the problem of our resources will be tackled vigorously and provision will be made.  I fully reject, and so do my colleagues, the argument <Col N="2615" /> put forward over the past two years that agricultural funds must be cut so that there can be an increase in both the Regional and Social Funds.  In the context of this country and its economic problems it is somewhat ludicrous to talk about a regional policy exclusive of agriculture. Remember a regional policy must be based on the agricultural industry and special recognition must be given to the role of agriculture in our economy. All financial resources should be applied in a co-ordinated way for the social and economic development of the country.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest stumbling blocks is the proposal <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Common Agricultural Policy.  Indeed there are several proposals including that of the super-levy. This latter has caused the greatest worry and anxiety.  There are good grounds for that anxiety.  As I said, this country is dependent on agriculture more than any other member country of the EEC.  The dairy industry is the foundation of our agricultural economy.  It provides employment on the farm and in the processing industry.  I cannot understand how anyone in Brussels could have come up with a proposal like the super-levy nor can I understand how that super-levy could be applied fairly.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is vital to our economy. According to the Treaty of Rome equal opportunity and fair play are guaranteed so that farmers can make a decent living. We have been in the Community only ten years.  Other member states have been there 25 years.  I am certain that my Irish colleagues in the European Parliament all agree that the policy adopted by the Government since last August has been the correct policy.  Deputy Pattison referred to the continuous efforts made by the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance.  All have used every means available to them in an effort to get a better understanding.  Only yesterday in the European Parliament the Common Agricultural Policy was debated.  That debate continues today and it will continue again tomorrow.  I shall be leaving in the morning in order to participate in <Col N="2616" /> the debate.  There are several amendments.</P>
    <P>We have a serious problem.  We cannot accept the super-levy.  That is the biggest problem with which we are confronted. Looking at the reaction in the different member states I am satisfied that ours is the correct approach.  It has got massive publicity in the media and a better understanding has been created.  Negotiations are going on all the time and I am satisfied, and I am sure my colleagues will endorse what I say, that both the Taoiseach and the Government have left no stone unturned in ensuring that the Commission, and particularly the Council of Ministers and the different national Governments, understand why we are so worried about the proposed super-levy. There has been remarkable unity and solidarity among the Irish Members of the European Parliament irrespective of party affiliation and irrespective of what group they are affiliated to in Europe. We have used every means at our disposal to get a proper appreciation of our problems.  There was a significant announcement by the Greek President in the past week.  Even those who may not have a full understanding of what we are looking for nevertheless recognise there is a serious problem in Ireland in relation to the dairy industry and the super-levy. We shall be speaking, both Mr. Richie Ryan and I, on a number of amendments tomorrow.  We shall be leaving here at 7.30 in the morning.</P>
    <P>The Currie Report is a report prepared by Mr. Currie, a Tory member of the European Parliament.  He was the rapporteur appointed by the Agricultural Committee to produce the report reflecting the views of that committee of the European Parliament in relation to the recent Commission proposals <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Common Agricultural Policy.  Unfortunately, that report is most unsatisfactory as far as this country is concerned in that, while it contains many good things and is in many ways a realistic assessment of the problems confronting the EEC at the moment in relation to the Common agricultural policy, there is no reference in this significant report to the special position of Ireland and other peripheral <Col N="2617" /> regions of the Community.  A number of amendments were put to the agricultural committee in the hope that they might be incorporated in the report, but that did not happen.  Other members of the European Parliament will have similar amendments to ours to put down.</P>
    <P>Our first amendment insists that any adaptation of the CAP on the basis of proposals put forward by the Commission should not be to the detriment of the viability of the family farm or of small farmers in the poorer regions of the Community such as Ireland.  The second amendment is seeking to insert a new paragraph, the text of which is that we believe the most practical way of regulating production in certain sectors is through the application of flexible guarantee thresholds which respect the following criteria &mdash; and these are very important &mdash; firstly, the importance of the sector in the economy of the member state and, secondly, the state of development of that sector in the member state concerned.  These are two vitally significant and fundamental factors in this debate with relation to the super-levy.</P>
    <P>We have put down amendment No. 11 which we will fight to have carried by the Parliament, which is of vital and fundamental importance to this whole debate. We are asking for the addition of a new paragraph seeking to have the European Parliament to agree that, firstly, because of the low levels of production in the island of Ireland, secondly, because of the degree of dependency on agriculture, thirdly because of the fact that the GP of Ireland is only half the Community average; and, fourthly, because of Ireland's dependence on milk, cattle and beef, the setting of levels for guaranteed thresholds should not be imposed until production in the island of Ireland reaches the average level of production of the European Community as a whole.  This is the basis of our entire case.  We are entitled to that chance under the Treaty of Rome and under the conditions of our entry into the EEC.  We are entitled to an improvement in our agricultural production and milk outputs up to the Community average.</P>
    <P>I took part in the campaign along the <Col N="2618" /> west coast and the southern regions to get the farmers to agree to entry into the EEC in order to give a new impetus to our dairy industry.  If this super-levy goes through we will have conned the dairy farmers of Ireland in 1972, misled them and given them false expectations of great things.  Nevertheless, I am cautiously optimistic, even though the battle is far from being won, that out of the summit meeting in Athens will come a formula which will be satisfactory to our dairy farmers and will give them scope to develop their output per cow up to the European level.  This will ensure that our dairy processing industries will develop, expand and provide more employment.</P>
    <P>I carried out a survey among some of the major co-operatives and am frightened at the social aspects of the impact of the super-levy.  Two top economists and one expert in the dairying industry whom I have consulted in the past fortnight have informed me that the imposition of the super-levy would lead to a loss of 1,000 jobs in the milk processing industry.  That is if the base line of 1981 were adhered to.</P>
    <P>There has been a 15 per cent increase in milk production between 1981 and 1983.  Most of the major co-operatives have surplus capacities.  They are targeting for increased milk production and milk intake in the coming year.  One co-operative is targeting for as high as 8 per cent of an increase in milk intake.  The whole structure of the dairying industry would be absolutely destroyed if this super-levy were imposed and that is no exaggeration.</P>
    <P>I shall have an opportunity in Strasbourg tomorrow evening to deliver much the same speech as I am delivering here in our national Parliament.  I welcome the speeches from the opposite side of the House.  They have displayed great unity and solidarity.  We European Parliament Members of all parties have done everything in our power in lobbying support for Ireland's case.  This debate will serve to demonstrate loudly and clearly to the powers that be in the European Community that this small nation is determined to ensure the viability of our <Col N="2619" /> dairying industry which is so vital to the national economy.</P>
    <P>One thing which worries me greatly is that because of the world recession it is becoming virtually impossible to attract major industrial investment from abroad, as had happened in the sixties and seventies. If we are to tackle the unemployment situation we must rely on our own resources and our only real resources are agriculture, the land of Ireland and the fisheries.  We must develop our agriculture, our food processing and added value in both agriculture and fisheries. These are the only areas which provide hope for the generation of new employment to meet the aspirations of our young population, the youngest in western Europe.  I am cautiously optimistic that the outcome will be OK.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear an MEP saying that he is optimistic that it will be OK.  It is only right that an opportunity was afforded to discuss this issue, which is certainly one of the most serious which has faced this Parliament since the setting up of the State.  This debate is important, because it will strengthen the hand of those men who are going out to Brussels to put our case.  Their muscle has up to now been a bit weak.</P>

      <P>The campaign, from the Taoiseach down, has been indecisive. The Taoiseach said at one stage that we should prevent damage to the Irish interests and then the Minister for Agriculture conceded the situation later.  We are facing a very serious situation at national level.  When we, as elected Members, bring it down to parochial level it is much more serious, with practically 50 per cent of the farmers dependent on milk production and about 73 per cent in my constituency.  The dairy industry has shown substantial growth since 1965.  It was then 24 per cent of the gross agricultural output.  It has risen since then to 32 per cent and that in a time when there was a reduction in the number of suppliers, but to offset that an increase in <Col N="2620" /> cow numbers and in yield per cow, which still stands at 680 gallons per cow and which is low in comparison with European standards.  Our average cow herd is only about 14½ cows.  When we compare those figures with the other EEC milk producing countries of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and Denmark this chart shows some of the areas where the dairy industry in Ireland is inferior to all the other member states of the EEC.  In most of the other states the yield is 1,000 gallons, but it is only 680 gallons here.  The seasonality of the milk supply has always been a problem here, and we find we come out very badly in that respect.  Deputy Walsh spoke earlier about paying on solids rather than butter fat content.  This has been discussed very frequently over the last few years.  With regard to the butter fat content we are the lowest.  We find that in Denmark the butter fat content is 4.22 per cent and in Ireland it is 3.49 per cent.</P>
      <P>Another question which was discussed at Question Time before the summer recess is milk recording.  It is generally accepted that it would be very desirable if there were more milk recordings.  We are at the bottom of the scale.  In Germany the figure is 44 per cent, France 25 per cent, Netherlands 66 per cent, Belgium 27 per cent, UK 36 per cent, Denmark 65 per cent and the Irish Republic 3 per cent.  We have failed to keep record of the recordings.  We are far down the scale in relation to the price of milk, only two thirds of most of the other milk producing states.  We are behind in every aspect.  We could blame many things for this.  We could blame the problems created by brucellosis when so many herds had to be disposed of and in other cases many animals in herds had to be disposed of.  We also had very high inflation and, most important of all, we started from a very low base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look at the dairy situation we also have to look at beef production and our factories.  We find that 85 per cent of beef supplies come from dairy herds.  It is generally accepted, whether it is single, double or treble sucklings, that it is not profitable because there are fewer people <Col N="2621" /> engaged in that as an enterprise.  The ideal situation is to have a viable dairy industry and aligned to it calf to beef and a beef industry.  Reference has been made here to the number employed in the dairy industry.  There are 11,000 people employed and it is accepted that if the super-levy is introduced 15 per cent of the suppliers will go out of business and there will be a decrease of 10 per cent in the work force employed in the dairy industry.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have referred to the problems caused by factory cows.  There are massive imports into the EEC of cereal substitutes.  Ireland, France, Italy and Denmark account for 55 per cent of the total agricultural production in the EEC but they import only 12 per cent of all the cereal substitutes.  Germany and the Netherlands are in the business of factory cows and account for 70 per cent of the cereal substitutes.  I saw lately that 20 million tons of cereal substitutes were imported and that 10 million tons of that went directly for feeding factory cows. This is one area where it is very hard for a country like Ireland to compete.  There should be some concession given to us in relation to the super-levy.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of New Zealand butter.  Despite all the discussions and all the pressures to reduce unnecessary imports, when we have a large amount of butter within the EEC, we find that in 1974 Britain imported 25 per cent of her butter consumption but this has now increased to 34 per cent.  In the case of milk as a percentage of the final product the figure is 32 with an average of 19 per cent in the EEC countries.  We all welcome the strategy for the development of agriculture processing in Ireland by the IDA.  This had great potential of higher value added products to provide employment.  We had the raw material in the dairy and beef production in large quantities.  In their report they stated that they estimated the increased level of processing which could be achieved over the decade by the dairy subsector would be 30 per cent increase in the level of raw material imports.  They hope that 83 per cent of the commodity products of butter, milk powder, chocolate <Col N="2622" /> crumb and casein in 1980 would be reduced to 65 per cent in 1990.  This would increase those higher added value products from 17 per cent to 35 per cent in that period.  The dairy industry was developing in that context.  The people in the industry felt there would be a ceiling to the amount of milk which could be produced for the more common products like butter and cheese.  They were aiming at the higher value added products and the baby and diet foods, canned milk powder, processed cheese, whey and dairy desserts.  They were pinning their hopes on those areas.  If the super levy becomes a reality it will leave us in a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>When we look at the Irish agricultural figures for any of the years I have been talking about there is only a slight change.  We find in relation to the gross margin per acre in certain enterprises creamery milk is £2.93 for 1982 and it came in second to sugar beet at £3.40. The sugar beet is restricted because it is on a quota system and the people cannot improve or increase their acreage because they would be getting a much lower price.  Munster and Leinster have alternatives but because of the soil in my area, where only 3 per cent is under cereals, we have a problem because there is no other line of farming which we can opt for if milk became unprofitable to produce.</P>
    <P>When ACOT were set up they set their own guidelines and said what they intended to do for that region which covers Monaghan, Cavan, Longford, Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal.  They recognised that Cavan, Monaghan and Longford were dairying counties and the others were more concerned with livestock, sheep, etc.  In the guidelines in their booklet they spoke about grassland management and production.  They said that, with tightening economic margins, the aim must be to optimise levels of production with properly developed livestock enterprise systems and that there could be a balanced and sustained increase and stocking to a level of 25 per cent above what was being achieved. They went on to say that the coming decade should see a 50 per cent increase <Col N="2623" /> in output in dairy produce in this region. Present indications seem to suggest a 25 per cent increase in cow numbers with a 20 per cent increase in milk yield as the most readily achievable way to this goal.</P>
    <P>That area is severely handicapped and, if the EEC means anything, they must take into account regional difficulties and problems.  They must also take into account the social as well as the economic aspects of any region.  That is what we expected under the Treaty of Rome but it looks as if we will not be getting that treatment.  I believe that the policies will be sufficiently flexible to take into account the stage of development of regions such as that because, in the region which I represent where dairying is so important, An Foras Talúntáis did a farm survey in 1981 and they stated that the family farm income for Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan was £3,048 per annum for a full time farmer as against £6,210 for the Leinster counties.  That gives an indication of the problems which would arise if that area could not develop their dairy industry.</P>
    <P>In a survey carried out by ACOT in Cavan last year of 382 farmers, 73 per cent listed dairying as their main source of income.  As 70 per cent of the land is marginal, it gives an indication of how it would be a practical impossibility to change over to any other type of farming, because the soil is heavy and retains moisture. As a result of surveys carried out by ACOT it was disclosed that a neighbour of mine, although he had less than 40 acres, was making a good livelihood from milk production only.  He was able to rear a large family and was paying income tax because his valuation was slightly in excess of £40 because it was good quality land.  That gives an indication of how a brake would be put on more productive farmers.</P>
    <P>We have two co-operatives in Monaghan and two in Cavan and there are a number of other milk plants like Abbott in Cootehill and MacCormack Products in Killeshandra.  These co-operatives are giving massive employment and there is a very big spin-off in terms of related employment.  In all those cases <Col N="2624" /> there is a diversification to value added products.  If there is any stay put on milk production, no one would be inclined to set up business in value added products in the area.  I am in a position to know what would happen to the co-operatives if this came to pass because I spent practically all my working life, prior to coming into politics, attached to a co-operative. At that time the co-operative structure was weak, we had small independent co-operatives, Killeshandra, Lough Egish and others.  In those small independent co-operatives the milk intake was 400 to 600 gallons a day.  Now in Cavan, with about 8,000 holdings, 73 per cent are engaged in milk production with 61,000 cows and in Monaghan there are 6,100 holdings and 41,000 cows.</P>
    <P>Over the last year in the Monaghan area &mdash; I have not got the figures for Cavan &mdash; they increased their milk production from 36 million gallons to 40.3 million gallons.  They increased their production from 1981 to 1983 by 10 per cent and by 4.3 million gallons.  If restrictions were based on the 1981 milk supply, it would mean that those farmers would be losing about 7p per gallon.  In that area 70 per cent of farmers have less than 10,000 gallons of milk.  It may seem a very small amount, but it is the produce of 12 or 14 cows and it provides a livelihood. It would decrease their income by about £56 per cow, in an area where there is no alternative livelihood.  I believe in the phrase that the world does not owe any man a living but it does owe them an opportunity.</P>
    <P>We would be denying people in regions such as Cavan-Monaghan the opportunity of making a living from an enterprise that has potential for development.  The situation is, therefore, very serious and involves also the co-operatives.  It is very difficult to understand EEC thinking in the past number of years having regard to the heavy investment that was made in the dairy industry, investment that resulted in the provision of buildings and machinery to enable the processing of additional quantities of milk.  The proposed levy will restrict the production capacity in the industry at a time when the EEC are grant aiding it.  With hindsight <Col N="2625" /> we have not made the progress that we should have made since joining the Community.  There are a number of reasons for this.  We heard a lot about credit facilities being restricted and about how badly off some farmers were as a result, but most of their expenditure was used for the provision of additional facilities in the dairy industry.</P>
    <P>The effect of the withdrawal of the farm modernisation grants has been referred to.  In one of the counties in my constituency 230 farmers were disqualified as a result of the measures taken in the last budget.  They were disqualified on the basis of not having received written approvals from the farm development offices.  Most of those farmers were involved in dairying.  I had the case of one man who had paid a large deposit on milking equipment to the value of £14,000 but he, too, was disqualified from receiving the grant.  We would hope that in the re-introduction of these grants, the Minister will give recognition to those people who had been well ahead in carrying out work on the basis of receiving the grants but who were disqualified on foot of the new regulation.  We had expected the grants to be reintroduced in this month, but I hope there will not be much further delay.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that the overall effect of the super-levy would be to reduce our GNP by at least 1 per cent.  In that regard the figure of £146 million has been mentioned.  We must not lose sight of the big question of the loss of confidence that would follow the imposition of the super-levy, because confidence is the most important factor in any industry. The producer must have confidence in his product.</P>
    <P>While some of the figures I quoted earlier do not show us in a very good light <i>vis-à-vis</i> our EEC partners, there has been a tremendous improvement in the quality of our milk.  We started from a very low base when quality control was unheard of.  That was in the post-war years when we were returning to milk production but when there was not as much as a proper filtering system.  Some of those heavily grant-aided processing <Col N="2626" /> industries to which I referred earlier are insisting on a very high grade of milk.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the super-levy would be the imposition of a quota on Irish production and on the expansion of our dairy industry.  In a situation of underdevelopment in the dairy sector and in which 85 per cent of farmers have fewer than 30 cows one can easily visualise the effects of the proposed levy.  We talk often about the reduction in the numbers on the land, a reduction from 390,000 in 1960 to 220,000 in 1980, but that would be nothing to the numbers who would have to leave the land if the super-levy were to be imposed on us.  It would sound the death knell of many farmers in the Cavan-Monaghan area, for instance, who had either developed their dairy industry or were at the stage of developing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this very important issue, and I compliment the Government for allowing time for this debate.  We must let the rest of the Community see that we are united in our fight against the super-levy proposal, a proposal that would destroy our dairy industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture must be complimented on the stand he has continued to take in negotiating on behalf of the farmers and of the Irish people generally in this matter and in trying to ensure that there is a derogation, a derogation of four years at least.  If the levy as proposed were to be imposed on us, many farmers would be out of business overnight.  At least 10,000 family farms would be affected to the extent that these farmers would have to withdraw from farming, from the only kind of life they have known.  If we take the average number of people involved in any family farm as four, we are talking about the livelihoods of 40,000 people.</P>
      <P>I do not think any of us could agree with such proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The workers at the Clondalkin Paper Mills have fought for their jobs now for two years past. At least they have no political axe to grind on this issue.  Regrettably, however, the same cannot be said for the Fianna Fáil Party. To an uninformed observer who might have dropped into this Assembly last evening and who might have heard Fianna Fáil speakers here pontificating, one would have thought that they, and they only, were the great nationalisers of this age, all of a sudden, the great keepers of promises and the great would-be openers of the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  Deputy Lenihan and Deputy Harney gave us here an apparently exhaustive and comprehensive account of all the commitments given by all and sundry to open the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  They referred to the commitment of the Fine Gael Party, they referred to the commitment of Deputy Skelly, they referred to the commitment of the Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring. They gave full details of all commitments given except one, their own.  That one they conveniently forgot to mention.  I am sure they would wish me, for the purpose of the record, to make good that <Col N="2628" /> omission so that it should go into the record of the House what was their commitment. That I propose to do.  I have it here, this document &mdash; I suppose they will remember that one &mdash; and I shall read it.  It is headed &ldquo;Fianna Fáil, The Republican Party&rdquo;, dated 4 February 1982.  &ldquo;Text of the Fianna Fáil Policy Statement Regarding Clondalkin Paper Mills, Issued by Fianna Fáil Press Office:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil condemns the inaction of the Coalition Government in regard to Clondalkin Paper Mills.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is committed to re-opening the mills and pledges that, when elected to government, it will, as a matter of urgency, take the necessary steps to ensure the resumption of production at the mills.</P>
      <P>Obviously this document was meant to be taken seriously because not alone did it have the names typed in but the signatures are there alongside them as well. I will read out the signatures: first, Mary Harney, TD; second, Liam Lawlor, MCC; third &mdash; and here is an interesting one &mdash; Brian Lenihan, TD, whom we heard with great force here last evening, Deputy Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party; fourth, Seán Walsh, TD; fifth, Eileen Lemass, TD; and finally Richard Conroy. The pre-condition in that document, that &ldquo;when elected to government&rdquo;, duly took place and they were elected to government in February 1982, a short period afterwards.  They remained in Government in March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November.  What was their pledge in that document when elected to government, as a matter of urgency to have resumption of production at the mill?  Some urgency, some resumption of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan last evening, with gay abandon, adopted and took aboard the idea of nationalisation, as is contained in Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment.  Where was his nationalisation Bill when he was in government for nine months?  Did that ever see the light of day?  Could it be that his Nationalisation of Clondalkin Paper Mills Bill of 1982 was held up in the nitty-gritty minutiae of the Committee Stage?  Or had it perhaps been held up on <Col N="2629" /> lengthy debates on Second Stage?  Was it ever published on First Stage?  Nothing, nothing at all; it never saw the light of day.  Where was the nationalisation Bill so much advocated here last evening by Deputy Lenihan when he had nine months to do it?  Where was that during his nine months?  Was that Bill rushed through the Dáil in one day, in a week, in a month, in three months or in six months?  And his supporters in that Coalition, The Workers' Party &mdash; who have shown themselves in recent times adept at Private Members' Bills &mdash; did they produce the Private Members' Nationalisation Bill of Clondalkin?  Not at all.  They were confined to supporting motions of confidence in Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach, in mid-term, notwithstanding his blatant default in carrying out his written and signed commitment of February 1982.</P>
    <P>The action committee were very unhappy about this situation as the months rolled on and nothing was happening. They sought a meeting with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  That meeting took place up there in Room No. 114 on 24 June 1982, more or less mid-term, with representatives of the action committee, of ICTU, local TDs, including myself.  The action committee presented to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, this document headed &ldquo;Some Facts for Presentation to An Taoiseach&rdquo;. I will read some of them:</P>
    <P>Paragraph (1): Political Commitments:</P>
    <P>(A)  Pre-election pledge signed by Lenihan, Lawlor, Harney, Walsh etc.</P>
    <P>That is the way it is put.</P>
    <P>(B)  Taoiseach's commitment in &ldquo;Gregory package.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Remember the Gregory package which included the Fianna Fáil commitment to re-open the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  That is one commitment of many not adopted or implemented by them in nine months in office.</P>
    <P>(C)  Verbal and written assurances by Minister Albert Reynolds to <Col N="2630" /> TDs, ICTU and Action Committee;</P>
    <P>(D)  Taoiseach's verbal assurances during Dublin West by-election.</P>
    <P>There was much play here last evening about Deputy Skelly's assurances at the Dublin West by-election.  But nobody mentioned Deputy Haughey's verbal assurances during the Dublin West by-election.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 3 &mdash; Inadequacy and Defects of Government's Actions:</P>

      <P>Those were the submissions made to Deputy Haughey when he was Taoiseach on 24 June 1982.  Did they spur the Fianna Fáil Government into any further action on Clondalkin?  Not at all.  July rolled on as did August, September, October, November, and what was achieved by that Fianna Fáil Government?</P>

      <P>Deputy Harney indicated here last evening that the next Fianna Fáil Government would re-open the mill.  I do not know what basis or credibility that statement has, seeing that the last Fianna Fáil Government had nine months to do it and did nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>They say they will open it again, subject to viability.  In recent times I have come to detest that word &ldquo;viability&rdquo;. The Boston consultants in their wisdom talked about a one-in-five chance of viability.  For the life of me, I do not know how they assess that, not one-in-four, not one-in-six, not that it has a good chance of working, not that the workers will put their all into it.  No, they pick on a one-in-five chance of viability, and frankly I distrust that kind of assessment.</P>
      <P>The Canadian firm, FMI, are prepared to put £1 million up front.  They apparently have one million reasons to think it is viable.  I am convinced it is viable; The commitment of the workers will make it viable; and a modest energy subsidy from the Minister for Industry and Energy to a working Clondalkin Paper Mills, as is given in Europe to paper mills, would ensure its positive viability.  I have raised the question of providing a modest subsidy in energy costs to the mill with the Minister and he said he could not make an exception in that case because if he gave it to one he would have to give it to many.  In legal circles they have a saying that there is always the exception that proves the rule.  In this industry, this would be the exception that would prove the rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he wants a good return on taxpayer's money.  In return for a modest subsidy he would get the following: first, the subsidy back straight away in tax on the energy used <Col N="2632" /> at Clondalkin; second, an input of £2 million a year in energy use into the ESB, which is likewise State funded; third, he would keep open one of the peat burning generating stations threatened with closure because they could produce the electricity for Clondalkin and send it down the wire to the paper mills; fourth, he would keep peat workers employed to feed that generating station; fifth, he would provide work for the people of Clondalkin; and sixth, he would provide our own paper for our own country.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil had the chance to open this mill and they did nothing.  The responsibility to open the mill now rests with this Government and now is the time to do it.</P>

It will provide a 50 per cent Government interest in that firm, there will be an Irish investment in the remainder and I understand Mr. Roantree is prepared to take up a substantial equity in the remainder.  He has given a commitment, I understand, to buy one-sixth of the total maximum output of paper production at Clondalkin.</P>

      <P>I notice that the Minister, Deputy J. Bruton, is not here tonight.  That is a pity.  I thought he would be so interested in this debate that he would have honoured us with his presence. Having listened to Deputy Taylor I have no doubt that he is going to vote with us tonight.  I cannot see how he has any other option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closure of the Clondalkin Paper Mills has gone on for far too long; we all agree on that, and it must be brought to a conclusion without delay.  Whatever about Deputy Taylor and his remarks this evening, I believe the Minister does not have a commitment to re-open the mill. It is quite clear that over the past year, since he became Minister, he has done nothing to re-open the mill.  It is only in the last week or two, since the two men went on hunger strike, that he has <Col N="2634" /> become interested again.  Because pressure is being put on the Coalition Government, the Minister now sees fit to send IDA personnel once again to England to investigate an English buyer.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with a Canadian buyer, as Deputy Taylor rightly asked?  They sought a meeting with the Minister over the last few months but he refused to see them.  At no time did he meet them.  They were committed to buying the mill.  They saw it as a viable proposition and were prepared to put £1 million into it.  The Minister did not think it was a viable proposition.  Surely these Canadians know their business.  They would not have made an offer of that amount of money if they did not believe the Clondalkin Paper Mills was a viable proposition. However, they got no encouragement from the Minister.  That shows his commitment on that issue.</P>
    <P>The viability of the Clondalkin Paper Mills was never in question.  Deputy Taylor agrees with that; the Irish Congress of Trade Unions agree with that; the workers agree with that and Fianna Fáil agree with it.  What is the difficulty?  Last night the Minister read out a statement attributed to Deputy Reynolds about the viability of the mills.  He twisted that statement in an effort to imply that Deputy Reynolds would not re-open the mill unless assured by some other purchaser that it was a viable proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At no time did Deputy Reynolds make such a statement.  He maintained that it would be a viable proposition because there would not be a full reinstatement of the 488 workers.  Even in the time of Deputy Michael O'Leary, Deputy Reynolds' predecessor, there was a proposition to open the mill as part of the old company with 320 workers. Deputy Reynolds negotiated that down to zero.  He stated that people would be taken on as required when the mill was reopened, starting with 50 workers or 100 workers on double shift on one machine and building up to 200 to 220 workers on two machines as the mill got into operation <Col N="2635" /> and a market was found for the product that would be made there.</P>
      <P>We all agree that there would be no point in opening a mill that was not viable. The workers, the ICTU and politicians would not see any point in that, but we believed that it would be a viable proposition after negotiations took place between all concerned.  Before he left office Deputy Reynolds had settled the following points: first, the purchase of the mill at a very low price, £1.75 million for the plant, machinery and 14 acres of land, in anybody's estimation a very good deal; secondly, the workforce was negotiated with the workers and the ICTU and was to be reduced from 488 to 200 workers.  That was agreed by everybody and on that basis everyone agreed that to reopen the mill would be a viable proposition. Thirdly, natural gas from Kinsale was coming on stream and would be available at a much cheaper rate than the electricity which was costing £1 million a year.  Fourthly, there was no paper-making industry in this country so we had a captive market for the produce of the mill.  All that was settled before Deputy Reynolds left office.</P>
      <P>The £1 million spent on electricity was a big factor in the non-viability of the mill.  At that time the Minister, Deputy Bruton, stated that he was considering helping Irish Steel by allowing them to avail of cheap electricity.  Deputy Taylor has stated that you could not set a precedent by giving it to Clondalkin Paper Mills.  The Minister was considering giving cheap electricity to Irish Steel so why not give it to Clondalkin Paper Mills? The ESB are producing 40 per cent too much electricity at the moment and it is going to waste.  It is being manufactured, there is no means of storing it and it is evaporating into thin air.  Why did the Minister not ensure that Clondalkin Paper Mills could avail of that electricity? That point made by Deputy Taylor is a good one and I agree with him there.</P>

    <P>Nobody wants a lame duck.  Workers have said that to the ICTU, we have said it and the ICTU have said it.  We all want a viable industry, not one that is going to open for six or 12 months and then close <Col N="2636" /> again.  The workers in Clondalkin have endured the situation for two years, and I must admit that I have never seen any group of workers stick to their proposition for so long while waiting for that mill to reopen.  It is extraordinary that their endurance has been so steady and complete. They have been very patient, and they have done everything in their power to ensure that their mill will open, and I congratulate them on their stand.</P>
    <P>Why should the Minister say that this mill is not viable?  Has he done any research on the matter?  A similar paper mill in Manchester has two machines of the same type as in Clondalkin and a similar workforce of 220.  They are making the same product and they make £2 million a year profit.  If that can be done in Manchester why can it not be done in Clondalkin?  Does the Minister know about that mill in Manchester?  Has he investigated any other mill in the world which is similar to that in Clondalkin, and which is viable and making a profit? There was never a question of opening the mill at any price.  We need our industries to endure.  The Minister did not even meet with the Canadian company.  He has done nothing at all in the last year in regard to this matter, and only now is he beginning to seek another buyer.  The ICTU have always believed that the intention of the Government was to reopen the mill.  Several meetings have taken place over the past year between the ICTU, the Minister and the Taoiseach. A letter dated 16 November 1982 from Deputy Reynolds to Mr McGrath of the ICTU, set out a five-point plan. The first point was agreement with the liquidator; second, examination of title; third, care and maintenance; fourth, management contract; fifth, reopening of the mill.  Under the fifth heading is stated: &ldquo;On completion of refurbishment the mill will be opened and employment will be phased in in relation to market demand to achieve full production on a two-machine basis&rdquo;.  That was signed by Deputy Reynolds, Minister for Industry and Energy.  How can anybody say that Deputy Reynolds was not totally committed to opening the mill?</P>
    <P>When the Coalition formed a government <Col N="2637" /> they held a meeting on 8 February 1983 which has been referred to and a decision to buy the mill was made by them at 2 a.m. and an agreement was signed.  This was just hours before the budget statement.  Has it ever happened before then that a Minister, his secretary and his officials burned the midnight oil right through the night to bring about the signing of an agreement before the next day, budget day?  I am absolutely convinced that pressure was being put on the Government of that time and that the Labour Party were not going to help form a Government or support the budget unless the Minister agreed to purchase the mill and decided so to do on that night.  They would not even wait until the next day, because there might have been a backing down.</P>
    <P>After that meeting, on 14 February a letter was sent from the General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mr. Donal Nevin, stating, concerning Clondalkin Mills, that he wished to confirm that in the course of the discussions with the Minister for Industry and Energy and with officials of his Department, it was made quite clear that the undertaking being given by the Government covered the commitments set out in the Minister's letter of 16 November, 1982.  I read out just now the headings of that letter.  Looking around the Chamber now, I see that there is no Member from the Labour Party present.</P>

      <P>One would think that they would at least come in to listen to this debate and be seen by all the people in the gallery who are workers and families of workers of the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  I am coming to the conclusion that they do not have any more commitment to the opening of the paper mills than the Fine Gael Party have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 14 April a meeting took place with the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Tourism, Mr. Rowan, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and members of the action committee of the Clondalkin workers.  They were discussing the refurbishment of the mill, and at <Col N="2638" /> that time everybody was of opinion that that meant that the mill would be opened. What else could one mean by refurbishment?</P>
    <P>Mr. Rowan stated at that meeting that as far as he was aware the Department's brief for the mill was just a refurbishment plan, that they did not intend carrying out the refurbishment, such as preparing the machinery and so forth.  The members at that meeting could not believe their ears when they heard this.  They could not believe that a great deal of money was being spent for nothing. There was no intention of reopening the mill, even though there were people out there and money was being spent on a refurbishment plan.  I believe that the Minister at that time just hoped that the Clondalkin Paper Mills workers would go away somewhere, drift away, and eventually the problem would be solved by default.</P>
    <P>On 23 September Mr. Nevin wrote to the Taoiseach indicating that an undertaking was confirmed on behalf of the Government in their statement of 8 February, 1983.  He said:</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt about the firmness of this commitment and, indeed of the time table set out in the letter of the Minister for Industry and Energy dated 16th November, 1982.</P>
    <P>He also said that the Taoiseach had acknowledged that the matter should be finalised as quickly as possible and had indicated that certain negotiations then in progress should be completed before the end of August.</P>
    <P>At that time Mr. Nevin was totally of the opinion that the Government and the Taoiseach were committed to the reopening of the mill.  At no time had anybody said otherwise to the workers or the Congress of Trade Unions.  This month the Irish Congress of Trade Unions issued a statement on the Clondalkin Paper Mills issue, an excerpt of which is as follows:</P>
    <P>The basis for the statement by Congress that the Government is committed to the November 1982 agreement is as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;There was an agreement between Congress and the Minister for Industry <Col N="2639" /> and Energy dated the 16th November 1982 which provided for the reopening of the mill.  No communication was ever received by Congress that the Government wished to abrogate the agreement.  The Government statement issued on the 8th February referred to the commitment of the previous Government and its decision to purchase the mill.  It made no reference to the abrogation of the agreement or, indeed, to any condition as to reopening.</P>
    <P>Discussions were held with the Minister's Department over many months concerning care, maintenance and refurbishment as provided for in the agreement.  Statements by the Minister about viability did not constitute an amendment of the agreement of the 16th November.  Notwithstanding references to viability, there could have been no agreement in this matter, given the imprecision of the word and the various constructions that could be put on it, apart from the period over which viability could be achieved.  It was made quite clear by Congress that discussions on the purchase of the mills was in the context of the agreement. Indeed, there was no other basis for the discussions.  There was no indication given at the meeting of the 7th or 8th February that the Government was repudiating the agreement of the previous Minister.  A commitment was given by Congress which was insisted on by the Government and recorded in the statement that was issued, that Congress recognised that because the situation was unique by virtue of the commitment given by a Government to Congress it set no precedent for any other case.  This makes sense only in the context of the agreement.  For all these reasons it was obvious to Congress that the agreement of November 1982 had not been repudiated.</P>
    <P>It is very sad indeed that a situation has arisen between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Government in that today, when Congress were to have met the Taoiseach to discuss the economic <Col N="2640" /> situation, they did not meet him. It constitutes a very serious situation with the economic situation as it is that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions see fit not to meet with the Taoiseach and the Government.  They have lost faith in this Government, they do not believe them any more.  They feel that they have been conned, and they have.</P>
    <P>To return to the matter of the viability of the mill, the Minister for Industry and Energy stated last night that the mill made only upgrade paper and that there was not enough market for that.  I was informed last night by one of the managers of the mill that newsprint was made in the mill some years ago, 45 per cent of which was exported and that it was only when they changed over to the upgrade paper that they stopped making newsprint paper.  Even at that time the mill was viable and, indeed, was viable until about three years ago, when things started to go wrong.  Of course, they needed new machinery, updating and refurbishing.  Of course, they needed some type of subsidy to help them with their paper production.  Apparently two people from outside the country were brought in to investigate the working of the mills, and from that day on it was downhill all the way.  They did not do anything to help the mills.</P>
    <P>We imported £143.1 million worth of paper in the first nine months of this year. Every bit of paper we are now using in this House is imported.  The New Ireland Forum is meeting at the moment and we are getting hundreds of submissions from people in Northern Ireland and around the country.  They amount to over 200 submissions.  I received in my post on several occasions what I thought was a new telephone directory but it was papers I had to read because they were submissions to the New Ireland Forum.  We import all the paper we use throughout the country.  That is a very sad situation when we could have our own papermaking industry and we could employ the 200 Clondalkin workers.</P>
    <P>It is very sad that the two men are on hunger strike.  I would like to add my voice in an appeal to them to come off their hunger strike.  We will not ease off <Col N="2641" /> in our endeavours to solve the situation. I hope those men will give up their hunger strike before they injure their health and be of such great concern to their wives, mothers, fathers and families.  I appeal to them for their own sake and the sake of their relatives and friends to give up the hunger strike.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to believe that the lengthy discussions that took place were only for the purpose of transferring £1.75 million of taxpayers' money to the shareholders of a private company.  If this is the case then Congress were deceived.  There was a blatant abuse of public funds, if it was only to purchase the mill and not to reopen it.  Whoever heard of anybody buying bricks, mortar and machinery just to sit there, deteriorate and not be of any use to anybody?  Must we accept that the Government have perpetrated a confidence trick on Congress and the Clondalkin workers by using taxpayers' money simply to purchase some real estate as a ploy to head off the serious situation that was developing last February? The mills were purchased as a step towards their reopening and the provision of papermaking facilities at Clondalkin to re-employ 200 people who had acquired particular skills over years of employment in those mills.  Surely that was the idea of all the discussions and the talk that went on which ended in the purchase of the mills for £1.75 million of the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have support tonight particularly from the Labour Party and some Members of the Fine Gael Party who believe that the mills are viable and should be reopened.  Let them put their money where their mouths are tonight, come to this side of the House and vote that the Clondalkin Paper Mills be reopened.  I believe we are right tonight in voting for this motion.  The Congress of Trade Unions, the workers and we cannot be wrong.  Are we all wrong?  Is everybody out of step with our Johnny?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the rules of debate we are limited, and in the few minutes allotted to me I wish to say that one encouraging result has come from the debate last night and tonight. <Col N="2642" /> There is on all sides the serious and unanimous appeal to the men on hunger strike to desist from that strike.  One understands the motives behind the men's protest, but it is not a satisfactory form of protest and does not help the situation. The unanimous feeling of the House is that this protest should end and that it should be brought to an end in a dignified way.  A point has been made by the people making this protest.  I am confident that the unanimous appeal of this House will be acted on.</P>
      <P>It is important that the industry which will reopen the Clondalkin Paper Mills is one which is able to trade internationally on a competitive basis.  There would be no basis of self-respect for those working in the mills if they were not convinced as they went in and out of the mills each day that their product could sell proudly and competitively on international markets. They do not wish to be in some kind of hand-me-down enterprise which cannot sell in a competitive way.  It is clear from the nature of paper production that it cannot solely depend on the home market. I know from my experience of involvement in this problem when I discussed it with the employees and unions concerned in the closing months of 1981 and the early months of 1982 that that could be the only basis on which the mills could be reopened.  The proposals then would have provided for approximately 300 of a workforce with wage moderation and so on, but that proposal was not acceptable.  That is water under the bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was convinced then that the kind of enterprise required by the workers of Clondalkin was one in which paper production would be carried on competitively. It would give no adequate remuneration, no decent salary, no decent income if we had less than a competitive industry at Clondalkin.  That was my belief then and I know it is the belief of the present Minister.  In any meetings I have had with him I know that he has been very anxious to get that kind of settlement.  I know that that approach answers the needs of the workers of Clondalkin, an enterprise of which they can be proud, which can sell on international <Col N="2643" /> markets.  I believed then and I believe now that it is important that the interest involved in such an enterprise selling in specialised international markets should be an interest with good experience in that area.  I met the Minister last Monday and I am confident that he has a serious intention, which is shared by most Deputies in the House, to reopen Clondalkin Paper Mills on this competitive basis.</P>
    <P>In the heat of debate Deputy Harney remarked that in the last general election I entered into promises in relation to Clondalkin.  I was attacked in that election because I did not enter into any promises.  I knew too much about this problem to make any false promises.</P>

It remains tonight as it remains always and on the record that we wish to see a competitive enterprise re-open which will provide good jobs for the workers in Clondalkin, and I am confident that the Minister is seriously bending all his endeavours to that objective. I know he has been pursuing this very actively in recent weeks and in the months before that and I know that the basis upon which he is attempting to re-open it will give the kind of jobs and income necessary for the workers in that enterprise.</P>

Following on that decision which was made between the IDA board on the basis of a revised proposal for the paper mills, I wish to say that today the IDA reached an agreement in principle with the Canadian company FMI.  However, this agreement is in a form that does not preclude negotiations with the alternative promoter mentioned last night by the Minister with a view to obtaining the best possible project.

      <P>I should say that it has taken some time for the IDA to reach this agreement, but they were operating on the basis of their proper commercial criteria in the interest of achieving a viable project for the mills.  To return to the concept of viability, the cornerstone of the Government's approach to the paper mills problem was that there was no point in reaching an agreement for the takeover of the mills with a company who would not be able to sustain the existence of the mills in the market place, who would not be able to bring expertise in terms of management to bear on the company and who would not be able to engage in production on a long-term basis.  Such a situation would be futile not only for the Government in terms of the substantial financial commitment involved but also from the point of view of the workers concerned.  Their only long-term hope is in the context of a viable project.  I am happy that has now been achieved and I hope that with the agreement of the workers the mills can be re-opened and put back into production.</P>

      <P>In conclusion I wish to express my thanks to all concerned in this matter.  I exclude from that expression of thanks the Fianna Fáil Party who have merely been disruptive.  I thank the unions for their forebearance during what has been a very difficult time for their members individually and for their families.  I share fully their concern, and that concern is reflected in many other parts of Ireland which may not be as successful in terms of having factories re-opened either by private enterprise or by the IDA.  Clondalkin Paper Mills will be viable and will provide long-term employment for many workers in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be some doubt about what the Minister has said.  I would hope he might clarify the position.  If I listened to Minister Bruton correctly last evening he did make some reference to the firm mentioned here this evening.  It was understood on this side of the House that these discussions had failed.  This matter should be clarified this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2652" /> In the event of what the Minister of State, Deputy E. Collins, has just said being correct there is no reason why our motion should not be accepted unanimously. The motion we tabled and the fact that two men at the Clondalkin Paper Mills have now been 14 days on hunger strike appear to indicate that the Government succumbed to the pressure involved.</P>
    <P>I should like to place on the record of the House the part played by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in relation to this affair.  It was most disheartening to note since last November the manner in which they were treated by this present Government and the failure of the Taoiseach to reply to their letters, to answer letters sent by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to him when things were very difficult for the action committee of Clondalkin Paper Mills.</P>
    <P>In regard to the news we have heard in the House this evening, as a representative of the constituency I want to say I am very pleased to hear it.  I sincerely hope it is very definite, in the interests of the workers, of the people of Clondalkin and of the country as a whole.  As I have said, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions played a very important role in this.  It was indeed a pity that the situation obtaining as at last weekend should have occurred.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Minister spoke about calm, that the Government should not be rushed into anything.  He said it was important that confidence be given at all times.  I want to say that the statements and counter-statements of the last week did little to help the cause of the workers of Clondalkin Paper Mills, the people of this country or the industrial situation as a whole.  We had statements, counter-statements one criticising the other.  It was an unfortunate situation that a senior Minister of a Government or whoever was responsible for the statements made last weekend should have carried on in this way.  As a representative of the constituency I am not one bit afraid to acknowledge what has been mentioned here this evening.  I sincerely hope it is correct.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see Deputy Michael <Col N="2653" /> O'Leary and Deputy Mervyn Taylor here this evening.  Deputy Taylor spoke here this evening.  He read the commitment given by the Fianna Fáil candidates in the general election of February 1982.  I have always paid him the compliment that he makes a very colourful speech.  It was very easy for a man of the calibre of Deputy Taylor to make such a speech in this House this evening.  Unfortunately, though, when the workers of Clondalkin were crying out for support last Friday, when they invited all of the public representatives of the two constituencies to attend, it was noticeable that Deputy Taylor, Deputy Michael O'Leary and Deputy Liam Skelly could not see their way to attend.</P>

      <P>In case Deputy Taylor may feel I am hitting him a bit hard I will remind him of a meeting held in either May or June 1982 in the Community Centre in Clondalkin.  Fianna Fáil were in office at the time.  It is true that a commitment had been given to have the mills re-opened.  The mills were not re-opened at the time.  As a Deputy for the constituency I had to listen to a great deal of criticism on that occasion.  Nevertheless, I had the courage and decency, as had Deputy Mary Harney and Deputy Eileen Lemass, who was the defeated candidate, to honour that invitation and accept whatever treatment was meted out to us.  But last Friday night, when the workers of Clondalkin were looking for support, the Labour Party&mdash;Deputy Mervyn Taylor, Deputy Michael O'Leary&mdash;a former Leader of the Labour Party&mdash;and Deputy Liam Skelly were very noticeable by their absence.</P>

It is sad to think that two men should have to go on hunger strike because of a Government failing to honour their commitment, a Government supported by the Labour Party, supposedly following the ideals of the late James Connolly.  What contribution have they made?  It was only when two men went on hunger strike and <Col N="2656" /> this Private Members' Motion was tabled that any real action was taken.</P>

      <P>He emphasised that Clondalkin would be viable in the home market alone provided the raw materials could be got at the right price.  The home market requires 600,000 tons of fine paper, and the maximum output of the mills is 35,000 tons.  In addition, this country imports 100,000 tonnes of boxboard.</P>
      <P>Mr. Skelly said the IDA had made a grave error in rejecting a viable proposal for Clondalkin from the Canadian F.M.I. Group.  Not only had the IDA proved itself to be incompetent but, due to their indecisiveness on four occasions, it had jeopardised the future of the mill forever.</P>
      <P>The FMI group was at the end of its tether due to the procrastinations and general messing they had gone through over the past 12 months.</P>

      <P>I have paid tribute to the work of the Congress of Trade Unions, and I would like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the action committee which was formed when it was thought that the Clondalkin Paper Mills could be in trouble.  A great deal of criticism has been levelled against these men, some of it by politicians.  These men are to be congratulated for the work they have done and the way they went about it.  It is unfair that men doing a voluntary <Col N="2660" /> job should have been criticised so much. No one can ever accuse them of leaning in any particular direction.  They approached everyone and every group that could help.  It is a tribute to the people of Clondalkin and to the workers in the mill that such a body of men would come together to form an action committee. They suffered a great deal of frustration but at all times they held their heads high and kept their hearts up in the hope that something would happen.  I hope tonight's announcement is correct and that these men will not have to suffer frustration again.</P>

      <P>First of all, I wish to thank the Minister for coming in to answer my question.  This is my fifth attempt to raise the issue and I am glad the Minister had the time.  The purpose of the Adjournment Debate is to receive from the Minister a formal recognition of the appellation of Athlone District Hospital as the siting for the orthopaedic centre, albeit in a temporary sense, for the midland area.  I want to sketch briefly the history of the matter.  In April 1981, the Midland Health Board were invited to set up a sub-committee to come up with recommendations as to the most&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;attractive site for the orthopaedic centre, bearing in mind that it was fully recognised that there was a very great need for such a centre in the midlands area.  They set about their business and took about a year, quite correctly, to fully research their subject, visit the various hospitals in the area and come up with their solution.  Twelve months later they came up with two solutions, a long-term and a short-term.</P>
      <P>This brings me to the point of my mission here tonight.  The most outstanding point which they made was that first in order of priority was a centre for elective orthopaedics.  They stated:</P>
      <P>The Comhairle recommends that a regional centre should be developed in the Midland Health Board area in the long-term and should incorporate the following specialties:</P>
      <P>1.  Elective orthopaedics.</P>
      <P>Having mentioned the most desirable location they went on in their report to say &mdash; and this is the relevant point of my question here tonight:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, should such a solution prove impossible, in the interim pending the building of a regional centre then, in view of the urgency of the <Col N="2664" /> problem, elective orthopaedic surgery will have to be done wherever beds and other facilities are available.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that St. Vincent's District Hospital, Athlone has the beds and many of the facilities.  What we need is a commitment that the Minister is willing to grant such a service to the Athlone area, sited in St. Vincent's Hospital.</P>
    <P>It would be wise to point out tonight that we serve such a very large urban and rural hinterland and yet have not got even what one might call the most basic medical facilities available in our hospital.  We have an excellent building, a very highly trained staff and a great tradition of caring in this hospital.  We are a centre for education, with the siting of the regional college, for industry with the siting of the IDA district regional offices.  We have a district veterinary laboratory in our town and are a major traffic centre for CIE for the linking up of trains and buses leading to all areas, yet one cannot get the most basic casualty services in the Athlone hospital.  This has led to great disquiet among the citizenry of the town and among the industrialists.  The elected body of the town, the Urban District Council, had taken the initiative, of setting up, some two years ago an open committee representative of various groups in the community.  They came up with their final solution to press for the immediate implementation of the orthopaedic centre in Athlone, knowing that from it would come basic casualty services as well and that we in Athlone would get what we justly deserve &mdash; proper hospital facilities.</P>
    <P>I am making my submission tonight, very confident that it is not out of line with what has been suggested as a short-term solution by both the Midland Health Board and, I understand, Comhairle na nOspidéal.  What I am saying is not pie in the sky or something which I have conjured up for the purpose of furthering my cause and my case.  There is backed up medical evidence that there is urgent need for a short-term solution for elective orthopaedic surgery based in the Athlone <Col N="2665" /> area.  The Minister is aware that there is a very long waiting list for such cases in Navan at one end of the area and the Dublin hospitals at the other end.  He is also aware that much of what is required for the orthopaedics is already in Athlone Hospital.  We have an excellent building and we have space.  I understand that the Midland Health Board are about to acquire space in the vicinity of the hospital. This will be important if the Minister gives us the go ahead for this important development.</P>
    <P>I understand that the studies carried out by the sub-committee of the Midland Health Board, when they were doing their year's research into this particular project, were very thorough and deep-searching. They came up with a long-term solution and stated that the siting of such a centre should be in a general hospital. Their over-riding conclusion was that that was a very long-term solution. I am very conscious of our economic situation and I am also very conscious of the economic strains under which the Minister for Health has to operate.  I have noticed in various debates and when he has been answering requests for various hospitals that economy allied with sound medical sense in his basic priority.  I can tell him that in the short term the basic economic commonsense of the solution to the need for orthopaedics in the midland area is to site it in Athlone in the building already available in St. Vincent's Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am speaking tonight as one of the elected Deputies for Longford-Westmeath putting forward a case which has the backing of all the people of the surrounding area.  Perhaps we have not marched and protested but we have gone about our business in a democratic fashion with the elected representatives having a public meeting and getting the goodwill of the people.  I understand the recommendation is with the Minister for some time.  There is a long-term solution which I believe in the present economic climate is not feasible.  I ask the Minister to give the commitment tonight to set up the orthopaedic centre for the midlands in the Athlone area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I never cease to wonder at the capacity of health boards, the more I have to do with them, to straddle the fence on where particular facilities should be sited.  At this rate health boards will suffer acute political hernia if they keep going on like that.  This is another example.  The health board in effect say that while they fully accept the advice of Comhairle na nOspidéal that the existing Tullamore Hospital would be the best location for a regional orthopaedic centre in the long term, nevertheless, they decide that, in the short term, there should be a facility provided in Athlone Hospital.</P>
      <P>My problem is, what is the long term and what is the short term?  I suppose, in the long term, all of us who are politicians are dead.  Meanwhile, it is impossible as the Deputy well knows, to close a particular facility once it is opened even if it is only a temporary centre.  While taking note of the double-barrelled ambivalence of the health board on this issue I am arranging for a detailed examination of the relative merits of siting the unit at Athlone or Tullamore.  It should be in one or the other on a permanent basis. That is the way the money should be committed.  When that decision is reached I hope to allow the planning to proceed as soon as the resources permit.</P>
      <P>I admire the Deputy for her diligence in raising this matter.  She has now made five attempts and the Ceann Comhairle has graciously acceded.  I am only too pleased to reply.  I assure Deputy O'Rourke that I am aware that the present arrangement for the provision of orthopaedic services in the midlands is unsatisfactory.  At the moment, there are other major unsatisfactory things in the midlands, particularly on the maternity side and the paediatric side.  That is why, as a first priority for the midlands, we are going straight ahead with the £8 million building of Mullingar Hospital.  We have got the unanimous agreement of the health board that Longford surgical and medical hospital will close and will be transferred to Mullingar.  Thank God there is unanimity with the health board on that and I do not have to face any problems there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2667" /> I have a problem in providing an effective orthopaedic service.  For example, there is no elective orthopaedic service provided for the people of Laois and Offaly and there is no orthopaedic surgeon employed in the Midland Health Board.  These are issues that I want to come to grips with quite rapidly.  I assure the Deputy I will not be delaying on them.  I have been in constant communication with my Government colleague, the Minister for Defence, on this issue. He has been in very regular contact with me on it, as have been the other public representatives in the area, Deputy Gerry L'Estrange and Senator Lena McAuliffe.  They have all been with me on the question and I am well aware of the intense preoccupation of Deputy O'Rourke, understandably, with Athlone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer long-term planning.  If one commits oneself exclusively to Athlone and spends a great deal of money in setting up the facility, one should not act on the presumption that one is going to remove it.  If one decides on Tullamore, spends a great deal of money and appoints an orthopaedic surgeon one should not act on the presumption that it is purely on a temporary basis either.  One must come down firmly on one venue or the other.</P>
      <P>At the moment I assure the Deputies I have an open mind.  I have to take into account the views of Comhairle na nOspidéal and the health board.  They are an excellent health board with an excellent CEO and staff.  I concede that Athlone is an excellent hospital.  I take all those things into account.  I assure Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Enright that as soon as the examination is completed on the relative merits of siting the unit in Athlone or Tullamore I will make that announcement.  It will be a positive decision.</P>

      <P>My attention was drawn to this report and I was concerned to learn that the large balance remaining to the credit of the local authorities in the Special Border Areas Programme Fund at the end of 1982 was due to the fact that the local authorities had failed to submit claims to draw down their allocations in respect of all the expenditure which they had incurred on their projects in 1982.  This situation gave a distorted picture of the utilisation of the Special Fund allocations and influenced the 1983 allocations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>On the question of the withdrawal of maternity services from counties, the straightforward answer to the Deputy's question is that maternity services were not, in fact, withdrawn from any county in the last ten years.  In this regard I must make the point that health services are not organised on a county basis but on the basis of health board areas.</P>
      <P>With regard to the withdrawal of maternity facilities from general hospitals 15 maternity units have been closed in the last nine years due to the steady decline in the number of births occurring there.  Comparable information in relation to the last 30 years is not readily available but if the information is of particular relevance to the Deputy I can arrange to have it obtained.</P>

      <P>Since taking office, the Government have taken a number of steps to improve the position of local authorities. These included £31.5 million extra towards rates support grants, a new freedom to strike whatever rate increases local authorities considered necessary, and legislation conferring new powers in relation to charges for services.  Local authorities cannot be shielded entirely from the effects of the economic difficulties but I am sure that they are in a much better position as a result of these measures to address those difficulties and to maintain employment and services at better levels than would otherwise have been the case.</P>

      <P>The answers to the Deputy's question are as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  The company in question was registered in Ireland on 18 July 1978 as a private company with limited liability.</P>
      <P>2.  The sale to this company of the former Courtaulds' factory in Loughrea, which earlier had been acquired by the Industrial Development Authority, was closed in June 1981.  The sale had been delayed by legal difficulties over title. The purchase price of the factory was £65,000 which was reduced by £24,050, being the IDA grant towards its purchase.</P>
      <P>3.  The total amount of grants paid to the company by the IDA was £723,258 of which £94,459 has been recovered.</P>
      <P>4.  Details of loans or other assistance given by Fóir Teoranta are a matter for the Minister for Finance, as Fóir Teoranta operates under his aegis.</P>
      <P>5.  The company employed 70 people.</P>
      <P>6.  The company submitted, on a regular basis, audited balance sheets and management accounts to the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2531" /> 7.  The final grant payment was made to the company in December 1981.</P>

      <P>I understand that the employee in this case submitted a claim under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, for investigation by a rights commissioner on 7 June 1983.  He was informed by letter on 17 June 1983 that, as he had only five months' continuous service with his previous employer, he would not be in a position to pursue <Col N="2532" /> a claim under the Unfair Dismissals Act, which applies only to employees who, at the date of their dismissal, have had at least one year's continuous service with their employers.  It was suggested to the employee, however, that his case might be appropriate for investigation by a rights commissioner under the Industrial Relations Act, 1969.  The procedure for referring a case for investigation under that Act was outlined.  To date, no claim under the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, has been received by the rights commissioner service.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question relates to the difference between commitments entered into by the Community in respect of Ireland and the payments received.  On that basis the details are as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  European Regional Development Fund</P>
      <P>Quota Section</P>
      <P>At the end of 1982 IR£65.5m was due to Ireland in respect of commitments entered into by the Commission in 1982 and previous years.</P>
      <P>Payments from the fund are made in line with member states expenditure on the approved projects.  The IR£65.5m outstanding at the end of 1982 will, accordingly, be paid in this and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>Non-quota Section</P>
      <P>At the end of 1982 IR£0.2m was due to Ireland in respect of commitments previously entered into by the Commission. This amount was received in the first quarter of 1983.</P>
      <P>2.  European Social Fund</P>
      <P>The amount of financial assistance committed by the Commission in respect of 1982 operations was IR£85.5 million.  The amount received to date is IR£57.4 million. In addition an amount of IR£6.6 million has been claimed but has not yet been paid.  To allow for processing and certification of final claims the Commission allows up to 18 months after the completion of projects for the submission of claims.  Accordingly it is not possible at this stage to give a total amount of the moneys which will be received in respect of 1982.</P>
      <P>3.  FEOGA Guidance and Maritime Surveillance</P>
      <P>For most guidance measures the level of national exchequer expenditure in 1981 created commitments for repayments from FEOGA to Ireland in 1982.  These repayments were received in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2547" /> In 1981, the Community authorised the introduction of a free pre-movement testing scheme as part of Ireland's accelerated programme for animal disease eradication. Under the scheme the Exchequer was to meet the cost of pre-movement testing and recoup 50 per cent from the Community in the following year.  The scheme was postponed in 1981 as part of the measures announced in the 1981 July budget.  Consequently, no recoupment was received from the EEC in 1982.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Western Development approved by the Community in 1980 envisaged expenditure of approximately IR£13.8m in 1982.  Of that amount IR£8.483m has been received and the outstanding amount has been carried forward for payment in 1983.  Expenditure on the programme for 1982 was less than forecast because of low demand from the farming community; demand has improved somewhat in 1983.</P>
    <P>Payments totalling IR£2,197,248 were requested from the FEOGA Guidance Section in 1982 in respect of arterial drainage projects in the Western Region. A payment of IR£397,248 was received in 1982.  However, as the payment of the balance of IR£1.8m would have exceeded the total funds available under Directive 78/628 EEC for arterial drainage, that amount fell for payment under Council Regulation 2195/81 and was approved for payment by the Commission on 11 November 1983.  It should be received shortly.</P>
    <P>In 1978 the EEC Commission agreed to participate in the financing of Irish fishery protection measures to the extent of IR£31 million approximately (46m ECU) over the years 1977 to 1982 inclusive. The Commission made annual provision for the expected claims from Ireland.  These claims were made each year on the basis of expenditure during the previous year.  Because design work in Verolme Cork Dockyards on a new vessel during 1981 took longer than expected, the claim from Ireland in 1982 was less than hoped for.  A sum of IR£81,391 was received from the EEC that year.  Expenditure in 1982 was substantial and in 1983, following an extension <Col N="2548" /> of the recoupment period, a large claim was submitted which leaves only £1 million approximately to be claimed in 1984.</P>

      <P>The question of the future of Longford County Hospital is a matter in the first instance for the Midland Health Board. In this regard the health board have agreed unanimously that a casualty unit should be provided in Longford to replace the existing hospital facilities. This unit would provide a casualty service, facilities for day hospital procedures and convalescent surgical beds for Longford patients.  The operational details of this proposal have yet to be clarified but I will be giving my agreement in principle to the course recommended by the health board.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, well aware that many promises were made in the past in relation to Longford Hospital and other hospitals.

      <P>The application was dealt with and an allowance book payable from September 1983 was issued on 28 October 1983.  A payable order in respect of arrears due from April 1983 was issued on 9 November 1983.</P>

      <P>It was decided by an appeals officer in August 1983 that the person concerned is not entitled to an old age pension on the ground that his means, consisting of half the weekly value of capital and a holding of land, exceed the statutory limit for entitlement to pension.</P>
      <P>The person concerned made a repeat claim to pension on 4 October 1983 and following further investigations by the social welfare officer into the transfer of the land, the case has been referred back to the appeals officer for review of his decision on the original application.  The person concerned will be notified of the outcome of the review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">

      <P>The person concerned last claimed unemployment assistance from 17 February 1983 to 31 May 1983, after which he ceased to sign as unemployed. His claim was disallowed on the grounds <Col N="2559" /> that by failing to furnish details of the income of the household in which he resided he failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit.  He appealed against this decision assessing his means in excess of the statutory limit and attended an oral hearing of his appeal on 21 July 1983.  The appeals officer upheld the decision disallowing unemployment assistance in his case.</P>
      <P>The yearly value of board and lodging is one of the items which deciding officers and appeals officers are obliged by the law to take into account in the assessment of the means of applicants for unemployment assistance.  Each case is decided on its merits having regard to the standard of living of the household and the circumstances of the applicant.  In assessing this it is necessary to have details of the income of the parents but not of other members of the household, such as brothers and sisters.</P>

He was accordingly in receipt of unemployment assistance at £6.35 weekly, maximum rate payable to him £48.35 less £42, from 17 August 1983 to 27 August 1983 after which he ceased to sign as unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2560" /> He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him but due to mis-filing at his local office delay occurred in dealing with his appeal application. Arrangements have been made to have his case referred to an appeals officer and a decision in the case will be made as early as possible.</P>
