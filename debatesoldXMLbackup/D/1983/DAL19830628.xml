      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>Trade statistics are compiled for various categories of goods but even at the most detailed level each heading generally covers a group of related commodities rather than a single identifiable product. It is therefore not possible to indicate the number of separate products exported to or imported from Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I propose to circulate a statement showing the value of trade in food and live animals with Northern Ireland under each of the relevant Standard International Trade Divisions for each year since 1970.  More detailed information is published in the December issues of <i>Trade Statistics of Ireland,</i> for those years.  Copies of these are available in the Library.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

        <i>(Limerick West)</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will, in view of the Taoiseach's recent statement at the opening of a plant (details supplied) when he said that the sharp fall in real incomes of farmers after 1978 received less sympathy than it deserves from the rest of the community, that the role of agriculture as a major contributor to employment and to exports has been under-valued to an extent that was not previously the case and that were such a catastrophic drop in real incomes and living standards to hit any other group in the community, the reaction would have been explosive, indicate the plans the Government have to increase the real income of the farming community; and, if so, when they will be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>The Programme for Government</i> and the actions already taken on foot of it clearly outline the Government's strategy to increase farm incomes.  This includes a determined attempt to control the domestic factors which exacerbate inflation and thereby contribute to the <Col N="393" /> cost/price squeeze on farmers.  The latest inflation figure, which was announced last week shows that we are succeeding in this, inflation now being down to its lowest level since 1978.</P>
    <P>Controlling inflation necessarily involves controlling public expenditure, including that in the agricultural sector. The effect of this restraint on the financial allocation to ACOT was reflected in the decision of the previous Government to phase out certain advisory services operated by ACOT.  However, the present Government found it possible to lessen the impact of this measure on ACOT, with the result that the number of staff to be laid off is reduced from 140 to 57.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy also includes maximising the benefits from EEC membership, and in this respect the prices agreement secured this year, which is the best in real terms since 1978, clearly represents a major contribution.  But a fundamental factor in bringing about agricultural expansion must be the determination of farmers to increase their incomes through increases in output.  The package of special measures for Ireland agreed in Brussels during the price negotiations is designed to encourage such a response, and it is to the same objective that the Working Group on the Four-Year Plan for Agriculture has applied themselves.  Their report is expected before long and their proposals will then be studied carefully by the Government with a view to further action.</P>

      <P>It is not so much that as the fact that the records are in the office in Tralee.  The entire set of records would probably have to be duplicated.  It raises further problems in that Cork, for example, which came up in the context of the same type of question recently, has so many outlying areas, whether Goleen, Skibbereen, Cahirciveen or Dingle, there could be requests for a whole series of offices in areas which are a considerable distance away from a centre such as Cork serving all Cork county and Tralee serving all Kerry county.  As I stated perviously in reply to Deputy O'Keeffe, I am looking at the matter and if I thought that there was a practical way of solving the problem and saving people long distances as outlined in the Deputy's question, I would gladly take it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Producer milk prices are largely governed by the outcome of the annual EEC negotiations on agricultural prices.  As a result of this year's price negotiations and a further Green £ adjustment this month, the support prices for milk have been increased by 7.5 per cent. The extent to which an individual milk producer benefits from increases in the support prices depends, of course, on a variety of factors, such as the efficiency of his own production and of the processing plant to which he sells, the range of products for which the milk is used and the strength of the market for those products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware <Col N="401" /> that the Irish milk price as a percentage of the European guide price is the lowest in all Europe and has been a source of constant discouragement and irritation to Irish dairy farmers over the years?  Would the Minister please have an in-depth inquiry carried out into the reasons for this constant gap between Irish prices and all other European prices?  Could he also indicate how much of the present price increase he expects the processors and retailers to pass on to farmers in this year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the latter part of the question is up to the individual co-operative society concerned.  It will vary from one to another.  Regarding the earlier part of the question, it is a matter of concern which repeatedly comes up at Question Time.  It can be attributed to many factors, one being that our competitors in Europe have a large liquid milk market at their disposal.  In some cases, as in Britain, this accounts for 50 per cent of the total market.  There is a lack of diversification here as regards utilisation of milk products.  We would have better prices if we had greater diversification.  We have a problem in relation to transport in that it costs us more to get our products on to the market. The butter fat content in Irish milk is lower that it is in milk produced on the Continent.</P>

      <P>A minimum of two visits by farm development staff in connection with land reclamation work is required, the first visit to draw up a scheme of work and a final visit to confirm that the work has been completed to specification.  In complex cases, more than one visit will be required in preparing a scheme.  Further visits may be made at the request of the applicant at appropriate times during the progress of the work to ensure that it is being carried out to specification.

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>

Does he also agree that it is foolish to suggest that the farm development adviser calls to have a look at the site and then calls out when the work is done and that in the meantime the drain would have been dug, the pipes would have been laid, the gravel would have been laid on top of the pipes and the trench back filled, and does he not think that all of those items of drainage should be seen, each in turn, and that if these are not seen the whole scheme of work, which is grant-aided, would be and could be practically useless?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, this is the first time since I have been involved with the Whips that I have had to rise to say that there is no agreement to take No. 4, No. 34 or anything else.  We failed to come to any agreement on the Order of Business for this week.  I am sure that you, Sir, will allow me, because it is rarely that this happens to make the point that at the end of the session there is always a rush to get business through and there is need for co-operation.  This year was no exception.  Over the last four weeks we have been sitting late and we sat on some Fridays.  We tried to get through the business in an orderly way, making sure that items were debated properly. Unfortunately, having agreed to do the business in this fashion and to let a large amount of legislation through with proper debate which we thought was not always adequate but at least fair, having agreed to take the Estimates late at night and on Fridays, and having agreed with the Leader of the House on the Government side to debate the committees and to set them up prior to his departure abroad, we came along with only one Bill left on the Order Paper and what we thought was an agreement with the Whips, the Minister for the Environment and his Minister of State because several weeks ago we alerted the Minister for the Environment to the fact that the Second Reading of the Local Government (planning and Development) Bill, 1983 should not be taken at this time in the session. Our spokesman on the Environment, Deputy Molloy, outlined the reason why. It was done in a very orderly and fair way.  There was no question of it being <Col N="537" /> just rushed through at the end, and we highlighted this at least three weeks back.</P>
      <P>Having obtained agreement to allowing all the business through and the clearing of all the decks with the Government we are left with only one Bill and with an understanding that this week the Fisheries Bill, if it was available, the remaining Estimates and the Adjournment Debate would take place and that since we had no other business we would be completed on Friday.  I feel that that is no fault of the Government Chief Whip.  From discussions with him, although he did not say so, it was quite obvious that he agreed with me on this matter, but at about 6.30 p.m. or 7 p.m. last Thursday night for some reason unknown to me, but I am sure known to somebody, there was a change in that and there was no agreement on anything.  I was told that we would have as much debate as we could on the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill which I thought we were not going to take.  I contacted our spokesman and from the informal talks he had he felt the same as I did.</P>
      <P>Now, having agreed to everything with the Opposition and having acted in an orderly and fair way, the Government have turned around on the Opposition and have been totally unreasonable. When the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill was presented on 31 May we did not object to, because we could not stop, the Minister for the Environment ordering it on 2 June.  The Official Report of 2 June 1983 at column 522, volume 343, states:</P>
      <P>Bill entitled an Act to amend and extend the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1982.</P>
      <P>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring): I move: &ldquo;That the Second Stage to be taken on Wednesday next, 8 June 1983 subject to agreement between the Whips.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no agreement between the Whips.  Therefore, I do not believe that it is in order to take that Bill now.  If we are to do business &mdash; on this side of the <Col N="538" /> House we are accused regularly of not doing business, not agreeing to committees and so on &mdash; on this occasion it should be seen fairly and squarely that there is no disagreement from this side of the House and that we in good faith over a number of weeks, as is always the case, have been in total co-operation with the Government Chief Whip who acted honorably in this matter.  However, the rug was pulled from under him, for some reason unknown to him I would say as much as it is unknown to me, last Thursday night.  Now we cannot take this Bill today.  I do not think it is in order to take it.  There is no agreement to it.  There is an agreement that it be by agreement between the Whips.  Perhaps the House would adjourn while the Whips come to agreement and we can co-operate in a fair and orderly way on the business of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> There is a saying that Whips should never fall out and I do not intend to fall out with the Opposition Chief Whip, but I would like to correct a few points.  The Order for Second Stage was moved here on 2 June to be taken on 8 June subject to agreement between the Whips.  At our following Whips' meeting the Opposition Chief Whip and I agreed between us to take the Planning Bill.  We then met Deputy Molloy who asked that we would not take it that week because he needed more time to study it.  Therefore we knocked it off for that week and reverted to something else.  I was accused of putting in filler business that same week, but it was as a result of that request.  That was business done by the Whips behind the scenes.  On this Bill the Opposition Whip for understandable reasons decided that his party did not want to take it before the summer recess. However, the Government decided that they wished to take this Bill before the summer recess.  I approached the Opposition Chief Whip and advised him of this and tried to get some agreement, but, because of the position of his party, that agreement was not forthcoming.  Therefore, it fell on my shoulders to arrange <Col N="539" /> times and to try to give adequate time to the Opposition to debate Second Stage of this Bill.  I did that by agreeing that it be taken today up to 10.30 tonight, all day tomorrow until 10.30 tomorrow night and all day on Thursday up to 5 p.m. and that Second Stage should concluded at 5 p.m. on Thursday.  I calculate that as 20½ hours of Second Stage debate.  I have also made it known that if the Opposition wished they could use another five hours on Friday which is provisionally put aside for Estimates and that would give 25½ hours Second Stage debate on this Bill. If you check back over the records for a number of years I doubt if you will find that the same amount of time was given for any Bill &mdash; which has only about 17 sections&mdash;with the exception of perhaps the Finance Bill.  In this instance we have tried to give as much time as possible to the Opposition in the form of Second Stage debate.</P>
      <P>I agree that an Opposition have a right to debate a Bill for as long as possible and to tease out difficulties that they may see in that Bill, but without agreement there was no option but for me to try to see to it that the Opposition were given adequate Second Stage debate and 20½ hours plus an option of another five hours, which would be 25½ hours, should be acceptable.  I have discussed this with the Taoiseach.  It may be possible even, if the Opposition so wish, to devote Friday for further Second Stage debate if they feel it is necessary to have that extra time, but that will be at the expense of the Estimates which, of course, will have to be agreed with the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer to agree with the Opposition Whip on the business to be put through the House.  I should like to assure the Opposition Whip, and the Leader of the Opposition, that I will be only too pleased if I can co-operate in any way this week, or next week, to try to conclude business in a satisfactory way so that every Member, including The Workers' Party and the Independents, whom I forgot to mention, anxious to make a contribution, is given an opportunity.  I should like to assure the Opposition Whip that my door will always be open <Col N="540" /> for this week if he wishes that we should come to an agreement as to how this business should be concluded.</P>

I should like to correct the Government Chief Whip and tell him that if he looked at the record he would find that the debate on the two previous planning Bills, which were major pieces of legislation like this one and were introduced in 1973 and 1976, were not a matter of 26 hours.  I believe it was longer than 26 weeks and for that reason he will discover that our request is not unusual.  Of course, it was not just a question of the Bill dealing with planning.  Last week at the Whips' meeting we were told that there would be other Bills &mdash; I am not sure what they are, there may be a turf Bill and a fisheries Bill &mdash; but we have not seen them.  It is impossible for an Opposition Whip, or an Opposition to plan for legislation we have not seen.

It has been said that the Chair is too rigid and it is obvious that if the Chair gives an inch it develops to a longer distance and into a long, disorderly debate.  Strictly speaking, any debate on the Order of Business is not in order for the simple reason that a debate can take place only on a resolution or on a Bill.  Since neither of those is before the House a debate is out of order.  However, I thought it proper and reasonable to allow the Fianna Fáil Whip to make his point and make it properly.  I did so.  I thought it necessary to allow the Minister of State to reply and I did that also. Deputy Ahern asked that he should be allowed reply and I even went that far. Consistent with my duties in the Chair I cannot be asked to go any further and I should not be asked.  I will not go any further.

You ruled on that occasion, which is only about two weeks ago, that a Minister had to give the date.  The Minister looked around and he was quite surprised that he had to give a date.  He did not know what date to give.  Usually the Whips' office give that going into the House.  You ruled that a date had to be given.  Surely it is not superfluous or you would not have ruled that a Minister had to give a date.  He had to get guidance on that occasion about the date.  Now you are changing.  The Standing Orders are not the only things which rule the House.  The rulings of previous chairmen also rule.

      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1983, <Col N="551" /> provides for the reconstitution of An Bord Pleanála and for the amendment of the existing law in relation to planning appeal procedures.  There are already three Acts on the Statute Book which together form the existing law in relation to land use planning.  The Principal Act &mdash; the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963&mdash;has now been in operation for nearly 20 years and the general physical planning system which it established has in large measure stood the test of time.  The main purpose of the second Act &mdash; the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976 &mdash; was to provide for the setting up of An Bord Pleanála to decide planning appeals; it also provided for the more effective enforcement of planning control and made various amendments to the Principal Act.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1982, was primarily a measure to deal with the duration of planning permissions and to remove doubts which had arisen as a result of a Supreme Court decision concerning the validity of certain permissions granted on appeal.  It also provided for the introduction of fees for planning applications and appeals and for increased penalties under the planning code.</P>

However <Col N="552" /> it quickly became apparent that the problem of delays in determining planning appeals and the growing backlog of appeals required urgent consideration.  In addition to this, it became evident that there was increasing public concern about the method of appointment to An Bord Pleanála.  Arising from these considerations, I had no option but to decide that the review of planning law should focus initially on possible improvements in the method of appointment of the members of the board and on appeals law generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning appeals system has often been a contentious one. Originally, under the 1963 Act appeals were made to the Minister for Local Government.  For various reason, not least the question of possible political bias, this arrangement soon came to be <Col N="553" /> regarded as an unsatisfactory one and, as early as 1967, a Private Members' Bill was introduced to set up an independent body to deal with appeals.  Other Bills followed but it was not until the enactment of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976 in July of that year that provision was made to remove the planning appeals process from the political arena by transferring the responsibility for their determination from the Minister to An Bord Pleanála. The board was established on 1 January 1977, and took over from the Minister the function of deciding appeals in March of that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its early years the new board seemed to have been reasonably successful in establishing for themselves in the public mind the kind of independent image which is so necessary if decisions of the board are to be accepted.  Some decisions naturally gave rise to controversy but this was only to be expected, given the subjective nature of some planning issues and the fact that, almost by definition, every decision cannot be a favourable one from the point of view of every party to the appeal.  However, it can now be seen, with hindsight, that the 1976 Act did not go far enough to achieve its objective; in particular, it left the appointment of the ordinary members solely in the hands of the Minister and made no provision for a selection or nomination system which would provide assurance that appointments were being made from among persons considered to be suitable by those best qualified to judge.  This is, in principle, an unsatisfactory situation and the way in which the power has in practice been used in recent times has led to a widespread diminution in public confidence in the appeals system.  Without implying any reflection on the persons concerned, I have to say that the circumstances surrounding some of the appointments, and especially their timing, could have no other effect than seriously to detract from the public perception of the board as an independent and unbiased tribunal.  Matters have not been helped by the fact that as more members were appointed to the board, the number of decisions made by the board decreased, <Col N="554" /> the backlog of appeals increased and the delays involved in the release of employment-generating projects lengthened.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are intended to restore public confidence in the system and to make the board's operation more efficient.  In short, the objective is to provide for a system which will ensure that justice is in future seen to be done in the making of appointments to the board and that these can never again be alleged to be based on political considerations.  It is essential that the proposed new system should be in operation at the earliest possible date and it is in consequence of this that provision is made for the termination of the appointments of the existing board as soon as new appointments are made under sections 5 and 7 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides that the new board will consist of a chairman and five other members.  I am satisfied that this number should be perfectly adequate to deal with the likely volume of appeals. I should like to draw attention to the fact that from 1977 to mid-1981 the board consisted of six members, including the chairman, and during that period made good progress in dealing with the arrears as well as keeping pace with the intake. In 1981 and 1982, when there were between eight and ten members, the output of decisions actually declined.  It may also be well to note that prior to 1977 all appeals were decided directly by the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary, neither of whom could afford to devote more than a fraction of his time to this function.</P>
    <P>The 1976 Act provided that the chairman of the board must be a High Court judge or former judge but this arrangement is not being continued.  Governments seem to have found difficulty in getting a serving judge to take the position and this is understandable for several reasons.  As a result, the last two Governments found it necessary to appoint, or to seek to appoint, a barrister as a High Court judge with a view to his immediate appointment as chairman.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I see little merit in such a procedure. Secondly, as a matter of principle I would not be in favour of appointing a retired judge especially as the normal retirement age of High Court judges is 72.  I think it is preferable that the chairman of the board and the ordinary members, in common with the overwhelming majority of public officials, should retire at age 65, and sections 5 and 7 provide accordingly. Thirdly, while I accept that direction in law is needed by the board, I do not agree that the appointment of a judge as chairman is the best way, or the only way, of making legal advice available and I believe that it should be open to the Government to consider persons with other relevant qualifications and experience for appointment as chairman. Section 5 of the Bill therefore provides that the chairman will be appointed by the Government for a seven-year term of office from among persons selected by a special committee consisting of the President of the High Court, the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, the Chief Engineering Adviser of the Department, the Chairman of the Council of An Taisce, the President of the Construction Industry Federation and the President of the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This method of selection is similar to that which applies in relation to the appointment of the Director of Public Prosecutions, under the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974.  I am confident that it will secure public acceptance of the integrity of the appeals system, without excluding anyone from consideration for <Col N="556" /> the specialised post of chairman by reason only of lack of a particular qualification. Under section 6, the chairman will have a special responsibility for the overall efficiency of the board and for the allocation of its business among the members.</P>
    <P>I turn next to the five ordinary members of the board.  Section 7 of the Bill provides that these will be appointed by the Minister for the Environment for a term of office not exceeding five years. Four of them will be appointed from among persons selected by groups of organisations representing professional, environmental, development and community interests, one member being appointed from the nominees of each group.  The fifth ordinary member will be an established civil servant drawn from the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The nominating organisations will be decided when the Bill has been enacted. However, I can assure the House that the organisations which I will select will be those which are genuinely representative of the interests concerned.  I should also point out that the Bill requires the organisations to be prescribed by regulations which must be laid before each House and can be annulled by resolution of either House.  I am satisfied that a board selected on the basis of these proposals will secure wide public acceptance, remove from the planning appeals system any allegations of political influence and produce a well-balanced board with the necessary qualities and capacity to deal with planning appeals efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that the chairman and ordinary members of the board will be required to be appointed in a wholetime capacity and that they will be precluded during their terms of office from holding any other office or employment in respect of which emoluments are payable.  Like other public sector officials, they will be expected to work a full five-day week.</P>
    <P>While it will be the primary function of the chairman and other board members to deal with the individual planning appeals coming before them, it is also essential that they concern themselves <Col N="557" /> with the overall efficiency of the board and that they see to it that all possible steps are taken to avoid delays and speed up the processing of appeals.  Section 4 of the Bill provides, therefore, that the new board will have a duty to ensure that appeals are disposed of as quickly as possible and, with this in view, to carry out periodic reviews of the systems and procedures being operated by it.  The section also enables the Minister for the Environment to direct that reviews of organisational matters or of systems and procedures be carried out from time to time and to give appropriate directives in relation to such matters after consultation with the board.  This provision is designed to enable the Minister to take action to improve efficiency, where he considers this to be necessary, but it does not, of course, entitle him to interfere with the determination of particular cases.  In fact, section 23 specifically precludes the Minister from intervening in any way in relation to any particular case with which the board are concerned.  As a further safeguard, section 14 of the Bill prohibits communications with the chairman or an ordinary members of the board which are designed to influence improperly his consideration of an appeal or other matter with which the board are concerned or the board's decision on any such matter.</P>
    <P>As soon as possible after this Bill is enacted, I intend to make arrangements for the selection and appointment of the new chairman and ordinary members.  In the meantime the existing board will continue to hold office.  I should mention that section 9 makes provision for the making of schemes for the granting of gratuities to persons who will cease to hold office on the coming into operation of the new system.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 to 20 provide for a number of changes in appeals law to enable the board to dispose of certain categories of appeals more expenditiously.</P>
    <P>Section 15 gives the board an absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing of any reference or appeal.  Under section 16 of the 1976 Act, the board have similar discretion but where an application to the <Col N="558" /> board to hold an oral hearing is refused, a person has a right under that section to apply to the Minister for a direction which would overrule the decision of the board in the particular case.  This arrangement is not being continued for a number of reasons.  In the first instance, it seems to me to be wrong in principle that a subsidiary procedural decision by the board should be subject to ministerial review when far more substantial decisions are not.  In addition to this, the present arrangements can contribute significantly to the delay in dealing with many appeals.  Moreover, experience has shown that the board have not abused the power to refuse an oral hearing and that they have not applied excessively harsh standards: under successive Ministers, only a relatively small proportion of all cases in which oral hearing applications were refused resulted in directions by the Minister to the board to hold an oral hearing.  For all of these reasons, the Bill proposes to terminate the involvement of the Minister for the Environment in considering whether there should be an oral hearing in any particular case.  Instead section 15 allows the Minister to make regulations requiring the board to hold oral hearings in cases of particular classes or descriptions. It seems to me that this system should enable reasonable safeguards to be provided for parties to an appeal without the undesirable consequences which can follow from the involvement of the Minister, even in a limited way, in relation to particular cases.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation, all appeals to the board must be dealt with by considering the original planning application as if it were made to the board in the first instance.  This provision for full rehearing has worked quite well in practice and it is proposed that it should continue to apply to the majority of cases.  However, cases can arise in in which a full rehearing is clearly unnecessary and, in such cases, the requirements of existing law can add considerably to the time taken by the board to process an appeal.  For this reason, provision is made in a number of sections of the Bill enabling the board in <Col N="559" /> certain circumstances to determine appeals otherwise than by full rehearing.</P>
    <P>Section 16 gives the board a discretionary power to dismiss an appeal where, having considered the grounds of appeal, they are of opinion that the appeal is vexatious, frivolous or without substance or foundation.  The board will also be empowered to dismiss an appeal under that section if they are satisfied, having regard to the nature of the appeal and taking account of any existing permission or approval which is relevant, that the appeal should not be further considered by them.  There are a wide variety of circumstances in which this latter provision might be appropriate.  For example, use of the new power might be considered where an appeal is made against a decision to grant approval and the ground of appeal relate solely to matters of principle which cannot legally be taken into account at approval stage.  The new power could also be suitable for use in cases where the planning application relates solely to modifications of a development which has already been permitted and where the grounds of appeal raise matters of principle which have already been raised and taken into account in the granting of the existing permission.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with grounds of appeal.  Delay in the submission of grounds can add considerably to the administrative work involved in the processing of appeals, absorb staff time which could be used more productively in dealing with fully-documented cases and thereby delay the determination of appeals.  Appellants, whether developers or third parties, can make appeals under existing law without initially stating their grounds of appeal and this practice has been held by the courts to be in order.  It is necessary, however, to provide the board with suitable powers for use in situations where there is continuing delay in submitting the grounds of appeal and section 17 does this.</P>
    <P>The section enables the board to serve a formal notice requiring the submission of grounds and, in default of compliance, to declare that the relevant appeals shall be regarded as having been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> Under existing law, the board are obliged to determine the original planning application afresh even in cases where no grounds whatever are submitted.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is somewhat similar to section 17 in that it enables the board to deal in a summary manner with another class of case in which a party to an appeal does not co-operate fully with the board.  The section will allow the board to dismiss or otherwise determine an appeal where a person fails to submit to the board information which they consider to be essential for the proper determination of the appeal and which the person has been requested to supply.  This section is designed, in part, to replace section 18 of the 1976 Act which deals with cases where unnecessary delays are created by a party to an appeal.  However, the provision in the 1976 Act has not been very effective because it did not release the board from the obligation to determine the original planning application afresh, even in a case where a third party or a person whose application for permission had been refused at local level was not co-operating with the board in submitting essential documents or other information.</P>
    <P>Section 19 simplifies the procedure for consideration by the board of appeals against conditions attached to permissions. While the board will continue to deal with most appeals <i>de novo,</i> the provisions of the section will give them a discretionary power to deal only with a condition against which an appeal is made, provided the board are satisfied, having regard to the nature of the condition concerned, that the determination by them of the entire application would not be warranted.  This new provision should enable a significant proportion of this category of appeals to be dealt with in a far more expeditious manner than can be achieved under existing law.</P>
    <P>So as to discourage frivolous or vexatious appeals or those which are otherwise without substance or foundation, existing law empowers the board to require a party to an appeal to pay to the board or to another party, as compensation for appeal expenses, a sum of up to £50 or, after consultation with the Minister, <Col N="561" /> a higher sum.  Section 21 proposes to increase to £200 the sum which can be directed to be paid by the board without prior consultation with the Minister.  This increase takes account of inflation over the period since the existing provision was decided upon.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are largely of a technical nature and the House will have an opportunity of examining them in depth on Committee Stage. Before I conclude, however, I should like to refer briefly to the current position regarding the backlog of appeals before the board.  At the end of April, the number of appeals on hands was almost 3,600 cases.  This build-up of arrears had led to long delays in the processing of particular cases and the consequent hold-up of many worthwhile development projects at a time when the building industry is particularly hard hit.  Side by side with the preparation of the new legislation, I have, therefore, arranged a programme of action aimed at reducing the arrears. Since the beginning of this year, approval has been conveyed to the board to employ four additional senior planning inspectors and additional professional staff are being made available on a temporary basis by my own Department. Additional administrative staff have been made available by my Department in recent times to deal with bottlenecks in the flow of cases to the board.  My Department have also carried out a study aimed at streamlining administrative systems and procedures within the board's organisation.  I hope that these various actions, coupled with the proposed changes in appeals law, will ensure that, in a relatively short time, significant improvements will be made in the time taken to process appeals and reduce considerably the current backlog.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann refuses a Second Reading to the Local Government (Planning <Col N="562" /> and Development) Bill, 1983, on the grounds that:</P>
    <P>(i) It will seriously undermine the existing procedures for physical planning in this country.</P>
    <P>(ii) It will have serious repercussions on the standing prestige and effectiveness of Government Boards and State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>(iii) It pre-empts the deliberations of the Joint Committee on Building Land which under its Orders of Reference is required <i>inter alia</i> to examine the operations of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1982 which are to be construed as one with the enactment of the Bill and thereby undermines the Committee system of the Houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My party have made their protest at the Government's action in proceding with this Bill in the way they have done and we have expressed our dissatisfaction with the ruling of the Chair in interpreting orders of the House.  When the Government Chief Whip rose to make his explanation he referred to me.  At the outset I want to clarify my role in the matter for the record.  I was not involved in any formal talks with the Government Whips, that is a matter for the Chief Whip of my party.  I was approached very informally in the self-service restaurant about when the Planning and Development Bill might be taken.  I recall very distinctly having made it clear that at that stage neither the Front Bench of my party nor the Environment Committee of the Fianna Fáil Party had had an opportunity to even discuss the contents of that Bill. I also pointed out that on the previous occassion when Planning and Development were discussed in this House the debate was lengthy, many Deputies wished to contribute to the debate and the Committee Stage took about 11 days. I thought it was most inopportune that the Bill should be rushed.</P>
    <P>I want to come to the basic objection which our party have to this Bill.  We feel it would seriously undermine the existing procedure for physical planning.  It is <Col N="563" /> clear that there is an organised campaign to depoliticise the whole planning process. This campaign has been undertaken by vested interest groups in the community. They are not representative of any large section of the community but they are quite vociferous.</P>
    <P>The existing Planning Appeals Board were appointed under the terms of the 1976 Act which was introduced by a Coalition Government and a Labour Party Minister, Mr. James Tully.  At that time the Fianna Fáil Party accepted the main provisions in that Bill to transfer the decisions on individual planning cases to an appeals board and disagreed with the recommendations of that Government that the appointment of the members of that board should be carried out by the Government and the Minister of the day.  The process of depoliticising, which the Government are facilitating now, is highly impractical and cannot ever succed unless the Government intend to completely scrap the 1963 Planning and Development Act on which all planning and development are based.  In that Act it is laid down quite clearly that planning decisions must be based on the county development plans adopted in each planning authority area &mdash; in other words, each local authority area &mdash; and that only the elected members of local authorities have power to adopt those plans.</P>
    <P>It seems that the campaign which is under way seeks eventually to remove the participation of elected representatives from participating in the planning process, a highly improbable and impractical proposition which would have chaotic consequences for the development of this nation.  In regard to the appointment of State boards, the Government's role must be paramount and the elected Government must make those decisions.  In the proposals contained in this Bill an attempt is being made to transfer the role and authority of the Government to vested interest groups.  There are some who believe that the terms of the Bill are unconstitutional. I will come to that later.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I would like to make my <Col N="564" /> position clear on another important point.  Shortly after this Dáil met and the Government were appointed, one of their first actions was to reconstitute the Committee on Building Land.  As spokesman for the Fianna Fáil Party on environmental matters, I was appointed chairman by the members of that committee. The terms of reference of that committee state quite clearly that it shall be the responsibility of the committee, of which I am acting as chairman and for which I must speak as spokesman in this House, to consider the operation of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963-82.  The work of that committee is now being pre-empted if the Government proceed with the introduction of a planning Bill which changes in a very fundamental way the whole structure of the planning and development system which has been in operation here.</P>
    <P>The committee have been charged to consider the proposals of the Kenny Report.  That report on building land prices says that the actions of public authorities are a further factor which may influence the trend in land prices and that planning legislation tends initially to add to the upward pressure on land prices. The committee, of which I am chairman have been charged with considering all matters which affect the price of building land here, and in particular to consider in a detailed way the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963-82.  The terms of reference of that committee do not contain any reference to the 1983 Bill.  Obviously their terms of reference will have to be altered.</P>
    <P>It is very wrong that the Government and the Minister should proceed with major fundamental changes in our planning laws while at the same time a committee of this House have been appointed to examine and make recommendations on them.  In proceeding with this Bill I consider the Minister and the Government are offering a serious slight to the members of that committee.  In recent weeks the House debated whether to establish numerous other committees to consider matters of vital concern to the community.  Are we to take it from the Government's action today that the <Col N="565" /> deliberations of those committees will count for nought in the minds of the Government?  The Government are offering a lot of lip service in encouraging the establishment of these committees and stating that their deliberations will be seriously considered and will influence future changes in legislation.  Already this weekend we heard the Tánaiste, the Leader of the Labour Party, announcing his position without waiting for the report from the Committee on Family Law Reform and other related matters to meet, deliberate and report to the House. What is the point in all these arguments, debates and suggestions and all the time which has obviously been wasted debating the merits of establishing committees of this House when it can be seen quite clearly that the Government will ignore these committees and will proceed to impose their own will, irrespective of recommendations emanating from these joint committees?</P>
    <P>I submit that the Government are making a farce of establishing joint committees. That is a basic principle which we defend here today.  As chairman of one of those committees I am in a very difficult position.  I appeal to the Minister to have second thoughts about proceeding with this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no need for this Bill at this time.  It makes only a minor contribution in some of the minor sections towards speeding up the process of decision-making on planning appeals. The decision to alter the membership of the planning board has nothing whatever to do with the Minister for the Environment's stated intention of speeding up decision-making or planning appeals &mdash; that there was a backlog and that the creation of a new board would shorten the time in deciding planning appeals.</P>
    <P>I had prepared a speech in which I wished to refute all those arguments on Second Stage.  It might be appropriate for me to deliver that speech now to the House.  It is as relevant on this motion as on Second Stage of the Bill.  Before I refer in greater detail to what the Minister and the Government are trying to do in this Bill, may I also revert to my role as chairman of the Committee on Building <Col N="566" /> Land and refer the Minister again to the Kenny Report which our committee have been set up to report on.  On page 36 of the Committee's report it is stated:</P>
    <P>Section 26 subsection (1) of the Planning Act, 1963 provides that where application is made to a planning authority for permission for the development of lands, they may grant it subject to or without conditions or they may refuse it.</P>
    <P>Further on, it is stated:</P>
    <P>... the planning authority shall be restricted to considering the proper planning and development of the area of the authority...regard being had to the provisions of the development plan...If this restriction on the powers of a planning authority to refuse applications for planning permission continued to apply to lands in a designated area, one of the main aims of the scheme would be defeated.</P>
    <P>There is the kernel of the matter which the Committee on Building Land have been asked to consider and on which they have been asked to report back to this House.  I submit that it is absolutely useless for that committee now to continue their deliberations.  The Minister has provided in section 16 (2) of the Planning and Development Bill, 1983, the continuation of that section.  That will inhibit the consideration of our committee on whether those restrictions should apply when they are deciding whether a local authority should have power to designate land or not, as proposed in the Kenny Report.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister is pre-empting everything which we on that committee have been asked to consider.  For my part, I shall have to consider very seriously whether I should continue to act on that committee.  We should not be asked to participate in a charade, as we seemingly are being asked to do.  The Bill before the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The amendment has been moved by Deputy Molloy and Second Stage has already been read out by the Minister and there is now a discussion on the amendment in conjunction with Second Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>As regards part 3 of the amendment, where I claim that the action of the Government pre-empts the work of the Joint Committee on Building Land, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that on 12 May the Joint Committee wrote to the Secretary of the Department of the Environment as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am directed by the Chairman of the <Col N="571" /> Joint Committee to inform you that at the meeting of the Joint Committee on 27 April 1983 notice was served by members that the following matters should be considered.</P>
    <P>Among the matters listed was An Bord Pleanála.  I cannot understand how the Minister and the Government expect this committee to continue their deliberations into the operation of the Planning Acts if, during the course of their work, the Government proceed to change the basic law which the committee was set up to examine and report on.  That is making a farce of the joint committee system.  It places me in a very invidious position, as I have been appointed chairman.</P>
    <P>The reply to that letter stated that appropriate papers on these matters were being prepared in the Department and would be submitted to the committee in due course.  I do not see the point when we proceed to deal with a Bill which will change the planning laws.  It changes in a fundamental way the structure of the board.</P>
    <P>It will have serious repercussions on the standing, prestige and effectiveness of the boards of State-sponsored bodies. There are numerous bodies to which Governments have appointed people as board members for a fixed time &mdash; three, five or seven years.  In all cases provision is made where these members can be removed from office for stated misdemeanours. No such accusation has been made against any members of this board. They are all being fired from their positions and it is clear that it is only a vindictive political act on behalf of the Government because the board members were appointed by the previous Government. This will have serious repercussions as regards people who will serve on such boards in the years ahead.  The action of the Government will be pointed to time and time again.</P>
    <P>The Bill abolishes the existing membership and method of appointment of An Bord Pleanála and proposes minor improvements in procedures to try to speed up decisions on planning appeals. No valid arguments were advanced by <Col N="572" /> the Minister to justify abolishing the existing board and it is well recognised that the only way decisions on planning appeals can be speeded up is by the appointment of additional planning inspectors and administrative staff.  It is clear that there is no need for the Bill and that the Dáil is being forced to discuss something which is unnecessary and completely irrelevant to the urgent needs of the nation at this time.</P>

When one considers the extent of organised crime, which is at crisis level, had the Government come forward with proposals for urgent debate which might seek to deal in an effective way with the level of crime they could certainly justify using the jackboot tactics they are using &mdash; the guillotine method of pushing legislation through.  We are not dealing with any proposals to bring about an improvement in that area.  Recently in the courts we saw the godfather of illegal drug selling walking out in the middle of his case.</P>

      <P>If the country saw the Government taking urgent action to deal with the drugs crisis or if Parliament was <Col N="573" /> asked to deal urgently with necessary legislation to clamp down on the tragic expansion of the use of drugs, then the Dáil would welcome such a move because such urgent action is called for.  If we had moves to deal with the crisis in unemployment &mdash; there are 200,000 people registered as unemployed &mdash; that would be a different matter.  Unemployment is the real crisis and tragedy in Ireland in 1983; it is not the membership of An Bord Pleanála.  The Government are making a farce out of Parliament in seeking to avail of valuable time to bring in unnecessary and irrelevant legislation which will have far-reaching repercussions and bring about a fundamental reappraisal of the planning system.  If the Government rushed in with legislation to deal with the PAYE taxpayers' revolt against crippling taxation the House might welcome it and willingly participate in such an urgent discussion.</P>

      <P>The Government's action in informing the Opposition that they were intent on introducing a guillotine or time motion to ensure the quick passage of this Bill would normally indicate that the Government believed there was great urgency about the passage of the legislation. There is no evidence why the Government have come to that conclusion, nor is there evidence of any great urgency attaching to the provisions of the Bill.  It is quite extraordinary that this Parliament which has not yet completed a 12-month term is faced for the first time with a measure, regarded by the Government as urgent, which in reality has no urgency.  The introduction of the Bill is vindictive political action by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government had sought to bring forward proposals to aid the ailing construction <Col N="574" /> industry we would have welcomed it.  We have used Opposition time to bring the crisis in the building industry to the notice of the Government.  We have made suggestions as to how the Government might bring about an improvement in the industry by increasing investment and creating thereby a growth in employment, but the Government ignored the pleadings and suggestions we made during those debates. Nothing has emerged to deal with the crisis which is affecting the lives of thousands of people, many of whom returned from abroad to live and work here and helped to build the facilities now enjoyed by our population.  Many craftsmen who have trained in our training centres and developed their skills see that the Government have no time for them.  We would have welcomed Government proposals to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Similarly we would have welcomed proposals to deal with the threat hanging over State and semi-State companies and the possible loss of thousands of jobs.  A terrible tragedy will descend on part of my county if the Government proceed with the proposed closure of the sugar factory in Tuam.  We would have welcomed debate on this urgent question initiated by the Government but it was left to the Opposition to bring the issue into Parliament.</P>
    <P>The tourist trade is also facing crisis. We are now well into the 1983 tourist season and there is evidence that the industry is in the doldrums.  The fine weather of recent days has been enjoyed mainly by ourselves since tourists are scarce.  We would have welcomed urgent measures to deal with the expansion and development of tourism.</P>
    <P>Off the west coast Spanish fleets are invading our waters and moving in to our fishing grounds and the Government dilly-dally with legislation to deal with the problem.  We are prepared to sit here all night and pass any reasonable legislation which the Government bring forward to deal with the invasion by Spanish fleets off the west coast and the moves to re-register Spanish vessels under the Irish flag in an underhand attempt to gain entry to our fishing grounds.  This is an <Col N="575" /> urgent problem which would warrant a guillotine motion if the Opposition were acting unreasonably and refusing to cooperate. We have not seen any such legislation and we are being asked to deal with something which is not urgent and is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Elderly citizens are facing a crisis week after week in the courts where rents are being increased by exorbitant amounts which in many cases they are unable to pay.  Many of them are suffering deep anxiety and their lives may be shortened as a result.  The Government have not come forward with the proposals to set up a rents tribunal.  We have heard promises but we have seen no action.  Week after week rents are being increased by several hundred per cent and elderly people are absolutely dismayed at the level of increases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputies in Fine Gael have not been consulted as to whether this Bill should be brought forward in this fashion.  Perhaps they have not been consulted as to whether their votes would be available for a guillotine motion.  Perhaps they were as surprised as we when our Whip notified us at a very late date, at the end of the week, that the Government intended taking the very unusual, the exceptional step, of putting down a guillotine motion to force through a Bill about which there is no urgency whatsoever.  This is a vindictive act by the Government against people who have given excellent service to the nation.  I have a lot to say and if Deputies sit here for a few more hours they will hear a lot more.  I am complaining that the Government are seeking to force this Bill through.</P>
      <P>This Bill is unnecessary and even at this late stage we on this side appeal to the Government to withdraw this Bill and let us get on with other urgent matters affecting the people of the nation.  A crisis exists and there is need to bring in legislation to remedy it.  Legislation is needed in the areas of crime, drug abuse, rent tribunals and the crisis in the construction industry.  I could go on and on and point out real problems affecting our people. We do not see legislation to remedy these problems.  What do we see?  There does not seem to be any need for this legislation and the Government are wasting the time of the House.  We oppose this legislation because there is a very basic principle involved.  People who are appointed by the Government of the day to act on State boards hold legitimate appointments and it is the tradition of the country that they be allowed to complete the term of their appointments.  However, if you read section 10 of this Bill you will see that a new principle is being introduced into Irish legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of those members holding legitimate <Col N="579" /> appointments from the Government of the day are being let go.  Previous members of this board were appointed by Coalition Governments.  The board was established by a Coalition Government and by a Labour Minister.  It is now being dismantled by a Labour Minister in another Coalition Government which makes it all the more confusing as to why it is necessary.  If there had been a mix of appointments on the board, this Bill would never see the light of day.  Because of the coincidence that members of An Bord Pleanála were appointed by the previous Government, this Government have taken this extraordinary step.  They think they will get away with it without its being exposed.  That will not happen. We will avail of this debate to expose what the Government are doing.  That is why we are opposing it.</P>
    <P>If the Government proceed to establish the principle in this Bill, any person who accepts any appointment from this Government to any State board need not feel secure in his directorship or membership of that board if there is a change of Government.  If the Government insist on putting this into the law of the land, we will accept from now on that all those memberships can be changed with a change of Government.  This will be a fundamental change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 10 of this Bill all of that is to change.  I hope this sinks into the minds and understanding of Fine Gael Deputies.  I do not believe they have given full thought to what is going on here.  There is something a lot more subtle going on.  This is not just removing people because they were appointed by Fianna Fáil.  It is also removing people because they were appointed by politicians, by Governments and by Ministers. That power is also being shifted away from this House to outside vested interest groups.</P>
      <P>This is another principle which we think is wrong.  People will rue the day they allowed that to happen.  Members of this House will regret the day they allowed that principle to be introduced in appointments to boards.  When Deputies opposite reflect on the real intention behind this, I am sure they too will see that the stand we are taking is the right one for Parliament and for democracy, and that it is one they should support.  I hope Deputy Skelly can understand the relevance of my reference to the delay in bringing forward the Rent Tribunal Bill.</P>
      <P>Never has the future of our country seemed to bleak.  The thousands of young people just completing their school examinations, and those in the third level institutions who are coming out into the market place and seeking employment in their home towns, their home counties, or in their own country, have to face the real tragedy and the really bleak prospect that is Ireland today.  These are the problems the Government should be facing and tackling.  They cannot claim that this Bill will make any contribution towards dealing with the crises which exist in the various areas to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's response at this time of great crisis is to force Dáil Éireann to spend two weeks, I understand, discussing an unnecessary and irrelevant Planning Bill.  This Bill creates a precedent in Irish politics.  This is the <Col N="581" /> first time that all the members of a State board are being fired without warning just because they were appointed by the previous Government.  This naked vindictive act will have repercussions throughout the whole State and semi-State sector.  It will affect in a fundamental way future participation on State boards by people from the private sector. Many people will be reluctant to act on these boards in the future now that it is being established that members may be dismissed in this arbitrary way following a change of Government.</P>
    <P>This Bill casts a serious reflection on the Irish parliamentary system in implying that the Government elected by the people are not competent or trustworthy enough to appoint a chairman and members of an autonomous national planning appeals board.  The central role of Parliament in the life of the nation is being challenged in this Bill.  This further reduction in the role of the democratically elected Government and individual Ministers is evidence of the ever-increasing bureaucratic control which is steadily getting a grip on every area of major decision making.  The bureaucratic machine is slow.  It is cumbersome and very expensive.  It is stifling enterprise, initiative and creative thinking.  I believe this country needs to be freed from over control by rigid bureaucracy.  Any Bill which seeks to remove decision making from the arena of elected representatives and hand it over to vested interest groups should be strenuously opposed.</P>
    <P>The vested interest groups covered in section 7 of this Bill hold no mandate from the electorate and may themselves operate under very questionable undemocratic procedures.  One of the organisations mentioned in section 5 of this Bill, An Taisce, has been involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the organisations mentioned in section 5 of this Bill, An Taisce, has been involved in a public campaign to denigrate the role of public <Col N="582" /> representatives in planning and development.

      <P>Deputy Donnellan is a member of a local authority who have been the subject of An Taisce's attentions. He should be well aware of the attitude of An Taisce to elected representatives on local authorities.  He should be aware of the views held by these people about people like Deputy Donnellan who is a member of a planning authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While valid criticism is at all times welcomed, one wonders about the objectivity of some members of An Taisce whose main purpose is to depoliticise the whole planning process.  This is a highly impracticable and dangerous proposition which would involve the abolition not just of the existing membership of An Bord Pleanála but also of the 1963 Planning and Development Act which lays down that only elected members of local authorities have power to adopt development plans upon which all planning decisions are based.  Fianna Fáil agreed with the other parties in this House some years ago to transfer responsibility for deciding planning appeals from the Minister for the Environment to a board &ldquo;the chairman of which shall be appointed by the Government and the ordinary members numbering not less than four or more than ten will be appointed by the Minister&rdquo;.  It was accepted by all parties then that planning and development issues would always be of major political importance affecting the economic, social and cultural development of the nation and as such could never be removed completely from the mainstream of political activity.  Any organisation who adopt as their major objective the depoliticising of planning and development are acting in an unreasonable, unrealistic fashion and should not be given a role to play by a parliament whose authority they seek to displace.  It is <Col N="583" /> essential that the role of parliament be paramount in any legislative proposals brough forward for enactment in Dáil Éireann.  We consider the main proposals in this Bill to be absolutely unnecessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been dealing with notes.  Deputy Skelly seems to have difficulty in seeing the relevance of some of my arguments.  If he likes I will send him a copy of my contribution when I have completed it.  As I was saying, in 1976 we accepted the Coalition's proposals introduced by the Labour Party Minister, Deputy Tully, granting the Government and the Minister for the Environment the power to select and appoint the chairman and members of An Bord Pleanála respectively.  We never sought to interfere with the appointees of the Coalition Government to An Bord Pleanála.  It should always be the Government's prerogative to make these appointments free of the cumbersome and unnecessary procedure proposed in this Bill.  Obviously much of the push for this Bill is coming from the Labour Party whose leader is Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State in the same Department is another Labour Party member.  In this Coalition the Labour Party are controlling the Department of the Environment and it is Labour Party Members who are bringing forward this legislation.  Therefore, I appeal to the Fine Gael Members not to allow all of their beliefs to be swamped for the expediency of remaining in office.  I appeal to them to defend the integrity of members who have served on An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember that this House is casting a very serious aspersion on the people who have acted as board members since An Bord Pleanála were established in 1977 by the Coalition Government.  People of <Col N="584" /> great eminence and ability have worked on that board at a remuneration level which could not be deemed exceptional or extraordinary.  The work is hard and involves reading volumes of paper, studying reams of plans and spending hours studying the issues in each case before arriving at a decision.  I have some experience of that work, having had the responsibility for deciding planning appeals in the years prior to the establishment of An Bord Pleanála.  Therefore, I speak with some knowledge and authority on the onerous tasks involved for any individual who is obliged to consider planning inspectors' plans, to examine all the submissions in support of a planning appeal and, most difficult of all, to arrive at a fair decision.  All of that involves dedication and hard work. People who have given this type of service to the country are now being ridiculed by the Coalition Government and fired out of office without any valid reason given.  There is no stated misbehaviour, no act which they are alleged to have committed which was improper which would warrant their being fired from those positions.  Many of those people have very high qualifications; some of them represent just pure common sense as Mr. Tully said, the man in the street.  He justified the appointment of one of the individuals on the grounds that the man was a sensible person who would apply common sense and the view of the ordinary man in the street as distinct from the expertise of the technocrats. In this Bill we are being asked to establish a planning appeals board comprised solely of technocrats.  Leaving aside the other principles which we oppose, that will not be a good board. There is always need for a broader view of matters when decisions are finally being made in planning cases and a narrow board as is proposed will not be successful.</P>
    <P>In the 1976 Act grounds were laid down on which members could be dismissed from office.  No complaints in line with the grounds in that Act have been made against any of the members on the board at present.  Therefore, it is very unfair and improper for Parliament to <Col N="585" /> take this extreme action for no good reason.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to recall that the appointments to the board were for a very short period, three years I understand.  Many people had agreed to act in the interests of the nation and gave up their free time. I know of one individual who did not live in the city of Dublin and who travelled each week to this city, stayed away from his family, and did that five days a week for all of the three years in which he acted on the board and he dealt with very complex appeals such as the caverns case in Dublin Bay and made a major contribution to the decisions of that board.  Is the work of such people all to be cast aside for naught?  Is this Parliament not to show gratitude and respect for people who have participated willingly in the democratic process by accepting invitations to act on this board?  It is an absolute and utter disgrace that people of that quality, calibre, level of dedication to the nation are abused and vilified in this way by this Government in this Bill.  I hope that many of the Members on the other side will re-think seriously about what they are doing.</P>
    <P>We believe so strongly that the new principles enshrined in this Bill should be opposed that we have adopted as part of our party policy that if and when Fianna Fáil are returned to office we will rescind sections 5 and 7 of this Bill.  If this Bill becomes law and if somebody accepts an appointment as a member of this board we are serving a notice on that person from Parliament here today that he need not expect the continued support of Fianna Fáil if and when we are returned to office.</P>

      <P>A Government Deputy &mdash; I believe it was Deputy Carey &mdash; replying to my statement that if and when there is a change of Government and my party are returned to power we will rescind sections 5 and 7 said it would never happen.  We are serving notice now on any person who accepts an appointment from the Government that that will be the position.  The urgency which the Government have attached to the Bill will be matched by the same urgency by us to have the sections rescinded. Government Members who contribute glibly across the floor of the House and make comments in reply to suggestions about a change of Government that it will never happen should remember that when one is a Member as long as Deputy Lenihan and I one is careful about making such a comment.  Changes have come and will come.  If any Government Members think they will be Members <i>saecula saeculorum</i> they are in for a rude awakening. I can recall the late Deputy Sweetman telling me in 1968 that he would be a Member longer than I.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of our party to rescind the main sections of the Bill in regard to the method of selection and appointment to An Bord Pleanála if and when we are returned to office.  We intend to do that to ensure that full authority in appointing members of An Bord Pleanála is vested in the elected Government of the people.  The Minister has pursued a vicious campaign of vilification against the chairman and members of An Bord Pleanála since his appointment as Minister for the Environment.  In his campaign he has resorted to false accusations to justify the extreme action he now proposes.  On the numerous occasions he has averted to the backlog of appeals and the impact of planning delays in An Bord Pleanála on jobs in the building industry, thus seeking to create the impression that it was the chairman and members of the board who were responsible for these delays.  Nothing could be further from the truth, as I will demonstrate later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> The Minister, having accused board members of being responsible for the delays, may feel he is justified in firing every one of them.  The Minister has not presented any evidence to substantiate his claim, and until he does he stands indicted of having acted unjustly and in doing so damaging the reputation of a High Court judge and the ordinary members of the board.  Under the 1976 Act the Government may only remove the High Court judge from chairmanship if he has become incapable through ill health of effectively performing his duty, or if he has committed stated misbehaviour or if his removal appears to the Government to be necessary for the effective performance by the board of its functions.  In case a chairman of the board is removed under this provision the Government shall cause to be laid before the House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the reasons for the removal. The Minister has similar powers in respect of ordinary members.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge neither the Government nor the Minister have claimed that any board member has (1) become incapable through ill-health of effectively performing his duties or (2) committed misbehaviour. Neither has any statement been laid before the Oireachtas setting out in writing reasons why removal of members appears to the Government to be necessary for the effective performance by the board of its functions.  The only grounds given by the Minister is the size of the backlog caused by delay in dealing with appeals but that is not a valid reason for a dismissal because the delays did not take place at board level but were caused by lack of adequate numbers of planning inspectors and administrative staff.  I challenge the Minister to deny that statement.</P>
    <P>A former chairman of the board has spoken out to contradict the Minister's assertion.  Mr. Justice Denis Pringle, who was appointed chairman of An Bord Pleanála by the Coalition Government in 1977, said in the course of a statement published in <i>The Irish Press</i>, 26 May 1983:</P>
    <P>The failure to replace key staff <Col N="588" /> attached to An Bord Pleanála was a major factor in the backlog of planning appeals.</P>
    <P>The planning inspectors are the key people in the working of the board and they were cut considerably.  We were pressing the Department for a long time to increase the number of inspectors to deal with appeals.</P>
    <P>A former member of the board has stated that appeals were rarely if ever delayed at board level for more than one week. Compare that to the false allegations which have consistently been made by the Minister in statements given to the newspapers and interviews.  He has sought to convey the impression to the public, and the construction industry, that the reason for the long delays in deciding planning appeals here was dilatoriness on the part of the chairman and ordinary members of An Bord Pleanála. I will demonstrate how inaccurate, unfair and unjust that is.  It surprises me that all the Government Deputies will troop in behind the Minister who is bringing forward this legislation on the basis that the board stands accused of being responsible for the delays.  We know that the delays have been unreasonable.  It is most unacceptable that it should take ten months or 12 months to decide a planning appeal and I would be highly critical of any system which would cause such delays in making those important decisions. We know at this time of high unemployment and a crisis in our economy how important it is to ensure that any administrative matters causing delays in investment are dealt with urgently.  We would welcome a serious attempt to deal with the cause of such delays.  To seek to convey the impression that these delays are solely caused by the members of the board and because of that that they must all be fired is a lie, it is not true, it is false.</P>

I do not have access to the inner corridors of An Bord Pleanála, the Department of the Environment or local authorities; but a person who served in the past on that board &mdash; it should be remembered that Mr. Justice Pringle, who was chairman of the board, has spoken out &mdash; has contradicted the Minister's comments.  The delays in appeals has never been caused at board level and rarely if ever were delays at that level longer than one week.  Even if I said that delays at that level were rarely longer than one month I do not think anybody could accuse board members of being the cause of unnecessary and unacceptable delays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the cause of the delays.  It might surprise many Deputies to know that when planning appeals were brought before the members of the board they rarely took longer than one week to be decided on. The 1976 Act established An Bord Pleanála and section 10 of that Act enables the board to employ their own staff.  It was the intention of Dáil Éireann that An Bord Pleanála would be an independent autonomous body employing their own staff.  I must now ask why the board have never been allowed to employ their own staff.  The Department of the Environment's staff, seconded on a short term basis to the board in 1977 to facilitate the transition, have continued in that <Col N="590" /> capacity ever since, thus frustrating the establishment of a truly independent board.  The Minister's civil servants have maintained their grip on the administration of the planning appeal process and must accept responsibility for the inordinate delays which have taken place in deciding appeals.</P>
      <P>The civil service bureaucracy may have resented the change from the Department to An Bord Pleanála and could have used their special position to frustrate the intention of the 1976 Act of establishing a completely free and independent appeal board.  It must be said that successive Ministers for the Environment presided over the continued employment of their staff on secondment to the board and contributed to the present unsatisfactory situation where the chairman and the board members do not have direct control over all of their staff.  If anybody cares to read the 1981 Annual Report of An Bord Pleanála he will see that the board have only one full-time staff member under their direct control, the chief executive officer.  This is a most unsatisfactory situation and explanations are certainly called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to give the House some figures to support my argument that delays in deciding planning appeals have more to do with staff shortages at technical and administrative level than delays at board level.  In the year ending December 1977 there were 18 planning inspectors. In December 1980 they were down to 15 planning inspectors and in the year ending December 1982 there were still only 15 inspectors.  We see that this board established during 1977 had at the end of that year 18 planning inspectors and at the end of December 1982, five years later, they had only 15 planning inspectors. I understand there were times in between when the number was even less than 15.  We have the extraordinary situation &mdash; this is a well-known and accepted fact &mdash; that there was an increase in the number of appeals brought before the board.  No appeal can be decided unless the planning inspector has written his report.  This is presented to the board and they make their decision. If there is no corresponding increase <Col N="591" /> in the number of inspectors how can the board increase the number of decisions they are making?  They will not be receiving a substantial increase in the number of planning inspectors' reports coming before them because there has not been an increase in the number of planning inspectors.</P>
    <P>With regard to staff employed by the board, in December 1977 there were 73 people employed by the board; in December 1980 there were 74, an increase of one; and in December 1982 there were 78, an increase of five from 1977.  In December 1977 there were 3,198 appeals decided, during the year ending December 1980 there were 4,271 and during the year ending December 1982 there were 3,662 appeals decided, despite the fact that there was a substantial drop in the number of inspectors employed.</P>
    <P>I now come to the crucial figure which illustrates the case being made in regard to delays.  The number of appeals on hand at the end of 1977 was 1,684, at the end of December 1978 there were 1,710 and at the end of December 1982 there were 3,255 appeals on hand.  There was a substantial increase in the number of backlog appeals but there was a drop in the number of planning inspectors.  These figures clearly illustrate that the number of planning inspectors dropped during the period, the number of appeals decided during the period increased and the number of appeals received greatly exceeded the capacity of the planning inspectors to deal with them.  Perhaps, for those who do not know I should explain that the members of the board have no knowledge of a planning appeal until a member of the board receives a planning inspector's report on the appeal.</P>
    <P>The delay from the time an appeal is received until the planning inspector's report is available is something over which the board members have not been able to exercise any control as they do not control the staff.  I have valuable information given to me by a former member which I think Members of the House should be aware of and which I should like to put on record, that is, the procedure followed by the appeals board <Col N="592" /> in dealing with planning appeals.  When an appeal is made to An Bord Pleanála it is received by the administrative staff; it is not received by a board member, which the Minister continues to seek to convey.  I understand that local authorities have been responsible for a delay of on average three months in submitting documents to the administrative staff of An Bord Pleanála to enable them to prepare the appeal file.  Therefore a large portion of the delay which has been taking place in planning appeal cases has been caused by local authorities throughout the country.  That point must be clearly established first.</P>
    <P>If we are apportioning blame in regard to delays in deciding appeals let us be factual and truthful and show where those delays really occur.  I understand that local authorities have delayed, often as long as six months, before submitting necessary documents to An Bord Pleanála to enable the staff to prepare an appeal file for a planning inspector.  I understand sometimes the delay will be one month, sometimes six months and that an average over the year would be three months.  After that three months' delay the appeal file is ready to be sent to the processing section, where on average a further one month's delay occurs.  At that point there is an appeal lodged &mdash; the board have not seen it yet and four months have passed.  The appeal file is sent then to the planning inspector where a further delay of on average, six months occurs.  Therefore, we had a three months' delay awaiting the local authority to submit the necessary documentation, a further one month's delay in the processing section, checking, cross-checking and preparing the file, then it was sent to the planning inspector &mdash; it takes him on average six months &mdash; so the appeal has now been with An Bord Pleanála for ten months.  But the members of the board will not have seen it yet.  When the planning inspector has completed his report &mdash; and this is at the end of an average period of ten months &mdash; it goes then to a board member and on average it is cleared through the board within one week.</P>
    <P>Therefore an appeal takes ten months <Col N="593" /> before being placed before the board for decision and then is decided within one week.  This Minister has issued public statements accusing the appointed members and chairman of An Bord Pleanála of being responsible for inordinate delays which have affected employment in the construction industry.  That was a wrong accusation to make.  Indeed, it was most surprising that the Minister should make such accusation.  But the delay does not end there.  After the board have decided on the appeal it can take anything from two weeks to two months before the order is ready for signature.  Until the order implementing the decision of the board is signed it cannot be sent to the appellant, the appellant is not notified, the local authority are not notified. Therefore there is an average delay of 12 months involved.</P>
    <P>It is clear that if there is to be a substantial reduction in the delays involved in deciding planning appeals local authorities must submit the necessary documentation more expeditiously.  I support the amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have been illustrating that on average it takes 12 months to decide planning appeals from the time An Bord Pleanála are notified of the appeal until such time as the order is signed and issued by the board.  In all of that period of 12 months I have said that the actual members and chairman of An Bord Pleanála involved in taking the decision on average take their decision within one week of receiving the planning appeal file and that the remaining 11 months and three weeks it took to decide is accounted for elsewhere, but not at board level.  I hope that point has sunk in on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>Even at this stage I would appeal to the Minister to apologise to the members of the board for the allegations he has wrongly levelled against them.  At the outset he should have been honest and admitted that really the only way of having an increased number of appeals <Col N="594" /> decided would be to increase the staff numbers, particularly the number of planning inspectors.  It has been a false economy to cut back on the number of planning inspectors and administrative staff in view of the substantial increase in the flow of planning appeals to the board. It is wrong for the Minister to claim that the backlog with regard to planning appeals is the fault of the board members and he should offer an apology to board members, past and present, for the unwarranted slight on their ability and efficiency.  Members accepted invitations to act on the board, often at great inconvenience and financial loss to themselves. They saw their work as a national task requiring competence and integrity. They gave their service loyally to the nation and the Dáil and the country owe a deep debt of gratitude to all of those who have served on the board since the foundation of that body.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by raising another issue in regard to my amendment and to the Bill, namely, the constitutionality of the proposal before the House.  It should be remembered that An Bord Pleanála exercise powers of a quasi-judicial nature.  When making decisions, the members must have unfettered discretion but, more important, must be seen that they have this unfettered discretion.  If members are appointed from a representative panel they will feel their appointment is to represent a point of view and to reflect it in their decisions.  If such an impression is held by the public it will sap public confidence in the operation of the board.</P>
    <P>There is a major principle of jurisprudence involved here.  Judges or those exercising quasi-judicial functions must be free and independent in the exercise of their office and must be free and deemed to be free of any bias in their decisions.  This being the age of minorities, one can see the absurdity of arguing that the Supreme Court should be representative of all sorts of minority groups. That is the kind of reasoning that suggested the Bill before the House.  In our opinion there is a case to be examined as to whether the selection method proposed in the Bill is constitutional.  I pose <Col N="595" /> that question here and Members on my side of the House may return to it at a later date.</P>
    <P>There are many other sections in the Bill which seek to achieve some improvements in a minor way in regard to considering planning appeals <i>de novo,</i> removing that obligation and allowing the board in future to consider conditions attaching to an appeal if the appeal is only against a condition in a matter of that kind.  I should like to contribute further to that on Committee Stage.  Other Members on this side will deal with those aspects of the Bill at a later stage.</P>
    <P>There are two main sections in the Bill, one proposing this new system of appointment and selection of board members and firing ignominiously the existing board.  The second part of the Bill concerns the minor improvements which should help to reduce some of the delays.  It has been a completely false argument for the Minister for the Environment to seek to justify this extreme step he is taking on the grounds that the delays were caused by the board members, that because of inefficiency or delay on their part our planning appeals system has been cumbersome and slow to make decisions.  I hope what I have said has demonstrated there is no truth in that.  A heavy responsibility lies on the Minister to clarify the false allegations he made against those who now serve and who served in the past.  All of them are honourable men and the nation owes them a debt of gratitude.  There are many other people who have participated in the working of State boards at the invitation of the elected Government.  They have served their country well and they should not be denigrated in the fashion proposed in this Bill.  It is a retrograde step on the part of the Government.  We are disappointed it has been left to the Opposition to defend the principle of the supremacy of Parliament.  Let there be no mistake about it.  That is what we are here to do today and what we will continue to do until the Government have a change of mind.</P>

      <P>I support <Col N="596" /> this Bill which I regard as timely, if not overdue.  On behalf of the Labour Party and Fine Gael I must say we regret the way this debate has started.  It is not our intention to try in any way to subvert or short-circuit the parliamentary process. In view of what has taken place it is only fair that the House should be aware of the timetable against which this Second Stage debate is taking place.</P>
      <P>The Bill was presented to the Dáil as long ago as 30 May after the Minister for the Environment on a number of occasions had indicated that the board would be restructured and reformed.  The order for Second Stage was made on 2 June and the date fixed was Wednesday, 8 June. There was an absence of agreement at that time but, as Deputy Lenihan will agree, three weeks were allowed which was not an unreasonable length of time. The Bill has been with Members of this House and the public for quite some time.</P>
      <P>Because it proposes to restructure and change the board it is preferable that it be done properly and quickly now that the intention has been made clear.  It is not in the interest of anyone, least of all the members of the board for whom Deputy Molloy declares so much concern, that the debate on this Bill be prolonged indefinitely.  More important, it is not in the interest of the nation that any ambiguity should surround the ongoing existence of the board because that would make their position untenable so far as the making of decisions was concerned.</P>
      <P>In moving his amendment Deputy Molloy attempted to suggest that the Minister somehow or other was pre-empting the role of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Building Land.  He attempted to suggest to the House that in some way that committee had specifically to look at the question of planning and to advise on changes in relation to An Bord Pleanála.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the board were <Col N="600" /> established under the 1974 legislation, was to depoliticise the decision-making in relation to one aspect of planning, individual applications.  The House should be aware, and most people are, that the primary power of the local member in the making of the development plans is still reserved in the planning legislation. The local authority members' position is being reinforced and strengthened in this legislation.</P>
      <P>It is ominous, to say the least, that Deputy Molloy is talking about the depoliticisation of the planning process. We believe individual planning decisions should not be open to political persuasion, as some people believed they were. The Committee Stage will give Deputy Molloy an opportunity to clarify this point, but the House should be told if Fianna Fáil want to return to a situation where the Minister of the day exclusively makes the decision.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lenihan will have plenty of opportunity to speak and no doubt his interruptions will assist me to clarify further some of the points I want to make.  I will not delay the House at this stage because I believe the majority of the Members support the principle of An Bord Pleanála.  Therefore, a Second Stage debate at this time is superfluous. This legislation is changing the structure, the operation and some of the law dealing with how that board should operate and function, how it should be structured and how members should be appointed.  That <Col N="601" /> is contained in various sections and the detailed discussion of those points is more appropriate to a Committee Stage debate.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and I in my capacity as Minister of State in the Department with direct responsibility for the construction industry, both jointly and individually have repeatedly met deputations from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions Building Group and CIF, the Cork group of building trade unions, the Cork group of CIF and others throughout the country to discuss the present problems of the building industry. Invariably those developers and builders referred to the delays in the planning process of An Bord Pleanála stage as preventing them from undertaking projects in which their capital and resources were tied up.  They said that in their perception of how the system operated the delays had increased and that there was an urgent necessity to have, as they would say, something done about An Bord Pleanála.  We are proposing to do something about that board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting what was requested.  We shall be restructuring and improving and moving towards a stage in which there will be a fixed time in relation to the processing of an appeal by the board.  This is the ideal towards which we hope to move, so that a developer or any member of the community would have a clear picture of the timetable in relation to obtaining planning permission here. They cannot have that picture at present because of the open-ended delays which can occur at appeal stage.  The Minister for the Environment's indication at those meetings that he was in the process, on behalf of the Government, of reforming An Bord Pleanála was warmly welcomed by the professional institutions, by the Congress of Trade Unions Building Group and by CIF.  I want to put that on the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy made very disparaging remarks against voluntary organisations, <Col N="602" /> both national and local, for their unrepresentative role and what he may have described &mdash; although I am open to correction on this &mdash; their destructive role in relation to the planning process.  The House should recognise the role of local residents' associations and of An Taisce in the development of a planning awareness in this country since 1963, when a former member of the Fianna Fáil Party introduced the major legislation on local government planning and development. Most of these bodies have come into existence &mdash; and have certainly blossomed &mdash; within the framework of that legislation.  The role and the contribution of these bodies have been in the main positive and substantial and without them small, and in some cases understaffed or inexperienced, local authority planning staff could not have done the job they have done, both in terms of monitoring what is happening in our environment and, more importantly, in having an input into the formulation of development plans throughout all the planning authorities.</P>
    <P>To say that these bodies should have no voice in any way or be consulted or be able to propose prospective members &mdash; not to nominate or appoint them, but simply to propose them &mdash; along with other interested bodies which have a particular interest in a particular skill in this area, is something which the vast majority of Fianna Fáil members outside this House would not accept.  I look forward with interest to hearing the contributions of other Fianna Fáil Deputies in relation to this.  For example, I would be interested to hear if my constituency colleague &mdash; and former colleague in the Custom House &mdash; with direct responsibility for urban affairs feels that all the resident groups whose meetings he attends along with me are so unrepresentative or so destructive as Deputy Molloy seems to imply.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary and it is proper that it should pass after a reasonable debate.  It has been circulated in ample time to permit of proper discussion. Deputy Molloy was so well prepared that he had a substantial series of notes printed and available.  He was not in any <Col N="603" /> way caught on the hop, because he had time to circulate these to the Press Gallery as well.  Adequate time was provided to the Opposition.</P>
    <P>On the procedural point of not taking all Stages of this Bill in the current session and taking Second Stage today, for whatever reason, and I do not wish to speculate on what the reasons might be, on precedent Fianna Fáil do not appear &mdash; and I say this in a spirit of co-operation &mdash; to have any strong case for opposing the taking of this Bill in the proposed manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to be a member of the Irish Government in 1977 when the first board of An Bord Pleanála, which had been appointed by Mr. Tully as Minister for Local Government then, and by the Coalition Government, functioned under the then Minister for the Environment.  There was never any suggestion, good, bad or indifferent, that we would in any way change any member of the board who had been appointed by Deputy Tully.  Very strong representations were made in respect of one or two of the appointments and I shall say no more than that.  We resisted those representations and would not entertain for an instant any interference with a board appointed by a Minister and sanctioned by a previous Government.  We had a long tradition of recognising that Governments elected by the Irish people have a duty and responsibility and the decisions made by such Governments should be respected.  If we are now going down the slippery slope literally of firing members of boards and authorities just because they happen to have been appointed by a previous Government that is not the path pursued by numerous Governments and administrations from the formation of the State until just now. This is the first board since the formation of the State that has been dismissed crudely and arbitrarily by a Minister and a Government without giving a scintilla of reason for such dismissals.  Other boards have been dismissed by Governments. I was in a Government when the RTE Authority were dismissed because <Col N="604" /> of a very serious issue.  I shall not go into the merits or demerits of the issue, but it concerned the interpretation of section 31.  It arose out of a matter of public policy in which there was a very real, open disagreement between the Authority and the Government of the day.  For that reason the Authority of the day went and the then Government reappointed another RTE Authority.  There is no parallel whatever between that case and this instance.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's script, there is no mention of any reason, good, bad or indifferent, why even one member of this board should go, let alone the whole board, under the crude instrumentality of section 10(2)(i) which states:</P>
      <P>The person who immediately before the commencement of this section held the office of chairman shall, on such commencement, cease to be chairman.</P>
      <P>There is no reason given, no word of the reason to be stated or the grounds for ceasing to be chairman.</P>
      <P>In section 10(2)(ii) it is stated:</P>
      <P>Every person who immediately before the commencement of this section was an ordinary member of the board shall, on such commencement, cease to be such ordinary member.</P>
      <P>That is the language of a Commissar State.  Once the instrument is in operation, the chairman and board members shall cease to be chairman and board members.</P>
      <P>I want to give the Minister and the Government warning that they are treading on very dangerous legal and constitutional ground.  I hope that they have considered those aspects fully, both in regard to the efficacy of the legislation and of the position of the chairman and members of the board, the chairman being a very distinguished jurist.  I am certain that these matters will be very fully considered by them.  The whole efficacy of this legislation and the personal position of these board members who are being treated in such manner by section 10 will wind up in the courts on very substantial legal and constitutional grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> Apart from the legal and constitutional aspect, there is the astounding political attitude involved in just firing a board for no reason other than because that board happened to have been appointed by their predecessors in office in Government. This is a very dangerous, slippery slope.  No Fianna Fáil Government would ever dismiss a board without reason.  I was proud to be a member of a Government and hold the Ministry for Justice &mdash; the Ceann Comhairle will be aware of the gentleman I am talking about, a very respected judge, the President of the High Court and a former Fine Gael Deputy between 1957 and 1961&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are moving very near to interference with the courts because this planning board is a quasi-judicial body.  The powers exercised by An Bord Pleanála, the amount of money involved, the complex nature of the investigations and decisions made have given rise to a situation where decisions made by An Bord Pleanála are, were and always will be far more important than 95 per cent of the business conducted by the courts.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully very wisely wrote into his legislation in 1976 that the chairman should be a High Court judge.  Under that excellent legislation a very reputable High Court judge, Judge Denis Pringle, was chairman of the Planning Board as was Judge Eamon Walsh.  We appointed an equally distinguished jurist, Judge George Murnaghan, to be chairman of the board.  Under Mr. Tully's legislation which was very wise and proper in this respect it was mandatory that the chairman be a High Court judge and so it was.</P>

      <P>The three chairmen of the Planning Board since 1976 have been High Court judges.  Judge Murnaghan, a distinguished jurist and judge, will be dealt with crudely under section 10.  He was a judge appointed under that wise legislation brought in by a Labour Minister for Local Government.  Just because he was appointed by a Fianna Fáil Government he will be removed, without any explanation, under section 10 of this Bill.  Judge Pringle was appointed under a Coalition Government and remained there under our Government.  Judge Walsh was distinguished in planning law matters.  He was appointed chairman of the board and unfortunately died.  Judge Murnaghan was a High Court judge we appointed and he is now to be asked to cease holding office on the commencement of this legislation.  Every other member of the board will be treated in the same scurrilous fashion.</P>
      <P>This is a serious matter because this board exercise functions of a quasi-judicial nature.  They discharge obligations and powers which, in many cases, are far more important then the powers or obligations exercised by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister said that he does not regard the position of chairman as appropriate for a judge.  I take issue with him.  It is very important that a person of the stature of a High Court judge should be in this position.  The Minister will be on a very dangerous path if he seeks to appoint a person who is not completely above reproach and suspicion. High Court judges have always been so regarded.  The Minister is taking a very dangerous step.  He is dismissing a retired judge of the High Court but once a judge always a judge.  He is doing <Col N="607" /> this without any explanation just because he was appointed by a previous Government. The other dangerous step is that the status of High Court judge is being removed from the position.  That is a very serious departure and marks a dangerous development.  It does not recognise the importance of a quasi-judicial tribunal.</P>
    <P>As regards the general principle of an incoming Government interfering with State boards appointed by outgoing Governments, I have been in Government for a long time and any Government of which I was a member was never a party to that.  It is a dangerous and damaging principle.  If you start hopping the ball that way there is no end to the balls which can be hopped.  I would resist any such development on the part of any Government I have the honour to be part of.  I do not approve of it.</P>
    <P>Inevitably as our amendment states it will have serious repercussions on the standing, prestige and effectiveness of Government boards and State-sponsored bodies.  Sensible intelligent people of stature in the community will say when asked to serve on state boards: &ldquo;Why should I go on such a board when an incoming Government can throw me out without any reason?  They can simply bring in a crude section in a Bill and tell me I am gone.&rdquo; That is not the way to add to the prestige and value of State-sponsored boards.</P>
    <P>There are serious repercussions implicit in this for other State bodies.  It has been of considerable value to the social and economic development of our society over the years and to successive Governments that they have had a pool of people in various walks of life who could give their expertise whether in the social, economic, financial or legal areas on these State boards and authorities, in many cases for little remuneration.  If the Minister does not agree with that, he should check the list of State-sponsored bodies and he will see that in the great majority of cases people are working on these boards for a mere pittance.  It has been of great value in our society that these people have been available but this sort of action is a direct deterrent to <Col N="608" /> recruiting people of that kind to such boards.  The inevitable result of this action will be to bring all State boards and State authorities into disrepute and it will deter people who can make a contribution from becoming members of these boards.</P>
    <P>The great majority of the people who take on these tasks are not active, militant politicians in any party political sense.  The Governments of which I was a member selected people primarily because of their ability and capacity and the contribution they could make.  Inevitably there were people who belonged to my political party but people were also appointed who belonged to other political parties.  If there was an outstanding member of one's party he was appointed to a board but the primary requirement was always the capacity of the person.  It seems we are to have in regard to Bord Pleanála the crude exercise of section 10, causing a person to be dismissed without any reason on the commencement of the instrument becoming law.  If that crude method of dismissal is open to be used over the whole range of State bodies and authorities, it is not a good thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister suddenly announced his intention during a heady week-end following election to Government.  Apparently he announced it without any consultation but in a number of speeches since then and in his speech today he has spoken dishonestly as if there were some equation between the board membership and the inefficiency of the board.  He has sought in the public mind to do the double trick of the smear and the big lie, equating the lack of efficiency on the part of Bord Pleanála to the membership of the board.  He tried it again here but only by innuendo because the facts are entirely at variance with that proposition. One sentence of his speech is an example of this pernicious type of innuendo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing is more calculated to bring this House into disrepute than the nature and format of the type of legislation we are considering, particularly the draconian nature of section 10 where under subsection (1) the chairman can be terminated in his office without <Col N="610" /> any reason being given.  Subsection (2) applies the same legal ukase in respect of the other members of the board.  Not a single reason was given; there was no basis on which the Minister should exercise his discretion to cause the members of the board to cease to hold office. Merely on this instrument becoming law the chairman and members of the board will automatically cease to hold office. The chairman is a distinguished man who has been a High Court judge for a number of years and has the status of one of the country's leading jurists.  He is being treated in that manner by this legislation.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, disrepute will hang around this Government like an albatross because there are very sound legal and constitutional reasons why that section can be challenged successfully not just by the members of the board or the chairman whose office is being terminated in this drastic draconian manner but by anybody who becomes prejudiced by reason of decisions of the board in the future or who feel prejudiced or wronged.  Such persons, in my view, have got admirable legal and constitutional claims to have his legislation declared unconstitutional immediately on its passage.</P>
      <P>The very nature of section 10, the language used in it, is the most unique I have ever seen in legislation.  It creates a precedent because of the crudeness of the language, the lack of any reasons being taken into account, only the implicit power in an instrument to the effect that a person's office automatically is terminated on the passage of this law.  In his speech the Minister did not give any reason.  He did not give any reason in the many heavy statements he has made about this matter since assuming office. There has just been this smear technique</P>

      <P>The big smear technique <Col N="611" /> is quite simple.  If the House will bear with me I will explain how it is being worked here.  Two uncorrelated facts have been put together to make the appearance of a correlation.  The two put together in this document will be put over only by a smear technique.  There is not a scintilla against any member of the board.  Not an iota of evidence or complaint has been made against any member of the board.  The only way the Minister has given himself some sort of justification for interfering with this quasi-judicial body is to bring in the big smear, the big lie technique to link two unrelated facts together.  In this case the justification is the backlog of applications to be dealt with.  In the last sentence of page 3 of his speech he said in a very smeary fashion:</P>
      <P>Matters have not been helped by the fact that as more members were appointed to the board, the number of decisions made by the board decreased, the backlog of appeals increased and the delays involved in the release of employment-generating projects lengthened.</P>

      <P>In that sentence it is sought to establish a relationship between the members of the board and the increasing backlog of appeals.  In the <Col N="612" /> last paragraph of the Minister's speech, which in all probability was written by his Department, an attempt is made to relate to the technical and administrative problems in the Department as the real cause for this backlog, but there is not a hint of the Minister's earlier reference to a correlation between the backlog of appeals and the members of the board, because at pages 11 and 12 the reference is to administrative and technical difficulties. I will quote:</P>
      <P>At the end of April, the number of appeals on hands was almost 3,600. This build-up of arrears had led to long delays in the processing of particular cases and the consequent hold-up of many worthwhile development projects at a time when the building industry is particularly hard hit.  Side by side with the preparation of the new legislation, I have therefore arranged a programme of action aimed at reducing the arrears.  Since the beginning of this year, approval has been conveyed to the board to employ four additional senior planning inspectors and additional professional staff are being made available on a temporary basis by my own Department.  Additional administrative staff have been made available by my Department in recent times to deal with bottlenecks in the flow of cases to the board.  My Department have also carried out a study aimed at streamlining administrative systems and procedures within the board's organisation.  I hope that these various actions, coupled with the proposed changes in appeals law, will ensure that, in a relatively short time, significant improvements will be made in the time taken to process appeals and reduce considerably the current backlog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite evident from reading those last 30 lines of the Minister's script that the civil servants fully recognise that there is an administrative blockage.  That is what has given rise to appeals in hand of more than 3,600.  As Deputy Molloy said, it is quite clear that these appeals are processed at inspector level and that it is at <Col N="613" /> inspector and administrative levels that appeals have been dealt with.  They come to the board for final decisions.  As Deputy Molloy also said, the process of delays extends through the administrative system, from the local authorities to the Department, out to the inspectors and back from the inspectors to the board.  That procedure often takes 12 months before a person is communicated with a decision.  The actual time spent by the member of the board on making final decisions can be as short as a week or two.</P>
    <P>That is what we are talking about.  That is the real problem.  The real difficulty has been caused because the Minister would not take off his coat and employ more inspectors and administrative staff. Then there would not have been need for this hullaballoo and the termination of a High Court judge, Mr. Justice Murnaghan, as chairman of the board.  There was no need for the interferrence with this quasi-judicial body without any reason being given.  There was no reason for all this nonsense because the appointment of additional technical staff would have ended the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of all these facts.  The only reason the other matter has been dragged in is simply because the previous board and the very respected and reputable chairman happened to be appointed by the preceding Government. It was the type of action I have no intention of being associated with in future Fianna Fáil Governments.  We will never embark on that sort of slippery slope. That is the sort of thing we can expect from Coalition Governments.  I would prefer the sort of Coalition Government that gave to the original Planning Act when a sensible Labour man, Mr. James Tully, as Minister for Local Government introduced a Bill and very wisely insisted in a section of that Bill that a person of the status of a High Court judge should be appointed to the position of chairman of that board.  He very wisely did that because he saw the importance of the decisions which had to be made by the Planning Appeals Board at the end of the day.  He very wisely saw that it was important to have somebody of the status of a <Col N="614" /> High Court judge in that position.  That desirable practice is now being set aside by the Government and the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to reject the application of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo., for authority to close Tuam Sugar Factory and further calls on the Government to give categoric assurance that Tuam Sugar Factory will remain an integral and permanent part of the company's operations.</P>
      <P>It gives me pleasure to move this motion. I want to assert the complete confidence of our party in the sugar beet industry.  I pledge our party's full support for its continuing nationwide operation.  It is disheartening, to say the least, for all who believe in our capacity to create and innovate, to see question marks once more being raised over an operation which has served Ireland well over the past 50 years.  I refer to the Irish Sugar Company, to their factory at Tuam and to the renewed speculation about it.  I am also aware of the rumours and the scares about the future of the Thurles factory. These rumours seem to be deliberately promoted, and they reflect the conservative policies now being pursued in regard to Irish industry generally and in particular in regard to industry based on agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil cannot permit the advocates of a two factory sugar beet industry to go unchallenged.  Neither will we permit them to succeed.  Fianna Fáil reject that concept totally.  To countenance such would be tantamount to the winding down of an industry which has had such a dramatic impact on agriculture over five decades.  In the same period it had a developmental influence on industry generally and in financial terms it was profitable as well.  It is a reflection on the <Col N="615" /> dearth of thinking by the present Government that growers and workers in the industry, instead of being encouraged, are being subjected to pressures for curtailment and contraction, when surely the opposite course would be in the national interest.</P>
    <P>One has only to study the results of the latest sugar beet campaign to see how illogical and unwarranted this policy of retrenchment is, this policy of amputation. The campaign to which I refer was the best in the industry's history.  Beet growers were paid almost £60 million. Nearly £20 million of that was paid to the farmers who supplied Thurles factory.  A further £5 million or so was paid to the farmers who grew for Tuam.  The workers in the four factories, who of course in the main are farmers' sons and daughters or their neighbours in rural towns, earned something in the region of £30 million in wages.  In addition, the servicing of the industry with transport and so on gave good employment to many others.</P>
    <P>What did the nation get?  It was saved £150 million in import substitution and £100 million worth of sugar was provided to serve the needs of the island as a whole with reserves for export directly and indirectly of goods containing sugar.  The by-products processed into animal feedstuffs at the factories were worth more than £20 million.  In financial terms it was also a profitable operation.  Since Fianna Fáil established this industry in 1933 its story has been one of success, innovation, diversification and profit.</P>
    <P>In 1933, when Eamon de Valera, Seán Lemass and Seán MacEntee set the objective of this industry, it seemed to some people to be an in opportune time to do this.  At that time the great nations of the world were in the depths of political upheaval.  Millions were unemployed throughout the world.  A weak Irish economy felt the bitter blast from outside and was further hurt by depressed conditions at home.</P>
    <P>The existing privately owned sugar company in Carlow was on the point of collapse.  Those deemed wise and careful at that time counselled closure.  Through the mechanism of the Irish Sugar Company <Col N="616" /> the then Fianna Fáil Government decided not only to buy the Carlow factory but to build three other factories as well.  Who today would challenge the wisdom of their decision.  Who today can calculate the value of that decision to the country and to the thousands who have benefited from that and who will continue to do so provided the Government will give the industry a chance?  It was not by any accident that the late Eamon de Valera chose Tuam for the turning of the first sod for that new industry, that bold venture.  The underprivileged west and the attendant problems of its people held a special place in the consideration of de Valera and of Fianna Fáil, just as it did in the case of Pádraig Pearse.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Archbishop of Cashel, the Most Rev. Dr. Morris, said there are few industries which illustrate the interdependence of people in a community better than the sugar beet industry. On turning the first sod for the nationalised industry at Tuam almost 50 years ago, Eamon de Valera struck the same note when he said we should see the things on which we can agree rather than things on which we differ.  Later at Thurles in establishing factories such as these, he said we were making the way for a self-sufficient and a self-supporting State.  De Valera had no doubts in 1933.</P>
    <P>When I visited Tuam last May and toured the factory, I said to the workers that afternoon that, as spokesman on agriculture for Fianna Fáil, I was expressing the continued commitment of Fianna Fáil to the development of Irish agriculture and industries based on agriculture. I said then, and I repeat now, that the policy which Fianna Fáil have pursued since 1932 has had a vital impact on the economic and social fabric of rural Ireland.  It has brought increased prosperity to our farmers and has provided meaningful, rewarding and real jobs for our people in their own local environment.</P>
    <P>This party resent and reject the smears of those who now belittle our efforts. Fianna Fáil remain adamant that that same principle is the way forward.  The history of the sugar beet industry is a classic vindication of our policy in this <Col N="617" /> regard.  The Tuam factory played and continues to play a vital and integral role in this policy.  Tuam may be small by European standards and a cost factor on the overall Sugar Company operation but I am sure the House will agree that they have served the region very well.</P>
    <P>We should not forget that during the Emergency years the Tuam factory, and the farmers who grew for it, served the national effort, sometimes producing more than other factories could.  I said last May in Tuam that the factory was deliberately placed there to help in the development of the west.  It was the first industry auxiliary to agriculture set up in the province.  The west still has special problems, it needs the factory and a need for political support for it still remains. When Fianna Fáil located the factory there, they were not motivated by profit considerations alone although, five decades later, it can be argued that their contribution to the national effort has been considerable and more than justifies the decision made some 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is Fianna Fáil policy to retain the factory and to use it as a vehicle to create a greater balance in farming patterns in the west generally.  Without the Tuam factory and its various ancilliary involvements over the decades, tillage in Connacht would have all but vanished by now.  What an imbalance that would have left.  Its critics point to the small acreage provided for beet but the percentage under beet in Connacht, when related to tillage in general, is perhaps greater than anywhere else here.  One acre committed to beet in effect commits three acres to tillage when rotational patterns are considered.  This is vital to farmers in the west, especially to the provision of winter fodder in a region which can be very severe on livestock.  We must never forget that the west is vitally important nationally because of the excellence of its cattle and sheep.</P>
    <P>I repeat that Fianna Fáil will resist all attempts to deny the west the opportunity which such industry provides.  Fianna Fáil set it up at a time of depression.  We reject the false logic that it should be closed down at a time of economic recession. I fully acknowledge the difficulties <Col N="618" /> of the Sugar Company.  They have never been in a position to hold adequate funds in reserve to meet the heavy refurbishing costs which were necessary recently to modernise and expand their 50-year-old factories.  Their profits, which were substantial over the years, were, of necessity, ploughed back into the building up of the industry at field level, research projects, seed and soil testing, disease control, the provision of essential limestone quarries, manufacture of farm equipment vital to our special needs and in assistance to exporting firms using sugar in their products.  The State, through the Sugar Company, provided all these aids to farmers and business interests by virtue of the Fianna Fáil decision to set up the industry.  No other sugar processing company had to embrace such an undertaking. In other sugar beet producing countries, the services either already existed or were provided by farmers or co-operatives. The Sugar Company did this work superbly.  We have an expertise in this area of agriculture which is of tremendous value to the nation.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged also that the Sugar Company undertook the development of the vegetable processing industry and financed it from their own resources. That national undertaking put a further strain on the company's finances.  Economic conditions and factories with inadequate protection within the EEC framework add further to the difficulty of Ireland having, as it should, a horticultural industry capable, as the sugar industry has been, of meeting national needs and winning markets abroad.</P>
    <P>We are now being prepared for the second closure announcement on Tuam. There are leaks almost daily to create the necessary climate.  No one is under any illusion.  The Government want to get rid of the Tuam factory.  The Minister for Agriculture said, in reply to questions over the last couple of weeks, that only viable enterprises can be tolerated.  We all subscribe to that but how do you judge viability in the context of a national industry which has a development role to play?  Let nobody think that continued and intense research is no longer required <Col N="619" /> in the beet industry, there is much still to be done in this regard.</P>
    <P>Last year this party, acknowledging this, brought in legislation which strengthened greatly the Sugar Company's financial base and, though funds were scarce, we gave a substantial £30 million injection to the industry then.  We did not provide that money to close down Tuam or to close down the food enterprise of Mattersons of Limerick, or East Cork Foods in Midleton.  That money was provided to enable the Sugar Company to become viable in all their operations in the context of their national contribution.</P>
    <P>Of course we envisage rationalisation in industry.  Industry must change and adjust, but there is a difference between that and taxing an industry and, indeed, a way of life out of existence.  If the Sugar Company are forced to close it will be only a matter of time before beet growing ceases in Connacht.  At present well over 1,000 farmers are serving the one factory and some of them have been growing beet for almost 50 years.  Then there is the position of workers, not all of them on the Sugar Company payroll, but in considering the growers more than 500 persons have full-time employment because of the sugar factory in Tuam.  I repeat that because it is worth repeating. In considering the growers more than 500 persons have full-time employment because of the sugar factory in Tuam. That is worth considering carefully in the context of this motion and in the context of the feeble approach of the Government in their amendment, which says:</P>
    <P>supports the Government in its efforts to secure the future of the sugar industry on a viable basis.</P>
    <P>What are the Government's thoughts on this?  Will they close the factory?  If that is so no support will be given to the Government from this side of the House, considering that 500 persons have full-time employment there because of the sugar factory in Tuam.</P>
    <P>Being conscious of these factors, Fianna Fáil reiterated their philosophy towards the sugar factory, particularly <Col N="620" /> the Connacht section of it, when it became clear two years ago that the then Labour-Fine Gael Government were determined to thwart a great national enterprise because of their clouded vision of this country's future.  When our party had the opportunity in Government last July we backed that philosophy with further strengthening legislation.  In other words, we have consistently and deliberately over the years supported the Irish Sugar Company, particularly their operation in Tuam.  We have said over and over again that the Tuam sugar factory is and must be an integral part of the whole sugar industry and we have brought in legislation and given the necessary financial support for this.  We have also stated that Tuam cannot and should not be considered in isolation as this Government are doing, that the whole sugar industry and the whole Irish Sugar Company complex must be looked at together.  It is patently improper for this Government to endeavour to nullify what is a legitimate national aspiration, the requirement to treat all areas of this country with equal concern, and that means assisting the less privileged regions.  I have no doubt at all if the current thinking at Government level is not abandoned Thurles will most certainly come under the closure threat.  Those who fly the kites for the present administration have already written off the factory in Thurles which serves the beet farmers of Waterford, Wexford, Laois, Tipperary and Kilkenny.  The thinking of this Government is to close down any enterprise which is not profitable regardless of the social consequences that will have for the people of the west and more particularly for the farming community and workers associated with this factory at Tuam.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> For the benefit of Deputy Molony I will say that if current thinking at Government level is not abandoned Thurles will most certainly come under the closure threat.  The factory and the industries and services which have grown up around it gave full employment to well over 1,000 people, not to mention the equivalent of another 1,000 full-time jobs on the beet farms which supply it.  These jobs are not protected. They were created from the sane and solid policies laid down by those who established this industry and, as I said earlier, the benefits of their labour for Ireland are rich indeed, as is widely appreciated.  The beet industry is indeed one which binds town and countryside in mutual enterprise, and the Deputy's party are forgetting about the social consequences of their policies at present not alone to the sugar industry but to all other <Col N="622" /> industries.  This industry is a classic example of co-operation between private enterprise, farming and the State, through the agency of the Sugar Company. It is an industry with an enormous multiplier effect within the economy and Ireland has exploited that characteristic to good effect.  We must concentrate on it even more so in the future as such an industry based on agriculture offers a security to the country that few enterprises can at this stage.  To tamper needlessly with such an enterprise is to risk damaging the entire industry.  The balance has been set and it must remain.</P>
      <P>There are many small factories in Europe and they are suitable in the west of Ireland.  The State should view Tuam factory as an innovator in a national effort to improve agriculture, especially tillage, in Connacht.  That factory should not be turned into a political football. I am afraid that is what is being attempted and I condemn it.</P>

The Sugar Company should be encouraged to get the best possible results for the west.  It should receive the political and public support and understanding necessary to do so.  Beet growing is an essential basic industry for us.  With our mixed farming pattern it would be utter folly not to foster it, but the Government would not understand that.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> If the Deputy cannot resist interrupting he has an option.  He does not have to listen to me.  The possibilities for beet growing were seen at the beginning of the century and Fianna Fáil made them a reality. That did not happen without Fianna Fáil having to endure the criticism and scorn of those anxious to belittle that industry. We still have such people.  One of the considerations that had to be taken into account by Fianna Fáil at the time was the need to develop our agricultural industry nationally.  There was a recognition also that tillage practice mainly among the smaller farmers needed special encouragement.  A further consideration, which remains as true today as it was then, was the desperate need to find employment in a local environment for <Col N="624" /> the sons and daughters of farmers and those in rural towns serving them.</P>
      <P>We have not yet reached the stage in our development when we can ignore the need for regional input.  Other regions remain to be developed and there must be a determination to plan and build for the future.  The solution to our problems will not be found through a policy of closing down industries which people with original ideas built.  It will not be found by driving thousands of workers on to the dole queues.  The country would be best served if we motivated people, as they were in the past, to build industries like the sugar factories and, more important, to have more of them based on agriculture.  Fianna Fáil believe that because of the recession and the necessity to create employment, for our young people in particular, we must turn to agriculture to provide industries.  I have no doubt that in the future we will continue to look to rural Ireland to build up industries like the Sugar Company.  I appeal to the Government to give the people on the western seaboard a chance to survive, as Fianna Fáil gave them. Fianna Fáil have given the example and the Government should follow it.</P>

    <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss with Members the situation of the Irish sugar industry.  Deputies are aware that the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture have received a progress report and a rationalisation plan about the sugar industry from the Sugar Company.  We have had that report for about two weeks and, following consideration in the coming weeks, recommendations will be sent to the Government for a decision.  I am not going to give any categoric assurance tonight about the future of any part of the Sugar Company. <Col N="625" /> There will be no such assurances given and there will be no decisions made until that report is fully studied by the Departments in question and, eventually, by the Government.  Furthermore, I have seldom heard such false and dangerous assumptions as those made tonight by Deputy Noonan regarding the Thurles factory.  I challenge the Deputy to name the source of his allegations.  As the Minister responsible for the Sugar Company in general, I am astounded to hear an Opposition Deputy say that there are moves within the Government to close the sugar factory in Thurles.</P>

      <P>I assure Deputies that in my examination of the proposals in the rationalisation plan I will take into account all constructive and realistic proposals which may be put to me in the course of consideration of the motion now before the House.  In saying that I would like to let the Members opposite know that I have a completely open mind in relation to this whole matter.  Neither the Government nor I have any preconceived notions.  In an effort to maintain a sense of constructive realism I propose to put a number of relevant factors to the House.  These will, I hope, put the position of the Irish sugar industry into perspective.</P>
      <P>Firstly, let me say that Exchequer funding, though a very important and even crucial issue in regard to this matter, is not the sole consideration here.  The very future of beet growing and sugar production is at stake.  Therefore, I want to emphasise at the outset that we are dealing with an industry which, at a national level, needs to be underpinned and secured.  This House has had occasion several times over the past three years to take stock of the situation in regard to CSET and the beet sugar industry. It has underwritten the provision of large amounts of public money, and has debated thoroughly the choices facing the industry.  It is, therefore, with some dismay that I find the Opposition making use of the same kind of selective argument, and demonstrating their habitual reluctance to face stark reality.  I can put the position into a nutshell now by saying that the issue is whether we are or are not to have a sugar industry in five years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The world does not stand still, and adjustment waits for none of us.  The future of our sugar industry will be determined by our response to a whole series of challenges that have been building up over the past 20 years or so and of further new challenges which will have to be faced over the coming four to five years. The yardsticks by which our industry has to be measured are not manufactured in Earlsfort Terrace or even Kildare Street. They are handed to us, whether we like it or not, by beet producers and factory <Col N="627" /> managements in other areas of the European Community who, in addition to enjoying natural and climatic advantages, have founded their own industry on considerations of efficiency and profitability and who have put themselves in a position to exploit any opening that our own lack of foresight affords them.</P>
    <P>Let there be no doubt anywhere in the House that this is the real issue.  Although I am somewhat less than seven months' in office as Minister, the Sugar Company's affairs are not all that new to me. I first came into close contact with them in 1980 as a member of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  I believe that all of us would do well to reflect yet again on the contents of that report in its essentials.  That joint committee was representative of the three main parties in Dáil Éireann.  As far as I am concerned, it is a fundamental document, and one which I wish to see guiding our thinking.  It opens by describing the nature and history of the Sugar Company. It points out that its legal character is that of a joint stock company and there we come up against the first consideration that is material for us.  When the company were established in 1933 the legal form chosen for them was not that of a board like the ESB or the Pigs and Bacon Commission. It was set up not as an authority, but as an enterprise, a State enterprise admittedly, but an enterprise for all that. Indeed, for many years the bulk of their share and debenture capital came from private citizens.  Only with the expansion of the company's activities in the early sixties did the State's holding become predominant.  That is a point which is not often appreciated by the general public or even some Deputies.</P>
    <P>I need not remind this House that the clouds had been gathering for some time before the Joint Oireachtas Committee made their report.  By 1980 the company overall were in a very substantial loss-making position to the extent of £11 million for the financial year 1979-80.  The committee had anticipated this and had structured their recommendations accordingly.  They drew the attention of the two Houses to the need for new shareholders' <Col N="628" /> capital and recommended that £25 million be provided immediately. This new capital would in effect be new Government funding to be applied to reverse the devastating trend in the company's finances.</P>
    <P>There followed a period of analysis, of debate, of determining strategy.  The company were asked to come forward with their proposals for financial restructuring. This they did in May 1981.  It fell to the incoming Government in July 1981 to assess these proposals and to take matters forward from there.  They sought expert advice on the steps needed to restructure the company's finances.  They commissioned a consultants' report, which was submitted in April 1982 to my predecessor, Deputy Lenihan.  They offered the then Minister a series of alternative plans for financial restructuring. This afforded him the basis for bringing the company's problems to the attention of the Oireachtas when he introduced the Sugar Manufacture (Amendment) Bill in June 1982.  The purpose of that Bill, Deputies will recall, was to empower the company to broaden their capital base considerably, to increase their authorised share capital from £10 million to £75 million, and to enable the Minister for Finance to fund and take up new issues.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall the debates that took place in July last when the Bill went through both Houses.  Much goodwill was evident on all sides.  There was, I think it is fair to say, a degree of relief in the air that the task had been commenced and that the Government had declared firmly for the sugar industry's future.  Along with the Government's financial commitment came a requirement for rationalisation. In exchange for new funding which Deputy Lenihan secured for the company he sought a rationalisation plan designed to set the company back on the road to viability.  Let that be clear: that Deputy Lenihan, when Minister for Agriculture, sought a rationalisation plan designed to set the company back on the road to viability.</P>
    <P>A plan came in August 1982.  Its main features were the closure of certain food operations in the Erin Food chain, specifically the Mattersons cannery at <Col N="629" /> Limerick and the East Cork Foods plant at Midleton.  The then Government did not take a decision on the August plan but provided £30 million in early October subject to conditions to be notified later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsequent dissolution of the Dáil and ensuing election precluded the notification of such conditions to the company until February of this year.  The new funding improved matters considerably, of course.  The 1980-81 accounts, published in early 1982, had revealed further losses amounting to £12 million.</P>
      <P>When the present Government were in a position to consider the unfinished business of the Sugar Company's rationalisation plan, they reached the conclusion that it would not be enough to accept closures as they were proposed.  They decided they would have to keep a close eye on the progress being made to achieve viability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly they sought from the company a second rationalisation plan, complementary to the first and prepared in the light of a progress report to be submitted at the same time.  The Government were determined to carry through the task, begun by their predecessors of getting the company back on their feet and into a position where it could generate <Col N="630" /> their own capital for reinvestment and thus ensure their survival.</P>
    <P>Just why it had failed to do that so far is a central issue that is crucial to any realistic consideration of proposals or possibilities for the continuation of the various Sugar Company enterprises.  No one will deny that the food business absorbed the major part of the profits that could have been used in the previous decades for sugar reinvestment.  Of course, that creates much of the problem with which we are confronted.  The Sugar Division itself did not perform as well as it should have.  The Sugar Company annual accounts to the end of September 1982, produced in February of this year, showed a loss of £22 million pounds. While there are special circumstances applying to that loss figure it is patently obvious that the Exchequer could not continue to fund the company without inquiring further into the fundamental causes of the colossal losses being incurred.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear to me, as it is to the company &mdash; as indeed it was to the Opposition when they were on this side of the House &mdash; that State investment in the Sugar Company must be real investment. It cannot just become debt clearance. It must be matched on the ground by a fundamental redirection of the efforts that the company make to register profitability every year.</P>
    <P>As a matter of interest, those sentiments were expressed by a member of the present Opposition when speaking at a meeting of Wexford Committee of Agriculture on 28 September 1981.  I might quote from <i>The Irish Press</i> of Wednesday, 30 September 1981:</P>
    <P>Wexford Fianna Fáil TD Mr. Hugh Byrne has supported the Government's decision to close the Tuam sugar factory&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Government being the National Coalition of the day.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;thereby defying the official party line on the issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne told a meeting of the Wexford Committee of Agriculture that a firm declaration of government's <Col N="631" /> intention to close the Tuam factory within a year would have to be sought.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne claimed that the factory would not have been built in the west of Ireland but for political influence.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Farmers in Wexford grow 22,000 acres of beet every year and that is enough to support a factory on its own, but the factory we should have got went to the west of Ireland instead,&rdquo; he told the meeting.</P>
      <P>The cost of supporting this &ldquo;lame duck operation&rdquo; had now grown too high&rdquo;, he stated.</P>

      <P>Thirty million pounds was put into the company last year.  It was put in essentially for financial reasons: to get the balance sheet right and to point the management in the direction of renewed profitability.  The investment that the company badly needs in improved capacity and plant has been going on with bank finance.  The immediate effect of this new funding is to substitute shareholders' equity capital, which should be serviced in the long-term, for bank debt, which must be serviced on the due date, thereby further increasing losses brought about through heavy interest payments.  The equity injection gives a company a breathing space, time to redirect its energies for a new thrust towards profitability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have got from the company in the last fortnight is a report on their present position and a plan which asseses the prospects for self-sustaining viability in respect of each facet of the company's activities.  It is, as I have said in answer to questions, a long and complicated document &mdash; 65 pages long excluding appendices.  It is being examined by accountants and other staff in my Department and in the Department of Finance. Only when this examination is completed will I be able to draw any conclusions about whether it is a workable blueprint and as to the action to be taken on the foot of it.  Before I put it to the Government I must be convinced that it will lead where it purports to lead.  Ultimately, it is the Government and not the Minister for Agriculture alone, which will take the decisions in regard to the plan.  Deputies can be assured that all known implications, including employment, social and other factors will be fully considered by the Government when coming to their decision.  I repeat my hope that Deputies will use the opportunity afforded by this debate in a constructive and positive way. The plan is the company's plan.  It assumes that the company will have a future.  It recognises that there is considerable scope for further tightening up of the company's operations.  It assumes &mdash; and this is the issue underlying the Opposition's motion &mdash; it assumes that the Tuam factory will be closed after the <Col N="633" /> 1983-84 campaign, in January next.  That is an assumption that is erroneous.  I have an open mind on the matter and so have the Government.</P>

      <P>So far, I have concentrated on the financial aspect of the Sugar Company's affairs.  It is, however, necessary to consider the structural aspects of the sugar industry in Ireland and to set it into its European context.</P>
      <P>Sugar beet is not, as any farmer will tell you, an easy crop to grow.  It makes demands on a farmer's judgment and skill.  It calls for care in sowing, constant attention during the growth period, and rigorous defence against disease and pests.  It calls for heavy investment in machinery, and is particularly demanding of well-prepared soil.  It is a crop which calls for a degree of specialisation if even moderate results are to be obtained.</P>
      <P>Sugar production, however, requires very considerable capital investment and the economies of scale enjoyed by the larger continental factories could rapidly put the Irish industry out of business were it not for the safeguards afforded by the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>This common policy for sugar works to the advantage of our industry.  Generally speaking, our costs by European standards are high.  Evidence given to the Joint Committee in 1980 put production costs per tonne of sugar in other Community factories at 60 to 70 per cent of costs in CSET.  Put the other way round, CSET's production costs were some 50 per cent higher, and that was three years ago. Given the predominance of manufacturing costs in the sugar production chain, this cost disadvantage could ordinarily have priced CSET out of their own market.</P>
      <P>The EEC quota system has, however, so far helped to safeguard our sugar industry in that it penalises production in excess of quota levels, through a system of levies and loss of price support.  However, even these safeguards are not absolute and we must now guard against the real danger that the cost gap between the continental sugar manufacturers and ourselves could make an assault on the Irish market worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot block imports from our EEC partners and I have pinpointed that <Col N="635" /> fact repeatedly in the past four weeks during the course of Question Time. Some people like to think we can put up a protective barrier against imports from our EEC partners.  I do not know if it is a case of deliberate misrepresentation or just pure stupidity.  It is time people got their thinking straightened out with regard to this matter.  We cannot adopt a system of protection.  Our sugar industry is just as vulnerable as the potato or vegetable industry.  There is over-production of sugar in Europe, not to mind the amount of sugar coming in from the ACP countries.  That puts our sugar industry in a very vulnerable position and all of us should be aware of that fact.  If we are non-competitive with regard to sugar we will be up against imports, just as happened in the case of potatoes and vegetables. The sugar industry could suffer the same fate as the vegetable processing industry and that is not an unrealistic or exaggerated risk.  It has happened and could happen again.  The remedy depends on our own efforts and willingness to see and deal with reality.</P>
    <P>Deputies must be aware that the EEC production quotas are due for review at the end of the year.  Needless to say, I will be opposing vigorously any measures which might be to the detriment of the Irish sugar industry.  However, the position remains that we are vulnerable on two fronts &mdash; that of costs and that of quotas.</P>
    <P>It is not just a question of Exchequer money, but of the very survival of beet-growing and refining in Ireland.  This is an area of activity which last season provided a cash return to growers in excess of £50 million and sugar with a cash value of £100 million, together with additional millions in value and revenue from byproduct feedstuffs.  This contribution to the economy is such that it cannot be put in jeopardy and any decision taken in regard to CSET activities has to be viewed in the context of the overall national good.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company have reflected on the position and have decided that they cannot make progress towards viability <Col N="636" /> unless the Tuam operation is discontinued. They have put this point of view to the Government.</P>
    <P>As everybody concerned acknowledges, Tuam is a loss-maker.  Debate hinges around the extent of that loss.  It is put to us that there was an &ldquo;operating loss&rdquo; of £1.4 million for 1981-82, and that this will come down for 1982-83.  Leaving aside the question of what an operating loss is &mdash; it is a concept which the Government's professional accountants find vague &mdash; the problem for the Government is not the figure of £1.4 million. Given the commitments made to meet the cost to the company of continuing with Tuam, the Exchequer has to come up with a figure nearer to £2.5 million. Now, this is not a manufacturing loss, nor is it an operating loss as indicated by the proponents of that idea.  It is a cost penalty. It is the excess cost to the company of producing their sugar requirement in four factories as opposed to producing the same volume in three factories.  This includes not just the specific running loss but also the cost of the weakened productivity at the other factories.</P>
    <P>The Government, as I have said, have no commitment to close Tuam.  They will look at the Sugar Company's proposals in the light of the analysis now being done in the Departments concerned, in the light of all the representations from interested parties that have been received, and will continue to be received.</P>
    <P>They will not on any account be rushed into a decision without having all the relevant data at their disposal.  They will have to consider the growing charge on public funds that subsidising the Tuam operation represents.  For the coming campaign, that will be about £3 million or over £10,000 per annum for every full-time job in the plant.</P>
    <P>They will have to consider whether inefficient use of capacity in the other factories is a risk which will put the industry's long-term future in jeopardy.  They will have to keep their eyes fixed on the profitability of the investment which they are making in the taxpayers' name.  Tasks of these kinds call for reflection and sound judgment, and that is what the Government will bring to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> In conclusion, I wish to state I have no preconceived notions or intentions with regard to the Tuam factory and neither have the Government.  The matter will be examined painstakingly and in depth during the coming weeks and it may be many weeks before a decision is made. The opinion and point of view of all will be taken into account, particularly that of Deputies opposite, the workers involved and the people in the Tuam area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy and the Chair.  I have a lot to say with regard to this matter and I shall try to get in as many points as possible in the time at my disposal.  I was delighted to hear the Minister has not got a closed mind about closure of the Tuam factory.  For a number of years many other people appear to have had closed minds.  It appears to me that for years past Tuam has been doomed and was on the way out but I am not quite sure of the reason.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that in the past 12 months there has been an input of £30 million into the company.  A sum of £46 million has been put into the company since 1978 and it is significant that only £1 million went to Tuam.  Where did the rest of the money go?  Why has Tuam been starved of funds?  The factory was reprieved at one stage by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Lenihan, and I went to see him on the matter with a deputation.  The workers have carried out their undertaking with regard to redundancy and 75 employees have gone. The farmers lived up to their undertaking to increase the beet acreage.  This year their beet acreage was raised by contract to 8,000 acres and, after a big fight, it was raised to 8,500 acres.  There were 1,000 acres still available but it was not given to the farmers of Tuam despite the fact that there were thousands of acres available further south which could not be used because of the bad weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> Why could this extra 1,000 acres not have been planted by farmers around Tuam?  Who is trying to get this factory closed?  Why is it that out of a loss making £22 million only £1.4 million can be attributed to Tuam?  Why not spread the £20.6 million over the other factories and use the same yardstick?  It would be unthinkable for us to abandon our sugar industry.  We are under pressure in regard to prices and ACP imports to the EEC. This has been evident for a long time not only for sugar but for most agricultural products.  A great many of the EEC surpluses are created by imports from third countries, developing countries and countries that need help.  It should not be said that Irish beet growers are responsible for any or all of these problems.</P>
    <P>In the west there are 450 workers directly involved and hundreds of farmers. That part of Galway, not to mention Tuam, revolves around the Sugar Company factory which is under threat yet again.  If the farmers and workers are prepared, and they have shown that they are, to do their jobs to reduce production costs and increase the amount of beet produced so that this will be a more viable proposition, why are they not being encouraged?  Why are they being threatened? Why were they not given more beet acreage this year, particularly at the end of the year when a further 1,000 acres could have been sown in Galway?  This acreage was not given to the farmers of the west despite the fact that it could not be sown down south.  There is something radically wrong here.</P>
    <P>The quota given to us by the EEC is ours, whether we produce it or not.  We have been producing less than the quota for a number of years, but last year we had a record yield because of the good weather.  We have to keep up that quota because if we do not it will be reduced and this will have a detrimental effect not only on Tuam but on sugar production all over the country.</P>
    <P>We hear talk about costs.  It is not a fact that the same numbers are at present working in that edifice between Harcourt Street and Earlsfort Terrace as there were some time ago.  That is one of the most valuable properties in this city.  If <Col N="639" /> the Sugar Company are so hard up, why not put that property on the market and bring the staff where they belong &mdash; down the country?  They should have a hard look to find out why several enterprises under the Sugar Company and Erin Foods closed over the last few years.  The numbers working on the administrative side are no fewer today than they were years ago, and they are costing £6 million annually.  We talk about costs, why not look at those costs?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at these figures.  I know from what he said today that he has not closed his mind, neither has his Minister of State.  His headline in the <i>Tuam Herald</i> last week gave some pointers as to what he thinks is wrong &mdash; he condemned the management.  Listen to this about a factory which has been under threat, under pressure and is being threatened again.  Last year the manager of the Tuam factory was sent to Carlow and he managed the Tuam operations from Carlow.  Try that manoeuvre and see how it will work with any business.  If we close this factory it will cost £5 million in redundancy payments and £1 million for the workers on the dole receiving £50 a week, not to mention those who will no longer be employed on the land.</P>
    <P>In Tuam the packaging of sugar is done by hand.  A machine could be bought for just a few thousand pounds but there is not that sort of money available for the Tuam factory.  Neither can they get the money to update some of their extraction processes, which are running well below what they should be.  These are areas I would like the Minister to take a very hard look at.  He should also get the Sugar Company, as now constituted, to look at these areas too.</P>
    <P>We heard that the Sugar Company recommended the closure of this factory.  Is it not a fact that this vital matter was to be considered before the two vital board members retired and the two new members were appointed?  Is it not true that two votes were taken at that meeting and the figures were six for closing and six for staying open?  The second vote was taken and the vote was the same.  Then one person switched and the vote was seven <Col N="640" /> to five in favour of closure.  The Minister must realise that this was a prejudiced decision and it is asking the Minister to put his head on the block to get the Sugar Company out of their difficulties.</P>
    <P>Suppose there was no Tuam factory? Suppose there were no losses there? What about the losses being made in the other three factories?  Translate that into a western seaboard exercise which has as much of a social content as it has an economic content.  Think of the off-spin and the skills the Sugar Company brought to Tuam?  If this factory is closed we will not have any of these skills in the future.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about job creation. There seems to be no end to the money available to create new jobs, but we should look at the jobs we have and try to retain them, particularly in times of high unemployment, before we go out to the highways and the by-ways looking for doubtful propositions, many of which will close as soon as the grants have been secured and the ten years have elapsed. Then their books will show they have been making a loss from the start.  This makes one wonder why these fly-by-nights set up business here if they have been losing money from the start.  We have to look very hard at this whole area. We are talking about the west and what this closure will do to the morale of the people on the western seaboard where there is unemployment at rates which have not been seen for many generations. We are telling those people how much we are prepared to put into other parts of the sugar industry but which we are not prepared to put into the west.</P>
    <P>Given the opportunity and the cooperation already displayed by the workers and the farmers, and given more research into better methods of planting and new strains of seed based on climatic conditions in the west rather than in the better parts of the east and south, that little unit in Tuam not only can survive but can expand and thrive.  The Minister for Agriculture can do a great deal for these people by ensuring there will be no threat hanging over this enterprise in the coming year and for several years to come.  Give this plant an honest chance <Col N="641" /> and an opportunity to survive.  They will show the Minister and the Sugar Company in particular that they are talking through their hats when they say that they must get rid of the Tuam plant if the company is to remain viable.  If they applied that yardstick to the building in Dublin and the three factories they would close the whole company and everybody would be redundant.  I am not suggesting that that should happen, far from it.  I suggest that we keep Tuam.  The Minister for Agriculture is the voice on whom we depend to ensure that this factory is kept open, that they are given the opportunity to produce more beet, which they are prepared to do, and that the workers be given the opportunity to reduce their numbers so that the costs will be reduced accordingly.  They should be given some instruction from the laboratory in Carlow, based on what best suits the west, or indeed on new methods of planting.  I thank Deputy Kitt for his courtesy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Noonan, on the motion which he has proposed.  Having listened to the Minister, I am disappointed that there is still a cloud of uncertainty, even though the Minister says that he has an open mind over the future of Tuam factory.  I was also disappointed with the amendment which he proposed, requesting Dáil Éireann to support the Government in their efforts to secure the future of the sugar industry on a viable basis.  We do not know what those efforts are, because the amendment is so vague.  I was hopeful that we would have something more definite from the Minister.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Noonan has said, we are talking about 430 jobs &mdash; 230 full-time and 200 part-time.  The Tuam factory has given a good contribution to the State and those people now working there deserve a definite answer from this Government.  It was set up in 1934, when the sod was turned by Eamon de Valera. It was set up, not solely to make a profit, but to promote regional development and create employment in the west, as was stated very clearly by Seán Lemass in 1933.  He said then regarding the beet crop for the sugar factory:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> It will be a cash crop for farmers and indirectly create new business for quite a number of industries.</P>
    <P>Those words are very true today.  Sugar beet is a cash crop and in the Tuam area the company have been a great help in setting up other industries, particularly the small industries.  It has given great skills and enterprise to those who have worked in the factories.  The social reasons are as valid today as they were in 1934.  I am glad to hear tonight that the Minister intends to visit Tuam.  He will be pleased at the production unit there because for its size it is very good.  It lacks the capital investment of the other factories and that is one matter on which I would be critical.  The Minister will be pleased at what he sees in Tuam.</P>
    <P>When, in 1981, we heard again that the closure of Tuam was being considered, the workers decided that they must play their part in improving the situation. They adopted a plan at the time which contained three elements &mdash; firstly, to increase the acreage of beet to 10,000 acres; secondly, to make an application for capital equipment and thereby reduce the losses; thirdly, to reduce the work force by 50 over three years.  I would like to spell out some of the details of those three submissions which were made. They set up a special committee comprised of representatives of ACOT and of farming and sugar personnel and the results were as follows: 1981, 4,600 acres of beet; 1982, 6,950; and in 1983, when they were hoping for 10,000 acres, they were not allowed that but were given a figure of 8,500 acres.  On the capital application for sugar packaging equipment and sugar extraction equipment, the arguments obviously were not understood or listened to by the Sugar Company because they were refused.  On the question of the work force, I should like to point out what has been achieved there.  By the end of 1983 the permanent work force in Tuam will have fallen by 90 and that will save CSET £900,000. This has been achieved by natural wastage, early retirement and non-replacement of workers and has been done without any friction.  Indeed, it has led to <Col N="643" /> greater productivity.  In 1982 the production costs increased by a mere 3 per cent, which was by far the lowest in the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that I have raised some questions in the last few weeks concerning Tuam sugar factory, in particular that of the operating loss.  I still cannot understand why the Minister will not accept the £1.4 million operating loss. That figure has been agreed by the head office of CSET.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just operating loss. It is the cost penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about the operating loss.  I will be very glad if he will now accept that figure.  It was accepted by the head office of the Sugar Company.  I know that, as the Minister says, there is a difference between that and cost penalty. If the Minister is talking about interest charges, roll up interest over a certain number of years, he should in fairness go back to 1934 and take the situation from there.  He should look at the contribution made since then by the Tuam factory and the profit made over those years.</P>
      <P>On the question of £30 million advanced to the Sugar Company by the Minister for Agriculture of the time, Deputy Lenihan, I have not received from the Minister at Question Time in the past few weeks an answer to my question as to why not one penny of that £30 million was advanced to Tuam.  In correspondence between the Department of Agriculture and the CSET, when Deputy Lenihan was Minister there was a certain commitment by the Fianna Fáil Government to keep Tuam open and that some of that money would be spent there.  I quote from a letter from the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture to Mr. Sheehy, stating in the last paragraph:</P>
      <P>Apart from the commitment by the Government to keep the Tuam sugar factory in operation, there is no other commitment of a non-commercial nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a definite commitment to Tuam, and the Minister of State must tell us why those conditions were subsequently <Col N="644" /> altered in a letter dated 15 February, 1983.  At Question Time in the last few weeks the Minister quoted the contents of that letter.</P>
    <P>Coalition Governments in the past, even that of 1981, have handled the question of Tuam in a very insensitive manner. In 1981 there was a breakdown in communication between the Minister of Agriculture of the time, Deputy Dukes, and Deputy Connaughton as to what was happening, as to whether Tuam was even going to be discussed on the agenda of the CSET.  We eventually heard that Tuam would get a year's reprieve, which was really an announcement that the Government intended to close down Tuam.  Everybody at the time accepted that it was no concession at all to the Tuam sugar factory.  There was uncertainty, the farmers could not invest in machinery and the workers did not know how they were going to bring about their rationalisation plans or voluntary redundancies.</P>
    <P>We want a definite answer from the Government now.  The Minister said, in concluding, that it may take some time and it would have to be discussed by various Ministers, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and the Cabinet.  How long more can this cloud of uncertainty remain over the Tuam sugar factory?  There has been much talk about the Oireachtas Committee which reported on the Sugar Company, of which the Minister was a member.  That committee stated very clearly that, even though they recommended the closing of Tuam, there was no way in which Tuam would be closed until full alternative employment was provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate I made it clear that the main motivation for this Bill was one which sought to terminate the board solely on political grounds and without any stated reason as to impropriety of behaviour by members or inefficiency of work.  That creates a serious precedent.  If that is to be the standard of administration of future Governments it is a totally wrong development.  Successive Governments, have always respected appointments made to boards by previous Governments. There were occasions when for stated reasons a Government had to remove a member or members of a board.  That happened on one occasion in the case of RTE when the Government of which I was a member had a conflict of opinion on a principle concerning the operation of section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.  On that occasion because the board and the Government did not see eye to eye the board terminated their operations.  That was for an open, stated reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case it is clear that the Government's only motivation is that the board <Col N="646" /> presided over by Mr. Justice Murnaghan was appointed by a Fianna Fáil Government. At no stage in the course of various statements made by the Minister since the decision was announced has he uttered one word of criticism of the board or members.  The precedent created by him is highly undesirable.  The Minister is only playing games and not tackling the real problem which is lack of technical and administrative staff in An Bord Pleanála.  The solution to the delays in dealing with planning appeals, lies in that area.  In the Minister's speech, by implication, he makes it clear that his Department regard these administrative difficulties as being the main blockage to dealing with appeals.</P>
    <P>What prompted the motion was that until last Thursday the two Whips appeared to have reached agreement. That was the whole purpose of the decision made in the House.  This legislation was to be introduced in the House and processed by agreement between the Whips.  That was the case until last Thursday. For some extraordinary reason the negotiations between the Whips broke down and the decision was made by the Government to bulldoze this legislation through&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with consequent guillotine provisions which will have to be introduced by them.  What is it all for? What is the motivation of the Government other than to cloud over the issue and seek by innuendo to make the case that in some way this board is associated with the delay in the backlog of appeals and that there is something wrong with it because it was appointed by Fianna Fáil? This raises serious issues of public policy. In his legislation, Mr. Tully decided to have a High Court judge presiding over this tribunal.  Now this is being withdrawn. It adds up to a sordid story not least because it is being introduced by a Government supposed to be concerned about Dáil reform and expediting the work of parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a Government that does not recognise there are certain elementary facts in <Col N="647" /> connection with parliamentary work. One is that you make the Whips system work effectively.  If you cannot rely on the Whips to come together and order the business of the House in a sensible way and so avoid the scenes we had today then one of the most basic facts of Dáil work is completely ignored.  The most effective way to have Dáil reform is to have effective consultation between the Whips and a greater acceptance both by the Government and Opposition of the decisions they make.</P>
    <P>There is ample scope for Dáil reform in having matters of immediacy raised here and having a certain time for discussion instead of the daily wrangle we have with the Ceann Comhairle which I deplore.  It happens because there is no scope for immediacy of debate on matters which we are anxious to raise in the public interest.  We find ourselves frustrated by a combination of Dáil orders and you, a Cheann Comhairle, are constrained and restrained by Dáil order and procedure and the non-allocation of Government time for such matters to be discussed. These practical areas of Dáil reform are not tackled.</P>
    <P>We have a lot of talk about committees. They will not expedite the work of the House but will clog it up.  We have the kind of scene on the Order of Business and the kind of scene which is giving rise to this legislation which has no urgency or motivation except to have a crack at Fianna Fáil and no reason for its existence except that the Minister, in a moment of euphoria, decided to have a go at Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We should have respect for ourselves and conduct our business properly instead of appointing fake committees, bringing in fake legislation and concentrating on the politics of cosmetics instead of on the politics of reality.

I am proud to have been a member of several Fianna Fáil Governments which followed Coalition Governments who made changes into the dead hour of night within minutes of departing and we did not change a single judge or a single board member appointed in that dubious manner, on the principle that the previous democratic Government were entitled to make appointments up to the end of their term of office.</P>

      <P>We have seen today Fianna Fáil blocking a measure introduced to this House to bring in the nonpolitical selection of members of the Planning Board.  When the Planning Board were originally established it was precisely to achieve that sort of independence. There was a feeling that in the interpretation of who should have permission in specific cases it was necessary that independence be guaranteed.  It is regrettable to see Fianna Fáil blocking a measure to bring a greater independence to planning decisions and to restore public confidence in the decision-making process in regard to planning appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy argued earlier that there was an organised campaign to depoliticise the planning process.  He argued that the reason for this organised <Col N="650" /> campaign was to undermine the role of local public representatives who decide on development plans.  I would argue precisely the opposite.  This Bill is in no way designed to interfere with local public representatives in their role in setting development plans.  Rather the purpose of this Bill is to see that in the observance of those development plans as published by the elected representatives there is entire independence.  It is copper-fastening the democracy of our planning process.</P>
    <P>It would be a political ostrich who did not recognise that public confidence has been undermined in the operation of the planning system during the past couple of years.  Much of this has been due to the method in existing law of selecting the members of the Planning Board.  The board proposed in this Bill is a tremendous step forward in the area of independence in the planning process.</P>
    <P>I fail to see the argument advanced earlier by Deputy Lenihan that the change-over from the present structure of the board could be construed as bringing in a board whose decisions might not be beyond reproach.  Far from this, the fact that the selection procedure for the chairman is to be based on the procedure used for the selection of the Director of Public Prosecutions will increase public confidence and ensure beyond all doubt that the position will be beyond reproach.</P>
    <P>Equally I cannot see the argument against the method of selection of members of that board.  The Bill will give a role to competent and experienced persons with a long-established record of working in the area of planning and brings in on a statutory basis all the interests affected.  This will bring greater independence to the operations of the Planning Board and ensure that in the public eye it is entirely beyond reproach.  I cannot see how the argument could be put forward that the present system would be better.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the Opposition's blocking of this Bill is that in doing so they are blocking important reforms that would speed up the procedure in planning appeals.  The sort of provisions contained in the Bill which <Col N="651" /> have not yet got much attention in the comments coming from the other side are that the chairman of the board will be given explicit responsibility to ensure the efficient operation of the board, and the board are to be required to review their operations and put through reforms to shorten the period which it takes to settle appeals.  The board will also bring in a system to deal with vexatious appeals and recommendations generally to speed up the process.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how Fianna Fáil can express concern for the needs of the building and construction industry, as they have on several occasions in this Dáil session, and at the same time block one of the single unanimous demands of the building industry in the past two years to do something about An Bord Pleanála and the way they have been operating. Contained in the Bill are many important provisions that have been welcomed by the building industry.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to some of the substantive issues in the Bill.  In section 16 it is very welcome that the board are being given new power to dismiss vexatious appeals.  In the past the board have had to proceed to ultimate determination of such appeals even if they believe that the reason for putting in the appeal was groundless.  It is welcome that that is being changed.  However, there will be a problem about deciding what is vexatious, and I am concerned that because of the way the provision is framed that the board will be empowered to dismiss appeals, it may mean in practice that very few vexatious appeals will be turned out. In reality it is easy to put in some minor objection that could be construed as substantive in some way to cloud over what would otherwise be vexatious.  Either there will be a need for the Minister to publish some sort of guidelines as to what will be regarded as vexatious or without foundation, or it might be possible to rephrase this section in order to enable the board to satisfy themselves before proceeding that an appeal is not vexatious. That may appear to be only a change of words, but it would change the emphasis significantly so that the board <Col N="652" /> would proceed only with cases when they believe there is good ground.  That could probably mean that this important power would be used more often.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is very welcome because the Minister is giving the board power to put a time limit on the submission of evidence by various parties to the appeal.  It is well known that it has been difficult for the board to get compliance with requests for information within a reasonable time, and appeals have dragged on.  However, I submit that the Minister should give attention to one matter when all the parties are agreed, that is, that the board themselves should operate within a time limit.  Because of their judicial function the board cannot be given quite as stringent a time limit as the local authorities, who have two months.  I would suggest a limit of six months for the board's operations. If that would be too stringent in some cases, the Minister could provide for extensions, on application to him, when the board could state their reasons for being unable to reach a decision before six months.  Perhaps it could be extended beyond the six months if agreement is arrived at between the parties.  In a Bill that puts the onus on the parties to the appeal to present their evidence within a period, equally there should be an onus on the board to come to an end of their deliberations in a certain time.</P>
    <P>In section 19 it is welcome to note that the board will be given the authority to confine themselves to conditions when an appeal is brought before them contesting just one of the conditions.  The board are now enabled to confine themselves to that restricted area rather than reopening the whole appeal.</P>
    <P>Having welcomed that, I can see a problem in the operation of the board generally, that is, in the balance between the political and judicial roles.  Under our present system we have a decision on a development plan which is undoubtedly democratic because the councillors decide upon it, it is laid open to the public and objections are heard and discussed by the councillors before final adoption. It seems that under present law the board have a somewhat wider role than simply interpreting the provisions of a specific <Col N="653" /> development plan, and it is right that there should be a possibility to look at a certain application in a wider planning horizon than would be considered by a single local authority, certainly in Dublin where you have a number of authorities very close together.  There is no doubt the planning authority should have an over-seeing role so that they could look at the implications of certain development plans not just for their immediate area but outside.</P>
    <P>In the exercise of this wider authority the board will have, it is important, if we are to ensure openness of the procedure, that some reforms should be made in the way the board will operate.  In particular, I should like the Minister to consider whether the inspectors' reports in the case of planning applications decided by the board should be published.  For a long time the board have given their reasons for refusing permissions but not for granting them.  A board that hold that authority should comply with the need to give the public full access to the reasons for their decisions.  That is especially important in cases in which the board might decide to act contrary to the reports of the inspectors.  The opportunity should be taken to consider more openness in the manner in which An Bord Pleanála will conduct their procedure, namely, in the publishing of the reports.  I suggest also that more publicity should be given to oral hearings.  At present oral hearings conducted by the board are notified to the parties but there is not a general onus on the board to make it known to persons affected that the hearing will take place. I have seen many cases in which interested parties discovered only too late that there would be an oral hearing and they did not get the chance to attend.</P>
    <P>Returning to the question of the political role in the planning process, it is regrettable that at the moment the Minister can intervene in planning decisions only by giving directives of a general nature.  He can lay down broad principles on which planning authorities and the planning board should make their decisions. In some cases where a planning application would have a bearing on <Col N="654" /> national policy I can see the need for the Minister to have power to call in that application and issue advice to the board. That power is not in our present law.  I can visualise cases where it would be necessary.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency there is a planning application of major importance. Many of the points raised in the application are not purely of a planning nature. It is regrettable that the consideration given to that planning application at all stages was confined to purely planning matters and the broader issues of national policy were not taken into account.  I urge the Minister to consider taking power to call in a planning application in special circumstances and to consider it on grounds of national policy.  Of course it would be a requirement that, if he gives advice to the board, he will also arrange full publication of the grounds for his advice.  That would be a significant improvement on the present position.</P>
    <P>I should like to express concern over a recent decision which may not be entirely relevant to this Bill.  I refer to a decision made recently on the right of a person to have services provided in a case where a sewerage pipe or a service line is running through his land.  There are many green belts around development areas such as the green belts around the city of Dublin. Inevitably, they must have sewerage services and water services running through people's land.  It is worrying that the continuing existence of green belts may be threatened if such decisions are upheld.  Planning authorities could be required to give permission to applications on green belts by virtue of the fact that a sewerage pipe ran through the green belt.  It might be worth our while to consider that issue when a Planning Bill is being considered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It will go a long distance towards restoring public confidence in planning.  It will also go a long way towards allaying many of the justifiable concerns of all involved about the very lengthy delays in the procedures of the planning board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate to support my colleagues who <Col N="655" /> have already spoken.  I support Deputy Molloy's amendment which proposes that Dáil Éireann refuses a Second Reading to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1983, on a number of listed grounds.  I support the reasons for that proposed refusal and I want to add quite a number of other reasons why Dáil Éireann should not be engaged in a naked political cosmetic exercise.  While the previous speaker had to speak in support of the Bill as introduced by the Minister, he concluded by saying that there were times when he believed the Minister should call in a file or an application in the public interest. There are many issues on which the public interest has to be served and can be served only by the elected representatives of this House.</P>
      <P>This afternoon we had exchanges which could have been avoided.  A Cheann Comhairle, I had a good deal of sympathy for you in a situation in which it became obvious that the Government were bereft of business, bereft of legislation, and bereft of the urgent legislation which the country needs at present.  For seven months, they have been paying lip service to Dáil reform.  The exchanges were forced on us because the Government saw fit to introduce a Bill as a naked political cosmetic exercise to pretend Fianna Fáil had created something while in Government which they now wish to get rid of and, by doing so, they would improve the whole area of planning and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Physical planning is of immense importance. It must obviously take account of the economic, social and environmental circumstances pertaining in the area. Who are better equipped to serve the people than the elected representatives who have to face the electorate at regular intervals?  I was a Member of this House in 1976 when we spent many weeks &mdash; not 25½ hours &mdash; on a Bill.  With hindsight I wonder have planning and development improved since to any noticeable extent? There are delays.  Deputy Molloy went to great extremes to point out where the delays occur, and that the removal of this board and their replacement by a new <Col N="656" /> board, by whatever means, will not make one iota of difference to the delaying factor.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy went to great pains to outline the fact that the delays are probably of the order of 12 months in many cases.  This is dreadful; because these delays affect projects and they affect employment.  The alteration of this board was started when the Minister disgracefully attacked the board as being the whole cause of the problem.  He knows that one of the main factors is the shortage of staff, and successive Governments must take some responsibility for that. Another factor is lack of co-operation. There has been need for a long time for greater emphasis on co-operation in the interests of orderly planning and development.</P>
    <P>Where does planning start?  It starts at local authority level.  We have all been dissatisfied with planning decisions by local authorities, whichever way the decision went and for whatever reason. Since 1963 many representatives at local level have served on planning committees of their own authorities.  The vast majority of them have acted in an honest and honourable way.  There have been abuses and there have been misuses of this function on occasions.  Whatever system is used there is room for abuse or misuse.</P>
    <P>What we are doing here is purely a whitewashing exercise.  The Minister is using the public relations people the Government use so well.  Neither of the Ministers across the House from me was in this Chamber in the period from 1973 to 1977.  Many times we charged the Coalition Government with going to great pains to use public relations exercises as a substitute for good government. How they failed was evidenced by the result in 1977.</P>

      <P>Thank you for your protection, a Cheann Comhairle.  It is difficult to deal with people who know they are working for purely cosmetic purposes. It started a long time ago.  Deputy McLoughlin knows far more than I do about local planning and he made strenuous efforts on behalf of his constituents over the years to make sure they were successful in their planning applications. He was correct in making those efforts provided he approached planning in a fair-minded way.  Most of us are prepared to do that but there are exceptions.  Of course there is a balancing factor that, when the next election comes, they have to face the public who will have the opportunity of saying whether&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they are satisfied with the way public representatives <Col N="658" /> performed their duty.  The Minister of State may not like what I am saying but he knows from his profession, when he served on planning committees in the city and county, that there were times perhaps when there was a clash of interests and he had to stand back from a decision. He knows, as a public representative, that he put his elected position before his professional status on behalf of his clients.  I compliment him for that and I see nothing wrong with it.</P>
      <P>This is pure, naked political placing of blame where no blame lies.  Removing a board and replacing it with another is bureaucracy gone mad and is taking the function further and further away from those who know more about the physical, economic, environmental and social needs of an area.  This is terribly dangerous because some of those nominating bodies have vested interests that may not be to the advantage of people in some constituencies.  I suspect we may end up with the creation of a very dangerous board.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy outlined our party's position at present and what it would be if we were returned to office &mdash; and, for the country's sake, the sooner that happens the better.  Why are we discussing this Bill?  It is because there is no other legislation to debate.  Where is the Rents Tribunal Bill?  The Minister of State talked an awful lot about it when he was on this side of the House.  That legislation is urgently needed in cities throughout the country where thousands of people are frightened of the consequences of court decisions because of the Supreme Court decision a few years ago.  That is what we should be discussing today.  We are discussing this Bill and pretending that nominations by Fianna Fáil on to a Board have created an unfair body to decide on planning appeals.  That is so far removed from the truth that it makes a joke of what this House stands for.  I should like to ask the Minister for the Environment if the Rents Restrictions Act will be brought in before the recess as it would be disgraceful if it was not brought in before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also be discussing pay agreements which are so vital to the <Col N="659" /> needs of the country.  I accepted your ruling on my Private Notice Question because of the events of recent days but I should like the Government to spell out their policies clearly.</P>
    <P>The Minister was contradictory in his speech.  He is dismantling a board and removing a High Court Judge and members, but with regard to oral appeals, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Moreover, experience has shown that the Board has not abused the power to refuse an oral hearing and that it has not applied excessively harsh standards: under successive Ministers, only a relatively small proportion of all cases in which oral hearing applications were refused resulted in directions by the Minister to the Board to hold an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very critical of the board in his public comments but, in respect of oral hearings, he compliments them.  It is unusual, especially coming from a Labour Minister, to see men being fired because, allegedly they were appointed by another Government.  My colleagues have gone into the dangers which will result from this exercise.  I took office in March 1982 on the day after a chief executive officer had been appointed to the new Youth Employment Agency.  The agency members had been appointed a week earlier and there was an outcry because the agency had not been given the opportunity of appointing the chief executive officer.  They said it had been done by the Minister for Labour although he had been appointed before I took office.  I supported the appointment in the interests of the agency.  We now have a Minister for the Environment who, for political reasons, has fired a board.  Imagine a leader of a Labour Party hiring and firing in that manner.  I ask him to withdraw this, not to let it go to the House.  I can see my way to supporting a few minor amendments in it provided the objectionable ones are removed.  Planning problems start at local authority level and there is an inconsistency about decisions from, first of all, <Col N="660" /> within the county itself, as Deputy McLoughlin knows.  Many a row he had in County Meath.</P>

Inconsistencies can apply to decisions within an area, within a county or within a local authority administrative area or between local authority and local authority.  Delays can occur as was outlined today by Deputy Molloy, the average given by him as being probably three months.  We have longer delays, technically at An Bord Pleanála level, not by the board but by the bureaucrats, the planning inspector, the administrative officer or whoever it is.  Let us rid ourselves of those blockages, those problems, and streamline what must be done where they are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the measure on which you ruled this evening, Sir &mdash; I am not referring to your ruling because I am sure you would rule me out of order &mdash; I refer to the advantage that has been taken of it by the Minister, &ldquo;at a certain date, 8 June, subject to agreement by the Whips&rdquo;. There is no doubt that that means &ldquo;on 8 June or such other date as would be agreeable to the Whips&rdquo;.  It has for long been accepted practice in this House that that is the case.  I remember when you, Sir, were on this side of the House you <Col N="661" /> insisted that if a Tuesday date, a Wednesday date or a Thursday date was being named, such a date or any other date was subject to agreement by the Whips.  The clear interpretation of that is that it is 8 June if it is agreed by the Whips and if it is not agreed it is such other date as is agreed by the Whips that the measure is taken.</P>

      <P>The Minister has embarrassed the Chair but as well as that he has introduced a dangerous precedent here whereby it will be more difficult in future to get agreement on when measures will be taken.  There are more important measures that we should be discussing, the most important being the rents tribunal, the next probably is the pay mess that has been created because of lack of action by various Government Ministers.  We should be discussing these before the recess.  We have 200,000 unemployed.  All these are issues of real urgency and this would be urgent if it were to contribute one iota to the speeding up of planning applications or decisions but it will not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to try to confuse the House.  I appreciate that he also must use the people appointed to the GIS, and they are many.  They must be used by this Government just as the 1973-77 Government used them so cleverly with so little success.  The Minister has appointed more people and probably he thinks because of that that he will be more successful. The facade is being seen through more quickly because he set out to discredit a board for political reasons, although replacement by any other board, however constituted, will make no difference to the speeding up.  The need for additional staff or perhaps a change of authority to whom the staff may be responsible, and ensuring co-operation at all levels, within that Department, between that Department and the board and at all levels of the Department and of the board are the <Col N="663" /> stumbling blocks that must be overcome.

      <P>Not at my invitation. The Minister would be doing the House, his party and himself a favour if <Col N="664" /> he withdrew this measure and sought our support for measures that would make a meaningful contribution such as the section covering vexatious appeals or the frivolous objectors we have all encountered and which have cost a lot of money. There is need for improvement there and I would support such measures.  Another matter in need of improvement is the question of appeals against conditions.  I have an open mind as far as oral hearings are concerned and if the Minister says the section that relates to that is needed I will not cavil at that view.</P>
      <P>The major sections, 5 and 7, do nothing to speed up decisions of the board.  The Minister almost said that it was a political exercise to scrap the board and reappoint different membership when, in the course of his speech, he said:</P>
      <P>On assuming office, I decided to press ahead with the general review of planning law which had already been started in my Department.  However it quickly became apparent that the problem of delays in determining planning appeals and the growing backlog of appeals required urgent consideration. In addition to this it became evident that there was increasing public concern about the method of appointment to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>There was no such public concern until the Minister embarked on his press campaign to malign the chairman and the honourable members of the board. While I was a member of Government we did not make a bad appointment to any board.  We examined each appointment carefully whether it was to An Bord Pleanála or any other board.  The suitability of each appointment was considered.</P>

      <P>The day before I assumed office in March 1982 the Minister for Labour, a member of the Labour Party, appointed a chief executive to the Youth Employment Agency.  A short time after the general election that same <Col N="665" /> Minister appointed the members of the agency and some of those appointed disputed the Minister's power to appoint a chief executive.  If the Minister for the Environment was in my shoes and followed his procedure he would have fired that chief executive on assuming office. I did not adopt that course because it was not the honourable thing to do.  A Minister in a caretaking capacity saw fit to make the appointment the day before he left office but I was prepared to stand over it.  We should contrast that with the situation we are faced with now.  This amounts to a naked political exercise to prove that the board cannot be tainted by public representatives.</P>
      <P>At a time when public representatives are taking a lot of criticism, this type of decision-making is not helping.  Surely an elected Government, irrespective of who is in power, are entitled to make their appointments provided those concerned are suitably qualified even if they are party supporters.  If the Minister wishes to make his appointments and if the people are suitably qualified and are Labour Party supporters he is entitled to make them.  I do not say that Fianna Fáil is the only party with members capable of acting on boards.  Provided those appointed are suitable I have no objection to the Minister making appointments but I am not happy that the major function of planning, which is extremely important in the physical, environmental, social and economic development of Cork, Kerry, Tipperary, and other countries, be given over to a group of people nominated by various agencies.  The function of appointing such people is best left to the elected Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is seeking to undermine the competency and commitment of those asked to serve on many State boards.  Many people have given a lot of their time to act on such boards and, perhaps, lost money also but they did so because they felt that they could make a worthwhile contribution.  This exercise by the Minister is an optical one to give the impression that the Government are better than those who went before them and will appoint a board that will not make an incorrect decision.  So many <Col N="666" /> matters must be taken into consideration in regard to planning that it is hard to say a decision is the correct one.  Certainly decisions are not acceptable to everybody. That problem will face the new board as it faced Governments in the past.  Replacing the existing board will not speed up the delays.  We are all anxious to eliminate the backlog and speed up the process so that developments are not delayed or postponed indefinitely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has nothing to commend it in relation to what could be regarded as the more important sections.  The Minister should withdraw sections 5 and 7 and we can see the possibility of giving support to some of the sections that are regarded as the less important ones but which are of greater importance in relation to expediting decisions in the whole planning area.  The Government are very divided in relation to this measure and some Members are funding it very hard to accept that you can have a Minister for the Environment who is prepared to fire members of the board who have contributed well and have given their commitment over a period to planning decisions.  They are also concerned about whether the new form of board appointments will make one iota of difference.  I have outlined where the strangleholds are, where the delays occur and where they can be improved.  It does not matter to the previous Minister whether it is the board which is there at present or the new board, because if the other problems are not taken out of the way there will be no change in the speed with which decisions will be handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all experienced difficulties and delays and we have known of employment being affected because of frivolous objections being made.  Very often those are not sustained and they certainly cause unnecessary delays.  This often means that projects do not go ahead.  The Minister endeavoured in a very weak way to say in his speech today that the board did their best and that they <Col N="667" /> did a very good job in relation to the old hearings.  In public debate all along he seems to have been critical of them.  I suspect that he has been advised by those people in the public relations grouping that surround the Government how he should handle this so expertly to create a climate abroad that there is need for the change he is proposing.  When he introduces it there is a great heralding of it.  I suggest that people have seen through that facade.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that there are great reservations among the Minister's colleagues in government about how good or successful a measure this Bill is.  I suggest that he withdraws the sections we particularly object to and then we can see our way to having a new look at this Bill. The delays can be put right.  Deputy Molloy outlined week by week this evening how the 12 months delay is arrived at. The Minister should admit that this is the true situation.  I want him to confirm to me what he obviously did with a nod of the head, that the most urgent legislation from his Department would be that establishing rent tribunals which would give some peace of mind and some relief to the many elderly sufferers in every city in the country who are worried about what effect their appearance in court will have.  I want the Minister to tell me that the rent tribunals Bill is ready and that we will have it before the recess.  We would be far better employed putting that legislation through the House than going through the cosmetics we appear to be going through in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>We will have other opportunities to discuss this rents tribunal legislation and I do not want to delay the time of the House.  I again appeal to the Minister to withdraw this Bill and take it back for reconsideration.  Let the Minister bring the rents tribunal legislation before the House, as promised, before the summer recess; let us go into that in detail, streamline it to the best possible advantage to all our constituents, particularly those living in the city areas who are suffering so much mental anguish at the present time, and we will be doing this house and the country a far greater <Col N="668" /> service than jumping in with controversial measures like the Bill we are now discussing, abusing &mdash; whatever side are in Government and whatever side are in Opposition &mdash; the phrase &ldquo;Subject to agreement between the Whips&rdquo;.  This has been breached on this occasion.  This could be a bad precedent and could be disastrous for the orderly procedures of the House and for ordering business in a normal way where the Whips co-operation, in government and in opposition, is of such vital necessity.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment moved today by Deputy Molloy which outlined some of the reasons why Dáil Éireann should refuse a Second Reading to this Bill.  I mentioned a few of the reasons.  We have heard a lot of talk about the man who got away from court a few days ago, about Dáil reform and about committees.  Some of those committees have been set up and some of them still have to be set up.  They will all reform Dáil procedures.  We agreed to participate in a committee on marital breakdown but no sooner had we reached that agreement than the Tánaiste, with great public acclaim, called a press conference and said: &ldquo;This is our stance in respect of it&rdquo;.  I do not deny him his entitlement to do that nor do I deny his party's entitlement to do that.  But it seems odd that different parties in the House are meeting in committee on a particular subject and the Tánaiste makes this statement.  It is obvious that the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach are not agreeing in relation to that as well as on many other issues.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to one of the reasons listed by Deputy Molloy and Deputy Ahern in submitting the amendment. I refer to grounds (iii) which state:</P>
    <P>It pre-empts the deliberations of the Joint Committee on Building Land which under its orders of reference is required <i>inter alia</i> to examine the operations of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1982 which are to be construed as one with the enactment of the Bill and thereby undermines the committee system of the Houses.</P>
    <P>Is it not ludicrous to think that an agreement <Col N="669" /> is reached and the orders of reference are set down in relation to setting up a committee on a very controversial issue and then this Bill is brought into the House?  The controversial issue is basically the Kenny Report, which has been kicked about by everybody for so long, some claiming that parts of it are unconstitutional. That is basically what we are talking about.  Built into the orders of reference is consideration of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963-1982; but just as that committee has got off the ground, chaired by Deputy Molloy, a Bill is introduced amending these Acts.  One could ask why should that be included in the orders of reference of the committee.  It is part of a public relations exercise and Dáil reform.  As everybody in this House knows, despite all we have heard about Dáil reform &mdash; the Minister responsible is abroad somewhere at present &mdash; we are still far removed from being able to raise relevant issues here, relevant to the day, to the week, to the specific period.  We would be so much better employed discussing, say, the Rents Tribunal, the figures for the unemployed, methods of improving the employment situation, the mayhem existing at present in relation to pay, the crime situation, the situation with regard to drugs abuse and, as I have said, the person who jumped from custody at lunchtime on a recent day.  Those are items we should be discussing before this recess, items much more urgent and relevant than firing a board for purely political reasons which, by the way, it is contended will eliminate all the problems existing with regard to planning.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is in regard to section 9 &mdash; superannuation of members of the board.  I might well read the relevant paragraph from the explanatory memorandum:</P>
    <P>This section contains provisions in relation to the preparation by the Minister of a superannuation scheme in respect of the chairman and ordinary members of the Board, and enables the Minister to make a scheme for the granting of gratuities to persons who cease office by virtue of section 10.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> That paragraph of that explanatory memorandum will always be a grave embarrassment to the Minister, particularly as a member of the Labour Party.  He feels he has a problem, it is a political one, he thinks, and he wants to buy them out in the old hire and fire style.</P>

      <P>The debate today has been like American television with all the interruptions heralded by the quorum bells.  It has not had much continuity.  The speeches of the three Fianna Fáil Deputies so far have been of a somewhat similar trend, with three main themes.  They have not given good reasons for their opposition to this Bill.  I hope to elaborate more on that later.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say there has been general public dissatisfaction with our planning laws and with An Bord Pleanála.  It has proved to be an unworkable board to date, unsatisfactory with interminable delays occurring with regard to planning appeals.  I should not like to think that the establishment of this board would herald a situation in which planning appeals would be bulldozed through. However, I do not think that will happen because there are precautions taken in its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil speakers, particularly Deputy Lenihan, have been preoccupied with the removal of the judge from the position of chairman and one judge about whose removal Deputy Lenihan was most annoyed.  It should be remembered that that judge is retired; I think he is in his seventies.  It must be remembered also, that there is a terrible problem obtaining in our courts with delays in cases coming to the courts, especially the High Court.  Much of the judges' time is spent chairing tribunals, special inquiries and so on.  Indeed appointing a High Court judge for the purpose of having him chairman of An Bord Pleanála seems to be a waste of time and talent, particularly with so many people experiencing <Col N="671" /> hardship, loss of money and the opportunity of having their cases heard, with some of them having to wait three to four years for their cases to come up in court. I do not think it at all essential to have a judge chairman of this board.  Neither do I think that the appointments should be of academics or quasi-academics with too much weight on the civil service aspect, it needs to be a balanced board.  At present we have one of the best teams of Ministers ever to be appointed to the Department of the Environment.  They are commencing at the very top and working their way downwards, reorganising the whole system.  I hope what they are attempting to do with regard to the appointment of this planning board will filter throughout the whole system of planning so that we shall have more efficient planning at every level throughout the country.  I am delighted that so much time has been spent researching the provisions of this Bill, this area of the environment, that they have devoted so much attention and taken such care to ensure the board is workable, independent, honest and respected.  Their serious approach to their work is reflected in the contents of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There have been some extraordinary decisions taken by An Bord Pleanála in recent years.  I shall not attempt to apportion blame.  I suppose there were diverse reasons such decisions were taken.  However, what puzzles me is why Fianna Fáil are so worried about this Bill.  Deputy Gene Fitzgerald appeared to say, in effect, that when they are in office they will appoint their members, or that when Labour are in office they will appoint their members, that when we are in office we appoint ours to the board and that that is all right.  The same theme ran through Deputy Molloy's remarks.  I do not understand why Fianna Fáil are so worried about the so-called de-politicising of this board.  Perhaps it hits a power base.  As Deputy Molloy suggested, I do not think there are hidden reasons for the introduction for this Bill but that there are reasons they should be worried about the establishment of this board.</P>
    <P>There could be a conflict of interest in <Col N="672" /> the board.  For example, there will be an appointee from the Confederation of Irish Industry and from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I should imagine that appointees of those bodies would look after their interests.  Perhaps the CIF might appoint someone who would push their interest, as would the ICTU.  If one removes those two representatives from the board one is left with the Secretary of the Department of the Environment and the engineer.  I am not sure that would be the best composition.</P>
    <P>The duration of office of the chairman will be seven years and that is a long time especially for an active and responsible body.  It is not a figurehead position and a period of seven years may be too long. One of the effects of setting up the board will be the removal of patronage, and that is good for the country.  People are very aware of patronage wherever it occurs.  The board can sue and they can be sued, and that is a welcome innovation. In the recent Bill regarding Posts and Telegraphs there is provision for immunity with which I did not really agree.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the use of section 4.  I am glad to see that the loophole in the previous legislation with regard to undue influence has been closed.  Deputy Molloy said that this Bill will interfere with planning and will depoliticise it.  There have been abuses in the past with regard to planning and the people are well aware of this.  Some of the abuses were scandalous, some were cases of deliberate intervention and others were done through ignorance. People in a position to make appointments did not have the necessary qualifications and awareness and were not concerned about the effect on the environment. They did not realise the effect that certain planning applications would have on the countryside.  Dublin County Council have an appalling record in this regard.  In effect, they have destroyed the county and I am very much ashamed of this.  I am not pointing a finger at any one person but as a body the council were not capable and by their actions they have proved they should not be entrusted with <Col N="673" /> planning responsibilities.  As an environmentalist I have had many battles with them outside of politics.  I know of dreadful decisions that have had a permanent effect on the landscape of County Dublin.  This is very regrettable.  I hope that in the elections next year people will examine carefully the candidates to see if they have any concern for our environment and if they do not show such care and concern I hope the people will reject them.  Candidates have not been made accountable in the past.  Very often the public did not even know who was their candidate in the elections.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been introduced because of a situation that arose through neglect. People did not hold their public representatives responsible for the environment. Ten years ago one could not get 20 people to attend a meeting dealing with the environment, but as a result of the tremendous damage that has been done people at last have become aware of the facts.  I hope that next year in County Dublin people will ask candidates to give an account of their actions and their attitudes towards the environment and their proposals to handle matters of this kind. I hope voters will be very critical of candidates.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the right people be selected for this board, especially when the chairman will be appointed for seven years.  The Minister stated that ordinary members of the board will be appointed from different bodies.  He did not say how they can be removed: possibly by ministerial order. In view of the fact that they will be there for a long time there should be some method of monitoring their performance and, if necessary, we should be able to remove them in order to get a more efficient board.</P>
    <P>Media attention was recently given to section 4 cases.  A programme on this matter was done recently in County Galway &mdash; that is Deputy Molloy's county, but that is not to say that he had anything to do with the matter under discussion. People do not like the use of section 4. There is no doubt that this power has been abused.  Removing elected representatives <Col N="674" /> may not be a bad thing although I can understand a certain fear of total removal of the powers of public representatives.  I should like to see all political influence removed from the appointment of a board such as the one we are discussing.  The standard has been appalling.  Sometimes wrong people have been chosen.  They did not have the necessary qualifications or experience.</P>
    <P>The standard on our county councils &mdash; I am speaking particularly for Dublin County Council, is appallingly low.  The statements on the environment made by the Dublin Council make one feel ashamed.  This applies also to statements made in the area of the arts where they have blundered and made asses of themselves. It is appalling that these people are elected to serve five years.  The local authority elections are not taken as seriously as a general election.  A county councillor can be elected quite easily and he does not have to account to his constituents for his actions.  Why should any member of the public have to go to a county councillor and beg him not to do something atrocious?  I had to beg county councillors not to put a dump between Chapelizod and Lucan&mdash;the first phase 132 acres, 25 feet deep.  If that had happened there would have been refuse trucks driving up that road every five minutes for the next 50 or 100 years. Some years ago when the late Deputy Noel Lemass was contemplating a golf course in an area near me it was decided to make it a temporary dump.  That decision was made 30 years ago and that dump is still there.  Why should any member of the public have to go to one of these ignorant people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>During the next year when these local elections are held I intend appealing to people to be careful whom they select and elect to a county council.  In Dublin West where I come from we will try to retrieve some element of respect for our county councillors.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy mentioned depoliticising. I do not know what the fear is in this area.  He particularly referred to appointments to State boards.  I am not sure if we want State boards to be within the reach of politicians.  Deputy Molloy said if and when Fianna Fáil are returned to power they would remove anybody appointed to this board.  Why?  Why is it so important to have control over the appointments to semi-State boards?  Is it a bid for the retention of power, of corruption or of influence?  Is this a bid to hold power because there is political largesse to be distributed?  If this criteria were to be applied to the appointments to all boards and to all the positions which are subject to political influence, would this be essential for a large political party to remain in power?  If we look at the history of the State since 1922 and at the composition of governments over the years, it is not very hard to see who was in power for the longest period.  If political appointments to these boards have been effective I can see why it would be important for the Minister to retain the power of appointment and not to remove appointments to these boards from political influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we set up An Bord Pleanála the appointments to the board were removed from ministerial control.  Who will deny that influence was used when ministerial decisions affecting planning were made? Who has not been affected by such decisions at one time or another?  Who in this county has not seen something happen <Col N="676" /> very near to him over which he had no control because somebody asked permission from a person who had political influence?  Whole areas of this county have been destroyed by such decisions. Even projects which did not hit the headlines affected the lives of people who are bringing up their children in settled areas where they thought they would enjoy a lifetime of peace.  Suddenly their lives were disrupted by this corrupt practice. This Bill is a bald-headed attempt to remove political influence from the appointments to these boards and I applaud it.</P>
    <P>I have not been in politics for very long and I have not been a member of a political party for very long either.  Therefore I may be looking at this problem from a new angle.  I do not want to keep my seat at any cost, but now that I am an elected public representative I want to make my contribution.  It is important for people outside this House &mdash; professionals, business people and so on &mdash; to be aware of how the system works and to try to get into this House.  We want to break the practice where two parties can stay in power by pulling the strings of influence.</P>
    <P>In the last three speeches I have heard, there has been an element of that. Deputy Fitzgerald said he did not mind if the Labour Party were in and decided to appoint a Labour person to a semi-State board.  That is fine.  I suppose that Fine Gael could do so too and then when Fianna Fáil get in they could again do likewise.  That was the gist of the statement made by a former Minister of this House who has reminded us during the last year of his great experience and has told Deputy McLoughlin on this side of the House that he was wet behind the ears.  I listened to that and I can draw only one conclusion, that what he is saying is, &ldquo;You do it when you are in and we shall do it when we are in.  It is all right, boys.  Let us keep it going&rdquo;.  What he is not saying that they they were in power for the greater part of the last 60 years therefore, if Fianna Fáil get back into power they will have the greater influence.</P>
    <P>This legislation will break the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is necessary because Fianna <Col N="677" /> Fáil have been doing this for the last 50 or 60 years all over the country.  I am tempted to name different professions, bodies and places where this takes place and I hope that neither the Labour Party nor Fine Gael will indulge in that kind of operation.  The last time these parties were in power together they managed to correct some of these abuses.  They even appointed a Director of Public Prosecutions, because these appointments were given in favour of the party or parties in power, as were the State briefs.  This has been going on all the time in the Four Courts.</P>
    <P>The Ministers are to be congratulated for what they are doing.  The matter was not rushed but thought out very carefully and Deputy Molloy had a prepared speech for the occasion.  If what I am saying about these abuses is true, that sickens me and I hope that the Bill goes through and does what the Minister intends it to do &mdash; removes from political influence the handling of planning decisions.  It will help to create a better environment for all of us and better planning for what is left of this miserable city which has been destroyed over the last decade.  The bad planning over the last decade has contributed greatly to the misery experienced by many through crime, drug abuse and all the other ills.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about how the law is to be amended.  We have three Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts.  The first, in 1963, was a milestone and a landmark.  It was necessary because of the uncontrolled and wild development which was taking place then and was brought about by ministerial decision.  Former Minister Tully, in his wisdom, removed it from under the aegis of the Minister and said afterwards that he was glad that it was taken from him because otherwise the finger could be pointed at him.  He probably was under great pressure.  It was enlightening legislation and Deputies on the far side of the House rightly congratulated him on it and I did also.  It put a stop to much scandalous and horrible development. People at least had an opportunity to object and there was an attempt at a fair hearing.  The Local Government (Planning <Col N="678" /> and Development) Act of 1976 set up An Bord Pleanála to decide on planning appeals and Mr. Tully was responsible for this.  Its main objective was to set up the Planning Appeals Board, which was a good start.</P>
    <P>In 1983 it is time to review this Act, to see how it has performed.  It is also timely that we consider what people have had to say about the legislation, how it has worked and whether or not it has been effective.  The Minister is perfectly right in revising it.  We had the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act of 1982, which dealt with the duration of planning appeals, the Supreme Court decision, fees on appeals and increased penalties.  There have been very long delays and backlogs under the present board and the position does not appear to be improving.  The purpose of revising the legislation is not to speed it up in such a way that people will not have an opportunity to examine what is going on.  There must be notifications of planning applications but there is a flaw in that the planning applications are not circulated efficiently.  They are not brought to the notice of people in general.  It is very difficult to find out if a planning application is imminent or in operation which will effect you or your property or will have an undesirable effect, such as the creation of an eyesore.  That is an area which could be taken up under this Bill and should be looked at.</P>
    <P>How many houses, garages, extensions, buildings have been built in areas unawares, perhaps next door to someone's total investment of a lifetime, a private house or perhaps affecting a whole estate?  These things can happen&mdash; for example the rotten dump about which I was speaking which, if not outlined, would affect thousands of people and destroy an amenity, the Liffey Valley, which has existed for thousands of years. It is wild, with flora and fauna and a natural landscape, but all that the county council can think of doing is filling it up with refuse 25 feet deep and making a linear park with small tarmacadam paths and wooden benches.  One of the county council members told me that it was only a swamp and the county council consider <Col N="679" /> that that plan would be nicer.  This is a natural landscape which God has made and Joyce immortalised.  That is what I mean by ignorance.  These people would not even know about that, or bother to find out.  I must mention the corruption and suspected corruption which have gone on in the area of planning.  It is extremely important, in fact crucial, that this Bill be passed for the very reason that these abuses can be stopped and be seen to be stopped.  It will enable people to see how this board are constituted and whether this has been fairly done.  It will enable other Deputies and myself to make suggestions in the House as to fairer ways of doing it.  It is necessary and welcome.</P>
    <P>Perhaps planning applications could be <Col N="680" /> put in the national or local papers.  Many people have had the sickening experience of finding out about the granting of planning permission with dreadful implications for them and resulting in the destruction of amenities only when the building operation was commenced. They have had no opportunity to object, because they did not know about it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Rent Restrictions Act, Deputy Molloy referred to me as having a lack of understanding or appreciation of the sufferings which people are undergoing.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 29 June 1983.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he is aware of a resolution passed by the Civil Service Executive union at their recent annual delegate conference concerning the practice of promoting or transferring civil servants in the change-over period between Governments; in view of the resolution passed by the union if the Government will introduce the necessary legislation or regulations to prevent such promotions or transfers from taking place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the resolution referred to by the Deputy, which is aimed <Col N="424" /> at preventing the grant of preferential treatment for promotion or transfer to civil servants associated with Ministers' offices.  So far as promotion is concerned, no civil servant connected with ministerial work has, since the change of Government in June 1981, received preferential treatment during the change-over period between Governments.</P>
      <P>As regards the transfer of such staff I assume the Deputy is referring to the question of where a civil servant, assigned to a Minister's office from another Department, should be located on a change of Government.  I have, in fact, informed the Civil Service Executive Union that these civil servants will remain on loan from their parent Departments in their substantive grades. Accordingly, they will return in those grades to their Departments when their services are no longer required.  In the circumstances the statutory regulation of these matters is not proposed.</P>

      <P>Building regulations will apply to all new buildings and all alterations, extensions to, and certain material changes of use of, existing buildings, including buildings under the control of public authorities.</P>
      <P>The Fire Services Act, 1981, is not expressed to bind the State in respect of State property and, therefore, any regulations made under section 37 will not apply to State property.  However, all other public bodies (e.g. semi-State companies, local authorities and health boards) are bound by the provisions of the Act and regulations under section 37 will apply to their premises, as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Office of Public Works that the general obligation to ensure the safety of staff in State premises is formally entrusted to the occupying Department or office.  Repeated detailed instructions have been issued to all Departments and officers as to how this responsibility should be discharged.  The instructions which prescribe a daily check <Col N="428" /> on premises, require, <i>inter alia</i>, the carrying out of periodic evacuation drills and the regular review of evacuation procedures.</P>
    <P>I also understand that all buildings erected by the Office of Public Works are designed to a high standard of fire prevention and protection.  These standards are borne in mind also when accommodation is rented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Litter Act, 1982, came into operation on 1 August 1982.  Prosecutions under the Act are a matter for local authorities.  My Department do not at present have details of the number of such prosecutions or the amounts of fines involved but will shortly be asking local authorities for this information in respect of the Act's first year of operation.  The employment of litter wardens is also a matter for local authorities and particulars of the number of wardens now employed throughout the country are not available in my Department.  I understand, <Col N="433" /> however, that Dublin Corporation employ eight wardens.</P>
      <P>I have requested local authorities on several occasions to implement fully the provisions of the Litter Act, 1982, which has strengthened and extended their powers to deal with litter and related matters and I intend to continue to press for an intensification of effort by the authorities.</P>

      <P>Unlike the other counties referreed to, Wexford is not one of the counties affected by the roads element of the <Col N="434" /> western package and accordingly its annual allocations under the local improvements scheme have not kept pace with those two counties undertaking projects which attract EEC aid related to expenditure of national funds.  By comparison with other counties outside the western package area, Wexford with £22,000 for 1983 has the second highest allocation.  There are no funds at my disposal to increase the allocation to any county.</P>

      <P>Enforcement of the provisions of the Dogs Act, 1906, is a matter for the Garda Síochána.  Neither my Department nor the local authorities have any statutory functions in relation to dog control. Planning authorities are, however, empowered to assist a body or persons providing homes or shelters for stray or unwanted dogs or cats and my Department operate a scheme of grants for the recoupment to planning authorities of 50 per cent of the expenditure incurred by them on such purposes.  I understand that Galway Corporation and Galway County Council are jointly considering the question of the provision of a dogs' home under this scheme.</P>
      <P>On the general question of the control of dogs, I should mention that the Minister for Agriculture has recently indicated that an inter-departmental committee is to be established to examine issues in relation to dog control and measures to prevent attacks on farm livestock.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the assertion contained in the first part of the question.  The position is that some major developments at this sawmill were undertaken <Col N="452" /> in the period from November to April last.  These included drainage carried out in November-December 1982 and yard resurfacing in connection with the provision of a timber drying shed. Some other minor works have been carried out more recently.</P>

      <P>As an Irish resident the taxpayer is liable to Irish income tax on his total income regardless of source.  Under the terms of the Ireland/Denmark Double Taxation Convention the taxpayer, if employed in Denmark, would be taxable in Denmark on his Danish income but would be entitled to credit such tax against his Irish liability.  However, in this case, the taxpayer is employed in the Faroe Islands, a semi-autonomous region of the Kingdom of Denmark which has local independence in the matter of taxation and which is specifically excluded from the operation of the Ireland/Denmark Convention. The extension of the convention to cover the Faroe Islands is a matter which would require the agreement of the Danish and Faroese Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards present liability to Irish tax, there is no provision in Irish tax law under which a credit in respect of Faroese taxation may be granted.  However, some measure of relief is being afforded to the taxpayer.  Firstly, he is being subjected to <Col N="470" /> Irish tax only on so much of his income as is remitted to this country.  Secondly, following correspondence between the Revenue Commissioners and the Danish and Faroese authorities, the latter have concessionally agreed to grant the taxpayer a tax allowance for payments to his children corresponding to the standard allowance in the Faroe Islands.  Under normal circumstances, as the taxpayer's wife and children reside permanently in Ireland, the Faroese authorities would regard him as a single person for Faroese tax purposes and would not recognise his family status in any way.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of a refund of tax, no Irish tax has yet been paid by the person concerned in respect of his Faroese income as the assessments are under appeal.</P>

      <P>For some time my Department have had a general policy of facilitating health staffs to take up short-term employment in countries whose health services are in need of development.  In the case of permanent pensionable staff, provided their employing authorities at home are prepared to release them, these facilities extend to special leave of absence with nominal pay which safeguards the staff's superannuation position.  Where applicable, incremental credit is allowed to staff on return, provided the duties carried out overseas were akin to the duties normally carried out here.</P>
      <P>My Department are not involved in recruiting health staff to work abroad or in negotiating their conditions of service while abroad.  This is normally done by commercial agencies acting on behalf of the foreign health authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> The Government have, in recent years, entered into economic and scientific co-operation agreements with some foreign countries, particularly Middle-Eastern countries, and such agreements invariably include co-operation in the health sphere.  Such co-operation normally includes the provision of training and experience here for medical, para-medical and nursing staff from these countries. In some cases, teaching staff here go abroad for short-term assignments.</P>
    <P>There are now opportunities for agencies in this country to become involved in managing and fully staffing some hospitals in Middle-Eastern countries.  We have a sufficient pool of trained staff to be in a position to export a significant quantum of services and the Government are generally supportive of developing an export business of this kind.  At the same time, we have to ensure that there is no undue disruption of our own services and that the quality of the services we export are of a high standard and in keeping with the good international reputation we enjoy in this regard.  I have discussed this issue with some of my Cabinet colleagues and have arranged for senior officers of the Departments concerned to examine this question to determine the most appropriate arrangements for the export of health services, having regard to the considerations which I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>When a disabled person is admitted to a training centre or sheltered workshop, it is normal practice for the health board to pay his or her allowance to the workshop, which in turn pays it to the trainee.  When the person in question was discharged from the Rehabilitation Institute, her cheques continued to be sent there, due to an error in changing her address on the health board's computer records. This error has been rectified, and, since June 24, this person's cheques have been sent to her home address.  I understand that the Rehabilitation Institute have forwarded the cheques which it received to the person in question at her home address.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health when it is proposed to give eligibility for hospital services cards to wives working at home with no independent income in view of the fact that wives with an independent income below £11,000 per annum are eligible for the card, regardless of their husband's income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The persons who are entitled to hospital services cards are those whose incomes in the year ended 5 April 1983 were less than £11,000.  These cards refer principally <Col N="478" /> to entitlement to free hospital consultant services.</P>
      <P>As a general rule, in assessing eligibility for health services the family of husband, wife and children under 16 years of age is regarded as a unit and in the same eligibility category.  If only one spouse of a marriage has an income, the eligibility status of the other spouse and of the children is the same as that of the spouse with income.</P>
      <P>An exception to this general rule is made in the case of eligibility for a hospital services card when husband and wife have separate incomes.  In this case the eligibility status of each is separately assessed and determined by reference to his or her income without reference to the income of the other.  It can happen that one or other or both spouses have eligibility for a hospital services card even though their combined income is greater than the relevant income limit.</P>
      <P>I am having the entire question of the eligibility arrangements examined.  The eligibility status of housewives will be included in this review.</P>

      <P>I presume that the question refers to trained nurses who are in receipt of either social welfare assistance or social welfare benefit.  I also take it for granted that the Deputy is aware that I am not in a position to offer employment to any person on behalf of health boards or other health agencies.</P>
      <P>The question raised has serious implications in regard to the statutory entitlement of persons under the social welfare code.  It raises the wider question of whether all or most unemployed persons should be required to provide some service in return for the unemployment benefit or assistance provided by the State.  It is not clear why nurses should be treated differently from the rest of the unemployed population.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has not indicated whether she would see the arrangement being on a voluntary or mandatory basis and, if the former, whether the nurses in question would be subject to the same direction and control as other employed staff. Clearly staff organisations would be concerned in this matter and their views would have to be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must also point out the staffing constraints that obtain in the public service at present.  Health boards and other health agencies are required to achieve a 5 per cent reduction in staff by the end of 1985, as compared with the position on 21 July 1981.  The hiring of additional staff, albeit funded by money from the <Col N="480" /> social insurance fund, would not be in accord with these directives to reduce the numbers employed in the public sector.</P>

      <P>Following an investigation of his case by a social welfare officer the person concerned was assessed with means at £42.30 weekly with effect from 1 June 1983.  His means accordingly exceeded the maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable to him £25.45 and his claim had to be disallowed. The assessment was upheld by an appeals officer.</P>
      <P>Means in his case were derived from the profit of a holding which was transferred to him by deed from his father.  In assessing his means account was taken of all farm income including the sale of stock and milk.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 804 and 805 together.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance from 17 November 1982 and his case was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of his means.  Following the completion of inquiries his means were assessed at £16.50 weekly derived from the value of board and lodgings in his parents' home and from capital.  Accordingly he was entitled to unemployment assistance from 17 November 1982 to 2 January 1983 at £8.95 weekly being the maximum rate £25.45 less £16.50.  However, the payment of unemployment assistance due to him in respect of this period was over-looked when he claimed unemployment benefit.  The matter was recently rectified and an order for encashment at his local post office paying all arears of unemployment assistance issued to him last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 3 January 1983 he satisfied the contribution conditions for unemployment benefit and weekly payments at £31.65 are being made to him as they become due.  However, his entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat-rate unemployment benefit is governed by the amount of his reckonable earnings during <Col N="489" /> the income tax period 6 April 1980 to 5 April 1981.  According to the Department's records his earnings during this period amounted to less than £25 weekly and he is accordingly not qualified for pay-related benefit.</P>

A question for reduction of his old age pension to £6.45 a week plus adult dependant allowance from 10 June 1983 has been referred to the local pension committee for decision.  Pension at the rate of £6.45 a week plus £3.30 adult dependant allowance is in payment to him pending the pension committee's decision.

      <P>The person concerned made a repeat claim to unemployment benefit on 1 December 1982 after receiving his maximum entitlement of 390 days unemployment benefit on 30 November 1982. His claim was disallowed on the grounds that he had no reckonable contributions in the governing contribution year 6 April 1980 to 5 April 1981.  The class J rate of contribution which he paid during that year is not reckonable for unemployment benefit purposes.  Following the completion of inquiries into the insurability of his employment in the year from 6 April 1981 to 5 April 1982 it has been established that he had a total of 41 reckonable contributions in that year and as a result qualified for unemployment benefit from the beginning of the current benefit year on 3 January 1983.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 13 July 1982.  She was not entitled to payment initially as she had not the required minimum of 26 paid or credited contributions in the contribution year 1980-81 which governed her claim.  According to the records of the Department she had only seven credited contributions in that period.</P>
      <P>The claimant was requested on a number of occasions to supply details of any further contributions she may have had in 1980-81 which would qualify her for benefit.  The relevant information was obtained only recently.  The 45 additional paid contributions she had in that year entitle her to disability benefit at the appropriate maximum weekly rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">

      <P>Employment under contract of service is, generally speaking, insurable under the Social Welfare Acts and <Col N="504" /> PRSI contributions are compulsorily payable in respect of the employment. Where a son is employed by his parents under such a contract, the employment is insurable and the parents are liable for payment of a PRSI contribution at the Class A rate.</P>
      <P>However, an exception arises where a son is residing with his parents and the employment is related to a private dwelling house or farm in or on which both parties reside; in these circumstances the employment is not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts unless the contract of service is a written one.  If, however, the son's earnings from the employment are liable for assessment under the PAYE income tax system there may be a liability for a PRSI Class K contribution which comprises the 1 per cent youth employment levy, the 1 per cent income levy and the 1 per cent health contribution.</P>

      <P>As already indicated in my reply to the Deputy on 17 May 1983, payment of the 1980 sheep headage grants and reactor grants in respect of 12 brucellosis reactors disclosed in 1980, was disallowed because the person named was convicted of contravening the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Official Garda houses such as those at Pondfields, New Ross, County Wexford, are provided by the State in order to obviate the difficulty which members of the force might otherwise have in securing accommodation when transferred from one centre to another.  If these houses were to be sold to the members in occupation they would cease to be available to newly transferred members.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the four houses at Pondfields are required for official purposes and, consequently, cannot be sold to the members occupying them.</P>
      <P>The maintenance of official Garda houses is a matter for the Office of Public Works and it is understood from that office that they will shortly be commencing a scheme of remedical works for the houses at Pondfields which will include the repair of windows and redecoration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the bulk of the applications for registration of title lodged in the Land Registry are for changes in, or additional, registration in respect of property already registered. There are no undue delays in processing these applications; registrations are effected within an average time scale of about two months.</P>
      <P>The Registrar of Titles states that the only area of the Land Registry's work in which significant delays occur is that of first registration, including the establishment of title acquired by possesion.  The number of applications in this category constitutes only about 5 per cent of the total number of applications for registration lodged annually in the registry. These applications involve detailed and complex examinations of title and often protracted correspondance with solicitors as well as the issue of statutory notices to interested parties which usually give rise to further correspondence.  It is difficult to be precise about average delays but they are unlikely to be less than 12 months in present circumstances.</P>
      <P>Remedical measures, involving the redeployment of an examiner of titles from other work and the improvement of the processing procedures, have recently been taken in order to enable applications to be dealt with more quickly.  Also, because in many cases delays are caused by incompleteness in the submission of applications to the Land Registry, the Incorporated Law Society proposes to hold a series of seminars for solicitors, which will be attended by Land Registry officials, with the aim of eliminating or at least reducing time-consuming correspondence. The embargo on the creation and filling of public service posts applies to the Land Registry and that limits the possibilities for expediting the rate of completion of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> In any case in which it is brought to the attention of the Land Registry that circumstances of special urgency exist, such as bridging finance or housing loans being held up, arrangements are made to have registration expedited as far as possible.</P>
