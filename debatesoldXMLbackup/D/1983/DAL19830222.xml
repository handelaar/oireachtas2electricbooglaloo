      <P>asked the Minister for Education the reason for the delay in affirming the plans for the proposed extension to De La Salle College, Churchtown, Dublin 14.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there was any undue delay by my Department in approving plans.</P>
      <P>Revised plans were submitted as recently as late December last.  Following detailed technical examination, these were subsequently found to form an acceptable basis for proceeding to the next stage of the planning process.  My Department wrote accordingly to the school manager requesting the preparation of the working drawings and these are now awaited.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education when sketch plans for the extension to Glenbeg national school, County Waterford, were received in her Department from the Commissioners of <Col N="610" /> Public Works; and when the examination will be completed.</P>

      <P>Examination of the sketch scheme submitted by the Office of Public Works in April 1981, and which was referred to in the reply to Question No. 23 of Wednesday, 23 October 1982, was undertaken when the suitability of the required site extension and legal title thereto were confirmed in July 1982.  As further inquiries have to be made I am not in a position to state when the examination of the sketch scheme may be completed but the matter will be expedited as much as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she will consider having the primary school bus which serves the Ballysaggart area extended beyond Veales in order to collect children (details supplied) for transport to Lismore primary school, County Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply on 12 May 1982 to a question from Deputy Deasy in this matter.  I have nothing to add to the terms of that reply which sets out the circumstances applicable in the case.  An extension of the route of the ordinary service operating to Lismore national school was sanctioned to facilitate this family.  Their standard of service is comparable to that enjoyed by pupils generally under the school transport arrangements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the school transport scheme a special school transport service may be provided only where there is a certain minimum number of eligible pupils in a distinct locality requiring transport.  According to my information there are no eligible pupils in the areas to which the Deputy refers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State consider providing transport to the children concerned on a fare paying basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not establish a transport scheme on the basis of fare paying pupils.  You must first of all establish it on the basis of right.  If there is accommodation on the bus you could consider fare paying pupils.  I am sorry I could not agree to the Deputy's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair must remind the Deputy that this is confined to one school in County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the same thing is happening all over the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to children paying for school transport, children are now being used by bus inspectors on the instructions of the Department of Education to ensure payment of fees on buses.  Is this correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question. The question tabled by Deputy Fahey refers to the provision of a transport scheme in a particular area.  If the Deputy will put down a question about what he is now referring to I will give him all the information possible, but that is certainly a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pursue this a little more, if I may.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Deputy Andrews bear with the Chair for a second? This is a specific question put down in relation to one specific school.  The Minister of State answered the question stating that there were no eligible pupils in the area.  Now the Deputy is seeking <Col N="612" /> to raise the whole question of charging for school transport.  It is not reasonable. Question No. 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 5 is not my question.  There is a mistake on the Order Paper.  I have enough to look after in the west of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is down on the Order Paper as Deputy Frank Fahey but I understand it is Deputy Mervyn Taylor's question.</P>

    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if a free school bus service will be provided by her Department to take children from Newcastle to their school at Rathcoole, County Dublin, having regard to the fact that their journey to this school involves crossing the dangerous Naas dual carriageway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the community school in Rathcoole in his question.  Generally, children from the Newcastle area live within three miles of this school.  Accordingly, under the terms of the school transport scheme, it would not be possible to establish a special transport service for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in the reply to a question from Deputy Deasy on 27 October 1982, a report on the existing accommodation at the Lismore Church of Ireland national school was requested from the Commissioners of Public Works.  That report has recently been received and is being considered in my Department.  A decision on how best to provide satisfactory accommodation will be taken as soon as possible and the chairman will be notified without delay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply on 27 October 1982 to a question from Deputy Deasy in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood from the Commissioners of Public Works that specifications for the replacement of windows at Clashmore national school are to be <Col N="614" /> issued to the school authorities at an early date to enable them to invite tenders.</P>
    <P>The matter of the future permanent accommodation requirements of the school is being considered at present following the recent receipt of a report in the matter from my Department's inspector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidence of title to the site extension required to facilitate the extension of Whitechurch national school, Ballinameela, County Waterford, has been received recently.

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning of the proposed extension to Rosses community school is proceeding.  It is not possible at this stage to say when construction will commence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is necessary now to use four pre-fab structures at Rosses community school?  Is there any indication as to when work on the extension will commence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the school in question was provided to cater for 350 students but that the number on the roll has now reached 471.  I am aware, too, of the circumstances to which the Deputy refers but the architectural planning of the project is at an advanced stage.  It is anticipated that all stages of that will be completed by summer, 1983.  The question of when the project may proceed to tender will then be considered in the light of available capital funds for 1983 and of other commitments and priorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Much as I should like to give a categorical assurance on that, it is not possible to do so because the matter will have to be examined in the light of a <Col N="616" /> number of other factors in the context of whether at that stage it should be allowed go to tender.  However, I will consider the Deputy's request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the percentage of the total annual expenditure on education at all levels spent on the free school transport scheme in respect of the years 1977&mdash;82, inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the proposed saving this year of £5 million when taken as a percentage of the total represents a savage imposition on primary education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say it is an imposition on some parents but there was not very much by way of alternative so far as the Minister was concerned having regard to the shortfall in the amount of capital that has been mentioned by the Deputy.  The entire school transport scheme is under constant review but I cannot offer the Deputy anything further in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The saving represents only one-sixth of the total of £3,500,000. Is this not a savage attack on primary education, that level of education which, constitutionally, is supposed to be free?</P>

My understanding from information received from the Board of Works is that they completed a survey in regard to this site and returned it yesterday to the Department of Education.  I do not know the result of the survey, but had hoped that the Minister would be able to give me up-to-date information on the position. Can the Minister not do this?</P>

They have been shifting about from place to place and have to provide a bus service for 110 pupils to these different sites in order to make available to them an all-Irish school.  Have the Government made a final decision?  If so, it would be of interest to the public to know what that decision is.  If the Government have taken a final decision it would be of interest to the public to know what is their position, if it is that they have no longer any interest in the Irish language, or in all-Irish schools.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The Estimates for Public Services published in November 1982 provided £28.2 million for school transport in 1983.  In order to operate within the Estimate and to avoid cutbacks in the service, it was necessary for the Government to seek a contribution towards the cost of operating the scheme from post-primary pupils who avail of it.  The contribution represents only a small fraction of the cost of operating the scheme.  In order to take into account any difficulty in the circumstances of large families, family contributions were limited to a certain maximum. In addition, it was decided to exempt certain senior cycle pupils whose parents or legal guardians hold medical cards.</P>
      <P>Because of the distance criteria determining eligibility for school transport, pupils from rural areas benefit most, but not exclusively, from it.  Therefore, there is an inherent rural bias in the scheme as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to seeking contributions from post-primary pupils using school transport, it was necessary to withdraw the special subsidy which was paid to CIE in respect of special school child fares. The beneficiaries of such special fares were mainly pupils from urban areas who travelled by bus to and from school. These pupils, of whom there are about 65,000, now pay fares travelling to and from school comparable to the contributions <Col N="633" /> required on behalf of their rural counterparts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will accept there is undue hardship being imposed on families, particularly those on social welfare disability benefit and so on?  Does he not accept that there is a very definite rural bias being shown in the decision to have these fares made compulsory now on children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must accept that, as and from tomorrow, there will be children who will either not be taken on the bus or who will be taken off the bus?  Does the Minister accept that this is the proper way to administer education in Ireland, education which is compulsory up to the age of 15?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

Brady, that they proposed to introduce the same charges.  I accept that charges will impose difficulties on some people.  In relation to school transport generally I should say that it is necessary to have a complete review undertaken of our entire school transport services.  That is what I am doing at present.  Until such time as I have examined that matter with various interests and organisations throughout the country and come to a conclusion I am not in a position to add anything further to what I have said already in reply to a whole series of supplementary questions and to claims made here last week in Private Members' time.  I am sorry I cannot give any more information. The charges are there, it is a factual situation and it is something for which the people opposite, when in Government, cannot disclaim responsibility.</P>

I want to remind you that when I occupied the Office of Taoiseach on every occasion I made the sort of declaration to the House which the Taoiseach has just made, the Leaders of the Opposition were entitled to say something about that statement.  I have some rights in this House.  I must ask you to look into this matter.  If we are to have a situation where the Taoiseach comes in here unannounced and makes an announcement on which I have no right even to comment, even though I have very serious questions to ask about the statement, announcement or declaration, in fairness you must do something about that situation.</P>

When the Chair had this honour conferred on him, Deputies on all sides of the House specifically asked the Chair to ensure that there was order in the House.  If the House is to be run as a sort of impromptu Question Time, in the Chair's opinion that is a recipe for chaos and bringing the House into disrepute.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, an allegation has been made that I used a device of some kind in a way that has not been used by my predecessors.  I wish, therefore, to have your ruling as to whether I have been correct in dealing with this matter of the allocation of functions by way of an announcement.  Am I correct in saying that is how this matter was dealt with previously, that I am following precedent and not adopting any device?</P>

      <P>In the Chair's opinion, the information was conveyed to the House by way of announcement, and precedent going back over a long number of years specifically provides that there shall be no debate or statement on an announcement, and that is what the Chair tried to enforce.  I was asked by the Leader of the Opposition if he could ask a question and the Chair felt it would be unreasonable to rule it out.  However, the question turned out to be a statement <Col N="719" /> and the Chair rules that the matter is over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government <Col N="724" /> have told us that because we have overspent we will have to tighten our belts, take cuts in services and pay more.  When I spoke on this debate on the last occasion I asked the question who had overspent? I said it was not those who are now being asked to pay higher taxes and who are being asked to take cuts in the educational and health services.  I said it was those who had control of the financial and capital institutions who had overspent, that it was they who had borrowed from banks and who had contributed to the erosion of our financial stability in the past few years.  Those were the people who had bought villas in Spain, who had liquidated companies and established other companies and who refused to pay over the contributions they deducted from their workers.  The ordinary PAYE worker is now being asked to bear the burden but he did not cause the financial chaos in the first place.  This budget is imposing higher taxes on people who will have to take cuts in services for which they have already paid.  The social welfare benefits will be reduced considerably and people will have lower incomes generally because of higher prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget did not take into account in any way the people who are really hit by the financial crisis facing us.  It did not take into account the class structures in society.  Budgets never take into account whether there is any difference in the class structures in society.  I have heard Ministers of various governments frequently make the point that there are no class differences here.  They say we are all the same and that we do not divide on class lines.  This is the type of propaganda that is spread abroad.  A former Minister for Industry made the point some months ago that the IDA are very proud to go to America and elsewhere and to say that when we decide on our tax structure in any year the laws will remain the same irrespective of what government are in power.  The IDA can tell people abroad that we do not change our laws because of a change of government because there are no class differences in Ireland.  This is not the case in England: if a Labour Government come to power after a Tory Government they <Col N="725" /> change the law.  We are able to tell people abroad our political structures are such that there will be no change in the law irrespective of the government in power. Unfortunately this has been the case since the foundation of the State.  One Government after another have retained the same type of taxation and financial structures; they have paid out the same hand-outs to the same people and have taken money from the same people. Thus, year after year the differences grow between those who have and those who have not.  The differences between the owners of property and those who have no property are getting wider with each year and this budget has contributed greatly to widening that gap.</P>
    <P>Many people wonder why there has been such an increase in crime and vandalism, why there has been such a rejection of society by young people in the past eight or ten years.  Anyone who studies the class structure of our society can see the real deprivation in some areas, can see the differences in the incomes of people and the environment in which they live.  They can see the differences in housing, in schools and in health services. Any sociologist who sees such extraordinary differences in society will understand what has happened to young people in the deprived class.  They know they will not get the same education as people of another class a few miles down the road.  They know they will not get the same opportunities and will always be dependent on welfare benefits or, at best, on low paid jobs.  These young people see a great parade of wealth &mdash; in housing, cars, hotels, and clubs to which others may go.  They can see that some are destined to have and others are destined not to have &mdash; the men of no property, of whom Tone spoke.</P>
    <P>When they see a Government putting through a budget like this they do not expect any better.  This is what they expect a government and those in authority to do to them.  They know that the ones in authority are the men of property. The men of property are the men who control government, who control and make the decisions in regard to taxes and the way the economy is run and, therefore, <Col N="726" /> they expect governments to do what this Government did.  This is why certain other people have not respect for property. Why should they have respect for property?  They are never destined to have any of it themselves.  Property is a thing which other people have.  They have no respect for authority.  Authority is what creates this system.  Therefore, there is little use in crying about vandalism, crime and the young generation when we create the type of society which these young people naturally reject.</P>
    <P>This budget of this Government was expected to be bad but many people thought that it would show some beginning of a change in the taxation structure. All right, maybe everyone would have to pay more this time.  Things were bad so everyone would have to pay more, but most people expected that this would go right across the board.  Therefore, probably the worst feature of the budget, bad as were the increase in PAYE, the extra one per cent income levy and so on, was the lack of capital taxes.  A survey done eight or nine years ago revealed that 5 per cent of the people owned 75 per cent of the wealth and probably if a survey were done today similar to that done by Professor Lyons at that time we would find that fewer than 5 per cent own the 75 per cent of the wealth.  The 5 per cent are those who get away untaxed.  This budget made no effort to include them within the net.  In fact, their taxes have been considerably reduced since 1974. Since death duties and estate duties were abolished then, the real taxes on wealth and capital have fallen year by year so that these people pay less duty than they did in 1974 in real terms.  This budget has even a £10 million subsidy to private landlords but the PAYE taxpayer who is the tenant of these properties and who is paying these landlords £20, £30 and £40 per week will now have to pay them also, through taxation, an extra £10 million. This attitude, this type of thinking is unbelievable for the ordinary working-class person who cannot conceive how a government could proceed in that manner unless they are being dictated to by the landlords, the property owners, the <Col N="727" /> farmers, the people who are not taxed, unless they are being dictated to by the five per cent who own 75 per cent of the wealth.  That is how it is perceived by the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>Regarding the manner in which tax evasion is dealth with in the budget.  I will read one sentence of the Minister's budgetary statement.  He sounded as if he was going to deal with tax evasion and then he said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The strengthening of legal powers for dealing with evasion should certainly yield results but this approach must be balanced against the necessity to protect the interests and privacy of the honest taxpayer.</P>
    <P>That sounds great but at the same time there is no such constraint on the Government to protect the interests and privacy of the honest social welfare claimant. There is no such protection for people on social welfare.  What happens to them is they are simply cut off social welfare benefits until they prove that they are entitled to them.  The unemployed are told,&ldquo;You are not seeking work, or you are not available for work.  Therefore no money is coming to you from next Tuesday&rdquo;. The unemployed must appeal that decision and that will take at least two or three weeks.  They go before an anonymous tribunal, queue up terrified and scared coming before three people who do not identify themselves, who question them as to where they went looking for work, question them in detail about what they are doing and where they are going, ask the women in particular how many children they have, and say, &ldquo;Who is looking after them at home; how are you available for work if you have three children at home?&rdquo;  They are questioned, harried and harassed in an effort to prevent them getting social welfare benefits to which they are entitled and for which they have to go through a long procedure of appeals.  In some cases they themselves even have to go eventually to the Minister before they can get the benefits to which they are entitled.  Many of them give up the effort and never get the benefits to which they are entitled and they live on <Col N="728" /> assistance.  There is no protection for them as there is for the so-called interests and privacy of the honest taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Regarding those who are evading their taxes and probably also availing of various subsidies, grants and so on to which they are not entitled, I received a letter only yesterday in which a worker sets out what he thinks of the budget and the way he is treated as compared with the way a farmer is treated.  He says that the budget has come and still the farmers are getting VIP treatment.  The means test limit for medical cards is £55 &mdash; I understand that it is £53.60.  A farmer who is in receipt of the non-contributory old age pension, who gets regular creamery or mart cheques and has let his farm, is well above this figure and can still get the medical card.  If he got his pension a few years ago there has never been a check-up since.</P>
    <P>The majority of wealthy farmers move cash around to a number of banks in order to qualify for a pension and they are now to get an increase in the pension. They have never been asked to pay tax. The majority of farmers have refused to pay their contribution towards the health scheme since it started some years ago and are getting away with that.  They owe well over £8 million in contributions to the health services but there is no pressure on them to pay.</P>
    <P>Some day the Government may bring in a Bill to enable refunds to be made to farmers who have paid health contributions. We had the case of a legitimate tax, the resource tax, being levied on farmers.  Farmers refused to pay and instead of being put in jail a Bill was passed last year to make refunds to the small number of farmers who paid £700,000 in resource tax.  That was the most extraordinary tax precedent in the history of the State: a tax was levied, people refused to pay, the tax was abolished and those who had paid were refunded.</P>
    <P>Farmers used the Constitution, as many property owners are doing at present, to evade their lawful payments.  By doing so they have got out of paying rates.  It would be interesting if a PAYE worker took a case to the court on the <Col N="729" /> basis that the only property he owns is his week's wages.  Under the Constitution and his right to private property he could well have a case against the State that it has no right to deduct that property from him before he gets it into his pocket.  If such a case was taken and succeeded the State would grind to a halt.  It would collapse completely without the PAYE worker.  Perhaps it is as well that no PAYE worker has as yet attempted to bring such a case as property owners are doing at present and as landlords did successfully proving that the State should not have the right to restrict them in their use of private property.  The State now pays a £10 million subsidy from the Exchequer to them.  This is taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>I do not say there is no room for cutbacks in Government spending.  There is tremendous waste in the health services. However, the cutbacks are made in the wrong areas and the wrong people are hit.  There is no cutback on payments to doctors or pharmacists many of whom get £40,000 to £50,000 a year from the taxpayer as well as having their own private practices.  We do not know how much they earn from that because many of them just put their fees in a drawer and do not give receipts.  They simply make a declaration to the Revenue Commissioners and there is no way of knowing just how much they earn.  They are paid on a fee for item basis which means that when somebody goes to a doctor he is charged say £7 and if he is given a prescription he goes to a chemist. The tablets he receives may last only a week and if he needs more he has to go back to the doctor who will write him another prescription, charge him another £7 and so it goes on.  The person may pay the chemist £10 or £15 each time.  There are no cutbacks made here because the people who would be hurt would scream and fight back.  However, the elderly man or woman who has spent 60 years paying tax will be told: &ldquo;You are not entitled to such-and-such a benefit or such-and-such a service, go home&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is no economic plan on which the budget is based.  There is no hope for the future and no indication that the <Col N="730" /> Government have any purpose in balancing the books or making ends meet.  If they have no purpose there is no point in doing it.  They must have a plan for employment.  What precisely do they intend doing with the money in the Exchequer if they succeed in balancing the books and everyone is on his uppers? There is no indication that it will do anything for us.  It will lead to more unemployment but there is nothing to say that we will be better off in the future or in a position to run our financial affairs more efficiently.</P>
    <P>Despite increases in taxes and cutbacks in expenditure the more job losses there are, the deeper the Exchequer will be in trouble.  The CII put the blame on the public sector and say that not only pay in the public sector must be cut back but also jobs.  They make such comments as &ldquo;the productive sector of the economy&rdquo;&mdash; that is the private sector &mdash; and &ldquo;the public sector is the unproductive sector&rdquo;. These pharses are meaningless because more than 50 per cent of the private sector is totally unproductive and a large slice of the public sector is very productive. Our biggest manufacturing industry is the ESB.  They manufacture electricity and could export it if they were able to maintain the link with the North which was broken a number of years ago.  It is not regarded as the largest manufacturing productive industry by the CII or anyone else.  Bord na Móna is another productive industry as is the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>Within the civil service the Department of Fisheries and Forestry is a productive Department.  They produce timber. It is interesting to look at that Department and see where savings could be made but are not and what actually happens to this productive natural resource, timber.  When cutbacks were introduced those who administered them were working in the administration area. During the last few years they have cut back on the number of the foresters and outdoor staff they employ.  They have been cut back by up to 50 per cent but at the same time the number of administrative staff have increased by one-third. Obviously there is room for saving and cutbacks but it is not in the forests that <Col N="731" /> the cutbacks should be made.  These forests have been built up over the past 60 years by our fathers, grandfathers and grandmothers paying their taxes, knowing they would not get a penny out of them but thinking their children or their grandchildren in the seventies and eighties would make a fortune when those great forests were mature.  Those forests are maturing so rapidly that in 1990 the output from our forests will be double what they are this year.  We have no capacity whatsoever for using the timber from our forests.  There are hundreds of small timber contractors around the country.  They can buy the timber in the forests for £1 a ton.  They cut down those mature trees, trim them and take them to Wexford or Waterford where they export the raw timber.  It will have cost them about £12 a ton by the time they get it to the port.  That is what is happening our timber today.</P>
    <P>Waterford Chipboard closed down and Scariff Chipboard, a private company, are kept going by the taxpayer.  The Clondalkin pulp mill closed down three years ago and the paper mill closed down last December.  This company have been successfully taken over by the State.  Private enterprise has collapsed so far as forestry is concerned, from the beginning right up to paper making.  Private enterprise is given the timber almost free, but it cannot be competitive with foreign markets. Timber is produced here twice as fast as it is in Norway and Sweden.  Maturity comes in 40 to 50 years while it is 80 to 90 years in Norway and Sweden.  Private enterprise is a failure and only lives off the taxpayer.  In 1981 the private sector cost the Exchequer in subsidies, tax incentives, direct State aids and services administered by various public companies a total of £2,550 million.  The figures which make up that are: tax incentives £245 million, Exchequer aid to farming £230 million, Industrial Development Authority's aid to private industry £203 million, Shannon Free Airport Development Company £21 million, Údarás na Gaeltachta £30 million, Development Fund £30 million, Córas Tráchtála £10 million, AnCO £38 million.  State <Col N="732" /> expenditure on the construction carried out by the private section £1,350 million. The private sector, not the public sector, has failed.</P>
    <P>The Government have not given any indication what policy they will pursue in the future.  They have not given any indication if they will accept the Telesis consultants report on the IDA and industrial development.  They have not told us if they will use our national resources to create jobs and exports.  We have not been told if they will continue to allow almost three million acres of our agricultural land almost to lie idle, as Dr. Tom Walsh of the Agricultural Institute pointed out about three years ago.  We have not been told if they will change the structures of farming or if they have any policy on farming.</P>
    <P>When did the Government last have an agricultural policy?  The last agricultural policy I recall, put forward by the Department of Agriculture was the infamous dual-purpose cow, the greatest disaster of all time in Irish agriculture.  Now the Government are simply administering the EEC agricultural policy.  There is no policy for Irish agriculture.  This is our greatest industry, the backbone of the country and it should be the basis for a great food processing industry and should provide at least 60,000 to 100,000 jobs. We still allow farmers to decide if they will use their land.  It is not up to them. It is our land and belongs as much to the worker in Ballyfermot as to the worker on the land.  Farmers cannot do what they like with the land.  All of the people fought for the land.  The land must be used for the benefit of all the people. Unless the Government act in that fashion agriculture will never be of benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>Have the Government any plan for our forestries?  It would be a simple matter to take forestry out of the hands of the civil service and establish a dynamic company similar to Bord na Móna to deal with our forests and our timber, to set up drying plants, of which we have hardly any, and bring order into the market.  At the moment a contractor living in Cork will see a contract in the paper for a forest in <Col N="733" /> Wicklow.  He will cut his timber bring it down to Cork.  The following week a contractor in Wicklow will see a contract in Cork.  He will go down to Cork, cut his timber and bring it back to Wicklow. Timber contractors are passing each other on the road all over the country. Will anybody bring order into that and use that great natural resource?</P>
    <P>Will anybody attempt to use the marvellous natural resources of the sea?  A large number of jobs could be created there.  Almost the whole of Iceland depend on one fish, the cod, between the catching of the cod, its processing and sale.  Iceland has a higher standard of living than we have, and indeed many European countries have.  We have not anything from the sea.</P>
    <P>Will anybody make use of our mineral wealth, where thousands of tons are poured out in the raw state and not even one job created from it?</P>
    <P>The workers from whom such enormous sums are being taken as a result of this budget, wish to know what the Government are planning to do with the money.  The workers are anxious to know whether their money will be given away to those same fly-by-nights who have been robbing us for years and who have put us in the mess we are in.  We should like to know also if the banks will be allowed to continue lending £30 million to people like the Gallaghers for the purpose of allowing them engage in property deals.  One need go no futher away than Leeson Street to see houses that were listed for preservation now in rubble. What remains is a big derelict site. Another omission in this budget is the failure to impose a tax in respect of derelict sites.  Are the banks to be allowed give money to property speculators instead of lending for investment in productive industrial purposes?  What I am asking is whether the Government intend taking control of the lending policy of the banks and also of their interest rates.  This must be done if the Government are to have any control of the economy.  But none of the Government's predecessors had control of the economy either. Instead, this control was vested in a handful of industrialists, those who controlled <Col N="734" /> the banks.  They are the people who decide how the accumulated wealth created by workers and farmers is reinvested.</P>
    <P>This budget represents the thinking of Thatcher and Reagan in regard to cutting back on medical, social welfare and education services while at the same time increasing the tax burden on those people who will be hit most by these cuts.  This sort of policy will lead to even greater chaos than has been experienced in Britain, because, unlike Britain, we do not have North Sea Oil to support us.  Mrs. Thatcher's policy of creating more unemployment so that the books might be balanced is bringing down increasingly the British economy.</P>
    <P>The policy put forward in our document of November last was designed to balance the books in the reverse order, that is, instead of cutting back our spending, we increase our output, expand our economy and increase our earnings.  This could be done by way of a 5 per cent annual increase in output.  Any Government having the interest of the country at heart should be putting forward a plan on the lines envisaged by us in our document. This would still enable them to balance their books at the end of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to Deputy Mac Giolla just as I listened also the speech of the Leader of the Opposition on the budget.  At least there is one point on which I agree with Deputy Mac Giolla and that is the preparedness of Deputy Haughey in his approach to the budget.  It was interesting, if not laughable, to see the Deputy read from prepared notes and to use such phrases as, &ldquo;as cold as a computer printout&rdquo; and, &ldquo;a bookeeper's budget without any sign of humanity or compassion.&rdquo;  No doubt we would have had these phrases regardless of what the budget had contained.  In fairness to Deputy Mac Giolla he spoke off the cuff and that is difficult in replying to a statement as comprehensive as a Budget Statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime Deputy Haughey has tried to convince us that he is the champion of the poor and of the oppressed as if his wish is to add this title to his title of <Col N="735" /> patron of the arts in which respect he is a champion and deserving of admiration. Now we have Deputy Mac Giolla putting himself forward as the champion of the poor and the oppressed.  He has said that the £2,500,000 which farmers will be asked to pay in tax this year is very nominal. He went on to say that the £25 million expected to be raised by way of wealth tax is only chicken feed and would not do much more than provide children with sweets.  I expect we will be able to find some better use for this money.</P>
    <P>I represent the constituency that is represented also by Deputy Mac Giolla but there are times when I wonder whether we represent the same people.  He seems to be of the opinion that he is entitled to the support of the PAYE workers as well as of all other workers.  There are about 1,250,000 workers in the State of whom about 800,000 are PAYE workers.  To put The Workers' Party into perspective, they gained two seats in the election having secured perhaps 14,000 first preference votes between both of them.  Is it not clear, therefore, that the bulk of the workers are represented here by the rising Fine Gael Party as well as by the rising Labour Party and the declining Fianna Fáil Party?</P>

      <P>Not only do I represent the same constituency as Deputy Mac Giolla represents but I come from that constituency. I am one of the workers but I succeeded in breaking out of the mould which I agree with Deputy Mac Giolla exists.  In addition, I am one of the 2 per cent of working class people who succeeded in going to university and to being able to choose their own career but I realise how difficult it is to break out of that mould.  I accept that but I would not find my salvation in The Workers' Party or the policies you represent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few <Col N="736" /> points in this area because it is one I know something about.  Deputy Mac Giolla when criticising this budget said that the PAYE worker has to pay for everything. Who does he mean?  He is talking about a minimum of 800,000 people.  Of the people who run businesses, practically 100 per cent are registered for PAYE. We are all workers.  What he is really talking about is the community who have to pay to put right the mistakes made over the past five years.  I found very little constructive criticism in his speech.  I have many criticisms of this budget which I hope to have aired and acted upon by my party.</P>
      <P>In my view The Workers' Party should change their name to The Knockers' Party because that is all they do.  They are becoming a party of no-hopers.  As a person in Deputy Mac Giolla's constituency I would not like what his party have to offer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am referring to the comments made by Deputy Mac Giolla on the budget and he, in turn, referred to previous speakers.  Not being the leader of a party I am at a disadvantage because I cannot reply to every debate.  If I, like Deputy Mac Giolla, was leader of a party of two I would be able to reply to every debate, as does the Taoiseach and Deputy Haughey, Leader of the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not sour grapes.  I can look after myself.  As a member of the community The Workers' Party have very little to offer me.  What we all want, especially the young people, is educational and career opportunities.  Our young people are energetic and strong.  I heard the Leader of the Opposition say many times that our youth were our biggest asset.  That was said in the seventies and then ignored.  We have not treated our youth as an asset because we did not plan and provide for them.  We did nothing <Col N="737" /> about them.  Throughout the seventies this problem escalated and our young people had very little experience in dealing with people in authority and could not speak for themselves.  In that respect we failed them because we did not listen to them, consult with them, plan for them and find out what the future would hold for them.  Our educational institutions did not prepare them to get jobs. Recently we made a start in this area by expanding our newer academic institutions, such as NIHE, Limerick and Dublin, where high technology and computer and practical courses are in progress. This move gives hope to the young.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla twice in the last week mentioned people with £50,000 cars.  How many £50,000 cars does he see driving around my constituency?  How many people have villas in Spain?  How much longer will people fall for this type of rhetoric?  The Workers' Party give the impression that they are the only people who represent the working class.  Are we not all working class?  Our roots are working class and it is not long since we emerged from them.  Our people have great ability and a desire to succeed and they can do this if they are shown the way.  In this respect we have failed them.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, I broke out of that mould but it was not an easy thing to do.  If fewer than 2 per cent of the working classes can get third level education and one in two of the professional classes can get a third level education, there is something radically wrong.  Those were the statistics when I was in university ten years ago.  I do not know what they are now, but if they are better, they are probably not much better.  We have done little about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla mentioned people with property.  Does he think the PAYE worker does not own property?  Does he not own his own house?  I do not want charity from The Workers' Party, nor do I want your pity and sympathy.  I do not want you to provide me with a new pair of overalls if I <Col N="738" /> stay at my work-place and behave myself. I want an opportunity to carve out my own career and make my own way forward. I do not want you telling me if I am a good boy and do what I am told we will all be equal because that would mean people would no longer use their initiative. I do not want that to happen and neither do the people.  They want to make their own way.  In my view you will have to change your policies.  I will try to get it across to the people in my constituency that they are being codded by your policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On one of the rare occasions I get to watch television I noticed in Frank Hall's programme last night that in one of the sketches they were talking about the budget hitting everyone &mdash; the rich, the middle class and the poor &mdash; and that is a fair summary of what has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker mentioned people going to the labour exchanges to fill in forms and then experiencing difficulties in getting their social welfare payments. Unfortunately we spend a great deal of our time trying to straighten out this situation &mdash; and we have no objections to doing it &mdash; but it must be accepted that there has to be order in society.  Deputy Mac Giolla must realise that there has to be a certain amount of, but not too much, <Col N="739" /> bureaucracy.  People have to abide by certain rules and regulations, otherwise there would be chaos.  Should the Minister dispense with any form-filling, much as I abhor that?  If the private sector were dispensed with altogether, have we a sufficient work ethic to take its place?  I do not believe so &mdash; contrary to the position in France, for example.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of some of our semi-State bodies regarding their efficiency and commitment to work.  I do not wish to add to this criticism, but it is fairly obvious that we lack the discipline of getting up at 7 a.m. and doing a hard day's work.  Socialism is not the answer to our problem.  Private enterprise has not been a failure or a fraud, as Deputy Mac Giolla suggests it has.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures prove that it has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is consistent with Fine Gael philosophy that the party should encourage self-help and make people less dependent on the State for all their needs.  This basic tenet should underlie the Government's approach to cuts in administration and to the imposition of taxation.  Rather than cut services, as in the case of educational services, overhead expenses should be reduced.  It is accepted here, as in many other states, that a person becoming a civil servant need only turn up for the rest of his or her life and have permanent, pensionable employment until the age of 65.  Civil servants should not be immune from redundancy, which would be much preferable to service cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farm modernisation scheme is being scrapped, although there is no mention of reducing the numbers employed in the Department of Agriculture. It is not clear whether such an approach has been considered, but if not, why not?  Employment in the civil service has become far too cosy because of the lack of responsibility and of the very substantial increases in salary in the seventies. It is fair to say that these people do not face the same hazards as in the private sector.  The lack of accountability means <Col N="740" /> that the taxpayers' money is wasted year in, year out because nobody in the Department is held responsible &mdash; either the Minister or the civil servants involved.</P>
    <P>In considering cuts in the various areas, the interested parties should first be consulted as to how the cuts should be implemented with the least unfavourable impact.  Could the teachers' unions have been asked to pinpoint wastage in the day-to-day running of the education system? Likewise with agriculture, many of whose services, free heretofore, it is proposed to cut.  The people concerned should have been asked for their opinions and proposals on providing the necessary services.  It is ridiculous that horticultural advisers, free of charge, visit people and suggest how they should maintain their gardens.  This also applies to the farm home advisory service.</P>
    <P>The small business sector is to a large extent overlooked, although there has been some effort to consider it in the recent past.  Certainly in the late sixties and early seventies this sector was overlooked. Its position at present is hazardous, because it is based on selling into the home market.  It is the backbone of our economy and must be given priority. Recent IDA policy documents have laid a significant emphasis on the encouragement of small businesses rather than the promotion of very large enterprises, which cost a fortune to entice here in the first place, cost a fortune to develop, are very difficult to manage and cause chaos if they fail.  This has happened in recent cases such as Fieldcrest, Ferenka and others. We concentrated on large businesses in the seventies and have been over-generous with the multinationals, who should have contributed more.  In return for the grants received, there should have been a commitment on their part to use Irish products along the line, as the company progresses.  This would have a spin-off effect on a lot of Irish businesses. The media portray the small business man as one who does well for himself, drives a large car, probably costing £50,000 as Deputy Mac Giolla suggests, holidays abroad, fiddles his tax returns and avoids paying his VAT and PAYE <Col N="741" /> unless pressed to do so.  There is a great lack of understanding of the position of the small business man on the part of the general public, and the Revenue Commissioners and the public service who deal with them.  A small number are dishonest, fiddle their tax returns and do not pay their PAYE, but the majority try as far as possible to keep within the rules.</P>
    <P>In recent media coverage small business people have tended to be tarred with the same brush without any consideration being given as to why taxes are not paid in time.  There is no feeling shown for their difficulties, particularly in the area of cash flow which most businesses now face.  Of course this difficulty becomes even greater during a recessionary period, particularly in a recession such as we are now experiencing.  There was the spectacle of an official from the Irish Taxes Union on a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme calling for greater powers for himself and his colleagues so that they could effectively go around pestering small businesses for completion of returns and so on.</P>
    <P>The Government constitute a large burden on the back of small business. Any small businessman will tell one that he has a pain in the neck dealing with returns which must be made to different Departments.  In any one week a small businessman may have to deal with PAYE, PRSI, VAT returns, with queries from the Statistics Office, others from AnCO, together with levies, along with Companies Office returns and forms from various other Government Departments. Government have decided that small business people should do their job for them.  That is wrong and places tremendous pressure on the backs of these ordinary people who may set up their own little businesses comprising one, two or up to 40 or 50 employees and who have done so through hard work.  In many cases they do not understand many of the forms they must complete.  At the same time they are being hounded and expected to act as tax collectors for the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that small business people should undertake <Col N="742" /> that task for them and then proceed to hound them to ensure they do so.  This is wrong and these business people have been saying so for years.  One might well ask how does a small businessman set up in the first place?  Who gives him the money?  He cannot go to the bank, they will not facilitate him because he is a PAYE worker, as Deputy Mac Giolla said.

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy in the fact that by speaking about the small businessman, the worker and the PAYE sector generally I was able to drive out The Workers' Party from the Dáil Chamber. This is what embarrasses them most because it is they who are needed to hold the country up by its bootstraps.  They are the people who will do so if helped. I am glad that Deputy De Rossa could not listen to any more of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was contending that the Government are on the backs of small businessmen to a great extent.  I was saying how difficult it is for such people to get started.  They will have no capital, no cash flow and must build up their businesses by working round the clock.  Such a businessman may have to mortgage his house twice.  Probably he will have to furnish personal guarantees. He takes enormous risks, living under enormous pressure.  At present I do not think the Revenue Commissioners take account of the enormous pressures being exerted on small businesses, particularly those carrying a huge number of debtors.  Such businessmen must pay over their PAYE and VAT contributions.  I <Col N="743" /> met a small businessman recently in Limerick who employed between 15 and 30 people and who had a turnover of over £1 million.  He told me he had lost £20,000 in the last two years.  He said he cannot sleep at night he is under such pressure; he is owed a huge amount of money for the last couple of years because of the recession.  This man had had four heart attacks in one year.  Because of the special industry in which he engages he has the added problem of endeavouring to get goods cleared through customs and paying large sums of money, perhaps £20,000 or £30,000, in order to get these goods cleared, VAT having been imposed at point of entry.  I know many people in a similar position.  That man told me he is working for his workers, trying to keep his business going.  I hope that is an area the Minister will examine in the near future.  Indeed I implore him to do so because of the enormous job potential in that area and what that could do for the country generally.</P>
    <P>In addition, small businesses are penalised if they do not perform in accordance with rules devised by civil servants, often bearing no resemblance to what actually goes on in the business world.  It is most inappropriate that people with no experience of small businesses should lay down rules and regulations as to how they should perform, without any regard as to whether the rules suit those businesses. I submit that that is the case.  The system of collecting VAT also imposes a significant cash disadvantage on small businesses because they have to account for VAT sales before they receive the relevant cash, which constitutes another strain on them.</P>
    <P>I might mention one other area to which insufficient attention is given by the Revenue Commissioners and in respect of which the Minister's Department might do something, that is the black economy.  It is very difficult to estimate its worth but experienced economic commentators estimate its worth at perhaps hundreds of millions of pounds. These constitute another threat to the small, legitimate businessmen trying to pay VAT, PAYE, corporation tax and so <Col N="744" /> on, the people who are endeavouring to keep within the bounds of the law to the best of their ability.  Yet the black economy is allowed run riot, with people being allowed undercut these other legitimate business people.  Such operators are putting the money in their back pockets. As Deputy Mac Giolla said, probably these are the people going about in £50,000 cars enjoying the fruits of their labours while the legitimate cannot.</P>
    <P>I have admiration for the IDA enterprise programme, which must be attractive to anybody with an entrepreneurial spirit, anybody endeavouring to get a business going here without being bogged down by Government.  Although the IDA talk about 50 jobs or more being created in such small businesses I think they should encourage as many people as possible to start off one-man businesses, making it easy for them by way of grants. I know that the system of IDA grants certainly is not geared to small, indigenous businesses here because until recently the IDA really did not want to know such people whereas an alien received a better deal.  I am glad that their attention is turning now to the small, indigenous business.  Our young people should be afforded such opportunity. I disagree vehemently with my colleague, Deputy Kelly, when he contends that we should be preparing our young people for emigration or jobs abroad.  This is a small country with a flexible economy.  It has a very flexible economy and it would not take much to turn it around.  I was very heartened at the CII conference last week to hear the chief executive of one of the top three companies in the country saying that the budget has made a start, that it has tidied everything up and got us on an even plane and that we can now plan the way ahead. The type of business in which this company is engaged is a barometer of the economy and the company has been known to make statements, usually very constructive, advising the Government of the day or correcting them if they feel they are wrong.</P>
    <P>I believe a boost should be given to the building industry, which is recognised as being a key motivator in getting the <Col N="745" /> economy moving.  I suggest that the Minister should consider extending the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to profits in the construction sector in order to make it more attractive to possible investors. This has been granted to the manufacturing sector.  There was an example during the past couple of years of how magnanimity can give a boost to a sector.  I refer to Section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981. We have to decide whether &ldquo;property&rdquo; is a dirty word or whether &ldquo;profit&rdquo; is a dirty word and whether or not we have a mixed economy.  If we accept that we have a mixed economy, what is wrong with investing, provided we pay our taxes and help our fellow men?  If people decide to invest in flats as a result of section 23, thereby giving employment to 10,000 people, what is wrong with that? It is estimated that about £450 million is available for investment in the private sector and it is a matter of encouraging that investment.  The figure was given in a recent statement by the head of the IDA.  I believe people would be willing to take the risk of investing in the construction industry it they felt there was some encouragement.  We could then aim for the 30,000 jobs we are talking about.</P>
    <P>There was a turnover last year of £1.2 billion in the building industry and the increase in VAT on the building industry, from 3 per cent to 5 per cent, amounts therefore to £12 million.  This poses a serious problem for firms which have entered into fixed price contracts.  The sum involved for the cheapest house is £700 and companies stand to lose substantial sums of money because of the retrospective nature of VAT in this instance.  This is a phenomenon which is unique to fixed price contracts because the time at which the contract is made is different to the time at which the consideration passes and therefore the liability to VAT arises.  House builders who have entered into fixed price contracts stand to lose 2 per cent of the selling price of the house at the close of sale.</P>
    <P>The construction industry has taken a hammering in the past year, especially through the manner of operation of the Housing Finance Agency.  I heard vociferous criticism on this point from Members <Col N="746" /> now on the Government side who were then in Opposition.  The most vociferous person is now the Minister for the Environment.  He has the opportunity to correct the imbalance which he believed to be there and he can expedite the payment of loans from the Housing Finance Agency.  That alone would give a boost to the house building sector.  Many small builders have gone to the wall during the past year waiting for loans to come through while paying interest on bank overdrafts.</P>
    <P>Section 35 of the Value Added Tax Act, 1972, provides for adjustment of prices in certain circumstances to take account of increases in VAT, but this provision does not resolve the problem in respect of fixed price contracts for house building.  In respect of fixed price contracts entered into before 9 February 1983 the increase in the rate of VAT must be deferred to 31 December 1983.  A similar arrangement was made in respect of the tourist industry.  The Minister should consider this matter.</P>
    <P>The extension of section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981, which will come up for review in the coming year, is very important to many people in the private sector.  If people wish to build flats or apartments which will come under section 23 they must start them now.  The relief provided by this section has been very successful in attracting funds into construction.  It has been of benefit to the economy and has also had beneficial social effects.  It is estimated that this measure has been responsible for the construction of over 2,000 houses and flats in the past 18 months, particularly in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  In 1982 alone over 800 new flats were completed, compared with 437 in 1981, and approximately 360 of these, representing 45 per cent of the total, have been directly attributed to section 23.  Over 1,000 new flats were started in 1982, compared with 787 in 1981 and 342 in 1980.  These flats show the significance of section 23 to the construction industry.  The benefits of the section could be greatly expanded.  It was introduced in 1981 for an initial three-year period but to qualify for relief new units must be built and let prior to March <Col N="747" /> 1984.  It is imperative that the measure be renewed in the next few months.  I draw the Minister's attention to it in the hope that he will do something.  I do not think it is costing the State one penny.  Otherwise there will be an interruption in construction activities in the period from the summer of 1983 to the spring of 1984.</P>
    <P>Funds being invested by private individuals in section 23 dwellings are being put to productive use in the provision of jobs and housing.  It is the Government's stated objective to increase housing output to 30,000 units per year.  If that is the case, every assistance possible should be given to prospective house owners.  That is particularly desirable at the moment because the resources available under the public housing programme must be limited.</P>
    <P>If we extended to the building industry the 10 per cent rate at present afforded to manufacturing industry, this would give a very large boost to the private sector of the construction industry.  In this industry the relief from tax in respect of retained profits is of crucial importance, given its requirement for high levels of investment in land and work in progress.  The construction industry is extremely labour intensive as compared with other industries which are increasingly dependent on technology and, as a consequence, are less labour intensive.</P>
    <P>The encouragement of the retention of funds in the industry will lead to an expansion of the industry, the creation of jobs, and increased efficiency by way of greater investment in plant and working capital.  Since the products of the industry are all for the home market, they increase the wealth of the country directly.  The construction industry is dominated by Irish companies with negligible foreign participation.  As a result, profits generated by the industry are retained within the country.  This should be contrasted with companies benefiting under the export sales relief scheme which repatriate a substantial part of their profits to the countries in which their owners are resident.</P>
    <P>In previous budgets there was talk of attracting private funds for enterprise <Col N="748" /> normally funded by the State.  The only example I know where this is succeeding is in the case of the new bridge over the Liffey at Ringsend which is financed by a private company.  I cannot see why other cash tied up in pension funds, and so on, should not be tapped by the State to provide other much needed infrastructure. As I see it, the arrangement would work whereby private funds would be directed into the building of roads, hospitals, and so on, and these would be paid for by the public on use.  It is common in other countries to have toll roads and I do not see why they should not be introduced here.  If the funds were used in this way, this would release other funds to improve, for example, the appalling conditions of our minor roads.</P>
    <P>The tax system should encourage those who are prepared to work hard.  If they earn more money from so doing, good luck to them.  I do not hold with adopting a begrudger attitude, dragging everybody down to the lowest common denominator. The financial pressures are enormous on many people who are trying to get going in business.  For some this involves borrowing money and pledging other assets including their house as security. If such a person is prepared to take the risk and does make a profit, he is entitled to enjoy that profit.  The State is not right to persecute him because he is successful, and we should not encourage the begrudger mentality.  I want to lay emphasis on the difficulties encountered by business during this recession and the nuisance of having to deal with Government correspondence especially when the Government hold all the aces.</P>
    <P>I attended the CII conference.  I did not like the suggested imposition of a pay freeze on the public service.  I agree with the Taoiseach's stance on that.  At this conference it was very instructive to hear the captains of industry discussing their plight and their future.  It was not a depressing conference.  Their hopes for the future are not depressed either.  Great stress was laid on the flexibility in the Irish economy and the fact that it is much better than the economies of some EEC countries.  We should have more indigenous industry and ownership.  If the <Col N="749" /> European economy recovers, this will help the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the approach taken in this budget.  It is a fair budget.  It has been accepted by the community.  Although everybody realises its harshness, the reasons for it are all accepted.  People realise it is an attempt to put the economy back on the rails after the mismanagement of the past five years.  It is heartening to find that the Opposition share this view and have come around to the Government's view that we cannot encourage further foreign borrowing and we must put our house in order.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that there is not enough money to pump into the economy.  I am confident that, if we leave it to our own ingenuity, to the different Ministeries and individual Members of the House, we will be able to harness the tremendous resources we have in our young people.  Given the opportunity, we will tackle the economy and put it right within the coming years.  We need to restore order to our public finances and we need sustained effort over the coming few years.  We should give a higher priority to cutting public expenditure and restoring competitiveness to Irish industry. Together we will be able to do this and I detect from my constituency and from the other speakers that there is now an air of confidence.  During the CII conference it was pointed out by many speakers that there is no need to be depressed about the future because we have the remedy in our own hands to sort out our problems.  I endorse this budget and support the Minister.  I will be passing on my suggestions to him and I am confident that the Government will in the coming months formulate a plan to tackle the problems of the economy and that we will be back on the road to recovery very shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>When the last speaker and his colleague in The Workers' Party abandoned the contest to determine which of them represented the workers of their common constituency, I found it very difficult to disagree with much of what Deputy Skelly said, especially in regard to his remarks about the need for <Col N="750" /> fostering and encouraging small industry. However, no industry will find solace or consolation in the budget, even though Deputy Skelly said he regarded it as a new beginning and a levelling plane for all.  I regard it as a final blow as far as industry is concerned.  If a level plane is to be attained it is likely to be the floor because, after the implementation of many of the provisions contained in the budget, that is where much of our industry will find itself.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is par for the course in any budget debate that it would have a very mixed reception, both from the media and the public, but this has not been the case in respect of the present budget.  It has met with universal condemnation from all sides.  It has been described as Draconian, tough, harsh and a grab all, give nothing budget.  The list of derogatory epithets which have been applied to the measures in the budget have, by now, been exhausted.  Surprisingly, sections of the media which traditionally have been favourable to the policies of the Coalition have described it as hopeless.  This budget gives no hope to organised industry, to the community or to the individual.  In all its accompanying verbosity, there is nothing to give the ordinary citizen any reason to hope that, after enduring the harsh measures it proposes for the coming year, we will be any nearer to solving our outstanding problems of unemployment and inflation.  On the contrary, there is every indication that, as far as those problems are concerned, we will be in a much worse position.  There is already provision in the budget of £31 million for increased unemployment.  The Minister and economic commentators acknowledge that the budget will add 3½ per cent to the cost of living, which, when other factors are taken into account, will be nearer 5 per cent.  We will then be back up to 18 per cent or 20 per cent inflation, which is a very undesirable situation when one considers that the last Government brought inflation down over the last eight or nine months to 12 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most disturbing feature of the budget is that it does not contain any evidence that the Government, despite their loud and persistent promises to the <Col N="751" /> electorate a few short months ago, have the skill or the talent to tackle those problems effectively.  There is nothing to foster a spirit of enterprise in any sector of industry, in business or in the individual. I realise there is a very limited scope for the exercise of imagination in dealing with budgetary matters and in coming to grips with the besetting problems in our economy.  However, after all the passionate denunciation of the alleged mismanagement of Fianna Fáil administrations in this regard and the glib assurances that have been given to the electorate by the Government, one would expect at least some evidence of new thinking on these problems.  If we could not have had an imaginative approach, one would at least have expected some originality of thought.</P>
    <P>Only that I know how industrious and committed the Minister is, one would be tempted to say it is a lazy man's budget, because he has taken all the soft options. The problem was to collect as much in taxation as possible and to cut and save public expenditure.  Taxation was imposed on all the old reliables and cuts were made where it could be guaranteed that the money would remain in Government coffers.  We had an increase in income tax, PRSI and VAT.  The result of the imposition of this taxation is by now well spelled out.</P>
    <P>The indications are serious for the nation.  Undoubtedly the budget will cause an increasing number of fatalities in industry, more people will be thrown out of employment and there will be a large reduction in living standards.  Of course there will be more pressing demands for increases in wages.  Unfortunately there will be more industrial unrest and many people will be forced below the subsistence or poverty line. The budget has not allowed any incentives in the tax arrangements proposed. So we go around the old merry-go-round. Instead of the Government using the budget as a method to stop this unfortunate state of affairs, by their actions they have accelerated the pace of the merry-go-round.</P>
    <P>The Government are not without their <Col N="752" /> excuses.  They have said Fianna Fáil intended to implement a similar type of budget.  That may be true but there are vast discrepancies in the thinking of Fianna Fáil and the Government.  The thinking behind Fianna Fáil policy, as enunciated in the document <i>The Way Forward</i> and as evidenced in the Book of Estimates, was to protect existing industry, to foster additional employment and to hold down inflation.  The budget will have the opposite effect on the economy.</P>
    <P>It is no excuse for the Government to say that the budget, even in its broad parameters, was drafted by the outgoing Government.  It is now their responsibility. They had the responsibility of introducing the budget and they cannot run away from it.  As one commentator said, what is the point in holding elections if after an election the incoming Government merely implement what the outgoing Government said they would do? It is also being dishonest with the electorate. Before the election, the parties now in Government sought the votes of the electorate on the basis that they would save them from the harsh budgetary measures Fianna Fáil were alleged to be cooking up at the time.</P>
    <P>Every sector of the community will feel the harsh lash of this budget but business and industry will be particularly affected. There is nothing in the budget that will give solace or encouragement, that will foster the spirit of enterprise or help the entrepreneurial talent in the community. Apparently efforts to attract new industry will be relaxed and existing industrial firms will be put under additional strain because of increases in the price of energy and fuel, increases on VAT and increases in postal, telecommunications and transport costs.  All these will take their toll of existing industry.  Last year approximately 700 firms went to the wall and about 420 firms are on the critical list. Many of them are bound to succumb because of the additional pressures that will be placed on them as a result of the budget.  The result will be an increase in the ranks of the unemployed and there will be an additional corresponding strain on the Exchequer to meet the benefits <Col N="753" /> which the unemployed are entitled to receive.</P>
    <P>Faced with this stark reality, one wonders if in framing the budget the Government and the Minister for Finance were concerned about the plight of industry and business in the present economic climate. Nobody denies that industry is under grave strain and can do with every support from the public and the Government. In this connection, there is one organisation which I believe enjoys the support of the public and that is the organisation dealing with the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  We have a duty to support our own industries particularly when they are capable, as they are in so many cases, of producing goods comparable with imported goods.  However, the duty to support Irish industry does not fall only on the consumer, it also devolves on business people.  All too often even when the Irish product is equally good value as compared with the foreign item it is proferred as a second or third choice to a customer.  Too many business people&mdash; not just in Dublin and other cities but throughout the country &mdash; looking perhaps to their own short-term interest are very slow in giving prominence to Irish products in their place of business.  They are slow to offer them as a first choice to their customers.  That is extremely regrettable when we consider that in buying foreign goods we are endangering the jobs and livelihood of our own people who are engaged in the production of similar products here.  Unfortunately imported products are not confined to the manufacturing end.  It is a national scandal that so many imported food products are available on the shelves of supermarkets and shops.  In a land where we take pride in having good farmers and the best land in Europe it is a scandal that we should witness so many instances of the importation of foreign food products.</P>
    <P>As regards some of the other industries, I came across a very interesting statistic a couple of weeks ago in relation to the clothing industry here.  The importation of foreign manufactured goods in that industry has increased from 48 per cent of the home market in 1976 to a <Col N="754" /> staggering 78 per cent in that same market in 1981 with, of course, a consequential loss of many jobs here in that industry. Therefore, it behoves us all, people in business and customers alike, to foster and promote the Irish product, and we have no need to apologise to anybody for doing so.  We are told that EEC regulations forbid this and that, but I have noticed that when the national interest of some other member country of the EEC is at stake they are quite quick to take remedial action and they do not mind incurring the wrath of their fellow-members. We too should be prepared to take a stand more often when our national interest and the welfare of our people are at stake.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly made a great case for small business and small industry, but one thing that will militate against business and industry is the black market. Unfortunately, we have all too many instances now of people going across the Border into the North of Ireland to do some shopping.  It is a pity that the Government by the terms of this budget will have encouraged and increased this activity rather than stemmed it.  This will be particularly noticeable in the towns and townlands close to the Border where the variation in price of items like petrol, for instance, is so great that it is now very well worth people's time to travel fairly long distances in order to be able to purchase this and similar goods in quantity. It is not just the damaging effect that this will have on our economy here and on the traders who will be adversely affected by such traffic, but we have also to take into account the strain it will put on our Garda and other security officers who have to deal with this situation.  We have also to take into account the increased tensions that it will cause as a result in the Border area.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the budgetary terms is the detrimental effect they will have on the competitiveness of our industry and business and our ability to sell goods abroad.  This will be particularly noticeable to people engaged in this business and many firms here are engaged in the export business.  There were signs already that we were losing our competitive edge <Col N="755" /> in foreign markets.  Over the years there has been a fall in the percentage of the traditional markets &mdash; for instance in Britain &mdash; that we have.  That is not due to a fall in or a dimunition of the market as a whole because alongside the drop in percentage points in the market we saw our rivals for the same market increase their percentage, and that could be done only because we were losing out on competitiveness in this market as will be the case in similar markets.  Unfortunately, the terms of the budget will increase that danger.  There is no point in a firm producing goods if they do not sell them.  A firm engaged in the production of goods for export must maintain competitiveness, otherwise they will go out of business. The budget in addition to the extra taxation has brought about the possibility of extra strains in industrial relations, extra wages, inordinate wage demands which will have to be met as a result of the overall terms of the budget affecting the lives of ordinary people who will seek to maintain in so far as they can the standard of living for themselves and their families which they have enjoyed heretofore.</P>
    <P>The budget also appears to have at least blunted the determination to attract new industry.  Many of the agencies involved in the attraction of new industry have suffered cuts in their allocation.  The IDA, for instance, have been reduced by £6 million, SFADCo by £3 million, Údarás na Gaeltachta by £1.7 million and AnCO by £1.6 million.  Though these may be small figures in comparison with the sums allocated to these agencies, nevertheless a psychological blow has been struck at their morale.  One thing we cannot afford to slacken from now on is our effort to attract new industry here and we should not appear, for the sake of saving small sums of money, to be in any way wilting in our determination to continue our support of agencies such as the IDA who have worked so well to our advantage in that regard since their foundation.</P>
    <P>These reductions have serious implications for the unemployed, particularly for the young.  We take great pride <Col N="756" /> in having the youngest population in Europe and boast that 50 per cent of them are aged under 25 years.  What a colossal waste to condemn this our greatest resource with all their talent and eagerness to a life of idleness and the dole, if they are lucky enough to get it. Apart from the loss to the country in economic terms such a life must be detrimental to their normal development. The spectacle of such a large section of the population being forced to accept that society is not capable of providing them with employment must have serious implications for democracy.  These young people have a right to expect that they will have an opportunity to live useful and satisfying lives as members of society. They will find little in the budget to endear our society to them.  Employment in the public sector has been curtailed and the prospect for industry is further unemployment.  The development corporation was set up and £7 million was allocated to it.  Apart from the fact that this is a paltry sum of money and a far cry from the £200 million which it was said would be allocated to it in pre-election speeches, I doubt if there is any necessity for such an agency.  We have plenty of State and semi-State organisations which can offer employment and do useful work.</P>
    <P>Industry is affected by capital cuts and cuts in public expenditure.  The CII have said that the development of manufacturing industry is hampered by inadequacies in road systems, water and sewerage systems, telecommunications and technological services.  They also said that capital spending to improve these areas would improve the competitive position of the productive sector by cutting down costs associated with inadequate infrastructure. While the cuts may be small relative to the sum allocated, it is a retrograde step and a psychological blow when one has to take a step back in face of the overwhelming need to take a step forward. Industries which looked for concessions because of pressures caused by the present economic climate were not given any.  I am thinking particularly of the clothing and motor industries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> The motor industry has taken a terrible hammering.  It is true that it takes a hammering in all budgets but this budget has outdone the others.  Look at the increase in the price of fuel &mdash; 26p over the last month.  When the price of oil dropped on the world market the unfortunate motorist got no share of the benefit.  Road tax was increased.  The industry made a strong case for the reduction of 18 per cent VAT charged on repair work done in garages to 3 per cent, which then applied to the building and construction industry.  There was a compelling reason for granting this concession.  The trade was in a deep recession and we all know this meant loss of employment in garages and a reduction in the intake of apprentices. Far from granting that concession the last budget increased the VAT rate from 18 per cent to 23 per cent.  This was a blind move.  Not only will it lead to further unemployment in the trade and encourage back-street business, mechanics, garages and so on, with resultant loss of revenue to the Exchequer, but it has serious implications for road safety.  In present circumstances people suffering a reduction in their living standards will be penny-pinching.  There are many basic items which must be provided for a family and there is grave danger that attention to a motor vehicle will be put on the long finger.  When it is attended to perhaps it will not be done by a suitably qualified person.  This could have serious implications for road safety.  I trust that everyone, no matter what, will realise that as regards the maintenance of motor vehicles it is essential that they are kept in good mechanical condition.  This could be a matter of life or death on the road.</P>
    <P>As a rural Deputy I have looked at many of the provisions in the budget in that context.  There was a time when a car was regarded as a luxury, but that time has long since passed.  While there is public transport in the cities and towns there are many parts of rural Ireland where there is no such thing.  People must rely on motor cars.  A motor car used to be a luxury but now it has become a necessity.  I am sure everybody appreciates that life in rural Ireland would be very drab without a motor car.  There are <Col N="758" /> no telephones in many parts of rural Ireland so that if there is a chronic illness a motor car is a necessity to bring medical aid in time of need.</P>
    <P>The tax burdens placed on the motor industry will affect other industries. Tourism will be very badly affected by the increased charges on motorists.  We have the highest motoring costs in Europe and this is bound to affect our tourist industry, particularly when we take into account the increase in the price of drink and other increased taxation.  I believe that even the patriotic tourists who accepted the Bord Fáilte advice to see Ireland first will not be inclined to do so from now on.  Many of those people will have a second think about the wisdom of having a holiday in Ireland when, as well as the increased cost of motoring, you take into account the increased cost of normal holiday activities as a result of the budget.  We have many natural advantages to attract people to visit us but we also have some natural disadvantages. The recent increases in the budget will not help the people engaged in the tourist industry or those engaged in enticing visitors from abroad.</P>
    <P>The building industry has been very badly hit by the budget.  This industry has always been regarded as the barometer of our economic wellbeing but it is now in the doldrums.  The VAT changes will mean that approximately £1,000 will be added to the price of the average house. There is a reduction of £18 million in the money allocated for public authority housing and an £8 million levy on developers. Those things will naturally have a depressing effect on the industry and will mean that more people will be unemployed.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is our main industry.  We like to pay lip service to this industry and to farmers.  We talk a lot about the return we get from investment in the industry and what it has attracted in grants from the EEC.  When we look at what the budget has in store for this industry we see that the Government expect an increase in the amount of income tax being paid by farmers from £29 million for last year to £47 million this year.  The £29 million showed a shortfall from the <Col N="759" /> £42 million expected.  I am quite sure the Revenue Commissioners did not listen to any sob stories farmers had to tell them. I am sure they just as efficiently went after farmers liable for taxation as they did after any other person.  The shortfall must be due to the fact, which is staring everybody in the face who cares to recognise it, that farmers are not making the kind of money people believe they are making.</P>
    <P>The increase of £5 million which the Government expect to get from farmers will be in addition to the rates which they will have to pay, which last year they could offset against income tax demands. Many farmers affected by the budget are in my part of the country.  In the disadvantaged areas we find many small and medium sized farms.  The budget provides for halting the farm modernisation service, termination of the group fodder scheme and a reduction of £3,500 of farm income for the cattle headage scheme. Farmers will now have to pay for visits by the ACOT staff.  Grants for mobile equipment and farm accounts are also abolished.  Those measures will hardly encourage farmers to improve their land and to go after higher production.  They will have a detrimental effect on the industry.  That will have the effect of diminishing rather than increasing production.</P>
    <P>Only last week we read in the papers a statement made by Professor Raftery to the effect that with proper husbandry, support and encouragement we could double our agricultural exports within a decade with all the advantages that would bring by way of creating employment by the processing of produce and other spin-off activities.  However, the industry is not being given the necessary encouragement and support so far as this budget is concerned.  Many of the farmers I represent would be regarded as under-developed small farmers who would be in need of all the grants they have been able to obtain by way of the disadvantaged areas scheme, not only in terms of improving their farms but of maintaining themselves and their families in frugal comfort.</P>
    <P>Many of these farmers were able to <Col N="760" /> avail of social welfare assistance but this scheme has been changed radically.  It was introduced more than 20 years ago and a farmer's eligibility for assistance was related to the valuation of his land. The payment of this money was for the purpose of encouraging small farmers to improve their holdings, of helping to keep families on the land while allowing them to enjoy a reasonable standard of living.  To that extent it was successful. Without it, we would have many more thousands of waste acres throughout the western region.  In addition, we would have fewer towns because the viability of communities in the west for a number of years past has been linked to payment of the dole.  These moneys provided stability for town populations.  Many of the towns concerned have been through times of recession and are now developing as towns.  However, I do not deny that the social welfare assistance scheme was in need of reform but it is not fair to alter it in the radical way in which it is being altered.</P>
    <P>I agree with the recent court ruling that one's PLV should not be regarded as the yardstick in the matter of the assessment of taxes but conversely it should not be used to determine eligibility for social welfare assistance especially when so many of the people concerned would qualify anyway on the basis of factual assessment.  Therefore, while this whole area should be reconsidered, there should be an intermediary period during which schemes would be made available to farmers in order to help them increase their productivity and ensure that they are employed gainfully on their lands. The problem of many of those people is that their holdings are not adequate to provide a decent income and in the areas in question there is no opportunity for off the land employment.</P>
    <P>Instead of bringing about radical reform in the payment of social assistance, I would prefer to see the entire social welfare area being reviewed.  I regret that the Government did not see fit to grant greater increases to the old, the sick and others who depend totally on social welfare.  While we are in a difficult period financially, an increase of 12 <Col N="761" /> per cent in social welfare payments when the anticipated rate of inflation is 18 per cent is not dealing fairly with the weaker sections.  It is no answer for the Government to say that social welfare beneficiaries received a 25 per cent increase last year when Fianna Fáil were in office.  We gave them a 25 per cent increase in the previous year also but many of them are having difficulty in existing on their meagre incomes.  The fact that they were granted the larger increases in the past two years is no justification for giving them only 12 per cent this year or for saying that on balance they are still ahead of inflation.</P>
    <P>I deplore the abandonment, and it is not the postponement, of the decentralisation programme.  If this programme had gone ahead as planned it would have meant a lot to the west and south-west regions.  First, it would have given to young people particularly the opportunity to work in the public sector in their own areas instead of having all of them rushing off to the city and putting an even greater strain on the infrastructure here.  I am sure that private enterprise could be encouraged to make progress in this whole area of decentralisation.  Those young people who go to the city to work in the public sector, very often in over-crowded conditions, are not helping either themselves or the communities they come from. Dublin is already over-populated.  If we do not tackle the problem of infrastructure in the city now, the whole exercise will prove extremely costly and much more difficult in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I find the budget very disappointing especially in terms of its impact on the disadvantaged areas, on employment and on industry.  There is no justification for the Government saying that they were constrained in any way by reason of pre-budgetary measures or policy decisions taken by the previous Government. That is only a cop-out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say it was a long hour I spent listening to Deputy Morley.  Like other Opposition Deputies, he felt obliged to finish up on a note of blame and accusation against this <Col N="762" /> Government for introducing this budget, but he made an effort to be constructive in many areas.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to reply to points raised by other Deputies but I would like to deal with one raised by Deputy Morley which I found interesting and that was the importance of the Buy Irish campaign. We should be aware of the importance of buying our neighbours' produce and the effects this can and will have on our economy and we should be concerned to keep as many of our people at work as possible.  Any efforts that can be made in this area through our educational system or public relations organisations are worthwhile.</P>
      <P>What I am about to say is not always the most popular thing, but I do not accept that the cries for protection every time an industry gets into difficulty or our market is penetrated from outside should be taken up by responsible elected representatives, the Government or people in power.  There are occasions when we can make allegations of unfair competition and accuse others of dumping or selling on our markets at subsidised rates &mdash; and there is a certain amount of that going on at present &mdash; but we must be extremely selective in the industries where we call for this protection.  We should not be so quick to say: &ldquo;Look at the way the French break the rules; look what they did to our lamb in 1977.  Look what the British are doing to the Common Agricultural Policy.  Let us build a barrier and prevent their goods coming in.&rdquo;  The other side of the coin is that every time we build a barrier and prevent an industry selling on our markets, we increase our cost of living and encourage yet another industry to become less competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can always make a case to the European Commission, and sometimes it could be sustained before the European Court, that for certain reasons some industries require and are entitled to that sort of protection.  But it would be very wrong for us to give the impression to our vast numbers of young unemployed or to encourage directors and management in industry in the view that we can by any measure of protection insulate <Col N="763" /> them against the effects of competition within a reasonable trading order which we are seeking to establish in the industrialised world.  There is nothing easier to do than build up racial or international antagonism against foreign competitors, but we must remember that we participate in an open economy.  We more than anyone else require open trading if we are to attract industries of any size.  If we are to attract modern high technology capital intensive industries the investors must be assured that they have a base from which they can sell on the European market and further afield.  If we are to attract these people not only must our labour relations be right and our wage rates competitive, but we must pursue the kind of foreign policy in which we will be seen to live in harmony with neighbouring states, recognising their problems and telling them about ours.</P>
    <P>Recently I was approached outside this country by the president of an international industry who said that Irish people should be aware of the creeping protectionism of Europe, the very thing for which we blame other people.  He pointed out that Ireland is the country which would suffer most if this protectionism develops in Europe, because if the French, Germans or British decide to throw up barriers against high technology goods produced by capital intensive industries, we will be among the first to suffer.  He pointed out that we had already lost one or two important industries for which we had been bidding.  It is important to note that our rating with the American investor has dropped from first to a doubtful third place, with Britain and Germany being more attractive.</P>
    <P>When we offer our people the soft solution, the easy way out of competition, we should remember that, while it may be politically sweet music to the ears of redundant workers and very acceptable to the directors and management in industry who are feeling the pinch, in the end it will cost us jobs and opportunities; and, if pursued, can only lead to a situation where Irish workers will lose their jobs and our standard of living will drop.</P>
    <P>The annual budget covers every facet <Col N="764" /> of our lives.  It is not only an exercise where we decide the services to be provided in the year ahead, but we also decide how much money will come from our taxpayers, how much will be raised within the State, how much will be borrowed, and how much will be borrowed abroad.  The provisions of the budget can have much wider effect.  They affect the standard of living of those on social welfare; they affect the competitiveness of our industries and they can make it harder for industries and services to compete with firms from abroad.  That is why a budget should not merely be an exercise in balancing the books for the year.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Government, who took office a few months ago, found themselves in a most difficult situation and did not have too many options open to them.  We had borrowed so much that it was recognised we could not borrow any more and, even if we did, that it was doubtful if we could repay it.  For all these reasons the options open to Government when drawing up the budget were not very wide because they did not know if they could introduce an expansionary budget.  The Government did not have that option.  They were deprived this year of the means at least to seek to expand employment and give some sort of stimulus, through reduced taxation or the provision of extra money, to employment and production.  It is hoped as a result of this budget that in one or two years time the Government may be able, in a better economic situation, to decide on an expansionary budget.  It was most unfortunate that the Government are not now in a position to stimulate the economy, because never was that stimulus needed more than at present.</P>
    <P>We have been suffering a depression for a number of years but its effects have not hit home as they might have because we borrowed so much recently, so insulating ourselves from the worst effects of the depression.  As has been pointed out by a previous speaker, our social welfare recipients received on average an increase of 25 per cent the year before last and 25 per cent last year which insulated them from the effects of the depression. If these recipients &mdash; the unemployed, <Col N="765" /> aged and very young &mdash; were a smaller proportion of our total population, to insulate them from the effects of the recession would not have cost so much and would not have had the same ill effect on our competitiveness and on the money left over for investment in our economy.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that before we introduced the budget the public sector had been in third place in the European Economic Community in the amount of money collected as a percentage of GDP &mdash; 56 per cent.  This amount was exceeded by only two other small countries &mdash; the Netherlands and Denmark &mdash; by two and three percentage points respectively. This budget has pushed our State expenditure as a percentage of GDP well over 60 per cent &mdash; the highest in the EEC. Whether the State by taking and administering 60 per cent of the wealth produced by all in agriculture, industry and other services is giving good or middling value for money is the question.  We have every obligation, as a Government coming into office, faced with a large bill and having a year before producing another budget &mdash; I hope that there will be no necessity for a supplementary budget, the Estimates, it is hoped, having been reasonably thought out &mdash; to ensure that we are getting good value for the money spent.  By comparison with other European countries the rise in our Government expenditure is worth noting.  In 1979 it increased by 26.3 per cent, in 1980 by 27.3 per cent, in 1981 by 25.8 per cent and in 1982 by 19.8 per cent, giving a cumulative figure of 142 per cent over those four years.  A comparable figure for the other narrow band EMS countries was 45 per cent, and 72 per cent on average for the nine European countries.  For the first half of that period we had reasonable economic growth in industry and agriculture but that was not the case in the second half.  However, the public sector demand for money still increased at a rate nearly twice as much as the more competitive EMS currency countries.</P>
    <P>The State has expanded its services so rapidly that we have not had time to organise to ensure that we were getting value for money.  In that period it seemed <Col N="766" /> accepted by politicians that we could seek to resolve our unemployment problem by putting people into the public sector.  I attended health boards and county council meetings some years ago when those statutory bodies were encouraged by central Government to provide jobs and money was given to them to provide these extra jobs.  The bodies other than health boards, were not looking for employees and were not giving an expanded service but were encouraged to take on administrative staff and engage them in paperwork of no real service to anybody.  This situation continued until the last Coalition Government came into office 18 months ago and was one of the reasons for our present situation.</P>
    <P>In addition, every Department tended to expand in an unplanned fashion, without consideration of what they wished to achieve.  This was done in the Departments of Agriculture and of Social Welfare. We made local government less competitive and less efficient when we created the health boards, taking away some of the local authority services and leaving them with the staff who had previously provided these services.  Fianna Fáil did the same when they abolished rates.  They took away local authority responsibility for housing, group water schemes and the like and left them with the people who had previously administered those schemes.  We had the ridiculous situation of all the counties having their full complement of rate collectors with very little work left for them to do. These are one or two glaring examples of lack of care in the spending of public money.</P>
    <P>In private industry, manufacturing and the private sector, if people do not get good value for money they will not take the service,but as far as public sector services are concerned the necessary taxation was raised by the Government in this Chamber whether the public liked it or not.  This led us a long way towards our present position.</P>
    <P>The budget has created problems for some industries, but the Government had little choice.  One cannot but have sympathy for those engaged in the tourist industry&mdash;the hotel proprietors who in <Col N="767" /> ever-increasing numbers are forced to close their doors because they cannot compete, not only with their foreign competitors but with some more protected sectors within the country such as guesthouses whose proprietors do not have to pay the 23 per cent VAT which hotels must pay on all their services.  When the Government get time and breathing space they will have to look at items such as petrol and drink because it will be very difficult for our tourist industry to carry on.  Every tourist will spend money on travelling and spend leisure time in the evenings in public houses, perhaps, and having meals in hotels.  We must find some solution to the ever-increasing cost of such items from the tourist point of view if we are to make it possible for the people engaged in the tourist industry, for Bord Fáilte, set up for that purpose, to attract people here.  I feel obliged to say that because I believe genuinely, considering the cost of capital investment in the hotel industry, it is very difficult for them to be competitive or to offer good value.</P>
    <P>Of course there are other areas about which one must be concerned at a time like this.  One is agriculture arising from the elimination of some development aids to that industry, for example under the farm modernisation scheme and a reduction in others, along with the imposition of some charges.  For the moment these will not make it any easier for the agricultural sector to expand and progress. At a time like this, however, we must ask ourselves also what had been happening in that industry anyway.  We must recognise that in the years 1976 to 1979, compared with other industries and services, the agricultural industry, proved it could improve its productivity at double the rate of other sectors within our economy and also engage in expanded production more rapidly than any of its competitors in the developing world. One country only in the developing world, New Zealand, had an agricultural industry expanding during that period at a rate more rapid than ours.  That gives the lie to allegations made against farmers and others in the agricultural industry <Col N="768" /> when it is contended that farmers should get up, do the job, stop crying, or that they cannot compete because they are not efficient or do not work sufficiently hard.  The facts prove that that is incorrect. Given proper economic circumstances the agricultural industry was the most capable here&mdash;I will not say internationally&mdash;but the most capable, in the right conditions, of improving its productivity.</P>
    <P>In the years since then we have had a stagnating agricultural industry, one which, in spite of the £240 million voted to it annually, has not been able to increase production at all.  That is not a reflection on the agricultural industry. But at budget time it is only fair that we ask how is this money being spent, how was the farm modernisation scheme operating, how did the western drainage scheme work, how did those aids and incentives affect the welfare of our average farmer?  The truth is they did not seem to affect his wellbeing all that much. Although any reduced spending in that area is to be regretted, the Government having taken such a decision it is time we stood back and asked ourselves if we can rechannel that money in a way which will encourage greater productivity, more of which will arrive eventually at the farmer's gate for investment.  The truth is that more than 50 per cent of that money was lost along the way in administration. Something like £50 million has been spent on the western drainage scheme over the last five years.  It must be said that as much value as possible was got for that money.  It must be noted that farmers having spent the money given them on their farms, achieved all of the objectives laid down by the Department and the EEC when it was being granted. But the Office of Public Works in the arterial drainage area achieved only something better than 50 per cent of their targets in the same period.  Therefore there is no reason to believe that the money given farmers by way of grant aid was not well spent because it was.  Yet the truth is that we did not increase by one hundredweight the amount of beef produced or our stocking rate by one livestock unit in the west during that period.  Neither did we improve farmers' <Col N="769" /> incomes which dropped by 50 per cent in real terms.  Therefore it is time we stood back and asked ourselves what are we to do with the £220 million voted for agriculture, how can we utilise it to make the industry more competitive, to improve farmers' incomes, at the same time attracting here as many grants and incentives as are available through the EEC.</P>
    <P>That is another area in which we have failed.  For example, under the disadvantaged areas scheme were we to pay out the amount of money allowed by the EEC, we could be expending £30 million more annually.  We would be receiving half of that amount from the EEC so that we could be putting £30 million into the economy for £15 million provided from our Exchequer.  Perhaps we could change the basis on which that money is spent but there is no case at all for not spending every pound of the money made available to us through the EEC in the regions for which it is intended, providing from our resources the amount required so that we may qualify for the maximum amount of grants.  The same is true of the farm modernisation scheme under which we did not receive all we could.  The same is certainly true of the farm retirement scheme where our social welfare legislation prevented a well-thought out scheme from being acceptable to our average farmer.</P>
    <P>One other problem experienced in the agricultural industry has been occasioned by the fact that our inflation rate has had the effect of increasing costs so rapidly. Being a member of the EMS and of the EEC, and having to engage in a price-fixing agreement with our partners in the Community we could not achieve the sort of prices our farmers needed if they were to enjoy the same increase in income enjoyed by their competitors in the EEC. There are many things one could say about that whole situation.  What we most like to say is that we go to Europe, attack other members of the Community, contending that they are preventing us from receiving increased prices because they do not accept the common agricultural policy.  We contend that everybody else is responsible for our problem.  It is true that not all the members of the EEC <Col N="770" /> believe or support the common agricultural policy.  It is true also that it is in the interests of some of them not to allow only the minimum increase in price of agricultural produce.  It must be recognised that, when the day is done, we sit down and fix prices.  Despite the most optimistic outlook any of us has about the sort of increased prices we would like to receive, there is no possibility that increased prices at European level will solve the problems of our farmers or of their incomes.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government, in view, of the B &amp; I Company's announced decision to abandon the Cork-Pembroke Service, to ensure that a full, regular and round the year service be provided as soon as possible between Cork and South Wales, such as operated satisfactorily for more than ten years between Cork and Swansea, and pending this outcome to ensure that a service be provided immediately by the B &amp; I Company for the remainder of 1983 in accordance with their contractual obligations.</P>
      <P>An amendment has been tabled to this motion which I reject as being inadequate. I call on the Minister to honour, as a matter of extreme urgency, the motion as I and my colleagues have presented it.  I do so because the amendment certainly does not take account of the problem which exists in Cork.  There has been a traditional link with the Welsh coast for 150 years or more, and once a service like that ends the danger is that people will forget it ever existed and it will become very difficult to start it again.</P>
      <P>The wording of the amendment is amazing.  It proposes to delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> notes the decision of the B &amp; I company to close the Cork-Pembroke Ferry Service as part of its plan to reverse its serious loss-making situation; notes also that since the decision was conveyed to the Government in October, 1982, it was not found possible by successive Governments to recommend a reversal of this decision....</P>
    <P>That is laughable.  My colleague will be able to explain later in the debate the role of the Minister in this and the fact that the Minister's approval was needed before the service could be discontinued. Deputy Jim Mitchell, Minister for Transport, is the man responsible.  I am asking that the service should be continued in 1983 to meet the contractual commitments of the company and after that I am advocating the establishment of a permanent link.  I have some suggestions as to how that link could be established.  We realise the continuing need for this ferry in the interests of Cork, Kerry and the entire region.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the employment situation. The total shore employment was 65 and 45 of those have been notified of redundancy, at a time when Cork can ill-afford any further unemployment.  I understand that 56 people employed on ship will become redundant and we are probably talking about a total of 120 people.  That is only the beginning.  Many people are employed in related jobs throughout the region.  The Government have an investment of about £30 million in B &amp; I.  The most suitable and successful service operated between Cork and South Wales was the Cork-Swansea link which operated for about ten years to 1978 or 1979.  The tourist industry, which is so dependent on this service, is probably at its lowest ebb.  Recent budget increases, particularly in VAT, will hit that industry very hard.  We know that the Hotels Federation had been lobbying for a reduction in the 18 per cent rate of VAT but instead it has been increased to 23 per cent.  This may well be a body blow to the tourist industry in the Cork-Kerry region, which is worth £117 million. <Col N="772" /> There are some areas within the region which are almost entirely dependent on tourism, particularly the peninsulas of Cork and Kerry where there is little other income to be derived.</P>
    <P>The traditional link between Cork and South Wales is remembered with sadness by many families whose relatives had to emigrate.  Then there were the years when emigration turned to immigration and people began to come home, many on the <i>Innisfallen</i>.  All the decisions taken by the company since the ending of the Cork-Swansea link have amounted to a run-down of the service.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry in the region employs 18,000 people directly, but that is only part of the story because many other people are dependent on it.  The region accounts for a very substantial part of our entire tourist industry and provides 27 per cent of our tourist accommodation. Of our hotels, 23.6 per cent are in the Cork-Kerry region, as well as 32 per cent of guesthouses, 20 per cent of town houses, 30 per cent of country homes and 31.3 per cent of farm guesthouses.  Is it to be imagined that the occupancy rate of that accommodation will not suffer?  Of course, it will.  I do not want to be divisive as between Cork and Rosslare but I reject that argument that people will still come to Cork and Kerry in the same numbers through Rosslare.  That is not feasible and that is why there is an obligation on B &amp; I to re-establish immediately a service to complete the 1983 contractual commitments to be followed by a permanent link with the Welsh coast.</P>
    <P>This is the largest tourist region in Ireland and it depends to a great extent on income from tourists.  I accept that the company introduced a five-year plan in 1977 and at that time it was announced that the intention was to introduce a continental service from 1980.  That scheme was opposed by Irish Shipping Limited and the Fianna Fáil Government of the day did not see fit to give permission to B &amp; I for it.  A very fine ship built in Verolme Dockyard, the <i>Connacht,</i> was put on the Cork-Swansea route with great expectations.  I am not sure if the management of B &amp; I took a positive decision then regarding Cork but certainly everything <Col N="773" /> that happened after that seemed to be aimed at running down the service from that harbour.  I should like to add that the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies who examined the position recommended that there should be consultation and co-ordination between B &amp; I and Irish Shipping Limited with a view to getting the maximum benefit from both companies in the national interest.  At first sight such a suggestion would appear to mean many advantages. The Government have a responsibility to ensure that all schemes are explored to the maximum with a view to restoring the service, perhaps by the companies joining forces, to the successful one it was on the Cork-Swansea route.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government did not allow B &amp; I to embark on a continental service and it appears that following that a decision was made to withdraw from Cork.  I do not wish to deal at length with the decision to purchase the jetfoil but suffice to say that it has been described since as a major mistake.  Obviously the jetfoil if it was not a success on the English Channel route would not be successful on the Irish Sea which is a lot rougher.  I understand that the cost of having that craft in dry dock is in the region of £900,000 per annum.  What an awful mistake to have made and I have no doubt that the failure of that scheme was a contributory factor in the decision to discontinue the B &amp; I service out of Cork.</P>
    <P>The successful years for the B &amp; I came to an end in 1979 when the company decided to change its base on the Welsh coast from Swansea to Pembroke.  Those who availed of the route to Swansea are aware of the good facilities on the Welsh side, the M4 to London, the motorway through Birmingham to the midlands and the hourly train service to London.  Swansea was also a very attractive town for shopping and for that reason the service was availed of by many organisations who brought their members on shopping expeditions.  I am not suggesting that we should encourage shopping trips abroad but if such trips help to maintain jobs at home we must look at them in a different light.  Pembroke never proved to be an <Col N="774" /> attractive shopping centre.  We were told that in changing the destination from Swansea to Pembroke the B &amp; I management took into consideration the tidal problem at Swansea and the advantage of a shorter sea crossing.  Whatever about those factors management's decision spelt the death knell of the service from Cork to the Welsh coast.  The Pembroke service was less attractive and the advantage of the shorter crossing time was more than negatived by the road conditions on the other side and the lack of adequate facilities.  I suspect that there was a little bit of thickness involved on both sides and with a little common sense and foresight the tidal problem could have been overcome and the move from Swansea to Pembroke need never have taken place.  My view is that the only reason for the change was to facilitate the service from Rosslare to the Welsh coast which was due to commence in 1980.  I am not trying to be divisive as between Cork and Rosslare and I have no objection to any further developments at Rosslare but I object to discrimination in favour of a Rosslare crossing as against a crossing from Cork.</P>
    <P>I am sure the business people of Swansea would welcome a return of the ferry service which I hope B &amp; I and Irish Shipping Limited will organise.  Since 1979 B &amp; I have been pretending to give a service but have been providing one that was not accommodating and unsuitable from the point of view of those using it.  Twelve months ago I attended a protest meeting and I heard a man who had used the service for many years saying that he would use air travel in future because of the decision to move from Swansea to Pembroke.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I had ten very successful years. They carried about a million people and 200,000 cars in that period.  All the people concerned in B &amp; I should note that and, if mistakes have been made, to reverse the decision which has been so damaging. I can give last year's figures for the Cork-Swansea service: 51,000 cars and 219,000 passengers.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that management consulted the works committee representing all the works' interests in Cork.  They told <Col N="775" /> them they were linking Rosslare with the Welsh coast, with the advantages of its being a shorter sea route and that they could compete with British Rail on equal terms, and that the costs at Pembroke could be shared by the two services. Whatever advantages those may have been, the travelling public were being more and more inconvenienced.  The company claimed that Rosslare would be profitable and would not interfere with them.  The workers were assured that this would be a move in their interests rather than being, as it now transpires, effectively the end of their employment with that company.  The work force saw Rosslare as a help.  They were given these commitments by the company.  I am sorry to say those commitments did not materialise and, instead of being a profitable organisation, Rosslare lost £1 million in 1981 while the Cork losses were £1.1 million.</P>
    <P>The cut backs then began to take place. In 1979 there were 265 round trips from Cork.  In 1980 there were 258.  In 1981 there were 187.  In 1982 there were 156. In 1982 there was one ship on the Cork-Rosslare-Pembroke sea routes.  I think the term they used was forked sailings.  A serious deficiency in the Cork situation was that there were no night and weekend sailings.  They are the most profitable and they are also the most attractive. They are the most likely to be used.</P>
    <P>We are talking about something which is almost as traditional in Cork as Shandon Bells.  I do not think Deputies on the other side of the House will disagree with me when I say that.  The sailing of the <i>Innishfallen</i> was almost traditional. Modernisation was needed.  I suggest that the Cork-Swansea sailings in that ten year period were extremely successful and showed a profit.  They must have been of major benefit to tourism in the whole region during that period.  No night and no weekend sailings were allowed to the Cork people.  They did not get that facility. Obviously that meant they used other sailings if they were going for a weekend. It appeared to be another effort to run down Cork.</P>
    <P>We talk about our road conditions, the <Col N="776" /> cost of maintaining and improving our roads, and the high incidence of death on the roads.  The extra volume of heavy traffic generated from whatever seaport to Cork since the running down of this ferry connection began is amazing.  In a radio interview recently I said that one morning at about 7 a.m. or 7.30 a.m. between Mitchelstown and Kilbeheny, a very short distance indeed, I met five or six loaded B &amp; I containers on their way from Dublin to Cork.  This was business which could have been handled successfully by the company in Cork.</P>
    <P>Some people suggest that attractions were offered to people who were prepared to use Larne-Stranraer.  No effort was made to sell or promote the Cork ferry.  In this forked service the ship usage was 30 per cent Cork and 70 per cent Rosslare.  Yet Cork accounted for 48 per cent of the cars and 61 per cent of the passengers carried.  I do not begrudge Rosslare the service, but there are a number of ferry services on the east coast and there is none now on the south coast.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will agree with this motion, not the amendment.  The amendment is not acceptable.  It cannot be tolerated or accepted.  The motion is very clear and reasonable.  It does not ask for the indefinite continuance of a service which may not be profit-making.  It asks for the continuance of a temporary service to accommodate the 1983 situation and, while that is being done, to promote and provide for a properlink on a permanent basis with South Wales and embracing some of the improvements or some of the restorations.</P>
    <P>If people have to admit they were wrong in their decisions why not do so; if that is in the interest of employment and the entire Cork region?  This was the only ferry catering for the south coast.  I hope Irish Shipping, or a combination, or whatever, will operate it as a permanent link, subject to the immediate need in 1983.  The two companies could be amalgamated.  People may talk about recessions, but they do not last forever. It is incredible to think that a vital link with the tourist region of Cork-Kerry, our biggest tourist region, should be lost. This industry was worth £117 million last <Col N="777" /> year.  It employed 18,000 people.  It was of huge benefit to the region.  It is being dealt a body blow.  Once a service is ended, the travel agents and the promoters are inclined to forget about it and not restore it to their literature or to their thoughts when promoting tourism.  When it dies, it is very difficult to restore.  The advantages in amalgamation are many. The workforce of the B &amp; I in Cork are very loyal and have been concerned about this matter long before today.  This is very much a Cork-Kerry regional problem and is a body blow to that area.  The sharing of ships, termini, personnel, shore facilities and jobs could have many advantages if they were amalgamated.</P>
    <P>In a public advertisement in the press in June 1981 Fine Gael guaranteed the future of the B &amp; I terminal.  In November 1982 a meeting was held with all political parties and a spokesman for Fine Gael said that in Government his party would ensure the continuance of a car ferry service run by a semi-State body, which was a very significant statement. The basis of our motion is to provide a car ferry service run by a semi-State body.  We are not saying it should be carried on indefinitely but at least for 1983.  It is scandalous that the Government should have permitted B &amp; I to award a major service contract, worth about £650,000, to a British dockyard in preference to their own, as we know that there will be redundancies in Verolme dockyard.  I hope also that the Russian contracts which are promised will materialise.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that there is a £30 million Government investment in B &amp; I, the link between Cork and the Welsh coast.  It is absurd that the Government should have allowed that contract to be placed elsewhere than Verolme.  Surely both companies, being in receipt of substantial State aid, should have been able to come to some understanding, or were there other, hidden reasons connected with the motion before us?  In the present state of the economy and the high rate of unemployment, we cannot afford the luxury of contracts being placed outside the State.</P>
    <P>I think I have made a reasonable case <Col N="778" /> as to why the motion before us should be adhered to.  The motion is not asking for the impossible, nor for the indefinite continuation of something that is not profitable. I understand that ships are available which could be used for 1983 mainly in the interests of tourism in the region.  We are aware that the Blarney Hotel has recently had cancellations because of difficulties with the ferry service, I presume in relation to the discontinuance of this link.  This link has lasted for more than 150 years and should be preserved.  It means so much in direct employment to the region and its loss is a body blow to the tourist industry, parts of which are utterly dependent on tourism to carry them through the winter months.</P>
    <P>We know ICL are commencing sailings to the Continent from the Cork port.  I have not gone into harbour development, the investment in Cork harbour and the pressure B &amp; I exercised on the harbour board to shorten the sailing distance. Now they will say they meant Cobh, not Ringaskiddy.  From the point of view of B &amp; I, I cannot understand what difference the two places made to them. Admittedly, there are other problems. Money has been invested in roads but much more needs to be done.  They have now discontinued service and it was this Minister that allowed it to happen.  My colleague in the House will be able to state categorically what was before them but the decision not to continue the service was taken by the present Minister. He said he spends holidays in Cork. We will welcome him every time he comes but we will give him an extra welcome if he accedes to my request to continue the B &amp; I service for 1983 and, while that is going on, to prepare a proper link by the amalgamation of the companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan) John F. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>notes the decision of the B &amp; I company to close the Cork-Pembroke Ferry Service as part of its plan to <Col N="779" /> reverse its serious loss-making situation; notes also that since the decision was conveyed to the Government in October 1982, it was not found possible by successive Governments to recommend a reversal of this decision; and welcomes the initiative of the Minister for Transport, and his continuing efforts, to provide a Summer ferry service in 1983.</P>
    <P>I will certainly take up the Deputy's invitation to go to Cork for holidays.  I have been there in the past and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  I am sure if I go there again I will enjoy it just as much.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to apologise because he is unable to be present here this evening.  He was, in fact, due to attend a meeting of the Council of Ministers in Brussels today but has been unable to travel due to illness.  He has conveyed his apologies for his absence to the Chief Whip of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>First, I think it is important to be clear on the mandate given to the B &amp; I and the conditions under which the company are expected to operate their transport services.  The company was acquired by the State in 1965 to secure a greater measure of Irish participation in the cross-Channel trade.  It was clear from the time the company came into State ownership that it was to be operated on a commercial basis and the board of the B &amp; I have accepted that they had been given a mandate to operate a commercial enterprise. The company had losses in their early years of operation due to the effects of a heavy investment programme undertaken to replace old ships and equipment. A profit was made between 1969 and 1978 with the exceptions of 1972 and 1973.  Since 1979, however, the company have been experiencing financial difficulties and losses have been increasing each year.  A loss of £1.1 million was returned in 1979, £2.2 million in 1980, £7.54 million in 1981 and an estimated loss of £9 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>The serious deterioration in the company's financial position over the last few years has been due to a number of factors. The general economic recession in <Col N="780" /> this country and in B &amp; I's principal market &mdash; Britain &mdash; and continuing unrest in Northern Ireland, have created difficulties for the company.  Escalating fuel prices and increases in other costs, coupled with intense price competition on the Irish Sea, have been contributory factors.  The company are also carrying a high level of borrowing and lease obligations resulting from investment in larger car ferries and other equipment in recent years.  The burden of servicing these debts has created difficulties at a time when the company have had to contend with the twin problems of a downturn in tourism activity and the effects of the economic recession.</P>
    <P>Apart from an injection of £20 million State equity from the Exchequer towards the construction of two car ferries in recent years, the company have also received further State equity of £12.4 million in 1981 and 1982 which has been used as working capital.  The projections for 1983 are also for a substantial loss and the company have requested further State investment.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the serious problems facing the B &amp; I Company so that the decision of the B &amp; I board to close the Cork-Pembroke service may be looked at in the context of the serious situation in which the company find themselves. The board of the B &amp; I in 1982 introduced various economies designed to reduce the company's cost structures, maximise the use of operating assets and realise cash on the sale of surplus assets.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are probably aware, a review of all the company's services is being carried out under the aegis of my Department since late 1981.  The company's activities are being examined with a view to identifying loss-making areas and improvements necessary to return the company to profitability.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the B &amp; I Company are expected to operate commercially and their losses must be reduced and finally eliminated.</P>
    <P>In examining the company's operations on the &ldquo;Southern Corridor&rdquo; as it is known, meaning the totality of routes between Cork-Rosslare and Fishguard-Pembroke, the performance of both the <Col N="781" /> Cork-Pembroke and Rosslare-Pembroke services of the B &amp; I have been examined. In 1980 and 1981, when one ship was operated on each route, the Cork route showed a substantial decline under each of the separate traffics &mdash; cars, foot passengers and commercial vehicles while corresponding traffic through Rosslare showed a substantial rise.  Total carryings on the two routes combined increased in 1980 and again in 1981.  Car parties via Cork declined from 48,000 in 1979 to 32,000 in 1981.  Foot passengers declined from 97,000 in 1979 to 64,000 in 1981 and commercial vehicles from 4,000 to 1,500 over the same period.</P>
    <P>In 1982, B &amp; I endeavoured to improve the trading situation on the Southern Corridor by operating the Cork-Pembroke and Rosslare-Pembroke routes with one ship instead of two ships as herefore.  This strategy did not, however, improve performance.  Both routes suffered because the unattractive sailing times and disruption of timetables whenever delays were occasioned by bad weather or breakdowns created problems. The estimated carryings on the Cork route for 1982 were 21,000 car parties, 57,000 foot passengers and 1,000 commercial vehicles.</P>
    <P>The Rosslare route suffered more than the Cork route because of the operation of a forked service in 1982.  Whereas the Cork schedule operated at the same times throughout the week with departures from Cork at 9.30 a.m. and from Pembroke at 10.45 p.m., the Rosslare schedule, using the same ship, had to fit in with the Cork sailings.  This resulted in sailing times to and from Rosslare at different times or different days of the week, some of themat very unattractive hours.  Three sailings left Rosslare at 2 a.m., three arrivals were after midnight and one at 3 a.m.  An improvement could only be achieved on the Cork route by a combination of increased carryings and realisations and reduced costs.  Substantial real increases in realisations would be difficult to achieve if fares are to be maintained at a level which can compete with the short sea routes.  Charges on the Cork-Pembroke route are only about 20 per cent above the Rosslare-Pembroke route <Col N="782" /> although the journey is twice as long, and a reduction in costs is more difficult to achieve given the higher costs of operating the longer route.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made that the change of the B &amp; I terminal in 1979 from Swansea to Pembroke was the reason for the decline in support for the Cork service and that the move was primarily to facilitate the new service from Rosslare which was inaugurated in 1980.  B &amp; I had a two-fold reason for deciding on the change.  Alleviation of the silting problems caused by tidal conditions at Swansea would have involved the company in underwriting substantial expenditure by the harbour authority.  The change also enabled the company to shorten the sailing times on the Cork-South Wales service.</P>
    <P>Swansea was said to have many advantages over Pembroke because it was a city and had better communications.  I would question whether these arguments are sustainable.  There are many ports, for instance, Holyhead and Fishguard, which are not cities but they are nevertheless used intensively.  It could also be stated that the road networks to and from Fishguard and Holyhead are not significantly different from those serving Pembroke, and indeed in some respects are more difficult.  The year 1978 has been taken as an example of very good carryings on the Cork-Swansea route.  It has to be remembered, however, that 1978 was a peak year in Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>The fact that the B &amp; I were informed by the Minister for Transport in 1979 that the company should not operate a service to the Continent has been advanced as a reason for B &amp; I's situation in Cork at the moment.  It has been stated that the service would have been profitable and that the profits could have been used to sustain a service to Britain.  It could be said that B &amp; I had been given an opportunity to become involved in the operation of a service to the Continent in the early seventies when both B &amp; I and Irish Shipping were asked to inaugurate a service following the withdrawal of Normandy Ferries.  Irish Continental Line was then set up for this purpose and it would have been unrealistic to have two <Col N="783" /> State shipping companies operating competing services to the Continent.</P>
    <P>The argument that denial to B &amp; I of a passenger service from Cork to France lies at the root of the difficulties of the company's Cork-Wales service is often put forward by people who, in the next breath, will claim that B &amp; I and Irish Continental Line should be amalgamated. If B &amp; I could have improved their position by operating a continental service &mdash; and this is an unproved assumption &mdash; but at the cost of worsening ICL's position, I do not see that from the overall national viewpoint anything would have been gained.  I think that the decision that B &amp; I should not enter into direct competition with ICL was justifiable. This is not to say, of course, that the present position in relation to the two companies is ideal.  Many interests have followed the lead of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies in suggesting some form of merger or other close association. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that such a development, if it were to materialise, could ultimately be to the benefit of Cork and of the region it serves.</P>
    <P>It has also been stated that there has been a lack of commitment by the B &amp; I company to Cork.  It is difficult to see how this allegation can be sustained when it is considered that B &amp; I had a work force of over 90 people on shore up to early 1982 which included passenger and freight sales personnel.  Since the position of the Cork service made the headlines more than a year ago, public representatives, local business people, tourism interests and all public bodies in the Cork region have unanimously decided that the service is vital to the commercial life of the region.  It is conceivable that the service would not now be in its present position if the service had been supported with the same enthusiasm as closure has been resisted.  There is an obvious parallel with railway lines where closure commonly elicits joint action from groups and interests whose practical support, if forthcoming, might have made the line economically viable.</P>
    <P>Whatever the position has been as <Col N="784" /> regards support by exporters and travellers from the region for the Cork service, the reality is that there seems to be a customer preference for the short sea crossing.  This has been amply demonstrated both here, on the English Channel and on the North Sea.  From the shipping operator's point of view the advantage is obvious.  There is better utilisation of ships.  The high fixed charges associated with shipping can be allocated over a greater number of trips for a short route operation.  Greater flexibility is possible with off-peak operation.  Lower unit costs can be reflected in lower rates and fares.</P>
    <P>The future of the Cork-Pembroke service has been the subject of public debate for quite some time.  As Deputies are aware, there have been numerous meetings with public representatives and Cork interests regarding the question of termination of the Cork-Pembroke service.</P>
    <P>On 19 October 1982 the then Minister of Transport met the Lord Mayor of Cork, Alderman Hugh Coveney, TD, and a deputation representing local and harbour authorities, tourism organisations, exporters, chambers of commerce and others, as well as public representatives in the area.  At that stage it became public knowledge that the B &amp; I management would be recommending to their board that the Cork-Pembroke service be closed on 31 October 1982.  The then Government had decided in May 1982 that the Cork service should be reviewed on the basis of monthly reports supplied by the company.  The B &amp; I board decided to postpone their decision of 27 October 1982 that the Cork service be closed on 31 October 1982 to 7 January 1983.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Transport met a deputation representing Cork interests led by Alderman Hugh Coveney, TD, Lord Mayor of Cork, on 30 December 1982.  Having heard the views of the deputation the Minister decided to ask B &amp; I to continue the Cork-Pembroke service in operation after 7 January 1983 until the Government had had an opportunity to consider the whole question.</P>
    <P>The Government had before them a comprehensive memorandum setting out <Col N="785" /> all the issues.  The Government had also taken into account the views expressed by all interested parties and examined all the options available to them.  Because of the substantial losses being incurred by B &amp; I and the very difficult financial position of the Exchequer the Government had reluctantly decided that it had no alternative but to allow the B &amp; I board to terminate the service from the earliest practical date.</P>
    <P>The Government are anxious, however, that the possibility of a summer service from Cork in 1983 should be investigated.  The Minister for Transport has asked the board of B &amp; I to examine the feasibility of providing such a service and to report back at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The B&amp;I, in their examination, will be consulting the various interested parties in the Cork region.  The Minister for Transport feels that this will give such interests an opportunity of demonstrating the extent of their commitment to such a service and to produce realistic and sustainable measures of support.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion calls on the Government to ensure that a service is provided immediately by the B&amp;I Company for the remainder of 1983 in accordance with their contractual obligations.  It does not seem to me that the company are obliged under their present commercial mandate to provide such a service.  I must day I am surprised that Deputies opposite are now asking the Government to continue this service in view of the policy laid down by the previous Government in their national economic plan 1983-1987 &mdash;<i>The Way Forward</i>&mdash; and I quote.</P>
    <P>As regards the capital expenditure of commercial semi-State bodies all significant investment proposals will be submitted to the most rigorous and, where necessary, independent financial and commercial assessment before they are allowed to proceed.  Unless the proposed investments are judged capable of achieving an adequate rate of return on capital employed they will be turned down.  A similar approach will be taken in regard to proposals for <Col N="786" /> the financial restructuring of semi-State bodies.  The ultimate aim of each commercial semi-State body should be to give a rate of return at least equal to the cost to it or to the Exchequer of borrowing funds as far as its commercial activities are concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on in the document it is stated that the Government:</P>
    <P>intend to ensure that in future the principle of commercial viability is effectively adopted by all commercial State transport companies as their basic operating criterion.</P>
    <P>Specifically in relation to the B &amp; I Company it is stated that:</P>
    <P>a radical retrenchment and rationalisation of B &amp; I's operations is necessary. Timely and decisive action will be needed to ensure that all services will be operated on an economic basis and the company's cost overheads significantly reduced.</P>
    <P>Whatever U-turn there has been in the views of Opposition Deputies since these policy decisions were taken a few months ago, the reality in regard to the state of the public finances has not changed.  As well as having limited resources at our disposal, our shipping companies are operating in a market which is limited in the volumes of traffic available.  It is obvious that the companies cannot continue to operate at the same level of capacity and frequency as were justified when tourist and commercial carryings were buoyant.</P>
    <P>The performance of the B&amp;I Company is being monitored on an on-going basis and the Minister for Transport will be looking to the company to take measures necessary to return its operation to profitability at the earliest possible date.  In the last analysis, it can be said that a rationalisation of their operations and adherance to strictly commercial principles will not alone benefit the B &amp; I but will be to advantage of users and the economy in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respects to the Minister I have no doubt that his brief <Col N="787" /> was well prepared by some official of the board of B &amp; I.  If the Minister had carried out a personal investigation into the activities of B &amp; I his brief would have been quite different.</P>
      <P>A major investment was made by the State in Ringaskiddy at the request of B&amp;I.  I have no doubt that every Deputy from Cork, irrespective of party affiliation, will bear me out in this.  Every possible effort was made by B&amp;I to get a commitment from the Government for a very costly investment in Ringaskiddy. The Cork Chamber of Commerce approached the tourist industry and everybody who had any influence with the Government was approached by B&amp;I in an effort to get this investment.  It is hard to understand the little effort made by the company to establish a viable service in the Cork area.  Cork was made the scapegoat for the inefficiency of and blunders made by the management of B&amp;I.  The purchase of the Jetfoil was made without proper market research.  If the Minister puts himself to the trouble of investigating that, he will find that there was no market research in an investment which in a short time proved to be disastrous.</P>
      <P>We all know what happened to the Cork-Pembroke service.  B&amp;I based that service on one very important thing: that the British authorities would invest moneys in roads and provide the proper facilities in the Pembroke area.  Alas, B&amp;I failed to do their own homework again. I could talk about this company all night because during that time I was a member of the Cork Harbour Commissioners and took a particular interest in the development at Ringaskiddy and the work of B&amp;I.  As soon as the development commenced one would have expected that B&amp;I would be prepared to develop the service, but suddenly they were silent.  I wondered at the time what was happening because here was an incentive for the B&amp;I to develop and, let us bear in mind, the costly investment in the Ringaskiddy area was taxpayers' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The withdrawal of B&amp;I from the Cork-Pembroke service had a disastrous effect on tourism and trade in the southwest <Col N="788" /> area.  The Minister mentioned that he had been in the Cork area, but let him go there now and visit some of the hotels. He will see the cancellations of bookings. There is also grave concern in the Kerry area as regards the effect on tourism and all associated with that industry.  They are concerned about the distance from Kerry to Rosslare.  Not only will the industry in Kerry be affected but industrial development is very much dependent on having shipping facilities near at hand in Cork.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of B&amp;I is a major loss of revenue directly to the port of Cork and also a loss of employment to shore and sea going personnel.  My colleague, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, produced statistics on employment and the potential of further employment in the area on the completion of the Ringaskiddy development. The overall development of Ringaskiddy, on which nearly £70 million has been invested, is very much at risk now. If it were known internationally that a State-owned company pulled out of Cork harbour, specifically Ringaskiddy, it would be an indication of a lack of confidence by the State in the venture and would make it very difficult to attract industry and other shipping services to the development.</P>
    <P>All the Deputies from this side of the House join with me in saying that this blow to Cork will be felt for quite a long time.  I hope the Minister realises the damage done to this great port by what has happened.  This port was always known as the gateway to Europe.  I was very sorry to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs say in a recent statement that the development in Ringaskiddy could be completed in a short time if an industry was established there.  He was actually saying if an industry was established there the completion of that development would be sanctioned by the Government. Surely there is employment in the development and the completion of the harbour.</P>
    <P>Why wait for the establishment of an industry?  Is it the Government's policy to wait and see and when the opportunity arises Cork harbour is not ready to avail of it?  I hope I am not misinterpreting <Col N="789" /> what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said.  It was a blow to Cork.  It was felt by all that a properly run service to Cork could be a viable one and that the policy of B&amp;I was to deliberately run down the service and make it uneconomic.</P>
    <P>I do not fear contradiction when I say that the purchase of the jetfoil and establishment of the Cork to Pembroke service were disastrous decisions by the B&amp;I board.  Now they come to the Minister with various statistics twisting the facts. I hope, even at this late stage, the Minister will spend some time examining the financial implications of the withdrawal of B&amp;I from Cork.  B&amp;I became very silent when we were near completion of the Ringaskiddy development.  Every facility was made available to them by the Cork harbour commissioners.  As a member of that board I was aware of the tremendous relationship between the Cork harbour commissioners and B&amp;I. I was also aware of the great co-operation of the workforce there.</P>
    <P>Those who know Cork city and county as well as Kerry know that that area attracts the largest percentage of tourists. It is sad to find that the link with the UK, which existed for over 150 years, has now come to an end because of the inefficiency and the lack of imagination of a State-sponsored body.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the motion is the most milk and water amendment I have ever seen in this House.  There is reference in the last sentence of the amendment to the recommendation of successive Governments for a reversal of the decision and to the continuing efforts of the Minister for Transport to provide a summer ferry service in 1983.  I should like to hear of the efforts that have been made by the Minister in that regard.  The Minister should tell us also whether there is any light at the end of the tunnel for Cork Harbour, the city and the county. I should like to be able to return to the constituency and tell the people that some alternative service for the region is being investigated.  If the amendment has any weight, we should be given this information.  Unfortunately, though, there is not in the Minister's brief any indication that there is light at the end of <Col N="790" /> the tunnel or that there is to be any compensation for the Cork area in respect of this loss.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter relates to the lack of facilities for traders in Cork who are in the export business.  I have been on a number of deputations to the Minister in this regard.  Whatever facilities were made available were not suitable for the traders concerned.  People on those deputations have made it clear to the Minister that much business is being lost because of the failure of B &amp; I to provide the services needed to facilitate the export trade in the Cork region.  The Minister may recall his promise to the last deputation to have this matter investigated with a view to finding out what might be done in that respect.  Having regard to the record unemployment figures in Cork, we are pleading with the Minister this evening to give serious consideration to this motion.  We can prove that the service from the Cork region can be very viable.  Indeed, that has been proved to the B &amp; I but members of the board are hiding behind the Minister for protection.  Undoubtedly, a re-examination of the finances of the B &amp; I as well as of the commitments they gave without knowing exactly what was concerned would lead the Minister to tell that inefficient board to go back to Cork and to make their operations there viable.  The Cork region has always been viable in terms of shipping but for some reason which we may never know the B &amp; I have gone out of their way to downgrade the area in that respect.  Can it be that they are trying to bring about a compact area of shipping between Rosslare and Dublin and to forget about Cork?  That has been suggested.  There are Deputies present who are fully aware that the B &amp; I have done everything possible to downgrade Cork.  This was obvious when, at a time that millions of pounds were being invested in the development of the B &amp; I services, the company were silent and were running away from the development of any such services.</P>
    <P>It has been obvious for some years that this company have deserted the tourist and commercial trades in the Cork and Kerry regions.  I regret that the Minister <Col N="791" /> saw fit this evening to misinterpret what the motion is all about.  I am confident that his brief was prepared by a B &amp; I official whereas there should be an investigation into the entire workings of the company with special attention being focused on the development of their services in the Cork area.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of which party we belong to, we must all agree that a terrible injustice has been done to Cork by the B &amp; I. I can only express the hope that one day someone in the shipping business will move into the Cork area and prove the B &amp; I wrong.</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the continued imprisonment of 14 workers of Ranks Mills in Mountjoy Prison.  Before the debate commences the Chair would like to point out that in so far as the Minister for Labour has asked for a report on the facts surrounding the matter and has received a submission from the imprisoned workers, the Chair has allowed the matter to be raised.  The Chair wishes also to point out that the Minister has no official responsibility for the imprisonment of the workers or for their release and those matters will not be in order in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I regret it has taken so long to get the subject debated in this House.  It is unfortunate that the Minister for Labour, Deputy Kavanagh, is not here to listen to <Col N="792" /> the points being made and to reply to the debate.</P>
      <P>It must be clear to everyone that the jailing of 14 employees of Ranks Limited and their continued imprisonment will have, and is having, the most serious implications, not only for the milling industry, but for the entire field of industrial relations in Ireland.  Today Dublin port closed for a half day as a result of sympathetic strike action by the dockers and building workers have now indicated their intention of taking similar action.  I congratulate them for their decision to take this action, because it is only through unity and strength of the trade union movement that in the long run workers will get their rights.</P>
      <P>Workers are very angry because of the situation that has developed.  They are indignant at the jailing of their fellow trade unionists.  They know that in the present economic climate, they too may have to take drastic action to protect their jobs and their rights.  We are likely to see more and more sympathetic industrial action arising from this dispute.  Unless prompt action is taken to have the jailed workers released, the effects could spread through Irish industry with the speed of a bush fire and with an equally devastating effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the immediate problem relates to Ranks, it is clear that there are a number of other disputes around the country which could escalate in a similar manner.  The use of High Court injunctions has become an increasingly sinister feature of our industrial relations field. Disputes of this nature must be a matter for the Labour Court rather than the High Court.  In this instance the Labour Court have already made a recommendation but Ranks have refused to implement it.  At present there is little or nothing the Labour Court can do when a company refuse to accept their decision. I believe the Labour Court should be given some teeth to enable them to deal with employers like Ranks.  What grants or Government subsidies have Ranks received?  What grants or subsidies have subsidiaries of Ranks received from the State?  What grants are they still receiving? There is surely a case for withdrawing <Col N="793" /> Government assistance from companies like Ranks who refuse to accept the findings of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>As unemployment continues to grow, and it inevitably will after the recent budget, workers will become more and more desperate to protect their jobs, or failing that to get fair and just compensation when their jobs are lost.  Unless the Government move to control the use of High Court injunctions in the industrial relations area, our jails will be filled with more and more workers.  With unemployment at an unprecedented level, with the Government cutting back on services and with unemployment benefit under threat, is it any wonder that workers are determined to hold on to what they have?</P>
    <P>The workers in Clondalkin Paper Mills and in Ranks have exploded the myth that Irish workers lack what is called the work ethic, a slander we repeatedly hear, particularly from the Fine Gael benches. Here are workers who are prepared to go to jail in their determination to hold on to their jobs.  Is it not a sad reflection on Ireland in 1983 that the prison authorities and the Department of Justice are apparently prepared to sanction the release of convicted criminals in order to make space to jail workers seeking their just rights?</P>
    <P>This dispute highlights once again the rights which private property is given over and above the rights of those who do not have any property.  The rights of shareholders of a company are deemed to be more important than the rights of workers who have given 10, 20, 30 and even 40 years' service making profits for a company who, at the end of the day say &ldquo;sorry lads but we can only give you a half week's pay for every year you have worked for us&rdquo;.  Injunctions have been sought and granted and men jailed because Ranks believe the rights of their shareholders are more important than the rights of the men and women who have worked for them.  This dispute has exploded another myth, that of a classless society.  We are told that we are all in this recession together, that we are all equally hit by it and that we must all pull together, except when it comes to <Col N="794" /> redundancies.  Then we are told we should take these few bob in our fists and go quietly down the road without making any noise because the shareholders must get their fair whack.</P>
    <P>In my view questions must be raised about the <i>bona fides</i> of the Ranks company. This dispute started when workers sought to protect their jobs.  When this failed they tried to get adequate compensation for the loss of their jobs but Ranks &mdash; 73 per cent of which is owned by a British consortium, Ranks, Hovis and MacDougal &mdash; have pleaded inability to pay.  It would be laughable if it were not so serious that a company of that size are pleading inability to pay 200 workers fair compensation for the loss of their jobs. To what extent have Ranks engineered the importation of British flour into this State?  To what extent have their subsidiaries here been using imported flour?  To what extent is the present closure simply the last act in a plan which has been set in motion by the Ranks organisation for the last 15 to 20 years in an attempt to get a grip on the Irish market?  They have succeeded in gaining 32 per cent of it. There is a strong suspicion that our 16 per cent of imported flour is coming from the parent company in Britain which effectively gives them a 50 per cent control of the Irish market.</P>
    <P>The Government must take steps to insist that the company fulfil their obligations to the workers who have served them loyally, not just during the last year or two but for generations.  They must insist that the company fulfil their commitments to the agreements entered into freely by the company in relation to redundancy payments, and they must insist that the company comply with the Labour Court recommendation on redundancy payments.  That is the way to end this dispute.  That is the way to get the men out of prison.</P>
    <P>With the agreement of the Chair, I propose that Deputy Gregory contribute to this debate.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy De Rossa and the Chair for allowing me to contribute to this debate. I am glad of this opportunity which at last <Col N="795" /> has afforded the House an opportunity to express our concern at the continued imprisonment of 14 workers.  It must have been very disheartening to the men and their families over the last ten days that there did not appear to be a sense of urgency in the Dáil at their desperate predicament.  It must be a very effective example to demonstrate the irrelevance of this House to vital issues of importance to workers, that so far this matter has not been debated through the normal time of the House, either by way of Government statements, private notice questions or other mechanism.  As the Chair is well aware, I attempted to raise this issue on at least three separate occasions by private notice questions using the accepted procedures of the House, all of which were disallowed by the Chair on what, with respect, I considered most dubious grounds.</P>

However, the Chair will agree that we started this session of a new Dáil with the principle before us of trying to make the proceedings of this House a little more relevant. The past week has shown the very serious difficulties confronting Deputies in attempting to do this.  That is an extremely important aspect of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I <Col N="796" /> was going to attempt to clarify that statement by reference to the reasons given by the Ceann Comhairle's office, particularly the statement that the situation had not changed despite the fact that since the original adjournment debate on this issue, when only two workers were involved, there has been for some days now a total of 14 workers imprisoned, which many Deputies regard as a drastic change in circumstances.  They felt that such a serious situation should come before the House and be debated in the normal session, not pushed to Adjournment time when, as we see, most of the Deputies have gone home and there is very little emphasis on what goes on.</P>
      <P>I must reiterate that the Chair's decision in refusing to allow this matter to be debated or to allow the Ministers responsible to be questioned during the normal session to be a most retrograde step.</P>

I did not do as some Deputies do &mdash; in other words raise the question at a time when it is not proper to do so.  I went through the accepted procedures of the House and put down private notice questions, but they were disallowed.  I do not want to divert from the main issue in this debate, but feel it is an extremely important issue which should have been debated before the House.

      <P>The issues involved in this dispute have been outlined by Deputy De Rossa, particularly the need for legislation to prevent the further use of High Court injunctions against workers involved in an industrial dispute.  Giving the, in my view, dishonest and arbitrary methods of unscrupulous business interests, it is certain that before long there will be many more instances of workers being forced to take similar drastic action.  The Government in this context would be very ill-advised if they do not act now.  If this adjournment debate does nothing else, it will highlight that issue which will be worth while.</P>
      <P>My immediate concern is for the courageous men now imprisoned in Mountjoy.  I trust that the Minister will outline what consideration the Government have given to ordering the release of these men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  However, I feel that this matter has been debated at Government level and that Deputies might be made aware of any consideration that the Government have given to the release of these men. The Minister is not here, which is disappointing. Perhaps we could be told if consideration has been given by the Government to the release of these men. We all agree that it is very unsatisfactory to talk of negotiations in such threatening circumstances, where people on one side of the dispute are incarcerated in prison cells.  It is unrealistic to talk of reaching a satisfactory conclusion to these negotiations while the men remain imprisoned. If the Junior Minister choses not to, or cannot, give us that information, the fact that this adjournment debate has been <Col N="799" /> held will serve to demonstrate to the workers the sense of solidarity among Deputies with their plight.</P>

      <P>In thanking you, Sir, for affording him the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment, Deputy De Rossa mentioned the fact that the Minister for Labour was not in the House.  That fact was referred to also by Deputy Gregory. In those circumstances it is only proper that I should say that the Minister for Labour has been attending an EEC meeting in Bonn and that he returns from there this evening, a fact to which I will refer later.</P>
      <P>At the outset I should emphasise that what I can say about this matter is limited, limited because of the fact that many of the issues in this dispute are <i>sub judice.</i> As both Deputies who contributed to the debate are no doubt aware, the Minister for Labour has appointed Mr. Ercus Stewart, S.C., and an authority on labour law, to provide him with a report on the facts surrounding the Ranks dispute.</P>

      <P>As I have said, Mr. Ercus Stewart was invited to prepare a report on the facts surrounding the Ranks dispute.  Submissions were <Col N="800" /> received by the Department of Labour from the parties to the dispute, Ranks (Ireland) Limited, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and the group representing the former employees of the company who have been engaged in unofficial industrial dispute, 14 of whom have been committed to prison for contempt of court because of their refusal to obey a High Court order.</P>
      <P>Mr. Stewart yesterday met with representatives of each of the parties involved.  I understand that Mr. Stewart has had prolonged meetings with both company and union representatives and also visited Mountjoy Prison to speak to representatives of those in jail.  The report is now at an advanced stage of preparation and the Minister expects to receive it tomorrow.  The Minister intends to publish the report in due course.  In the meantime I would hope that all concerned would await publication of the assessor's report and disclosure of the full facts before making any further comments or taking any further action which might be unhelpful.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise for the benefit of all Deputies the great urgency with which the report has been prepared.  I do not think I can put the matter further at this stage except on one general point raised by both Deputies who referred to the question of the role of injunctions in labour disputes.  As the Deputies will be aware, the Minister for Labour, in the course of his budget speech made reference to this subject and has already indicated his intention of examining the role of injunctions in labour disputes in conjunction with both sides of industry.</P>

      <P>The European Regional Development Fund comprises a quota and a non-quota section.</P>
      <P>Quota Section</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of large projects costing in excess of IR£6 million (i.e. 10 million ECU), Ireland's applications for European Regional Development Fund assistance under the quota section of the fund are in respect of a number of projects grouped together.  The ERDF commitment is based on a percentage of the combined national aid for the group of <Col N="665" /> projects and not on individual projects. The ERDF is currently assisting the Irish Road Development Plan, the Irish Telecommunications Plan, the Irish water supply and sewerage programmes and groups of infrastructural and industrial projects throughout the entire country.</P>
    <P>Receipts from the ERDF are treated as a recoupment of Exchequer expenditure on the assisted projects and are used to increase the overall resources of the Public Capital Programme for regional development throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Apportionment of European Regional Development Fund approvals or receipts to individual counties would not be feasible and, in any event, would not represent a true picture of the operations of the quota section of the fund in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Non-Quota Section</P>
    <P>The non-quota section of the fund is currently part financing with the Exchequer a Five Year Special Border Areas Programme designed to improve the economic and social situation of those areas and is applied specifically to the counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.  Details of the projects undertaken in 1980 and 1981 were given, on a county basis, in reply to a question from Deputy Rory O'Hanlon on 16 December 1981.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of weekly payments of unemployment benefit since the commencement of his claim on 27 January 1982.  He completed 156 days of benefit on 3 September 1982 and as he did not satisfy the contribution condition of having at least 280 paid contributions during a seven year period his rate was reduced from £88.90 to £76.60 with effect from 4 September 1982.  Weekly payments of £76.60 continue to be made to him as they become due.</P>
      <P>His entitlement to pay-related benefit is governed by the 85 per cent limit which provides that the total sum of flat-rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and income-tax rebate may not exceed 85 per cent of his average net weekly earnings.  The 85 per cent limit in his case amounted to £75.25.</P>
      <P>Consequently his entitlement to pay-related benefit at £3.50 weekly terminated after 3 April 1982 when the weekly amount of flat-rate unemployment benefit paid to him £71.75 was increased to £88.90.</P>

      <P>There are two free fuel schemes.  There is the urban fuel scheme which operates in 17 cities and towns including Dublin city and there is the national fuel scheme which operates throughout the State.  Each scheme lasts for a period of 30 weeks from October to April each year and the value of the allowance is £4 per week in each case.</P>
      <P>Under the urban scheme certain categories of persons resident in the urban areas concerned are automatically entitled to free fuel allowance.  In the case of the national scheme, however, there is a test of need before those entitled to apply can be granted the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dublin urban area persons receiving unemployment assistance who <Col N="686" /> have dependants automatically qualify for the free fuel allowance.  Also persons in similar circumstances who formerly resided in the Dublin urban area but who were re-housed by the corporation in the County Dublin area maintain their entitlement to free fuel.  Under the national fuel scheme, however, unemployment assistance recipients would not qualify for free fuel.  Under this scheme entitlement is confined to persons receiving long-term social payments, such as pensions, or health board payments, who are living alone or with dependants or with incapacitated persons.</P>

      <P>In the case of the person concerned, the maximum period within which payment could be made to her was the 14 week period from 6 September 1982 to 11 December 1982.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 470 to 479, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The appointment of teachers to secondary schools recognised under the Rules for Secondary Schools are made by the authorities of the schools.  The authorised quota of teachers to whom incremental salary may be paid is determined in accordance with the Rules for the Payment of Incremental Salary to Secondary Teachers, which are of general application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position to state what arrangements the authorities of individual <Col N="711" /> schools will make in regard to the employment of teachers of particular subjects of the curriculum in the school-year 1983-84 or the total number of teachers whom they will employ.  There is, however, no basis for any assumption that the general adjustments in the authorised quota of teachers in secondary schools to whom incremental salary may be paid which will take effect as from the commencement of the school-year 1983-84 will result in school authorities not being in a position to make suitable provision for guidance service.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the employment of remedial teachers in secondary schools remain unaltered.  In the case of vocational schools, the Department of Education in making the annual allocation of teachers will stipulate the number of teachers being allocated within the total allocation to the vocational education committee in respect of guidance work, as well as the number of teachers in the case of other specialists areas, such as woodwork, metalwork and religion.</P>
    <P>In the case of comprehensive and community schools, the Department will make the necessary provision for guidance work in accordance with the circumstances of the individual schools, with due regard to the conditions applicable in the case of secondary and vocational schools.</P>
    <P>A revised circular letter dealing with the employment of guidance teachers in second level schools will be issued in due course.</P>
