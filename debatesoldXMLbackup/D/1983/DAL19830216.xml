      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have endeavoured to point out the various differences existing between the Government parties in relation to their budget strategy.  There are a few further serious misrepresentations by the Government in relation to this and, in particular, to their commitments prior to and after the last election.  For instance, as I said yesterday, in the Fine Gael-Labour Programme for Government, dated December, 1982, their most important objective was to reduce unemployment. They make a number of commitments and I quote:</P>
      <P>As an immediate measure, a sum of £100m. from the Contingency Fund in the recently published Public Capital Programme will be set aside to finance work of this kind during 1983.</P>
      <P>This provision has been scrapped in the present budget.  I further quote:</P>
      <P>There are a number of cases involving, we believe, up to a further £100m. of projects in which infrastructural work could be usefully undertaken on a joint public-private basis, drawing in additional private capital for employment creation.  Arrangements will be made to mount such joint ventures with relevant financial institutions or other private interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again the Government have reneged on that promise.  In the section devoted to agriculture, they honour their promise to provide a further £3 million for disease eradication, but remove £1.85 million <Col N="241" /> from the same disease eradication programme, which means an increase of only approximately £1 million.  Would the Minister for Agriculture explain why he found it necessary to remove this £1.85 million in trying to juggle figures to add £3 million?</P>
    <P>Under the heading of farm modernisation, the Government commitment reads:</P>
    <P>We must seek to reinforce its development role to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in this budget the farm modernisation scheme has been scrapped.  Under the heading of taxation:</P>
    <P>Indirect tax increases to be minimised in order to help reduce inflation.</P>
    <P>We know what has happened in that regard.</P>
    <P>Tax credits to be substituted for tax allowances in order to secure greater equity as between income groups.</P>
    <P>We know what has happened to the tax credits.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to point out also that in the January 1982 Budget reference was made to provisions in the Finance Bill for the introduction of these tax credits. However, in this latest budget we are told simply that they are for another day. Therefore one can only assume that that programme is to be scrapped altogether.</P>
    <P>I believe those inequities should be highlighted because members of this Government were very strong in their criticism of Fianna Fáil Governments when manifestoes, promises or whatever were produced and not adhered to, at least in the view of the Fine Gael Party in particular it was felt they were not adhered to.  It is important that we show up the total lack of commitment to the people on the part of this Government in this budget, commitments made before and after the last election when the two parties came together to draw up their Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned that this Government have lost their nerve.  Let me say that I want this Government to continue in office.  I do not think the <Col N="242" /> country needs a general election until they have had an opportunity to sort out the serious problems with which we are confronted.  But it is becoming clear now that this Government are losing their nerve, that they are failing to carry out the promises laid down in black and white in the Fine Gael/Labour Programme for Government.  We must remind them at every opportunity that this is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>We must remind the Labour Party also of their important role in Irish society. Indeed I might point out that in their manifesto in the last election they declared that they represented ordinary working people.  They emphasised that Labour does not accept the prospect of continuing mass unemployment, that Labour does not accept that essential economic and social reforms stop with the recession.  It is about time Deputies in the Labour Party looked carefully at this Programme for Government and implemented those very basic commitments given.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with two other aspects of the budget before concluding.  The first is in regard to agriculture.  A number of important areas in the agricultural industry have been affected by this budget.  In particular we notice that the Government have abolished the one and only scheme for the structural improvement and development of our farms.  This represents a reprehensible step because it leaves our farmers with a negative approach to farm development in 1983. The budget fails totally to recognise the problems of agriculture.  In cutting back on several schemes which were doing something to improve agriculture they have left our farmers now in a situation in which they will feel the best thing to do is as little as possible by way of improvement or development.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture mentioned the farm retirement scheme yesterday and said that because it had been underutilised, with approximately only 600 people availing of its provisions in the last couple of years it should be scrapped.  In my view this is a retrograde step when viewed in the spirit of agricultural development as experienced in the <Col N="243" /> last few years.  While I agree that the scheme has been underutilised, that unfortunately not many farmers have felt it wise to retire and making their land available to younger, more progressive farmers, I do not think the proper thing to do is abolish that scheme altogether. Instead, its advantages should be put across to older farmers so that they would be encouraged to avail of it.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture should proceed with their programme of making more land available to young, progressive farmers who will utilise it to the full. The big problem being experienced in Irish agriculture at present is the under-utilisation of land.  We have also the very serious problem of underproductivity in Irish agriculture.  One has only to drive along our roads to observe this under-utilisation and underproductivity about which I speak.  If we could overcome these problems we could create enormous growth in incomes.  We all read in the newspapers about two months ago of a farmer farming 18 acres in County Leitrim and of the productivity he was able to achieve in dairy farming.  That is the type of programme in agriculture that should be put across by this Government.</P>
    <P>The other big problem being experienced in agriculture is our failure to benefit from the EEC.  We entered that Community with great expectations, because we knew we were entering a market of many millions of people and that, as a food producing country, our agricultural industry could benefit.  It did benefit for a while, but unfortunately in recent years we have failed to capitalise on the bonanza of the EEC, the reason being that, while we have reasonably good agricultural produce, while our raw materials are good, we have failed utterly to process and market those goods and make them available across Europe.</P>
    <P>In this regard I had hoped that some stimulus would have been provided in this budget for the food processing and marketing industry.  Even though this is repetition, I suggested here, in the course of my maiden speech on the Fianna Fáil Economic Plan, <i>The Way Forward</i> that it was very important that the Government <Col N="244" /> set up an organisation to oversee the processing and marketing of Irish food.  Unless we are prepared to process our raw materials, with its full added-value, unless we are prepared to market our food to a very high degree in Europe, then we shall never reap the benefit our agriculture deserves.  In that regard we need only look at the success of Kerry-gold butter.  It is absolutely essential that the Government now examine the possibility of marketing Irish food in Europe under the one brand name, thereby having an essentially Irish element.  If this were done I am quite satisfied that thousands of jobs could be created in this indigenous industry.  I implore the Government to examine that aspect. Indeed, I was encouraged by a reference to this some time ago by the Tánaiste when he expressed his desire to see a major reshuffle in the processing and marketing of Irish food.  The Government's decision to ignore developments last week in relation to the CBF constitutes a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>I come now to what I believe to be the most serious problem confronting our economy at present, to what I believe also is an area which has been totally neglected by every Government.  At the risk of repeating myself, I must refer again to imported goods.  I dealt with this problem on the two occasions I have spoken in this House so far with, unfortunately, no reaction from any quarter. If I might refer the House back to the 1940s when Eamon de Valera said in a broadcast to the nation that the problem of unemployment affecting industrialised countries could be solved in our particular conditions here, that if we set out to produce for our home market we could provide work for a number greater than that of our unemployed.  When was the last time we heard a senior Irish politician talk in that vein?  When was the last time there was any serious debate on the cancer of foreign products being imported here at the rate of almost £100 million a week?</P>
    <P>When was the last time there was an effort by any Government to deal with this problem?  In recent times we have been found to be in contravention of <Col N="245" /> EEC legislation by our Buy Irish Campaign. However, it is my firm belief that if we can convince our people to buy Irish products it will be a most important step towards rectifying the problems of our economy.  There is no point in talking about financial rectitude or about cutting the current budget deficit unless we tackle the problems that are basic to our economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>We cannot accept the closure of a company like Ranks.  This company use the produce of our farms and produce a food which is basic to our lives.  Apparently they are now to import this product from England.  This is the greatest scandal to befall this country during my few years in politics and I am amazed that there has not been an outcry by the politicians and the people against this closure.  There has been an outcry about another development which, although it is important, certainly has not the same degree of importance as the closure of this firm.  We must go back as de Valera did to some simple solutions.  There is no reason why the acreage of grain should not be substantially increased and there is no reason why the necessary investment should not be made to enable Ranks to modernise and compete effectively.</P>
    <P>When I spoke here in November I said that the people would respond if we as politicians, and the Government especially, were to make strenuous efforts to show the folly of buying imported goods. Each person must be convinced that when buying anything other than an Irish product he or she is giving away the job of a father or a son or a member of the family.  A concerted campaign should be waged by the Government so that this message is brought home to every sector of society.  This would enable us to reduce our import bill very substantially.  The statistics are alarming.  We import £60 million worth of goods each week through Dublin port alone.  Penetration of imports has increased from 29 per cent in 1977 to 37.5 per cent in 1980 and this trend is growing.  This is the greatest problem facing the Government but unfortunately they did not consider it necessary to mention it in their Budget Statement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> I am anxious to see both sides of this House coming together and co-ordinating a policy which will achieve growth in the sales of Irish goods.  Even if we did convince people to be patriotic and buy Irish-made goods, in many cases they would not be making a wise decision and the Government must attempt to improve the quality and value of our goods.  In the Fianna Fáil economic plan an effort was made in this direction with the company development plan and the company-by-company approach.  The necessary resources should be made available to make firms more efficient and enable them to produce higher quality goods giving better value.  If we cannot compete at home it will be very difficult to compete in export markets and I urge the Government above all else to look seriously at this question.  I look forward to hearing their proposals in this regard in the near future.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of the Minister's budget speech sums up the Government's will to give in to the problems facing us. The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Today is not a time for despair or for hopelessness in the face of the magnitude and complexity of our problems.</P>
    <P>We have met and countered inflation before this.  The Irish people have in the past suffered cruel unemployment and surmounted it.  For decades we have been making progress, slow though it might often seem, against inequality.</P>
    <P>The Government do not appear to be prepared to tackle the problems they outline. The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>We can do all these things again if only we have the will.  We can do them if our leaders show the resolve required to motivate our community, and it is as a community that we must face our problems.</P>
    <P>The Government do not appear to have the necessary resolve and will to tackle the difficulties of inflation, unemployment and inequality.  We are all agreed on the need for financial rectitude but the price this economy must pay for the improvements proposed in this budget <Col N="247" /> means that the very core of our economy will be damaged to the extent that we will have an even larger budget deficit in coming years.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to think again and to fill the gaps, to provide the stimulation, the motivation and the will to succeed by immediate, effective action. This is needed by the people and by the economy and its absence is evident in this budget.  The strategy outlined in the budget will put our economy into a tailspin from which it will be very difficult to recover.  Let me warn this Government that they will be held responsible for the economic mess in which we will find ourselves towards the end of this year and in 1984.  What is needed now is leadership and government like a stonecutter's chisel.  Unfortunately, this Government have a lot of sharpening up to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe) Jim O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week a leading politician said in relation to this budget &ldquo;Of course, the public finances are in a difficult state and corrective action must be taken.  Services must be cut back, expenditure curtailed, borrowing reduced...&rdquo; I think there are very few who would quibble with that analysis of the problem or with the measures suggested in that comment.  That comment, reported at column 1553 of the Official Report of 9 February, was made by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey.  In the light of that, and other comments made by the Leader of the Opposition, it is rather odd to find him and Members of his party adopting a different approach.  It is clear to any objective observer that our public finances are in a difficult state and that corrective action must be taken.  It is obvious that that action must relate to a reduction of services, a curtailment of expenditure and a reduction in borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to the Leader of the Opposition, in making the comment I referred to he put in a qualification in regard to the protection of the less well-off people in our community.  However, it is clear <Col N="248" /> that the budget went as far as possible in that area.  There was an increase in social welfare.  Although it was not as much as many of us would like to give the increase was reasonable in the context of the figures allowed last year, and in the context of the money available now.  We have the new family income supplement to benefit workers with low incomes, the reactivation of the Combat Poverty Agency, a special funding for the voluntary social organisations and a special allocation for the housing of the elderly.  It is clear that in spite of the problems the budget went as far as possible in granting broad increases in social welfare and introducing such special measures for the less well-off.</P>
    <P>It is clear that in their heart of hearts the Opposition agree that their prescriptions for budgetary strategy as enunciated by the Opposition doctor is broadly similar to that of the Government doctor, that we have no option but to reduce our borrowing, the results of which have put the country into an economic strangle-hold. It is clear when we are in a deficit situation that the first and major task has to be to decide on the borrowing requirement, how far is one going to fund the Exchequer in the current year with borrowing. After that the other figures fall into place.  Where the background is such that there is a clear need to reduce the borrowing it makes that starting point all the more important.</P>
    <P>In 1982 we had a borrowing figure of £1,945 million which represented 16½ per cent of GNP, £988 million on the current side and £957 million on the capital side. Any sane observer will agree that with such a huge figure and a major percentage of GNP involved there was no way in which the country could continue on that path.  I give credit to the Opposition because they saw the problem but our quibble is that they did not take the steps when they had the chance to turn the tide earlier and when it would have been easier to do so.  I believe that they agree that our approach in regard to the reduction in borrowing is essential if we are to have any future.  In fact, not alone is there broad agreement from the Opposition in principle but reading their documents <Col N="249" /> and speeches it is clear that there is broad agreement on the extent of borrowing for 1983.  The figure this year will be approximately £1,700 million, a considerable reduction as a percentage of 1983 GNP.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Opposition, in spite of the natural urge while in Opposition to be more free and easy with the money of the State, not alone agree on the need to reduce borrowing but on the figure for the maximum borrowing requirement of the State this year.  It is not a surprise to anybody to learn that the Government and the Opposition are <i>ad idem</i> on the approach to this figure. The background is clear, we have had an increase between 1977 and 1982 in our national debt from £5 billion to approximately £12 billion.  In that short period we have had an increase which was far more than the entire amount over the previous 55 years since we obtained our freedom in this part of the island.  We know that all the income tax we will collect in the current year will not be sufficient to meet the interest payment on that borrowing.  That may pass over people's heads although those who are paying tax under the PAYE system when they look at their weekly or monthly deductions would be happier if they knew that the money being deducted was not just going to pay the moneylenders but would be doing something productive for the country.  Unfortunately, as a result of recent borrowing trends that is not so and the money is going to the lenders to the State, international bankers, to repay interest on our past borrowings.</P>
    <P>It is proper that we should pause and consider the result of taking the easy path over the last five years because more and more we went into foreign borrowing.  It sounded grand at the time and the interest rates were attractive but the problem arose when we had to pay back because we had to do so in the currency we borrowed. When one borrows hard currencies one then hits a problem when that currency appreciates and one finds that the repayments are greater than originally envisaged.  The figures for last year show the result of that misguided policy, not misguided because we should not have resorted to it at all, but because of <Col N="250" /> the extent to which we resorted to it.  Last year alone foreign currency appreciation added £340 million to our total foreign debt.  It is clear that if we continue on that path the problem will become much worse in the years ahead.  That is one of the major problems of foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of the balance of payments deficit.  Last year foreign interest charges accounted for one half of our balance of payments deficit. Apart from the history of the situation and the problems with which we are now afflicted as a result of foreign borrowing, there is also the factor of whether money will be so free and easy from foreign sources in the future.  We all know the developments in the international markets in recent times.  We have seen the defaults of major countries with problems in Poland, Mexico, the South American countries and many African countries. Two weeks ago Zambia defaulted on interest payments.  Obviously, this will cause further pressure on the international banking system.</P>
    <P>In addition, quite clearly a difficulty will arise somewhat ironically from the drop in oil prices.  The big flood of petro-dollars will be trimmed somewhat because of the drop in oil prices.  Moneys available to the international banking system will not be so plentiful as they were in the past.  Apart from the inadvisability of over-concentration on foreign borrowing, we must face the situation in the times ahead that money will not be as freely available on the international markets as heretofore.</P>
    <P>Coming back to my starting point, we are agreed on the need to reduce our borrowing requirement.  I accept that there is a difference in approach within the parameter of the £1,700 million approximately.  As far as one can discern from the Opposition documents, there would be a greater concentration from the borrowing point of view on capital borrowing if they were in Government, and they would go for a lower current deficit.  On the Government side we are talking about approximately £900 million borrowing on the current side, and approximately £825 million on the capital <Col N="251" /> side, whereas the Opposition talk about around £1 billion on the capital side and £750 million on the current side.</P>
    <P>There is a slight difference in approach there.  While the Opposition talk about what they could do with the extra money borrowed on the capital side &mdash; and they are quite entitled to do so &mdash; correspondingly there is an onus on them, if they are to have any credibility, to tell us how they would reduce the borrowing figure on the current side.  I have no doubt the former Minister for Finance will deal with this point.  I will be very interested to hear his views.  If they were in Government how would the Opposition have raised the £700 million to bridge the gap on current account?</P>

      <P>Anybody who suggests that there should be greater borrowing on the capital side and who also accepts the total borrowing figure must account for how the gap can be bridged on the current side.  From the approach adopted from the Opposition, it is clear that they would have had to account for the raising of £700 million in extra taxes if their figures were to stand up on the current side.  That would appear to be the strategy they would have adopted within that borrowing requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the introduction of the budget there was some discussion in the House on how that gap could be closed.  Naturally some Opposition speakers reached for the easy option.  A number of vague <Col N="252" /> references were made to expenditure cuts.  That is a very useful refuge in Opposition.  I recall Deputy Seamus Brennan and a number of others following that line.  Is it open, with any degree of credibility, to a Member of the Opposition to go up that laneway?  I think it is a cul de sac because the levels of expenditure were already set as proposed by the Opposition.  We are dealing with a Book of Estimates which was produced by the Opposition when they were in Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>And which was interfered with by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>They produced the Book of Estimates which set the levels of expenditure and, therefore, it is not open to a Member of the Opposition now to indicate that, instead of higher taxation being imposed expenditures would have been cut.  The opportunity came at the time of the preparation of the Book of Estimates.  We reduced expenditure in relation to the Book of Estimates.  We lopped £105 million off it.  We had to. There were other adjustments.  We revised some of the figures but substantially they were the same.  We allowed £31 million extra which was a more logical figure in relation to unemployment benefit, bearing in mind the rising trend in unemployment.</P>
      <P>The basic point I am making is that it is not now open to the Opposition to suggest that the current deficit could be reduced by expenditure cuts.  They had the opportunity to provide those.  The only logical approach they can now adopt is to indicate to us, if they wish to have any credibility, where they would have raised the £700 million in taxation.  That is the figure we are missing from them.  I accept that there will be a degree of reluctance on their part to disclose that. There is always a degree of reluctance in Opposition to imposing taxation, as it were, from the Opposition benches.  If they are to have any degree of credibility in this debate they will have to give us an indication of that.  That is the inescapable position in which they have put themselves in regard to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> It is clear from what I have said that, where there is an agreement on the borrowing requirement, approximately £1,700 million, and where there is a proposal from the Opposition that there should have been greater emphasis on capital borrowing, their proposal would have resulted in less borrowing on the current side and therefore extra taxation. There I have to part company with the Opposition in discussing this budget.  I do not think the country could bear the type of taxation measures implicit in the Opposition's approach.  We all agree that the country is groaning under a weight of taxation that is quite excessive and, that once we get public finances in order, our energies must be concentrated on reducing the weight of taxation.  Furthermore, most independent commentators will accept that the taxation requirement which is implicit in the Opposition approach would have had catastrophic effects on the economy and would have been so deflationary as to put the country out of action for the current year.</P>
    <P>I would also like to comment on the approach with regard to the capital side. When I came into this House a number of years ago and tried to pick up the mechanics of budgetary strategy, I accepted as a matter of course that one should borrow for capital purposes as it was productive and provided jobs.  I came to the conclusion that it was the only way to solve our unemployment problem and that the more money one spent on the capital side by way of borrowing, the more chance one had of solving the unemployment problem.  At this stage, I am beginning to doubt the merit of that approach.  I have been wondering for quite a long time why if that is the correct approach, we have an unemployment problem.  There has been so much borrowing in recent years and what is the result?  We do not seem to be achieving the result from our borrowing, even on the capital side, that we should have achieved.  I was struck by an article in an excellent document produced by the Institute of Public Administration, &ldquo;Unequal Achievement&rdquo;, an analysis of the situation in regard to public expenditure. The author was Mr. Moore <Col N="254" /> McDowell.  He spoke about the generation of public expenditure growth and he refers to it as &ldquo;Leviathan Unchained&rdquo;. That seems to be a rather apt description. In commenting on public sector investment, he states that there is, however, much evidence of appalling public sector investment decisions which point to a catastrophic fall in the productivity of public sector investment.  Then he says that there is no measurable, direct return to infrastructural investment.  We have all glibly accepted that when one borrows for capital purposes, it is going to produce the correct return in the context of productivity and employment.  However, it seems now that this is not so.  In future, when anyone suggests that to me I will have to ask, where is the proof?  It seems fairly clear that this is not true, the figures are not there to justify it.  If one questions that approach now, one also has to think of the consequences for capital borrowing because capital borrowing has to be repaid through current account.  We are now feeling the impact of past borrowing for capital and current purposes.  I am not an economist but there must be a question mark against the glib assertion that money borrowed for capital purposes is productive and, because it is for investment purposes, is going to lead to a reduction in unemployment.  In the weeks and months ahead this aspect will have to be teased out further.</P>
    <P>The budget was harsh but, in the context of the reduction of the borrowing requirement, it had to be and I have great confidence in the common sense of the people.  I believe there is a broad acceptance of the need for the measures that were taken in the budget, despite the fact that in the poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning, three out of four people expect their standards of living to drop.  Of course their standards of living will drop, we have been living beyond our means and if that situation is to be corrected we must live within our means in national and personal terms.  This is going to force a reduction in our standard of living but there is a new air of reality and perhaps a less selfish approach on the part of our people.  There is a realisation that today's borrowing is tomorrow's taxation. <Col N="255" /> People are concerned that our country should be left in a reasonable condition for our children to inherit.  The selfish approach of spend, spend and borrow, borrow without regard to the consequences, seems to be gone.</P>
    <P>There are two criticisms of the budget that need to be looked at in some detail. One was that the budget did not do enough for unemployment and that it lacked imagination.  Some of this criticism came from the Opposition benches and some came from independent commentators. It is probably correct to say that the budget did not do enough for unemployment.  Normally when there is unemployment, the reaction, according to economists, is to stimulate domestic demand and the effects are supposed to work their way through the economy with greater demand, greater buying, greater production and greater employment. Was that option open to us?  You stimulate demand by putting more money into the economy but, in this instance, it was not there unless you borrowed it and this was the constraint which was on us.  Borrowing is a tightening noose of constraint which is choking our capacity to take effective action to deal with unemployment. Even if we had wished to follow that course it was not open to us to do so.  If we had been in a situation with no deficit, obviously it is a course which we would have been very anxious to follow despite the fact that unforeseen results can arise from that kind of approach which are not of direct benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>I remember the 1977 manifesto where the approach was borrow, borrow, spend, spend and this will solve our unemployment problem.  The attitude was, more spending, more demand, more production and more jobs, but it did not work.  Why did it not work?  As an open economy it is now accepted that where that type of economic measures are taken at least half the increase in demand leaks outside the State.  This is what happened after 1977.  Jobs resulted from the approach then taken &mdash; some jobs were here but there were many more in Birmingham, Liverpool, Peking, Tokyo and <Col N="256" /> other places from which we import our goods.  That is not the total solution but despite that it probably would have been the approach to adopt in the light of our appalling unemployment figures but because of our debt situation that approach was not open to us.</P>
    <P>What do we do about unemployment? It has to be faced in another way and I believe now is the time to do it.  Because this Government are not able to follow the line I mentioned of giving a stimulus to domestic demand, they will take a number of measures in the employment area.  These measures will be of a non-budgetary nature but they will promote expansion of output and employment. They will be a concentration on ensuring the maintanance of the competitiveness of Irish goods and services in the domestic and external markets.  Obviously that has to be so in the context of our membership of the EEC and in an open market situation.  There is no tear in the eye abroad for Irish goods.  They will have to sell on their merits and if they are not competitive they will not sell.  We have to ensure the maintance of the competitiveness of Irish goods and, where necessary, an improvement in this area.</P>
    <P>We have to take steps to improve the problems on the side of management, with regard to weaknesses in production, in design and in marketing.  I was interested to hear the comments of Deputy Fahey regarding the success of Kerry-gold. That was a success story but it has to be multiplied in the months and years ahead.  There must be a better approach on management side to personnel problems and industrial relations generally. All these are areas that, to a greater or lesser degree, affect the management side in our productive undertakings. There must be a positive approach to tackling them.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the labour cost factor. There tends to be an over-emphasis on this and while I say it is just one factor, I accept entirely that it is a very important factor.  The old truism was that one man's increase was another man's redundancy and I think that message is getting through to more people who are working today.  We must ensure that unit costs so <Col N="257" /> far as labour is concerned are kept at least as competitive as unit costs in other countries where we are competing for a share in the market.  We have special problems here because of the small scale of the operation on the domestic market and we have limited research and development. However, there is a market of 260 million people in the EEC with free access to that market and I think we can make vast improvements.  I do not think we are taking full advantage of that huge market.  Apart from the fact that we are an island, in view of our history our horizons may have been somewhat limited in the past but we must expand those horizons to take advantage of that huge market.  The Government will be nudging, pushing, cajoling and persuading people in that direction in the years ahead.  In addition, a special task force of Ministers will be set up very shortly with the purpose of co-ordinating this approach and they will produce a blueprint that will be the basis for tackling our unemployment problem.  There will be the National Planning Board.  Our approach in regard to the reform of Dáil procedures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The former Minister will have ample opportunity to talk about that.  I do not think we should underestimate the effect of the improvements for the efficiency of this House but perhaps even more so of the approach being adopted in regard to improvements in the public sector.  Public service reform is an essential ingredient in getting this country in a trim and efficient condition.</P>
      <P>Although I was very young at the time I remember the problems that existed in the late forties and fifties.  In my area when one talked about a job one meant going on the <i>Innisfallen</i> boat leaving Cork for England.</P>

      <P>We will keep them at home and give them jobs instead.  There was a gloomy attitude in those days.  In many ways the major breakthrough was the First Programme for Economic Expansion and leading up to that a change in outlook and approach, although it was not related to budgetary strategy.  We had the Control of Manufactures Act in operation.  Is it not incredible today that this was the strategy of the thirties and stretching into the forties and fifties?  The situation was that a person from outside was not permitted to set up a manufacturing enterprise here.  I believe that approach was Sinn Féin gone mad.  Fortunately in the late forties and fifties people started to question whether this was the correct approach and we had the foundation of the IDA and Córas Tráchtála.  In 1956 one of the most important Bills ever was introduced in this House.  It was the Encouragement of External Development Bill, 1956, introduced by the late Gerard Sweetman.  On the change of Government in 1957, fortunately we had the follow-on with the Whitaker-Lemass approach resulting in the First Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
      <P>We have now to question the basis on which we had been working in the past. Now we need another new brave approach.  On the silver jubilee of the First Programme for Economic Expansion we need a new approach and beginning. In many ways the outline I have given of the approach to be adopted by the Government and the measures to be taken will provide that new thrust that will enable us to make, to use the Chinese expression, a great leap forward.  I say that in a jocose way but I believe firmly that we must seek that new approach at this stage.  I hope that will be the major part of the solution to the problem.  It is not correct to say that this Government are not absolutely and totally concerned about the extent of our unemployment problem.  We do not accept that there is a simple solution to it but there will be a major concentration on attempting to find the solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two criticisms of the budget must be looked at in detail.  The second is lack of <Col N="259" /> imagination.  I always think that anybody coming in here to speak on the budget imagines himself or herself to be the Minister for Finance.  Any Member is entitled to come into this House and put forward measures as if he or she were Minister for Finance.  If I hear members of the Opposition or the Government side coming in with that approach I am delighted, with the one qualification that anybody coming in here as shadow Minister for Finance, so to speak, making proposals for solutions, if he seeks any credibility, must say how the proposals should be paid for.  It is easy to suggest that more money should be provided for the farmers or a lesser burden on the PAYE sector and so on, but anybody making any such proposal must tell us how it will be paid for.  Anybody standing in here imagining himself Minister for Finance must take the same overview, the same broad look at the situation and provide the same balance.  If you put the budget arithmetic out of plumb by saying that the PAYE sector should get £50 million relief you must tell us where that £50 million is to come from.</P>
    <P>Some of the suggestions that have come through in this debate so far have been interesting and, if implemented, would do a great deal for this country, but I fear that the other side of the equation, the balance on the scales, has not been forthcoming.  How were these suggestions to be paid for?  I myself would toss in a number of such suggestions if time permitted but again I would have to feel that in doing so it would not be credible unless I could say where the money to pay for them would come from. I see a smile from the Opposition benches.  I will give an example.  I believe that, say, tourism is an area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was reduced by £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where confidence needs to be boosted and I would very much like to see that confidence brought back to tourism.  If I should say, &ldquo;OK, there should be an extra £2 million for tourism which could be used, say, to <Col N="260" /> co-finance promotional efforts by hoteliers and other people involved in the tourist area&rdquo;, it would be an excellent idea that funds would be available to the tune of £2 million to back £ for £ promotional efforts by people involved in that area to attract more tourists.  However, there would be no credibility in my making that proposal in this House unless I said where that £2 million would come from.  Having produced that proposal I would have to restore any credibility I would have in this area by saying that there is a way of paying for it.  It might not be the absolute answer.  Travel tax went up to £5.  In the current year that increase will bring in £2.3 million and in a full year £3 million. OK, instead of increasing it to £5 increase it to £10 and that would bring in more than enough for that purpose.  There may be administrative and other complications in taking that step but, having put forward the proposal on the one side, I suggest that that might be the way to pay for it.  If there are any further suggestions of a similar nature from the Opposition I would ask if they propose to spend money that they tell us where it is to come from.</P>

      <P>One other aspect I want to refer to is the fact that the budget provided an extra £3 million for overseas aid.  I was very glad that this extra funding was provided.  I must confess that I was a little disturbed this morning to see a suggestion by the Lord Bishop of Galway, Dr. Casey, that I had been misleading when I said in my statement that there was an increase of 22 per cent on last year's contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept entirely that Bishop Casey would have wished to have an even greater increase provided by the Government for development assistance. I accept also that the amount of increase which was given in the budget does not meet the .05 increase in GNP, but I <Col N="261" /> cannot and will not accept a suggestion that I, as Minister of State with special responsibility in this area, had been misleading. I do not accept that because I said in my statement that the Estimate this year would amount to an increase of more than 22 per cent over the outturn for 1982.  That statement was correct and I stand over it.  While I accept entirely Bishop Casey's entitlement to say that more money should be made available, he should not say that I, as Minister of State, was misleading in my statement. The outturn for official development assistance last year was about £24.5 million. The provision for this year is over £30 million.  Anybody who would work out a percentage on that would be able to verify that this amounts to an increase of over 22 per cent on last year's outturn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While dealing with that area, I hope and expect that in the years ahead, despite the problems we have, we will see even greater progress towards the UN recommended target of .7 per cent of GNP.  The Estimates that we were left with from the other side of the House would have resulted in reduction in GNP this year.  It would have resulted in this country sliding backwards in the approach towards the UN target.  Fortunately, because of the extra allocation made available by this Government who have a genuine care and concern for the problems of people of the Third World, we have a figure now which will enable us to make some improvement towards the UN target, not as great an improvement as we would have wished but at least some improvement.  We are still heading in the right direction.  In the years ahead while this Government are in power I will be pushing very strongly indeed to ensure that further and even greater progress will be made towards reaching the UN target.  Perhaps this is a good note on which to conclude because in many ways we could sink ourselves into a deep well of gloom thinking about our economic problems.  It would be salutary for anybody in that frame of mind to go and see how people live in the Third World, where people very simply do not have enough to eat, where there is no problem about the mortgage rate, the <Col N="262" /> problem is that they have no housing. There is no problem about PRSI, social welfare and so on; the problem is that there is absolutely no work there at all. It is important to remember that, despite the difficulties in that area, we are, out of a total membership of the international community of 150 countries, the 25th richest in the world and our GNP <i>per capita</i> is so far ahead of the least developed countries that they are not in the same league at all.  I mention this for two reasons, I am glad we are making our contribution to help the people in the Third World in their absolutely extreme difficulties, where people are dying of hunger and starvation and at the same time to put into perspective the feelings of the people in this country in relation to our situation, that we are in economic difficulties but in relative terms we do not compare with the people who are in real difficulty.</P>
    <P>Any reasonable person examining the budget and the hopeful effects of it will have to agree in broad terms with the strategy adopted.  I believe that with this budget we have laid the foundations for the future.  The first thing that any person trying to build any structure has to do is to lay the foundations.  You have to dig down before you start building up.  The benefit of what we are doing may not be apparent in the short term.  It may not be apparent to members of the Opposition who probably would not be tempted to look down and see the mass of concrete beneath the ground, who naturally demand instant results and instant solutions to the problems.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the budget we have laid a good, firm foundation on which we can build for the future and with that firm foundation and the improvement that will result in our public finances and the reduction in our borrowing requirements we will put ourselves in a position that in the years ahead we will be able to devote a great amount of money towards the purpose we would like to be devoting it, into investment to produce jobs.  In the heel of the hunt, the money that should be going into investment and improving our economic situation, the money that should be improving the lot of the less <Col N="263" /> well-off, making the social improvements that should be made, is not there.  It is being sent out by way of interest and capital repayments on our borrowing. Once we get that problem right &mdash; we have started it and I believe the first step is the hardest &mdash; within two years I can see this country in a sound shape from the point of view of public finances.  I can see it much better able to cope with problems in the international arena economically and I can see it in a much better position to cope with the real major problem of the country, the problem of unemployment among our young people.</P>

      <P>If I was a member of the Labour Party listening to some of the remarks of the Minister of State towards the end of his speech I would shudder to think that he was saying in a most patronising way &mdash; I thought we were long gone from this &mdash; that those who have a job should be glad to have a job, that those who have a house are lucky to have one.  He started with a defence of the arithmetic of the budget and the necessity for financial rectitude. He went from there to say how lucky we were to be alive and have enough to eat. I was appalled.  It is such a departure from the contributions by that same Minister of State, who was then an Opposition Deputy, at the church gates of his widely spread West Cork constituency on the Sundays of last November.

      <P>After listening with interest to the speech of the Minister of State this morning, I must remind those people that he spoke at length and with such force this morning and I must <Col N="264" /> remind them about the conversion that has taken place in their elected representative. I do not see the joy, the hope or the future ahead which the Minister of State sees.  I am not sure if I should describe the budget as thick and tough or tough and thick.  I am not sure which to put first.  It is understandable that it had to be tough.  No budget has been more universally criticised by every sector of society, from the employer organisations to the trade unions, from the trade unions to the farming organisations, from the farming organisations to the youth groups.  Everybody has criticised this budget.  If it has had anything going for it, it is that its reception has been consistent among all groups of society.</P>
      <P>The thickness I referred to is to the lack of strategy.  The Minister of State referred to a strategy in the budget.  I fail to see it and I fail to see what course it was directing us on.  Certainly, from the point of view of the Labour Party, it is quite obvious that the Ministers had no input at Cabinet table into the preparation of that budget.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with some specific aspects of it.  I do not believe it is for me to go in detail into this new approach of people on the other side of the House saying that your credibility is questioned if you do not put up the alternative money or ways in which it could be raised.  Those people have the responsibility to govern. They sat on these benches so many times over the last five years when I was across on the other side and I heard them make all the promises, criticise all the moves and convey to the people that they had all the answers.  What a change it is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first subject I intend dealing with in some depth is the lack of approach to public service pay, pay policy and incomes policy.  The Minister says that there is a need for pay restraint.  I have to say that of course that is true but how we do it is very important.  I claim some credit for the successful renegotiation of public service pay agreement in October last year.  I indicated then if I was in Government I would, early in 1983, be meeting with the trade unions and the public sector to discuss 1983 strategy.  No such meetings have taken place yet, no <Col N="265" /> guidelines have been put forward.  It is very important that we have pay restraint in the private and public sectors but the leadership given by the Government is so different from the strategy suggested by the then Fine Gael Front Bench when, as, many remember, the Leader of the then Opposition hastened back from a holiday abroad for the purpose of convening a meeting of the Fine Gael Front Bench following certain decisions that had been taken by the then Government at the August weekend, 1982.  I have here a press statement, dated 5 September last, that was issued by the Fine Gael Front Bench and which was referred to at length by the Leader of the then main Opposition party.  Before reading from that press release I might refer to the irresponsibility of the man who is now Taoiseach in issuing a statement on the day before the executive committee of the ICTU were to meet.  This was the most irresponsible outburst from a leader of any main Opposition party that I have heard in my 11 years here. It was a deliberate attempt to undermine, in the interest of political gain and expediency, a situation being worked on by people who were concerned for the country as a whole.  I challenge the Minister who is to follow me in this debate to deny this.  I can expose it at any time that suits me. In the press release of the Fine Gael Front Bench, the Taoiseach said that he had also indicated the scale of increase in this pay bill in 1983 which he believed the economy could sustain.  He expressed the hope that the damage done by the Government's hamfisted initial approach to the problem would not prejudice the achievement by agreement of an increase of the order of approximately 10 per cent in the total public service pay bill for 1983, including a carry-over from 1982 of special increases.  Here we are a week after the budget and well into February with no indication of any leadership from the Government in the matter of public sector pay or of a pay and incomes policy generally.  Of course, we have heard the Government refer to the importance of this issue but I have here too what I regard as a very good information document, one that I used a good deal while <Col N="266" /> in Government and which I find very useful now also in Opposition.  I refer to the Industrial Relations News Service Report.  This contains a good deal of statistical information each week.  The information is well researched.  In the 4 February 1983 edition of this IRN report on page 2 there is the following heading &ldquo;Government Pay Policy &lsquo;Statement&rsquo; Fails to Materialise&rdquo;.  The first paragraph of the comment reads:</P>
    <P>For almost an entire week, the industrial press was given to expect a major Government policy statement on pay, a statement that, for obvious reasons, was awaited with avid expectations. What eventually was released on January 28th was, for the industrial press, something of a &lsquo;damp squib&rsquo;, with nothing new and, certainly nothing that could in any way be construed as &lsquo;pay policy&rsquo; contained.</P>
    <P>That is comment from people who are aware of what is happening in the whole industrial relations area.  It is fair and informed comment in relation to what was a build-up in the usual typical public relations style of this Government.  Let us compare that with the insincerity being advanced in September last year when the Leader of the then Opposition hastened home from abroad and made it appear that he had done so to save the country from being mishandled by a Government that he considered not to be capable of handling the economy. Deputy Kelly shares my view as to how well the situation was handled then by us.</P>
    <P>Despite the irresponsible and publicity-seeking efforts of Fine Gael then we still have no indication from them of their attitude in this area.  We read in the document I have referred to that some pay settlements have been reached in the private sector.  Income restraint is extremely important but this budget, rather than indicating leadership in that regard makes the situation more serious. Twelve-month settlements ranging from 13 to 15 per cent are being reached.  That situation should not be allowed continue.</P>
    <P>This whole matter of pay should not be led by public statements.  There must be <Col N="267" /> consultation and negotiation in private between the bodies concerned and the Government.  There is no point in issuing edicts as to what should be done.  On the Minister's admission the tax increases in the budget amount to 3½ per cent.  When I suggested to him the other evening that we could refer to the increases in terms of 4 per cent plus, he did not disagree. The reality is that it will be 4 per cent plus the knock-on effects and apart from the 1 per cent levy.  Therefore, we are starting from a base of 5 per cent plus knock-on effects.  This represents a major contribution to further difficulties arising in respect of pay settlements.</P>
    <P>We must have moderate pay settlements. I would not agree with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs regarding redundant workers and no pay settlements being available.  The approach must be to negotiate in the interest of all and to arrive at a level of increase that is in line with what the country and the companies can afford. We must ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from whatever increases are granted but if there is a strategy in this budget, it is a strategy of undermining to a large extent the possibility of arriving at the type of moderate pay increase that is needed so badly and that is the first damning feature of the budget.  It will lead to further inflation, an increase in the CPI and demands for wage increases far beyond what we are able to pay.  The lack of effort and of consultation in terms of getting together on this most important issue is already an indictment of the Government.  The Taoiseach has not seen fit yet to come to grips with this important matter.  I ask the Minister of State to tell his leader that the most important issue is the settlement by agreement and negotiation of the pay policy this year or next year.</P>
    <P>Another point which has given rise to some public controversy is the arithmetic of the budget.  I am not charging anybody with doing anything wrong, but I am convinced that the Minister has set out to achieve his budget deficit with something hidden in his back pocket.  I support him and wish him well, but I agree with the <Col N="268" /> ESRI commentators who say revenue has been deliberately estimated in a conservative way.  That is understandable in the light of recent experience and the fear of what interest rates in the current year may be.  Another area which will help the Minister is loan repayments.  His estimate is probably more than will be required. In reaching that figure he was not being dishonest, he was simply being cautious. In my view the Minister has these two good windfalls to protect him.  I wish him well in his efforts to achieve the current budget deficit, but I would hate to think he is using the protection of those two areas to ensure that his arithmetic turns out right.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said he agreed the budget did little or nothing for employment.  I am surprised that the Labour Ministers have ignored the most important problem facing the nation.  We have read a great deal about the National Development Corporation and how wrong Fianna Fáil were in not going ahead with it.  I could never establish from the other parties what they meant by National Development Corporation. I read in the lead-in to the Limerick conference that hundreds of millions of pounds would be made available for this corporation, but £7 million has been provided in this budget &mdash; to be fair I think there is £10 million available because we made £3 million available and the Government are probably transferring that as well.  No matter how one looks at it, £10 million is a far cry from hundreds of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in this budget has been on cutting back employment rather than helping employment.  That must be our prime concern.  The downturn in activity because of VAT increases, the actual cutbacks in capital expenditure and so on, will mean direct unemployment.  The Minister of State argued theoretically how expenditure on capital development did not necessarily mean employment to the full value of the increased expenditure. No-one could disagree with that. One must accept that more infrastructural development makes an immediate impact on employment and in the longer term it makes infrastructure for industrial <Col N="269" /> development more attractive and easier as time goes by.  A year or two ago Deputy Reynolds, then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was mocked when he said telephones would be available off the shelf in a short time, 1984.  In my own city and county they will be available off the shelf by the end of the year 1983.  My county has been hit much harder by this budget than other areas.  Expenditure in areas like telecommunications, roads and so on help in developing manufacturing industry in the long term and this adds to employment.  In my opinion the employment strategy in this budget is non-existent and the tendency is towards unemployment rather than employment.</P>
    <P>There is no encouragement to export. The Government speakers seem to have thrown in the towel.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy F. Fahey, a young man from Galway, who spoke in detail about the importance of the &lsquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  I am not too pushed about what they say in Europe about this campaign. They are all very good at protecting their own interests and it is possible that we have been good boys too often. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hegarty, is having a meeting today in connection with flour imports.  I wish him well.  He said this morning he wanted to see these imports stopped and I agree with him and assure him that I will do anything I can to help him.  The problems of flour milling in this country did not start with this or the last Government.  They started many moons ago and the problems became more serious as time went on.  I was involved with the first threatened closure of Kelly's of Kilcock, part of the Rank organisation and take some credit for the successful conclusion of negotiations which kept that bakery open.  I was not very successful in my later efforts with Ranks dealing with the north Dublin bakery or the bakery in my own city.  I often felt this company had a death wish in some of its enterprises in this country.</P>
    <P>They supplied the industry with 32 per cent of the flour necessary and I do not like to see that flour being imported.  I will support the Minister for Agriculture in his efforts to prevent that happening. <Col N="270" /> As a Government we did not achieve what we wanted in this area and I look forward to seeing this Minister succeed. As we have seen, some people have been sent to prison but I do not want to go into that in detail.  I realise these people have gone against their trade union decisions but I can imagine the frustration they feel as employees of a multi-national company which failed to provide the expected redundancy payments.  The greater sin I see this company having committed is not having an investment programme.</P>
    <P>I have complimented Deputy Fahey on his contribution to the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; Campaign. When Minister and in Opposition, I have rarely missed an opportunity of encouraging buying and selling Irish and am not too worried about who says that I should not.  The quantity of imported foreign food on display in many of our large supermarkets is most unfair.  We can produce food of a better quality and certainly from a less polluted environment than most of our European counterparts. All Members of this House at every organisational and trade union meetings, if they have an interest in the future of their country, should encourage the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; Campaign.</P>
    <P>There is an unexplained tradition in the Fine Gael Party not to make much noise about buying Irish.  Deputy Fahey has said that a job saved might be that of a father, mother, sister or brother and how important that would be.  In some areas it is more fashionable to stand and walk in imported shoes, particularly for men.  Some think it more trendy to stand and walk in imported shoes, although we have here some excellent manufacturers of these products.  This does damage at a time of overall serious economic difficulty. It is not enough to pay lip service to buying Irish &mdash; positive steps must be taken.  Many of our industries which could have been saved over the years have been lost through imports, mainly from low cost countries, with whose prices our manufacturers could not compete. However, I fully understand that the mother of three, four or five children may have to buy their clothing at the lower price.  That is not the case about which I am talking.  I am speaking about <Col N="271" /> people who buy an imported product because it appears to be packaged more attractively than our own.</P>
    <P>Were the Labour Party Ministers present when this Government programme was being prepared?  I remember a former Leader of the Labour Party leading a section of a massive protest on PAYE when I was Minister for Labour.  This former Leader, now a member of the Fine Gael Party, is conspicuous by his silence on this budget, the first in so many years which did nothing for equity.  There was some window-dressing and whitewashing, but nothing in real terms.  Not only has it done nothing for equity, but it has increased considerably the burden on PAYE contributors.  Will the Labour Party Members continue to follow Fine Gael through the lobbies of this House in support of this budget?  If so, they will be doing a major disservice to what was once a proud party of which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is a respected member. The Labour Party supporters are disillusioned &mdash; the PAYE contributors on whose behalf they made so much noise for so long.  These people ask, was it just craw-thumping?  Our successive budgets recognised the need for steps towards equity, but the present budget is one major step backwards where tax equity is concerned, which, as the figures emerge during this year, will be shown clearly.</P>
    <P>We have discussed the financial resolutions, some in detail, and late last Wednesday night I asked the Minister how the 1 per cent would work in respect of sectors other than PAYE.  PAYE is the one area of collection where there is no problem, provided the money is sent in by the people doing that collecting. However, with regard to the collection of that 1 per cent from self-employed and farmers that is not equity, although I accept the administrative difficulties involved.  This is doing the opposite to what we have been trying to do for so long.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed at the handling of the area of public service pay, although I will continue to support the necessity for restraint and any positive <Col N="272" /> moves by the Government in that respect.  The Government should not be sitting back and hoping that the problem will go away, because it will not.  They must negotiate with the responsible parties and groups in this area.</P>
    <P>I see school groups this morning in the gallery.  It is good to see teachers bringing these children to see their national parliament and this should be encouraged. It is important that democracy should survive, although there are many who would like to see it pulled down.  Motorists driving through urban and rural areas seeing the vast numbers of children getting out of school at closing time must appreciate the problem for whatever Government are in power.  We should all endeavour to co-ordinate an approach to the greater use of training facilities and work experience programmes and the encouragement of inventive schemes and a lot more besides.  Even all that will not solve this major problem, which is common to all Europe.  Because of our population and workforce growth, it is a bigger problem for us.  The Government have my sympathy and support in dealing with this problem for which there are no easy solutions and which will not disappear overnight.  The population growth will be with us for ten years and this budget does absolutely nothing to tackle the ensuing problems.</P>
    <P>A major departure from normal procedures occurred on budget day, when the Minister, in his long speech, glossed over certain items and we were then issued with the <i>Principal Features of Budget.</i> These contained items never heretofore, in my experience, contained in a document of this nature and which were not mentioned by the Minister.  He spoke about cuts and cutbacks.  He spoke about changes in the Estimates as had been presented.  I support the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs in his statements of necessity for Dáil reform and indeed for public service reform.  I have just remembered that there was just one item I forgot to mention when discussing public service pay. I support public service reform but it must be handled in conjunction with a good, loyal, hardworking and dedicated <Col N="273" /> civil service.  I believe that the greatest insult to that civil service was when this Government, in their wisdom, were considering what other means of taxation were available and almost went along the road of taxing gratuities being paid to long-serving civil servants.  Despite the Taoiseach running for cover and saying there was no truth in rumours that there were possible retirements I can tell him that there were many people missing on Wednesday last on a day's leave who might not have returned on Thursday last had the Government not changed their direction at the last minute.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment in the House knows that what I am saying is correct.  He is aware also the terrible step it would have constituted because it would have been done without consultation or compensation.  Surely the public service who have served us so well for so long deserve better treatment than that.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt as well that consideration was given to the PRSI contributions as they apply to the public sector. I am now satisfied that there has been a postponement in this regard for the moment at any rate.  There was a veiled threat in the budget speech that, in the event of additional moneys being needed for pay, they would have to be found somewhere else.  These are areas at which I have no doubt the Minister for Finance is still looking.  I warn this Government that issues of this nature do not warrant decision in that way.  If ever to be contemplated they could be done only through consultation, agreement and negotiation. I support the necessity for public service reform but done in the way I have outlined. I wish my successor every success in that regard in any reasonable steps he proposes taking towards that end.  There is one thing, however, on which I shall not compliment him and which must be a source of some embarrassment to him, that is, when the Minister for Finance, really scraping the bottom of the barrel, decided he could get £500,000 extra by charging fees to candidates in civil service examinations.  How low can one stoop by seeking £500,000 in that way?  Certainly I would have had very strong and hot <Col N="274" /> words with any Minister for Finance, a colleague of mine, who tried to do that. It was an unfortunate step because it indicates to me a sort of patronising attitude, one of more or less saying to a young boy or girl: yes, you may sit for an examination but we will charge you a fee for doing so; you are being given a very great honour by being allowed.  It smacks somewhat of the old, outdated apprenticeship or guild system as it was at that time.  In fact time was, in the nursing service, when one had to pay to get in. There is a bit of that attitude about this proposal.  Imagine Labour Ministers sitting at the Cabinet table while this retrograde step was being considered.</P>
    <P>The speaker before me almost said: you are lucky to have jobs, to have houses, to have enough to eat compared with what I see when I go around.  I accept and support the idea of more money being made available for overseas development aid.  I should like to see even more being made available.  I agree with the Minister of State there.  But we must realise that there are many problems on our doorsteps, in our towns. There are also in rural areas where perhaps people are better catered for simply because people in need are better known than they are in our cities and towns.  But there is quite a lot not so well known to so many.  Therefore I am glad there is more money being made available for overseas development aid but that does not solve many of our problems at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said this morning there were cutbacks in some Estimates. We wish the Government well in their efforts to achieve them but I wonder how realistic are some of them.  In this respect I shall mention one only.  I see, in the revised Estimates, that there is a proposal to reduce Garda overtime by a further £3 million.  I honestly believe that, in our Estimates, there would have been difficulty in achieving a cut of the magnitude we were proposing, or at least a limit of the magnitude we were proposing.  But a further £3 million cut strikes me as being over-ambitious particularly when one remembers a crime such as the Shergar one committed last week.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the comments of <Col N="275" /> the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment on the subject of controlled dwellings under the Rent Restrictions Act of last year that created such problems on all sides of the House as a result of the Supreme Court decision. We are awaiting the announcement of the establishment of the tribunal.  In our Estimates there had been provision for £15.5 million for rent allowances for tentants of formerly controlled dwellings under the Acts.  That figure is being reduced to £10.5 million, in other words a cut of £5 million and the explanation given is that it is being done in the light of more up-to-date information.  I am aware of the contributions of the Minister of State present on this measure in the House.  In view of his expressed interest I would ask him to tell the House what more up-to-date information became available between the preparation of our Estimates and theirs.  I suspect it was a stab to find £5 million and that the only more up-to-date information might be a possible postponement of the establishment of the tribunal.  I hope I am wrong but I should like the Minister of State to confirm or deny that.</P>
    <P>I come now to the public capital expenditure side where we really see the cutting operation.  Despite all the noise and promises, particularly those by the Labour Party in the lead up to and during the election campaign about what they would and would not do in Government and what they would not cut, in the <i>Principal Features of Budget</i>&mdash; the pink document &mdash; we are given all the details glossed over so lightly in the Minister's main budget speech.  The Public Capital Programme as published by us was for a figure of £2,110 million.  We are told this is being reduced to £1,890 million, a reduction of £220 million.  We are told then where the principal elements of that reduction are &mdash; £27 million in sectoral economic investment, £41 million in productive infrastructure, £32 million in social infrastructure and the deferment of the global contingency provision of £120 million.  I want an assurance from the Ministers opposite that companies such as Irish Steel, NET or Verolme <Col N="276" /> Dockyard will be catered for if they need money and that jobs there will be protected. Other companies are involved also.  What insurance exists for the workers in the companies to which I refer?  Let us be honest about the effects of this measure.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party recently met a deputation from the trade unions and employers and all involved in the construction industry.  They were impressed by his approach and believed that money would be available in the budget to help the building industry.  The opposite was the case.  In his own area of responsibility, provision for roads and sanitary services has been reduced by £18 million and housing by £13 million, a total of £31 million.  The Minister for Social Welfare was a Member of this House during the term of the 1973-77 Coalition Government and he has often cited the great achievement of the Labour Minister who was responsible for housing.  Is this cut in the housing provision a desirable social development?  Certainly not.</P>
    <P>These are some of the cuts in capital expenditure which the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs tried to defend this morning.  He knew his case was a poor one and almost indefensible and he put up a brave show in the circumstances, especially considering the impact on his own region of some of these cuts.</P>
    <P>Government Ministers in recent times seem to be attacking the press and they appear to have become supersensitive. This morning the Minister of State mentioned a comment by Bishop Casey as reported in the press.  I do not wish to attack <i>The Cork Examiner,</i> which every Corkman, wherever he is, must read but an article on the front page of today's edition reports a statement by the president of Cork Chamber of Commerce accusing Deputy John Wilson of downgrading the Cork region.  The Cork Chamber of Commerce is probably one of the best in the country and when the president of that body speaks he commands respect but I think he should check his facts.  Under the heading &ldquo;Chamber chief accuses Wilson&rdquo; the article states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> The Government Minister accused of downgrading the Cork region was identified last evening as Fianna Fáil's John Wilson.  Cork Chamber of Commerce President Mr. John McHenry named the ex-Fianna Fáil Transport Minister as the one who dismissed a request by a Cork delegation for Government investment in the Ringaskiddy deep-sea berth.</P>
    <P>Let me put the record straight.  In the 1982 Estimates prepared by the then Coalition Government no provision was made for a deep-water berth at Ringaskiddy. During the election campaign we indicated that on return to Government such money would be provided at the first opportunity.  Our Leader indicated this during a visit to Ringaskiddy.  Deputy John Wilson, who was then Minister for Transport, visited Cork in September and our Estimates when prepared included £1 million for the deep-water berth.  Cork Harbour Commissioners were informed by letter on 8 December that this money would be made available and they went ahead and obtained a tender which would have given good value for money.  However, we were told on Wednesday last that the money is no longer available because of the decision of this Government.  I wish to contradict the reported statement of the president of Cork Chamber of Commerce.  The commitment made by Deputy John Wilson was honoured.  Last week I saw a prize-winning photograph of Deputy Wilson looking at me in a much more friendly manner than shown in this morning's edition of <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> I am not in any way blaming <i>The Cork Examiner</i> but I am complaining about a statement by a respected person in Cork and saying that he is not correct.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs said that when he was young jobs in West Cork were scarce and many people sailed away on the <i>Innisfallen.</i> They cannot do so this week because the B &amp; I service no longer operates.  No decisions were taken by the previous Government on the future of B &amp; I in the Cork region.  The part played by B &amp; I goes back many decades and <Col N="278" /> has many poignant memories for Cork families whose relatives emigrated.  In recent years it has provided an extremely important link in the tourist industry but management decisions over a period of years have not helped and one has the impression that somewhere there was a death wish and a feeling that the Cork area did not need this service any longer. I ask the Government to instruct B &amp; I to continue this service at least for the coming tourist season and at the same time to investigate the continuation of a link with the Welsh coast.  The Cork-Swansea service operated very well for many years.  Another decision which helped to speed the demise of the service was the taking away of the <i>Connacht</i> and its replacement by the <i>Innisfallen.</i> There have been several ships under the name <i>Innisfallen</i> and it is almost as much a part of Cork as the Shandon Bells.  I would ask the Government seriously to consider a short-term B &amp; I service to cope with this year's tourist season and to investigate the possible development of a new service.</P>
    <P>In a debate such as this we are allowed what could be described as the parochial run but at this time it is extremely important for me because we have employment problems in Cork city and county.  We were lucky to have many old traditional industries but the job losses in recent times have been great.  I thank the IDA for bringing many new industries but, unfortunately, the fall-out was pretty high and the impact of new industries was less than might have been expected.</P>
    <P>The budget strategy will do a lot of damage to the tourist industry.  I was interested to hear the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, say this morning that tourism should give more and he suggested this should be done by the industry raising money itself.  However, £1 million has been cut from the allocation to tourism and the employment incentive scheme has been withdrawn from the hotel and catering industry.  I appeal to the Government to restore that.  The hotel industry is suffering because of the imposition of VAT and a downturn in numbers.  The Government should restore the employment incentive <Col N="279" /> scheme to cover the hotel and catering industry and the building industry.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be told that there is no money to restore that scheme. Accepting that there is a shortage of money the Government should ensure that the hotel and catering industry gets its fair share of the cake.  Manufacturing and agriculture should get its share, but the cake should be divided equally.  To withdraw the scheme from the hotel and catering industry represents a retrograde step.  The budget will fuel inflation and its deflationary aspects will be felt in the coming months.  The decision to increase VAT by 5 per cent on almost all essentials is a penal imposition on our people.  Of course the full impact will not be felt for some time but the most serious aspect of that increase is that it will fuel inflation. The knock-on impact of that increase on the CPI will be enormous as the year goes on.  I do not have time to refer to the effect of the VAT increase on fuel but suffice to say that it will affect the elderly people living in our cities.  It will also hurt industry.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the weekend this is a budget that even after spending many nights discussing one would not expose some of the hidden impositions.  I am amazed that Ministers from the Labour Party presided over the measures in the budget.  There is no use defending it in a patronising way, as occurred this morning, by saying that people were lucky to have a house, a job and enough to eat.  I hope the Minister for Health, who will follow me, will not indulge in the same type of patronising attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall confine my remarks to aspects of the health and social welfare services.  I should like to commence with the decisions taken in conjunction with the budget which affect our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that the policy decisions taken by the previous Government in conjunction with determining departmental allocations for 1983 were reflected in the published Estimates for the various Departments.  In the case of the Department of Health I have had no <Col N="280" /> option in the period of six weeks in office but to implement most of these decisions. I had considerable reservations, however, concerning the Fianna Fáil decisions to introduce public ward charges and charges for out-patient services.  To my mind the introduction of such charges would represent a major policy change which should not be contemplated until there is an opportunity of reviewing fully the health care system, including the basis of entitlement and funding arrangements. I will be covering this ground in a White Paper which I intend to bring out before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided, therefore, not to proceed now with public ward and out-patient charges.  The loss of the extra income which would have resulted from such charges will be made good by other means.  In addition there is the further saving of £10.3 million to be achieved on the published Estimate. These savings and the loss in income will be compensated for by savings elsewhere in the Estimate, which I will now describe.</P>
    <P>The cost of the General Medical Services Scheme is expected to be about £7.5 million less than originally anticipated due to the trend of price increases of drugs and medicines being more favourable than earlier envisaged.  The lowering of the British inflation rate helps us in the drugs prices negotiations.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on levels of medicine prices have been concluded with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries and a new agreement is expected to be signed shortly.  Further savings on medicines are expected to arise on the basis of the new agreement, additional to the saving of £7.5 million.</P>
    <P>The previous Government decided to adjust the drugs refund scheme so as to contain expenditure on the scheme with an overall figure of £13 million.  Because of the limitation of the funds available for health, it has been decided to achieve further savings of £5 million on the scheme in 1983.  Therefore, for this year the overall expenditure on the scheme must be confined to £8 million.  This was regarded as a less undesirable cost saving option than others which were considered. <Col N="281" /> The Voluntary Health Insurance Board will be adjusting their schemes to tie in with the changes to be made in the scheme.  I will be making an announcement in a week or so about increasing the £16 drug refund limit.</P>
    <P>There will be a saving of £1.8 million on subhead G9 of the Health Vote arising from a decision to wind up the National Community Development Agency.  This saving is to be transferred to the Social Welfare Vote for the new Combat Poverty Organisation and certain other voluntary agencies.  Finally, it has been decided that institutional budgets should be reduced by a total of £5 million.  This, I might add, represents only about 0.65 per cent of overall institutional budgets. I am sending notification of that £5 million cut to the health boards and other health agencies in the next day or so.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the implications of adjustments in the estimate for non-capital allocations approved for health agencies for 1983.  The changes in the Health Estimate and in the associated decisions will have to be reflected in the non-capital allocations for 1983 which were approved for health agencies.  The extra income which would have resulted from the new hospital charges which the former Government had decided to introduce, namely, public-ward and out-patient charges, was reflected in the approved allocations for 1983.  Because of the decision not to proceed with these, it is proposed to make appropriate upward adjustments in the approved allocations.  On the other hand, the other cost-saving measures which I have described will enable allocations to be reduced.</P>
    <P>My Department will be in touch shortly with health agencies in regard to the adjustments required in the allocations. Next Friday I will be meeting with the chairmen and chief executive officers of health boards.  This will provide an opportunity for a full discussion in regard to the current year's budgetary situation of health agencies.</P>
    <P>Most countries are becoming increasingly alarmed about the considerable escalation in the cost of health services. <Col N="282" /> Our experience parallels that of other countries.  Costs in actual terms, in real terms and as a percentage of GNP have increased over the past decade at a rate which cannot be contemplated for the future.  In 1972-73 non-capital health expenditure amounted to about £108 million, representing about 4.7 per cent of GNP.  In the current year the cost is estimated at £1,020 million which will represent almost 8 per cent of GNP.  It must now be accepted that, whatever deficiencies there are in the present range of services, in the immediate future these can be remedied only in three ways:</P>
    <P>(1)  the extent that any extra funds required for this purpose can be released from other areas of health expenditure; or</P>
    <P>(2)  by charges for existing services; or</P>
    <P>(3)  by increasing health contributions.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Any decisions in these areas must be based in all instances on ability to pay a true and fair share towards the cost of such services.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the adjustment in the non-capital allocation in the current year.  This reality assumed a very concrete shape in July last when not only did it become apparent that additional moneys were not going to be made available but, in fact, moneys previously allocated had to be reduced.  The economic situation has continued to deteriorate and our present difficulties have been fully spelled out in the budget presentation which the Minister for Finance gave to the House on 9 February last.  In that scenario it would be quite unrealistic to anticipate that, in the immediate future, 1984-85, significant additional resources can be made available to the health services.</P>
    <P>My objective must, therefore, be to ensure in the first instance that the essential fabric of the services is maintained by ensuring the maximum efficiency in the operation of the existing services, the rationalisation of services to promote that efficiency, and the elimination of practices and services which are either <Col N="283" /> unnecessary or wasteful.  Whatever expansion in the services is needed to meet urgent needs will have to be financed in a major way by the redeployment of resources both personnel and financial.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that some of the facilities within hospital services could be reorganised without serious implications for essential services.  I am taking steps to have any such facilities identified in order to free up resources which might then be otherwise used.  Freeing up resources in this manner is one way of trying to meet the continuing demands for expenditure in hospital services.  For example, even after two months I am being pressurised to develop facilities for open heart surgery, for bone marrow transplants, for additional accident and emergency services and for other aspects of institutional care.  It is clear that there is an ever-increasing demand for acute hospital services and these, as Deputies know, are particularly expensive services involving as they do large numbers of staff and very expensive high technology resources.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that special project teams are currently working on various aspects of existing hospital services. These are reviewing such matters as hospitals admission policies.  It is obviously of the highest importance that people who do not require to be treated within hospitals should not be admitted to them and that those who do require such treatment are discharged from hospitals as soon as possible after the completion of the appropriate treatment.  In these two areas alone it will be very surprising if we do not discover that some improvements can be made which will have the effect of freeing up resources which might then be used to meet other demands within the services.  In addition to these matters there is also an examination being undertaken of other aspects of the provision of hospital services.  Specifically patient transport, purchase and storage of supplies, housekeeping and laundry in hospitals, and insurance arrangements of health boards are being examined.  I am waiting, with some considerable expectation, <Col N="284" /> an early outcome from these studies also.</P>
    <P>With regard to out-patient services, my aim, as I have said before, is to try to lay a greater emphasis on treatment within the community.  In pursuing this aim it is appropriate that we should, as we are in the process of doing, investigate very closely the existing arrangements for the provision of out-patient services.  It is far from clear that the existing systems are the most effective.  I have never been able to understand why it should be necessary to have people waiting three or four hours to see consultants, and I find it impossible to accept that there are not better methods of dealing with this problem than those currently in operation. Our aim should be to suit, as far as possible, both those providing the services and those receiving them.  This would be a step towards more effective utilisation of hospital staff time and considerable saving to the many people who, in order to attend at out-patient departments, have to forego a half day's pay.</P>
    <P>We must also devote a great deal more thought to the possibility of dealing with people on a day hospital basis.  Some effective work has been done in different parts of the country in introducing this type of service and I hope that we can adapt approved procedures and extend them into all areas.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I am looking also at the possibility of involving the general practitioner more closely in the delivery of services which can be provided on an out-patient basis.  In deciding on the level of diagnostic facilities in the hospital we should, as a matter of routine, consider the extent to which it would be appropriate to have some or all of these facilities available to general practitioners.  After all they are the people who know most about the patients for whom certain tests or examinations are being sought and there seems, in principle, to be a good deal to be said for ensuring that they can see to it that only necessary tests are done and that these are, to greatest possible extent, done on an out-patient basis.  In doing so, one would help to maintain the general practitioner's responsibility for the continuing care of his patient, to help <Col N="285" /> him to maintain the level of professional expertise which is desirable and, not least, to facilitate the patient in obtaining services.</P>
    <P>I am, as I mentioned, anxious to promote to the greatest extent possible the provision of health care in the community. This has been the avowed intention of successive Ministers for Health in recent years and could almost be regarded as the conventional wisdom in the provision of health services.  An examination, however, of the resources we have been devoting in recent years to the provision of services in the community suggests we have been only paying lip service to this ideal.  In general financial terms the percentage of current health expenditure on community services in recent years has been falling rather than rising.  Whereas in 1976 the percentage of current health expenditure on community services was approximately 23 per cent, it has in recent years fallen to below 20 per cent.  The present position is therefore that, despite the general acceptance of the view that prevention of illness, the promotion of health and maintenance of people within the community are matters of fundamental importance and deserving of high priority, the actual allocation of our resources does not reflect this viewpoint.  The proponderance of resources continues to be allocated to institutional care with the highest proportion of this going on the acute hospitals which contain the highest levels of medical staff, the most advanced technology and overall highest ratio of staff to patients.  This situation will have to be changed and I intend to do so.</P>
    <P>The capital programme for the next few years involves the completion of a number of major institutions.  These and extensions to other large general hospitals will require the recruitment of the highest levels of medical staff and a very high level of nursing and other medical staff.  The revenue costs of running these hospitals will make increasing demands during the next few years on resources which, it is quite apparent, are going to be much more limited then they have been in the past.  I would have to say that in these circumstances it would <Col N="286" /> seem to me that any increased expenditure, or even the restoration of the former level of expenditure on community care, can only be achieved by some restriction on the expansion of hospital services.  I am having an examination undertaken of the possibility of doing this.  It is not easy to make changes, particularly in projects which have reached an advanced level, but I am satisfied that it is necessary to do so if I am to give effect to my stated conviction that, to an extent, the existing balance in our health care expenditure requires adjustment.</P>
    <P>One thinks in this connection in particular of services which are provided for the elderly.  I would like to see an examination undertaken urgently of the existing services for the aged with a view to establishing the extent to which improvements in them can be effected and to identifying the services to which it would be most cost effective to allocated resources.</P>
    <P>In short, we are taking steps to keep within the budget funds for 1983 which have been allocated to us.  We are currently examining in the areas of greatest expenditure aspects of the provision of services which we hope will free resources which would be available to meet some of the claimant demands for newer or better services.  I am in particular considering whether, in order to strengthen the community services, it would not be possible to find some money by slowing down to a limited extent developments in the provision of further hospital facilities.  In particular, it will be my policy to devote the resource saved to the improvement of integrated institutional and community services for geriatric cases, for the continued development of community facilities for psychiatric cases and for the improvement of the living environment of long stay mentally ill persons.  The replacement of outmoded and often fire hazardous accommodation will rank high in my priorities for capital moneys as will the replacement and improvement of facilities from which community health and welfare services are delivered.</P>
    <P>The health service is a highly labour intensive industry and is the biggest <Col N="287" /> employment sector in the public service. The number of persons currently employed, in terms of whole-time equivalents, is around the 60,000 mark.  Apart from the eight health boards, which employ approximately two thirds of this work force, there are over 100 other voluntary and statutory bodies engaged in the provision of the health services. There are various voluntary hospitals, mental handicap centres and health corporate bodies, such as the National Rehabilitation Board and the Blood Transfusion Board.  This work force is comprised of over 300 different grades which, taken in conjunction with the wide range of services provided, the number of different employment authorities and various types of specialist agencies involved, together go to make up a fairly complex industry.  When we think of the health services we generally think in terms of doctors, nurses, dentists and para-medical staff and we tend to forget about the considerable back-up force that is necessary to any health care system &mdash; the engineers, technicians, catering and maintenance staff, administrative and clerical systems.</P>
    <P>The past decade or so has seen a considerable expansion in the work force in the health services.  If you take the health boards, for example, between the years 1974 and 1981 there was a 45 per cent growth in the numbers employed.  Voluntary hospitals, including corporate body hospitals such as St. James's, would also have increased numbers to much the same extent over that period also.</P>
    <P>The present recession, of course, and the Government's policies in relation to the containment of the growth of the public sector have affected the health services just the same as other sectors of the public service.  With the considerable growth over recent years, however, we are in a position to take pause and look at the overall situation to see what remains to be done.  Various studies and analyses are already under way as part of a general review of programmes.  With the current lack of additional resources a closer look is being taken at how our existing resources are deployed so as to <Col N="288" /> ensure that the optimum use is made of what we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>In the present circumstances there would seem to be no alternative but to deploy our existing resources in accordance with the priorities to be given to the various aspects of the health services. This may necessitate the reshaping of our existing work force to accord with these priorities.  As far as the professional staffs engaged in the provision of health services are concerned, we do seem, by and large, to have an adequate supply of well-trained people available.  In the case of a few para-medical grades there is a slight shortage of skills, but in the overall context of the health services the numbers involved are very slight and it should be possible to overcome the problems in these areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to medical consultants there is some difficulty in filling jobs in a few of the medical specialties, but recent developments in training programmes should remedy this situation.  Also at medical consultant level there are some posts which have been approved by Comhairle na nOspidéal and which have not been filled because of the current lack of resources.  This is a matter that will have to be looked at in the light of the current review of programmes to see what should be done as regards this matter.  At this stage all I can say is that over the period I referred to earlier there was a much greater increase in the number of non-consultant hospital doctor posts than the average increase mentioned and it may be worth looking at the question of redeployment of resources in that area.</P>
    <P>As we enter the fourth successive year of international recession, with its associated contraction of demand and unprecedented high levels of unemployment, we are faced with a budget situation where returns on the existing taxation base are not sufficient to maintain current levels of Government spending.  The Government have, therefore, had to face reality in balancing the demands being made upon Exchequer finances with the resources available to it.  I am acutely aware of the pressures generated by the recession for those who are sick or invalided, for those who are unemployed or <Col N="289" /> who are retired and dependent on social welfare pensions.  I am also acutely aware of the difficulties which the recession poses in making an adequate response.  It is at times such as these that the need for the income-maintenance services are most stretched.  It is essential, therefore, that resources are allocated to best advantage to help those whose needs are greatest.</P>
    <P>The problems of the exceptionally high levels of unemployment are added to by the high proportion of young people in our population structure.  This means an increasing labour force and results in very substantial increases in expenditure by the Department of Social Welfare before any allowance is made for increased payments.  Since the 1983 Estimates were prepared by the previous Government the continuing rise in unemployment has made it necessary to provide an additional £31 million under this heading before any question of increases in rates of payment could be considered.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary financial circumstances made a major provision in social welfare payments almost out of the question for this year.  However, the long-term beneficiaries should, to a limited extent, have their benefits protected until a real increase can be provided in next year's budget.  While short-term beneficiaries will receive a lesser increase, it must be borne in mind that many qualify for pay-related supplements, however much reduced.  Neither I nor the Government are happy with the situation but it is nevertheless a provision having regard to the limited financial resources available this year.</P>
    <P>Before the budget the Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare provided for a total overall expenditure of £1,780 million.  Of this amount the Exchequer would have contributed some £949 million and the balance of £831 million would come mainly from contributions of employers and employees.  As a result of the decisions taken in the budget, overall expenditure in 1983 will rise by some £86.6 million.  This will come to about £160 million in a full year.  The increased rates have been circulated to Deputies and I do not propose to comment <Col N="290" /> on them at this stage.  However, I wish to comment on a question that has come up quite frequently, namely, the misuse of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the need to allocate the available resources to the best advantage in meeting the needs of those dependent on social welfare payments. There can be no doubt that when resources are scarce those who misuse the system are siphoning off funds which could be used to improve the lot of those who must, of necessity, rely on the social welfare system.  Those who abuse the system are also placing an unfair burden on the working population who support these benefits through their PRSI contributions and taxation.</P>
    <P>It is popular to believe in the current anti-welfare climate, which I deplore, that there is a high level of social welfare abuse.  I believe that the extent of such abuse is much exaggerated.  I am particularly concerned at a time of high unemployment to avoid attaching suspicion or odium to the overwhelming majority of unemployed claimants who are entitled under law to these payments.  As an insured person since 1952, I have never in my working life had to &ldquo;draw the labour&rdquo; for myself as a single person or for my family as a married person.  I suggest that those who talk so frequently about the &ldquo;work ethic&rdquo; and &ldquo;work incentive&rdquo; should try to live on unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or even on pay-related payments.  They should do so for four or five months, preferably for nine months and become long-term recipients.  If some Deputies tried that exercise I think it would cure them of the paranoia that some of them have about the work ethic.  I should like to quote Austin Clarke: I quoted him before in the early seventies when I did a paper for the Labour Party on social welfare.  He said, &ldquo;The poor have no friends, only their rights&rdquo;.  At the same time I accept fully the need to combat misuse where it exists and I will do all in my power in this matter.  I would point out also that we have a duty as citizens, not to mention the financial benefit as taxpayers, to prevent abuses.  Many of the abuses spoken of today could not be <Col N="291" /> perpetrated without full co-operation of others.  If this co-operation were withheld there would be far less scope for such abuses.</P>
    <P>We must also remember that abuses of the social welfare system are not confined solely to beneficiaries.  Employers who default in the payment of PRSI contributions or who delay in remitting such contributions are also guilty of fraud, and a particularly reprehensible form of fraud at that.  Not alone are they failing to meet legal obligations to their employees in the form of contributions to their social security, they are also misappropriating funds that have been deducted from the wages of their employees.  I am concerned, particularly at a time when resources for social welfare are stretched for various reasons, that this problem will not be exacerbated by delay or default in the payment of PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the changes relating to short-time workers. In general, about two-thirds of short-time workers will have incomes ranging from 81 per cent to 90 per cent of their fulltime net income and about one-third will have net incomes in excess of this level but substantially less than they had been received under the existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>In respect of the changes proposed for disability benefit and pay-related benefit, it will mean about 86 per cent of net weekly earnings in current terms will be paid as against 98 per cent under existing arrangements.  These changes are fairly substantial but at a time when there are 200,000 people on the live register we have no option but to spread the pay-related supplement as equitably as possible. Expenditure on pay-related benefit in 1981 amounted to £58.5 million, in 1982 it was £77.8 million and it is expected to amount to £61.3 million in 1983.  There have been other changes which I will refer to on another occasion. The Government introduced the family income supplement scheme and an announcement about that will be made in due course.  I do not propose to refer to the rates of PRSI contributions which are not being increased this year.  About <Col N="292" /> 155,000 workers will be affected by the provision to alter the ceiling from £9,500 to £13,000 from April next.</P>
    <P>Apart from the £5 million in respect of the new family income supplement, the budget improvements in social welfare will amount to £80.6 million in 1983 and £157.5 million in a full year.  To this must be added the cost of the improvements in health allowances which will amount to £3 million in 1983 and £5.9 million in a full year.  I do not deny that the amounts are limited: they barely and in some respects do not meet the cost of inflation.  However, we could not provide any real increase in 1983.  This is a reflection of the grave unemployment situation facing us.  It is also a reflection on successive Governments for their failure to develop a fair and equitable system of taxation and also to provide family income maintenance.</P>
    <P>The extent to which this Government transform the situation will be the real yardstick of their concern for social justice and real equality in our society. When we came to office we had only a few weeks to look at the Estimates and make some relatively minor changes in order to bring in the budget.  I hope we will be given the opportunity within a matter of a year or two to start on that work even in times of serious recession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East)</i>: Let me say at the outset that, while I readily accept that this question is entirely legitimate, it is necessary for me to be particularly careful about anything I might say in present circumstances where it seems inescapable that the question and my answer will be linked in the public mind with a very recent case that in certain major respects is still <i>sub judice.</i></P>
      <P>My attitude is that, as a matter of principle, I am prepared to consider any proposal that is not clearly misconceived but, as far as the particular proposal in the question is concerned, the position is that the rights and interests of a person charged with murder are already protected by elaborate safeguards and I have no reason to believe that they are in any way insufficient.  If, however, the Deputy wants to make a case that those safeguards, taken together, are insufficient, I suggest that he might send me a written statement of the arguments and I will have the matter further examined.

      <P>The question is simply asking the Minister if he will consider an amendment to the criminal justice legislation to ensure that in cases, as I say in the question, where an accused person pleads guilty to murder &mdash; I understand that there have been at least three such cases in the last two or three years &mdash; which carries the mandatory life sentence, legislation will be there to ensure that the court would be required to hear psychiatric evidence.  Is it not a fact that in a recent case the defence attempted to introduce psychiatric evidence and it was not done?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Donaghmede is one of a number of areas in and around Dublin where there is a local demand for the establishment of a Garda station.  The difficulty about providing extra Garda stations, apart from the high capital costs involved, is that manning them absorbs Garda manpower which might be used more effectively on patrol duty in the areas concerned.</P>
      <P>The Donaghmede area is at present served by Coolock and Raheny Garda stations.  Since 30 June 1982 there has been a net increase in garda strength at both these stations of 17 and six, respectively. Four newly trained gardaí will be assigned to Coolock next week and further increases in strength at both stations will be considered according as the additional manpower at present in training becomes available for assignment to the various centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the assignment of extra gardaí to Coolock and Raheny stations has enabled them to provide additional foot and mobile patrols in the Donaghmede area.  The policing arrangements for the area will be kept under review with a view to effecting further improvements in the Garda service according as additional manpower becomes available.  The provision of an improved Garda service in the whole area served by Coolock and Raheny stations may obviate the need for a new station in Donaghmede.  Accordingly, there is no proposal at present to <Col N="298" /> provide a Garda station in the area, but the Deputies can be assured that the situation will be kept under review by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the detailed submissions made by the community in Donaghmede to his predecessor and to himself.  Would he not agree, whilst, heretofore, communities and individuals have been attempting to discourage Garda presence from their areas there is a very welcome and healthy development here?  The community are anxious to invite and encourage the Garda to come among them and stay among them.  Whilst I commend the Minister's decision to allocate four additional personnel to Coolock and his predecessor's decision to allocate ten to 12 additional personnel is he aware that there is a sense of hopelessness and disillusionment in this area at the seeming inability of the Garda, notwithstanding their constant vigilance and commitment to duty, to deal with this situation very effectively?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am aware that many communities are seriously concerned about crime and vandalism in their communities.  I accept what the Deputy says, that the people in Donaghmede are also concerned.  Garda strengths have been increased in Coolock and Raheny from 31 December 1980 to 11 February 1983.  The Garda strength in Coolock has gone from 78 to 97 and in Raheny from 50 to 56.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not fully accept the Deputy's population figures. It is a fact that the greater part of Donaghmede is served by Coolock station, which is the district headquarters, and the remainder is served by Raheny station.  There is a problem in the greater Dublin area, which has been met by previous Ministers for Justice.  A total of 350 new recruits have been allocated to stations in the DMA since mid-August 1982.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As a matter of principle I am not prepared to discuss at Question Time in this House whether, in relation to any particular case, I am going to exercise my powers of remission and commutation when a person has been convicted of a criminal offence.  Because of the widespread and prolonged agitation in relation to this particular case, I am prepared to make some comments here about it but I do not intend thereby to set any precedent.</P>
      <P>Since I assumed office I have received representations from members of this House and from persons outside the House about this prisoner &mdash; some seeking the release of the prisoner, others seeking information on the matter.  Many of those who were in touch with me were themselves apparently approached by a committee, which has alleged that the prisoner was wrongfully convicted and was illtreated by the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the prisoner is serving twelve years' imprisonment having been sentenced <i>in absentia</i><Col N="301" /> for his part in what is known as the Sallins Train Robbery.</P>
    <P>Throughout the first trial of this case in the Special Criminal Court, which had to be abandoned due to the death of one of the judges and the second trial in the same court, allegations of improper conduct were made against members of the Garda who were involved in the investigation of the robbery and who gave evidence in the subsequent trial of the prisoner.</P>
    <P>It was alleged that the prisoner &mdash; and others who were subsequently acquitted by the Court of Criminal Appeal &mdash; was innocent of the offence and that he &mdash; and they &mdash; were illtreated by the Garda during questioning to such a degree that untrue admissions of involvement in the robbery were made.</P>
    <P>The prisoner absconded while on bail and did not return until after his codefendants had been released following a successful appeal by them to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  On his return to this country he was ordered by the Special Criminal Court to be committed to prison to serve his sentence.  Subsequently he appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal and then to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>In so far as any of those who made inquiries or registered protests in relation to the case may suppose that the appeal courts, including the Supreme Court, were not in possession of all the evidence available to the court of trial or that those courts would not have been empowered to upset the verdict if they considered that the evidence did not justify it, they can be assured that neither supposition is correct.</P>
    <P>On 29 October 1982, the Supreme Court gave judgment on the case and dismissed the appeal.  In the course of delivering his judgement, which was agreed by the four other members of the court, the Chief Justice said.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It can be said, therefore, that the Appellant although he absconded while on bail during his trial and although he remained, culpably, out of the country for 18 months following his conviction and sentence, has nevertheless been afforded on his return, every <Col N="302" /> possible opportunity of establishing that he should not have been convicted and to this end has had his appeal fully argued, heard and considered, not only by the Court of Criminal Appeal, but also by this Court.  It is seldom that the appellate jurisdiction of our Courts has been so fully exercised but it is proper that it should have been so in order to satisfy the requirements of justice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think it is important that I should make clear the position of the Minister for Justice. The Minister for Justice is not a court of appeal against court decisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister is empowered by the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, to commute or remit in whole or in part the punishments imposed by courts exercising criminal jurisdiction &mdash; save capital punishment, where remission is reserved to the President.  Exercise of that power in the case in question at this early stage in the serving of a long sentence could only be on the basis that the Minister rejected the findings of the courts, including the Supreme Court, as to the facts of the case or on the basis that evidence of facts not available to the court has materialised which would justify what would amount to a free pardon.  It would be improper for me to act on the former basis and I have no reason to act on the latter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned that a unique situation exists in this case whereby the two codefendants of Mr. Kelly were released by the courts during the time that Mr. Kelly was missing, having absconded while on bail, despite the fact that they had been charged on precisely the same evidence and in the exact same circumstances as Mr. Kelly was charged?  Does this fact alone not warrant an immediate review of the continued imprisonment of Mr. Kelly?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There has not come to my attention anything that would enable me to involve myself in this case.  It was taken through the Court of Criminal Appeal and to the Supreme Court.  As the Deputy says, the co-accused of the gentleman in question were released.  This was because the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the Special Criminal Court should have declared inadmissible their statements of admission.  The difference in their case was that in one instance proper notetaking procedure was not followed while in the other the location of the questioning which led to the statements being made &mdash; an underground passage linking the Bridewell and the Four Courts &mdash; was oppressive.  I have no information which would enable me to review the case as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

However, as there have been major housing developments in this area which are some distance from the station, a contract has been placed for a temporary additional station at Neilstown.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes, but that happens also in other areas in Dublin.  If the Deputy would use his good offices as a local representative and a Member of this House to provide alternative accommodation for the Department of Social Welfare it would relieve <Col N="307" /> pressure on the Garda barracks.  As I said, a temporary station is being provided at Neilstown, one-and-a-half miles from the present station at Clondalkin. A contract for the erection of the temporary station has been placed and work has commenced on the project.  The new temporary station will cost £170,000 and will include public offices for sergeants, detectives, juvenile liaison officers and Ban Gardaí, recreation rooms, doctors' room, kitchens and cells.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The answer to the first part of the question is &lsquo;no&rsquo;.  It would not be appropriate for the Garda to make a file available as suggested. The position is that a complaint was made which effectively suggested that a crime had, or might have, been committed.  This was investigated by the Garda and they found no evidence that a crime had been committed.  On the contrary, they were of opinion that what occurred was an error and that it happened in good faith.</P>

Can the Minister explain why the Garda did not find out if this letter was readdressed by a Member of the Oireachtas or a member of the general public?

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are two sub-districts in the area.  One of these has had a below average increase in crime, the other an above average increase.  A policy decision by the former Minister for Justice in May 1982 to redeploy strength from Border areas to the DMA resulted in eight members being transferred from the Louth-Meath Division. However, since then 21 recruits have been allocated to the division.  They have been assigned to the centres which, in the opinion of the divisional officer, were most in need of a greater Garda presence.  In continuation of that policy and in an awareness of the increased crime rate in one sub-division which concerns the Deputy, it is proposed to allocate three extra gardaí to Dundalk station on 25 February.</P>
      <P>On the question of further increasing the strength, this will be considered according as recruits who are at present in training become available.  The Minister is aware of the difficulties and recruits have been assigned.</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not appear to have been fully informed by prison officers, or whoever else may have been in communication with him in this matter.

The essential points are that I am anxious to honour the commitments given by my predecessor in relation to the same hours of association being introduced in Limerick Prison as apply in Portlaoise Prison, including the keeping of the cells unlocked during breakfast, and in relation to craft shop facilities and that I am endeavouring to get the staff to co-operate in this on the basis that the taxpayer will not be unduly imposed upon.</P>

The craft shop, for example, is now available and prison officers have said that they are prepared to allow it to be used by the prisoners.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The provision of craft shop facilities was one of the undertakings given by the then Minister on 7 September 1982.  A new craft shop has been built in Limerick and has been ready for use since 21 January last. Staff have declined to man the craft shop, <Col N="316" /> however, without extra posts being sanctioned. The governor of Limerick Prison is satisfied that adequate posts are sanctioned already for Limerick to allow for the manning of the craft shop and, indeed, manning of a study room which the staff also say that they will not man without additional posts.

I want to clarify the Minister's reply, because I would not like to be misled by the prison officers or it to be publicly stated that that was the case.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> My information is that there is already adequate staff to man the craft shop as presently deployed.  The question of overtime, as the Deputy is aware, is the key issue in the extension of recreation from 8 to 8.30 in so far as the prison officers are concerned, even though the Minister is quite willing to sanction payment of overtime from 8 to 8.30, they consider <Col N="317" /> this an inadequate inducement to work the hours.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The staff were asked on a number of occasions since the prisoners began seeking longer unlocked hours if they would be willing to leave cell doors open during breakfast time in advance of agreement being reached on longer hours of unlocking and compensation for same.  On each occasion staff replied that they were not.  At a meeting on 3 February 1983 they said they agreed that the existing manning levels were adequate to allow of cell doors being left open during breakfast time but the staff would not be prepared to continue the arrangement in the event of cuts in manning levels.  Therefore no decision has been taken at present to direct the staff to leave cell doors open during breakfast time.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The difficulty about the hours of unlock at breakfast time is that in the Estimates for prison officers' overtime published by the previous administration the allocation was £4.5 million.  In the Estimates in the budget that figure was increased by £2 million to £6.5 million but the outturn last year was over £7 million.  It will not be possible to keep within the increased allocation of £6.5 million this year without a reduction in manning levels in some of the prisons.  The prison officers in Limerick are looking for a guarantee that there will be no reduction in manning levels if they agree to unlock at breakfast time.  I would hope that matters could be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.  I feel in honour bound by the commitments given by my predecessors to the prisoners who were on hunger strike last September.  But the settlement cannot be made in a piecemeal fashion.  The various outstanding matters will have to be met in one package settlement rather than in piecemeal fashion.</P>

I had intended to raise the question, as I did yesterday.  I have under Standing Orders, under an accepted procedure, submitted a Private Notice Question to the Minister for Labour on this very serious matter of the jailing of 14 Ranks workers.  Again you have in your wisdom disallowed this question, a Cheann Comhairle.  I have studied Standing Orders and found nothing to justify your disallowing this question.  I would ask you to clarify your reasons for disallowing a question which has not been raised before.  A situation has not existed where 14 workers have been jailed following an industrial dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Much media comment on <Col N="356" /> the budget over the weekend seemed to concentrate on the performance of the Minister for Finance on television and in the House.  Terms such as &ldquo;professional&rdquo;, &ldquo;competent&rdquo;, &ldquo;cool&rdquo;, and &ldquo;even handed&rdquo; were used.  I hope this House is not concerned with the Minister's demeanour or performance on television. The House and the country are concerned whether what the Minister has done in the budget is suitable in our economic and social circumstances.</P>
      <P>I am not one to engage in adversarial politics and I said so in my maiden speech last March.  I criticised members of the Opposition coming in merely to criticise Government measures and Government backbenchers coming in to praise measures which they do not in their hearts support.  However, having examined the budget in as cool and rational a fashion as I can, I am driven to the conclusion that it is nothing short of a catastrophe.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and others of the ultimate effect this budget will have on the political fortunes of the Labour Party. On every occasion in Irish political history since 1922 that a Coalition Government have run the economy into the ground, one or other of the Coalition parties has suffered at the subsequent election.  In 1977 it was the Fine Gael Party which lost seats.  On this occasion, due to the massive reorganisation of Fine Gael, the Labour Party will be the losers.</P>
      <P>Mr. Joe Higgins of the administrative council of the Labour Party was quoted in one of the weekend newspapers as saying that the draconian penalisation of the PAYE workers and working people in general makes it imperative that Labour break from this Coalition rather than be seen to support such measures. There is the authentic voice of the Labour movement, a movement which is becoming increasingly isolated and remote from the Parliamentary Labour Party.</P>

      <P>I did not come into this <Col N="357" /> House to interrupt Deputy Kelly and I ask him to have the manners not to interrupt me.</P>
      <P>The following is the quotation:</P>
      <P>The Labour Party have been outplayed comprehensively at the budgetary game.  Now he [the leader of the Labour Party] and his party are landed with a Fine Gael Budget which they are forced to support.  Labour will spend a long time recovering from the effects on its popularity.</P>
      <P>I am not going to engage in theatrical gestures asking the Parliamentary Labour Party to support us in the lobbies because I know they will not.  Their minds are made up but it is no harm to point out to them the electoral consequences of what they are doing.</P>
      <P>I find it impossible to ascertain precisely what the Minister is trying to achieve in the budget.  It could be described as a budget of lost opportunities. It does not tackle unemployment or purport to deal with inflation.  It has attempted to further deflate an economy which is already flattened.  The Minister for Finance told us that last year's deficit was £988 million and that the opening deficit for this year was £956 million with a closing deficit of £897 million.  That means a reduction in the deficit of £59 million, a small saving when one considers the almost unbelievable amount of punishment that is being visited on the Irish taxpayer.  I should like to remind the Minister for Finance that the reduction of budget deficits is not and cannot be an end in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The twin economic evils which have beset this country are inflation and unemployment. I cannot find anything in the budget that purports to tackle the problem of inflation.  In fact, there is much in it that will exacerbate and increase that problem.  The CPI will be increased directly by the increase in VAT and indirect taxation generally.  The increased rates of tax on wages will give rise to higher wage demands which will, inevitably, give a further twist to the inflationary spiral.  In addition, the present unemployment situation will be further aggravated and the Minister has <Col N="358" /> admitted that.  The increase in inflation which will result will lead to a decline in competitiveness and that will make it more difficult for Irish manufacturers and producers to sell their goods at home and abroad.  That will lead to an increase in unemployment.  The increases in VAT will have their own effects on various industries such as the hotel and catering industry and tourism in general.  The general increase in tax levels means that consumers will have less money for discretionary expenditure.  Consequently, demand for goods and services of all sorts by consumers will drop.</P>
    <P>The increase in unemployment to which this will give rise will mean that there will be less money available to the Government for expenditure on employment creation projects.  The stated objective of the Minister for Finance to reduce the budget deficit will be achieved only in the short term because the increase in unemployment that will result from his economic proposals will ensure that the draw on the public finances will be aggravated in 12 months' time.  Indeed I can foresee unemployment rising to a level where the stability of society will be seriously threatened.  In my opinion the Minister should have looked closer at the question of public spending and tax incentives.  The problem with regard to Irish Governments in the last ten years is not that they under-taxed the community but that they have over-spent.  In the budget the Minister has relied too much on increasing taxes and too little on reducing or controlling expenditure.</P>
    <P>I should like to give two examples of Government expenditure that have not in the last 20 years been properly controlled or monitored.  In the 1983 public capital programme the Minister missed the point because the return expected from the expenditure incurred will be derisory.  The Minister reduced the IDA building programme by £2 million out of a budget of £45 million but at the end of 1982 the IDA held two million square feet of advance factories and planned to add 800,000 square feet more to that.  It is difficult to see why the entire programme was not cancelled or at least delayed until the backlog was eliminated. <Col N="359" /> The 4 per cent reduction is only a small gesture.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why the Minister is standing over the proposal to spend an estimated £129 million on extra electricity generating capacity when the present electricity generating capacity is 62 per cent over the peak demand.  It is also difficult to understand why the Minister, and former Ministers for Finance, continue to pulversise the Irish taxpayer to feed white elephants.  Indeed, not one single white elephant lost one minute's sleep over the budget.  The public capital programme has been responsible for the bulk of the borrowings which now take up the entire yield from income tax.  In neglecting to seriously examine this and the Government guaranteed borrowings for white elephants, the Minister has had no option but to further punish the people who contribute to the Exchequer by way of taxation.  I look forward to the day when we have a Minister for Finance, irrespective of the party he represents, who will honestly and constructively look at the inefficiency in the public capital programme and the guaranteed borrowings of State companies.</P>
    <P>We have the highest investment in the public capital programme of any OECD country and the worst investment performance. Inevitably, that leads to savage budgets with taxpayers being robbed to sustain white elephants.  Another area of Government spending to which I should like to advert is the health service. It is a cruel paradox that we spend more of our Gross National Product on health services and provide less comprehensive care and coverage than other countries that spend less.  That paradox will have to be examined seriously and quickly in view of our economic situation.  There is ample evidence to show a misplaced emphasis on hospital and community care.  In the last two weeks a senior executive officer of the largest health board in the country said there was little accountability for the large sums spent on voluntary hospitals.  There seems to be insufficient information available for <Col N="360" /> us to engage in a rational analysis of the wastage that is occurring in this area.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to many people about that matter and I have come to the conclusion that as far as the voluntary hospitals are concerned there are too many hospital beds that are over-used or inefficiently used.  There is enormous wastage at every level of our health service which our present monitoring systems have either failed to reveal or revealed inadequately.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health spoke on the budget in the House this morning.  I listened carefully to his contribution.  I want to tell him that the expenditure on the health services for which his Department are responsible is very bad value for money.  The Minister for Finance has taken a great deal of money out of the economy.  I contend that he should have done so by looking at Government expenditure.  He decided to do it by increasing taxation.  Regardless of how he did it, he has failed to encourage anybody to put any money back into the economy.</P>
    <P>Various interested bodies such as the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Construction Industry Federation made recommendations to the Minister for changes in the tax laws to give people incentives to invest in the economy and to replace the money the Minister was taking out of it.  Not one of those appears in the Budget Statement.  If the Government have not got the imagination to formulate incentives for people to invest in our economy they should have the good grace to accept suggestions other people made to them.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the budget to which I want to refer briefly, that is, the family income supplement.  The Minister stated on a number of occasions that the main reason for the introduction of a family income supplement was to overcome the problem where people on low incomes have to pay tax and PRSI and end up almost as badly off or worse off than people on welfare of all sorts.  To encourage people to go out to work rather than stay at home and draw welfare, the Minister announced that he is introducing a family income supplement <Col N="361" /> estimated to cost £5 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>The previous Fine Gael Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, intended to tax short term social welfare benefits to increase the gap between people working in low paid employment and people on welfare.  The present Minister baulked at that and decided to reduce the benefits rather than taxing them.  This is directly contrary to the proposals made by the Commission on Income Taxation that all income from whatever source should be taxable.  I want to make a suggestion to the Minister which would tackle the problem without the necessity to introduce a family income supplement.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Limerick city we have a large number of corporation houses which are extremely badly maintained. We have problems with parks, roadways and footpaths and the Corporation tell us they cannot do this work because they have not got the workmen. Why not ask able-bodied people who are on welfare to contribute a few days a week to the community in some type of public works programme, or at least to assist the local authorities in doing what they are there to do, such as repairing corporation houses, cutting grass, keeping the roads clean, and so on.  This would restore their dignity to people who do not wish to be unemployed.  It would discourage people who prefer to stay at home and draw social welfare benefits rather than work.  It would also have a therapeutic effect.  It is said that when people have been idle for a certain length of time they lose the will and the inclination to work.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to various individual measures in the budget.  On the income tax front there has been no widening of the tax bands.  Tax rates remain the same apart from the additional top rate of 65 per cent.  Tax free allowances have not been increased.  The Minister said the Government intended next year to substitute a system of tax credits along the lines proposed by the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, and to replace the present system of personal allowances.  The introduction of tax credits involves a fundamental change in concept.  Instead of <Col N="362" /> the taxpayer being seen to be entitled to a certain amount of money tax free, the Government will decide what he should get back by way of tax credits.  They will take the money and give it back to him by way of tax credits.  There is a danger that if tax rates and the present structure of tax bands remains the same over the next one or two years, the average taxpayer will be handing over 65 per cent or 75 per cent or 80 per cent &mdash; at one point in the United Kingdom the top rate went as far as 98 per cent &mdash; or anything up to 100 per cent of his income to the Government and getting back whatever they choose to give him by way of tax credits.</P>
    <P>Various proposals for tax reforms were suggested in the very comprehensive report of the Commission on Income Taxation.  When Deputy Bruton was Minister for Finance he intended to implement some of them in the budget which was defeated in the House.  One which springs to mind immediately was the proposal to tax the self-employed and PAYE taxpayers in the same financial year &mdash; in other words, to replace the preceding year basis of taxation for the self-employed.  There were a number of others mainly in relation to interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dukes, told us it was impossible for him to introduce those measures this year because they need greater study.  When Deputy Bruton was Minister 15 months ago he intended to introduce them.  If they did not require greater study 15 months ago, why do they need greater study today?  Is the Minister suggesting that his predecessor, Deputy Bruton, was introducing those measures without proper consideration?</P>
    <P>There is no attempt in the budget to spread the burden of taxation more widely.  There is hardly a word in the Minister's long statement about capital taxation.  Consequently this Government deserve no marks for making Ireland a fairer place in which to live.  The effect of escalating tax rates, particularly on those on the middle income groups, has been to bring about a general change in work attitudes and work practices in the past few years.  Everybody seems to agree that the middle income groups should bear <Col N="363" /> the greatest proportion of the burden of increased taxation.  It is my contention that the point of diminishing returns has now been passed.  It must be borne in mind that all countries are heavily dependent on the middle section of the work force with regard to the whole question of wealth creation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also proposes to bring all farmers into the tax net.  Broadly speaking, this is in line with the proposals of the Commission on Income Taxation.  I agree with the proposals but we must try to avoid a situation where a farmer is not liable for income tax but has to pay an accountant an exorbitant sum of money to prove this to the Revenue Commissioners. I recall when the rateable valuation for tax purposes for farmers was brought down from £50 to £40 the then Minister announced a simplified accounts system for small farmers between £40 and £50 rateable valuation.  In several cases the Revenue Commissioners refused to accept those simplified accounts forms which had been completed by the farmers to avoid the cost of going to an accountant. They demanded items such as balance sheets, opening capital statements, etc., which could only be produced by an accountant.  The Minister has announced that he is studying the question of introducing simplified accounts forms for what he described as smaller farmers, although he did not define who these are.  I hope he will define who they are and that the Revenue Commissioners will accept accounts forms which are going to be prepared for distribution to those farmers.</P>
    <P>The major effect in terms of revenue yield from this change will be from part-time farmers who are also working in the PAYE sector and whose rateable valuation is below £20.  Any farmer whose rateable valuation is in excess of that sum is contributing to the Exchequer because his personal allowances are reduced.  The effect on people in the PAYE sector who also have small farms below £20 rateable valuation means they will be paying income tax at the top rate on their farming income without the benefit of any <Col N="364" /> personal allowances.  The Government should ensure that part-time farming is not made so unattractive because of this that a fundamental change in community structures in rural areas will occur.</P>
    <P>The mortgage relief in the case of married people has been reduced from £4,800 to £4,000 per annum and in the case of a single person it is reduced from £2,400 to £2,000 per annum.  Has any account been taken of the effect this will have on the building industry, coupled with other budgetary measures such as the increase in VAT?</P>
    <P>The Minister also announced his intention to increase the levy at present paid by banks.  It is not a tax on income, it is a levy on bank profits.  It was the previous Government who introduced this bank levy initially.  I did not agree with it and I said so privately and publicly in this House last March.  To increase the bank levy is only going to increase the problem to which I adverted on that occasion. Because of the need to maintain a liquidity ratio between what the banks retain and what they are allowed to lend to the community, the amount of money available for lending to industry is going to be reduced by a huge amount.  I do not have the figures but the reduction is very substantial. This will further exacerbate the employment situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also announced his intention to introduce a property tax. This is the Labour Party's only discernible input into the budget and it is strange that it remains so vague and ill-defined. There are other forms of wealth, apart from house property, which are not singled out for capital taxation or for the imposition of a levy of 1½ per cent every year.  It is difficult to see why house property is the one form of wealth to be singled out.  It is possible that the proposal to impose this tax, when it appears in the Finance Bill, may be unconstitutional. Various questions have been raised about it but none of them has been answered yet to anybody's satisfaction.  However, I will reserve my position until it appears in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>One other aspect of the property tax which has not been adverted to is the need that will be imposed on taxpayers <Col N="365" /> to get a professional evaluation of their property because the tax will depend on the value of the property and, in many cases, whether tax is to be paid will depend on the value of the property.  The association of valuers estimate that an average professional valuation will cost anything from £120 to £130 plus 23 per cent VAT.  This is a situation where the burden on the taxpayer, like the small farmer who will be brought into the tax net for the first time, is going to be increased without any yield to the Exchequer.  This cost of professional valuation is a parasitic cost on the taxpayer. It will not yield any revenue to the Exchequer, it is something a householder will be forced to do because of the property tax.  The Minister made no reference to indexation for inflation when introducing the property tax.  Therefore, in a very short time, if inflation rates continue as they are, the average house will be subject to a property tax.  This is tantamount to the re-introduction of rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also announced proposals to introduce advance corporation tax.  The Cement Roadstone Company will be very severely hit by this when they pay their next dividends.  Due to the availability of tax relief, some companies do not pay enough corporation tax to cover tax credits.  As I understand it, that is why advance corporation tax is being introduced.  Apparently, although the Minister does not spell it out clearly, advance corporation tax will be equal to the tax credits attaching to the distributions made by a company in an accounting period, less the amount of the tax credits attaching to any distribution received by the company during that accounting period.  All commentators agree that the overall effect of advance corporation tax will be further to reduce corporate liquidity.  It is not the company which is in a break-even situation or the company which makes a loss which is going to be penalised, it is the company which makes a profit.  The person who is going to be most severely penalised is the shareholder who invested money in the company that makes a profit, a positive disincentive to investment at a time when the Minister is taking substantial sums of <Col N="366" /> money out of the economy.</P>
    <P>The budget only purports to tackle one of the country's economic difficulties, the high State borrowing requirement, whilst it ignores all the others.  I accept it was necessary to achieve a better balance in the State finances but there is no doubt that it could have been achieved in other ways which would have had a lesser impact on employment, output and inflation. It could have been done in a more sensitive and imaginative manner which would not have damaged the economy to the extent that this budget is inevitably going to do.  The budget is too harsh in all the wrong areas.  Any beneficial effect on the State's finances will be more than outweighed by the effect on the country's overall economic performance and on personal and corporate confidence.  This budget was deliberately and unashamedly constructed to balance the country's books.  There was no attempt, or even an indication of an attempt, to reverse the downward spiral of the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with care to most of Deputy O'Dea's speech and I want to make one or two points arising from what he said before he sat down.  He said in a tone, temperate enough in terms of decibels but certainly in a scolding tone as will be evident when the speech is printed in the Official Report, that the budget was &ldquo;deliberately and unashamedly constructed to balance the country's books&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely we have arrived at a curious stage in national affairs when it appears to be a matter of shame for a Government to balance the books?  I am not saying anything very much out of the way &mdash; perhaps it is something that the Deputy in his heart would agree with me about &mdash; when I say that the reason we are in such difficulties this year, as we were last year and as we will be next year, is because all attempt to balance the country's books was abandoned, thrown to the winds, during the past ten years.  I do not want to engage in adversarial politics any more than the Deputy did, but I must say that I believe a genuine attempt was made in Liam Cosgrave's time, when Richie Ryan was Minister for Finance, to <Col N="367" /> apply the brakes in difficult circumstances. Deputy Bruton made an attempt; and I think in the dying days of the last Fianna Fáil administration an attempt was also made.  However, the tendency generally in the past ten or 11 years was not to bother about the books, to show &ldquo;compassion&rdquo;&mdash; what Deputy Haughey is so strong on &mdash; to show a warm heart and to give the soft answer.</P>
    <P>That short-term softness is fine for cheap, instant, easily-bought popularity, a quick by-election in one's pocket, but it is bought at the expense of the coming years and future generations.  What is wrong with this country &mdash; I believe that in his heart Deputy O'Dea will agree with me &mdash; is not only that as individuals we want our neighbours to pay for us, but that as a nation we want our posterity to pay for us.  As a nation we do not want to pay for ourselves year by year.  We want the next decade or even possibly the next century to be stuck with the bill.  We refuse to pay for the services we take for granted.  We refuse to meet the real cost of the things we demand in health, education, infrastructure and services of all kinds.  We borrow; and what that really means is that we are expecting the next generation to pay.  We will not feed the monster we have created, so we are allowing it to eat up the hopes and prospects of our children and grandchildren. I call that wicked.</P>
    <P>There may be some excuse for a small budget deficit, even on current account, provided it is a once-off operation for which there is some visible reason.  The first of the current budget deficits in 1972 was small and venial, and perhaps the same was true in 1973 but most certainly it was not true after the first shock of the oil crisis had subsided and 1977 had arrived.  What happened thereafter was that, instead of reining in expenditure at a time when the economy was growing at two or three times the average European rate, Professor O'Donoghue, in the course of his lifelong career to do down Deputy Haughey &mdash; both of them now well beyond the reach of ordinary reason and proportion in their approach to political life &mdash; advised Fianna Fáil &mdash; and his <Col N="368" /> advice was eagerly gobbled up &mdash; that the &ldquo;imaginative&rdquo;, &ldquo;compassionate&rdquo; and electorally sucessful way to manage the economy was to spend; to borrow; and to spend and borrow again.  This was at a time when every economic commentator &mdash; little though they might be disposed to agree with one another or even to like one another &mdash; was unanimous that this was the reverse of what was required.</P>
    <P>The books remained unbalanced and they got worse.  Deputy Haughey's campaign and conspiracy to dig a trench for Deputy Lynch, to push him into it and to cover over the trench finally succeeded in 1979.  He made his &ldquo;state of the nation&rdquo; appeal on television in 1980 and spoke about the need to moderate expenditure, but he did the opposite.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to direct those remarks, which I know I am uttering in a scolding manner, to Deputy O'Dea personally, for whom, like most people on this side, I have a regard.  I know he speaks his mind and does not look over his shoulder when he is speaking.  Therefore, I tend to believe him and I listen seriously to him even when he says things that are critical of my side.  I am sure he will agree that the very thing he apparently was castigating in his final sentence, namely, what he called the &ldquo;deliberate and unashamed attempt to balance the books&rdquo;, is what might have saved the economy from the present rigours had it been indulged in by the Fianna Fáil Government.  While I could not fault much of what he said, he was on a wrong and perverse angle when he advanced that final point.</P>
    <P>I must observe also &mdash; I do not mean this in respect of Deputy O'Dea particularly but in respect of the contributions so far from the other side &mdash; that there is a dreadful degree of confusion.  The Deputies on the other side do not seem to know exactly what they want between one side of their party and another, between one end of a speech and another, between one election and another.  Deputy O'Dea said he deplored the absence of any serious reference to capital taxation in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance apart from the residential property tax.  Incidentally, in regard to this I largely share his reservations <Col N="369" /> but I will come back to that.  He deplored in general the absence of a reference to capital taxation.  I tried to take down what he said, and he seemed to say that this absence of a reference to capital taxation means no move towards making Ireland a place in which one would want to live.</P>

      <P>I will not disagree very much with the Deputy about that.  I have always supported the idea of a wealth tax, even at a time when nobody else in my party was willing to do so.  Everyone was still smarting after the electoral rebuff in 1977 when that proposal cost us at least six seats.  However, I will point out to Deputy O'Dea that that is not the view of the rest of his party, or certainly it was not their view in 1975, 1976 and 1977. Their view was that an economy in the condition of adolescence such as ours needed the injection of wealth.  It needed wealth in every shape and form even if some of it was conspicuously displayed in a socially provocative manner.  It needed wealth, and the more the better.  That was the view of Deputy Colley, at least if he meant what he said, and it was the view of Deputy Vivion de Valera and of Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick who were the three Fianna Fáil Deputies who sustained the greater part of the debates on wealth tax.  It was also the view of Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Haughey, Deputy Lynch and all the rest of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that a consensus may emerge in this country that would certainly stop far short of any socialist ideology&mdash;on the lines that people must apologise for having done well in life, that there is something to be ashamed of in having made a bit of money&mdash;but would equally recognise that people to whom God has given enough of what it takes to get that distance owe something, even if only a small sliver of their substance, in social justice towards people to whom God has not given what it takes to make a bit of money.  That seems to be an unarguable proposition, but Deputy O'Dea is the first person from that side whom I have heard saying something which appeared <Col N="370" /> to suggest that he shares it and believes in it.  Certainly it is not, when we are able to observe it, the view of his party as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey spoke as soon as the Minister for Finance had finished last Wednesday.  I make every allowance for the fact that a Deputy following a Budget Statement which he has not had a chance to think about is somewhat at a disadvantage. On the other hand, I can see quite clearly from Deputy Haughey's speech &mdash;I suppose I would do the same myself&mdash;that he had prepared a good deal of it in advance and was going to say it no matter what the budget contained. However, I cannot help observing that for a man who is given a certain amount of credit for being a financial wizard&mdash;a wizard who does strange things with his box of tricks&mdash;confusion runs right through his speech.  For example, he deplores the fact that the Minister's Budget Statement envisaged a deficit which was almost £150 million more than the £750 million which Fianna Fáil had proposed.  Almost in the same breath he deplores that no provision is made for public service pay.  If the Minister was going to make provision for public service pay&mdash;which he did not, it is true&mdash;over and above his £897 million deficit he certainly would have been further away from the £750 million to which the Fianna Fáil Party in their last document were committed, but what then would have had to be done to bridge the gap?  It could have been bridged by borrowing; but Deputy Haughey in the course of his speech, had some very hard words to say about borrowing. That will come as a surprise, but Deputy Haughey seems to have decided that borrowing is a bad thing and must be cut back, pruned.</P>
    <P>How then could that gap have been bridged?  Would it not have been that much harder to bridge, had provision been made for an increase in public service pay?  &ldquo;Heavy extra impositions on working families&rdquo; are also deplored by the Leader of Deputy O'Dea's party. How can he deplore heavy impositions in one breath, and in the next breath repeatedly deplore that the budget deficit is being phased out more slowly than his <Col N="371" /> party had proposed?  That does not make sense, unless he has proposals of a concrete kind for very ruthless cuts in public expenditure.  I do not know where these cuts in public expenditure can be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea made some effort to point to areas where in a general way it is possible to say that we are not getting value for money and he instanced the health services.  Perhaps he and most Deputies in this House know more about the way the health services function than I do, and I am willing to assume that he is right in what he says about not getting value for the immense investment of public funds.  It is all very well to say that, but it is quite a different thing, as he will discover when he finds himself sitting at a Government table, to decide where exactly and how exactly they are going to make a cut.  He mentioned a fairly heavy item of investment for extra electricity capacity.  I agree that the ESB appear to have at the moment virtually excess capacity, but I take it for granted that that allocation for electricity capacity is related to long-term commitments which have already been entered into, one of them in relation to a plant not very far from his constituency.  It is not reasonable, in a case of a really major undertaking such as that, for all work to stop and the flow of money to cease, because that in the end would cost more.  Whether it was advisable in the first place to commit oneself to such expansion is quite a separate matter and that could be asked about a number of things.  In the case of the coal-burning ESB capacity I think it is advisable.  At any rate, it is one thing to talk about phasing out the budget deficit even when, as Deputy Haughey unquestionably is, one is disqualified by one's own past performance from being too up-stage about other people's failures in that regard.  It is one thing to talk about it and quite another thing to do it.</P>
    <P>During the time of the last National Coalition Government I remember two or three separate gruelling periods when we sat around the table for days on end trying to prune Estimates.  I used to become exasperated, impatient and depressed at the sight of Ministers agonising <Col N="372" /> for maybe 20 minutes over saving £50,000 here and £100,000 there, peanuts in national terms, when really the growth of the public service and that alone was the enormous tree or plant or growth, so to speak, which was depriving everything else of light and air.  In other words, we&mdash;and every Government when they make cuts&mdash;were obliged to do small, teasing, annoying things which were painful to those on the receiving end, but no Government seem able to lay the axe to the root of what really is choking us, namely, the apparently unstoppable growth in the public sector.  I missed any reference to that in Deputy O'Dea's speech.  Maybe other members of his party whom I did not hear have said something about it.  It requires not just mention but a sustained public uproar. An isolated outcry is not enough.  We will have to have a sustained public uproar about the size of the public sector, and we will never get our finances right until that happens.</P>
    <P>I know that people who have vested interests in the industrial relations side of the public sector will be saying that I have added myself to the ranks of the people described by Mr. John Carroll the other day as carrying out a sustained onslaught on those he represented.  No one is carrying out an onslaught on any individual or collection of individuals.  I am not pointing, and could not point, any finger at any individual or collection of individuals. All I am saying is that looked at globally the phenomenon of public sector growth here is something that we cannot shut our eyes to.  We are foostering around pulling weeds here and there at the foot of this tree which is choking the life out of everything all round it.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example which I gave last night at a meeting of a professional association.  In January 1973, the year I entered the Dáil, there were a little over 40,000 people in the civil service strictly so called, the non-industrial civil service. In January of this year there were 60,500. The State has been here for 60 years; and in ten years the public service has put on 50 per cent in weight.  Where is the justification for that?  There have been parallel developments, not necessarily in the <Col N="373" /> same percentages, in the health boards, local government and so forth.  Where is the justification for an extra 20,000 strictly-so-called civil servants over the last ten years?  This is not the age of the quill pen and the Dickensian high stool and desk.  This is the age of the electronic revolution which is going to make it possible for banks, insurance companies and every other form of service to shed employment on all sides.  I am not advocating shedding employment out of coldness of heart.  On the contrary, it is the false warmth, the cheap compassion, the reach-me-down heart-on-the-sleeve of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench which says that &ldquo;Musha, we should throw out another few £ million here and there to give a few jobs to these and those.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what is depriving the children still to come, the unborn that we are supposed to be concerned about, of any hope of a job.  We are going to leave them with a millstone around their necks when they are born.  They have a right to be born certainly, but they have a right also to be born with a better legacy and inheritance than the debts which we have built up because we have refused to pay our way.  That is what is facing them, and the false soft-heartedness of the kind of people whose attitude is, &ldquo;Musha, throw out another few £ million&rdquo; is at the bottom of that.  A large part of it is focused in the absolutely uncontrolled growth of the public sector, &ldquo;Jobs, at any price.&rdquo; It is not simply a question of paying public sector salaries.  Every extra section and every enlarged section of civil servants have to be housed.  As a rule they are very well housed, although not all of them are.  The offices have to be heated and lighting has to be provided.  Provision has to be made for insurance and for expenses of all kinds.  It is not simply a question of salaries.  You could probably nearly double the salary increase implied by the extra 20,000 civil servants in order to get the real increase which their presence represents for the State.  We are only wasting our time here talking about expenditure cuts, pruning this and that until this problem is tackled.  The thing which needs to be gradually pruned is the public service.  We are only doing damage <Col N="374" /> by plucking harmless weeds here and there when what is really choking us is something a great deal more formidable.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be really a thing on which the public service owes the country an answer as a body.  How is it that, in the age of the computer, the word processor and the electronic labour-saving device, the poor old State is the only organisation that gets nothing from it? How is it that the poor old State is not able to save anything, but on the contrary has to take on more people?  It goes without saying it has not economised on the buying of hardware.  It has got all the hardware, the word processors are in position, the computers are humming away; but the recruitment of people is going on all the time.</P>
    <P>This is a decade in which we had two embargoes on recruitment.  There is one still in operation.  An embargo sounds fine to the bookkeepers, though it causes a great deal of annoyance at constituency level and at political level.  An embargo on public recruitment sounds fine; but when the smoke has cleared away after three years, there are more people in the civil service, not fewer.</P>
    <P>I know the expansion of the State's functions over the years must bring with it the necessity for an enlarged personnel. I appreciate that, though I believe it ought to have been more than offset by the so-called electronic revolution.  I want to know why that has not happened and why there is not the political will to make it happen.  Because, we have not got the political will, children are being made to suffer with school cutbacks, and we have health cutbacks which will affect all kinds of people in all kinds of ways.  I do not need to lecture the House about this.  The small niggling, teasing economies which are being made on all sides are happening and are constricting the economy in one way or another.  Taxation burdens are being placed even on productive sectors, not to speak about the extra burdens on personal income tax.  These things are all happening because nobody on either side of the House has summoned up the political will to take the public sector in hand and stop its growth.</P>
    <P>I do not advocate what I hear some <Col N="375" /> people advocating, that the public service should &ldquo;get a taste of redundancy&rdquo; the same as the private sector, that there should be no such thing in the country as sheltered employment.  None of those people is in any sense individually at fault for what has happened.  Nobody is faulting any member of the public service for being part of this apparatus.  I hope I make it clear that there is no trace, so far as I am concerned, of hostility or animus. There is nothing of that kind in it at all.</P>
    <P>But we must form a political will, and, I hope, a political consensus between all sides of the House, that this growth has got to be checked.  I hope it can be checked gradually by persisting in an embargo and simply demanding more productivity and making sure we get it. It is easy to say that, and I am not so sure I could deliver it; but I would be aiming at it.  It seems to be a pathetic thing that although we are supposed to be the Government of the country, speaking generally &mdash; this House is supposedly the major component of the sovereign body of the country &mdash; we are not able to make any impression on this problem.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Lynch was returned here as Taoiseach in 1977 I listened to him and his acceptance speech was on this subject only.  He spoke about almost nothing else apart from the usual inauguratory courtesies, thanking Deputy Cosgrave for handling the administration over, for not having wrecked it and all the rest of it.  Apart from that his speech referred to public sector reform, and he spoke two or three times in the course of that short speech about the necessity to form the political will to bring that reform to pass.  Mr. Lynch has now left the House, and I believe he has left with a lot of goodwill from all sides.  We all wish him well; but he was not able to do it.  He did not mobilise the political will.  I do not think Deputy Haughey had the wish to mobilise such a political will.  I have no doubt that the side I belong to subscribed to the notion of forming that political will; but they do not seem to be able to do it either.  I suspect the reason is the old one, that anything which is to be painful and politically difficult would <Col N="376" /> expose Fine Gael to artillery fire from Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil to artillery fire from our benches.  I believe that is the reason it does not get done.  That is a scenario which leaves the people nowhere, as they always remain nowhere when Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil decide that the biggest thing in the country is the issues between them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the components of the budget, I heard Deputy O'Dea say that he thought the only discernible input which could be clearly imputed to the Labour Party was a residential property tax.  I am on these backbenches for a mixture of fairly simple reasons.  The main one was that I was apprehensive about the way the country would go if the Fine Gael Party fell into a pre-disposition to think of its future in terms of permanent Coalition with the Labour Party. That is a mistake for this party, and I did not wish to be associated with forms of political tactics which appear to reflect that disposition.  My larger reason was because I think the way politics here is structured, particularly the artificially kept-up conflict between the two sides of a movement which once was one, does an incalculable amount of harm.  I was afraid, because of the first of these reasons, that when I saw the budget of the Minister for Finance, it would display a good deal of Labour thinking.  I must frankly confess that apprehension has not been realised.</P>
    <P>I want to say this in respect of you personally, in courtesy, and I hope in friendship, that what I am saying is not in any way intended in disparagement of the Labour Party or its policy.  On the contrary, I have a lot of respect for that party and its policies.  I would not lose any sleep if history had left me a member of that party.  I believe, because it is a party with its traditions and the necessary directions of its political involvements and the kind of political interests which it must support and stand up for, its input into Government in times like these is likely not to be helpful.  That is in no sense intended to be disparaging, as I know you will believe, towards colleagues I respect, value and admire.  I feel that the general thrust of a party who <Col N="377" /> think in socialist terms is likely, in the conditions of 1983, not to be helpful. There have been times in the past when it would have been extremely helpful.  In the days of Taca and the mohair suits in the middle sixties a Labour element was absolutely vital in this country.  The evolution of Opposition politics towards the left was a national necessity.  It is a national tragedy that that was just the moment the Labour Party chose to turn their back on Coalition, so that we lost the 1969 election and left the State with another four years of Fianna Fáil Government, including the crisis of 1970. This is a historic tragedy which cannot be reversed, and is water under the bridge.</P>
    <P>I mention this only to say that I accept that there are times in people's history when a left-inclining Government is exactly what is needed.  It was needed in the middle sixties and perhaps the early seventies.  I believe that the Cosgrave-Corish Coalition worked very well, but I have misgivings about how valuable a socialist input is likely to be in the conditions of 1983 when what we need is prudence, retrenchment and old-fashioned housekeeping.  These are three phrases that do not trip easily over Labour lips.  That is not to their discredit. It is merely the way their ideology is constructed.  There will be other times when what I am advocating may be the last thing that the country needs.  I accept that, too, but that was one of the reasons for my resigning from the Front Bench.</P>
    <P>I was apprehensive about what this budget would contain, but I must admit that it has not measured up to that apprehension. I do not find in it a great deal of Labour ideology, with the exception that Deputy O'Dea mentioned, and which was visible on the Sunday before the Government was formed, when the deal between the party leaders was revealed to us and to the Labour Conference.  At the same time, what I say is contradicted by several of the economic commentators whom I observe writing in the papers in terms such as that the virtually total absence of any serious inroads into public expenditure reflects the Labour domination of the Government.  Two or three commentators are of the view that the <Col N="378" /> reason for the Government not going further in terms of expenditure cuts is that Labour would not agree.  I have told the House where I think the real target for expenditure cuts must be.  The only target that makes sense is a progressive reduction in the size of the public service. The Labour Party are being blamed wrongly for having been behind the relatively modest cuts in expenditure which the budget discloses.  What expenditure cuts could even Fine Gael, let alone Labour, stand over in addition to those announced already, leaving aside the question of the public service?  We have promised cuts in education.  As Members of this House we receive letters every day, both in Irish and in English, protesting about these cuts.  They have caused a storm of protest.  I think I have received more letters in this regard than I have received about the proposal to amend the Constitution.  Do these commentators think that the cuts in education should have been more severe?  Do they think we did not go far enough in making cuts in the health services?  Where are the cuts which even Fine Gael could stomach, let alone promote, but which they were prevented from putting into effect by Labour?  I cannot think of any.</P>
    <P>There was no Deputy in Fine Gael who was more apprehensive and more sensitive to the likelihood of Labour influence in this budget than I was, but I do not see it in that degree.  I cannot see that the relative modesty of the cuts, severe though the complaints are, can be attributed merely to Labour recalcitrance. Even if we had a Government made up totally of Fine Gael members, with enough Fine Gael Deputies to float by ourselves, it would not have been politically possible to have introduced more severe cuts.</P>
    <P>We have voters, too.  At election time we must go around scrounging votes, knocking on the doors of people of all classes.  There is such a concept as a political impossibility for us, too.  We do not all get votes from large farmers and the gombeen men who I know are part of the Fianna Fáil mythology.  I am not even sure what a gombeen man is but I have a vague idea.  I have a mental picture of <Col N="379" /> one wearing a gold watch chain across his waistcoat, but I do not know of any of these people in my constituency.  Neither are there any large farmers in the constituency. The three seats we hold there are the result of support from people of all conditions.  Therefore, in defence of the Government and of my party generally, though it runs contrary to what I expected, I do not find in the budget any excessive evidence of the Labour Party having imposed an ideology on us in the shape of a prohibition on expenditure cuts.</P>
    <P>There is one exception, though this is something to which I object and to which I voiced my objection before the Government was formed; I refer to the question of the residential property tax about which Deputy O'Dea spoke very justly. This may easily be an unworkable tax. The fact that the Minister spoke about it in such general terms on budget day, in terms as general as those in which it was promised in our <i>Programme for Government</i> two months ago, is a sign that the Department of Finance have encountered difficulties in putting the tax into workable shape.  I have no inside information on that, but I suspect that the Minister is no further forward now in this respect than he was two months ago. Even if the tax is workable, it is unfair to single out this form of wealth and leave untouched all the other forms.  I say that as someone who fought as Government Whip for a wealth tax, and who continued to support it after the rest of my party had abandoned it.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to people of substance being asked to shed a little of that substance, not enough to injure them, to seriously harm their business or even perhaps their private existence, but to shed something of that substance year by year as a gesture, if nothing more, to those people who never will have any substance and whose children or grandchildren are not likely to have any wealth either.  That is the least that social justice requires.  I am not making a song and dance about the excessive burden that this residential property tax will represent.  I live in a good house and I have calculated that <Col N="380" /> this new tax will cost me between £500 and £600 per year; but that is probably less than I would be paying in domestic rates if they were still being charged, because at the time they were abolished, I was paying about £300.  In other words, I was given a present by the then incoming Fianna Fáil Government of £300 which I neither needed nor wanted, and all in the interest of trying to buy my vote.  That was a ludicrous operation so far as I was concerned.  The rates had been increasing year by year in fairly steep proportions and in the past six years the rates for the house in which I live would probably have been well over £500.  Therefore, I do not regard this new tax as burdensome on me personally, and I am sure that the same can be said for a large number of people; but the point about it is that it is neither fair nor rational.  There will be people far better off than me who will be able to avoid it; while there will be people paying it, perhaps not very much of it, who will react in exactly the same way as farmers reacted in 1977 when wealth tax was introduced.  They, and people I know who were, like myself, not within an ass's roar of the level at which they would have had to pay wealth tax said that, although they were not being caught by the tax, its introduction was &ldquo;the thin end of the wedge,&rdquo; the first step towards penalising, in the name of a red ideology, people who had worked, saved and built up substance for themselves.</P>
    <P>It is not because of its political effect that I disagree with the residential property tax.  It resembles the old schedule A income tax which was abolished 14 years ago.  If it is in the Finance Bill, it appears that, so far as anything the Minister said to the contrary is concerned, it is going to be charged on the market value of the house, irrespective of whether the beneficial ownership of that house is entirely vested in the person who lives there.  In other words, a man might own a house worth £65,000 or £70,000, and have no other substance in the world &mdash; and that is the case with a lot of people who live in my constituency &mdash; except his car, and he might not even own that entirely &mdash; he might still owe on that expensive house &mdash;<Col N="381" /> it might have been his life's ambition to provide a good background for his children and he may have laboured long to get that distance &mdash; and still owe half the value of that house on which he is making heavy repayments.  Apparently that element is not to be taken into consideration in constructing this tax.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister will take it into consideration and that the market value will be regarded as the market value less the amount outstanding in respect of the mortgage on the purchase of that house.  Even if that is done, it will still not be a fair and rational form of taxation.  A person could be a mohair-suited, suede-booted high-living bachelor living in an expensive flat in Blackrock with a view of the sea and costing £60,000 &mdash; that would be a very fine flat, and I picked that sum because it is just under the threshold we are discussing.  Yet that boulevardier might own a street of houses somewhere else, in which other people live, but he will not be caught by this residential property tax at all.  He could be the beneficial owner of the Pembroke Estate and he will not be caught for one penny by this form of tax.  He might have very substantial industrial investments, he might have an unlimited income, but because he does not live in the kind of accommodation we are talking about here, he will not have to pay one penny towards this tax.</P>
    <P>If I required any final proof that ideology, and nothing but ideology, is what is behind this proposal, it lies in the Minister's enchanting admission that he does not have a notion how much this tax will produce.  He said &ldquo;because of inadequate statistics on the numbers likely to be liable for the new tax, it was not possible to estimate precisely what yield can be expected,&rdquo; but he said, &ldquo;he was including in the budget arithmetic a provision of £10 million for 1983.&rdquo; That is a nice round sum, but any other round sum would have been just as good, because he does not know how many residences will be liable.  That to me is a clear sign that this unfair, irrational and in a real sense anti-social proposal &mdash; anti-social in the sense that it will be a replacement of a proper system of capital taxation which <Col N="382" /> I would support &mdash; is there merely as a sop to superficial left-wing ideology.  I object very strongly to that and intend to exercise the right of being on the back-bench to criticise this proposal in its passage through the House in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>What the country needs in budgetary matters is the political will to do what is right, in the conditions which the economic climate presents to us, over a period of years.  That is unlikely to happen in the context of the confrontation in which the unhappy mí-ádh-ridden evolution of Irish politics has left us.  In bad world conditions such as we now encounter, a Government containing a component even of the nicest and most admirable men in the world &mdash; I freely apply those adjectives to the Labour Members supporting this Government &mdash; is handicapped &mdash; although I confess this budget does not show much evidence of such a handicap apart from the residential property tax &mdash; if they have to look over their shoulders, politically, at a party which is still somewhat bigger but does not differ from it on any point of economic ideology but which differs from it on the largely forgotten embers of 60 year old issues which are deliberately fanned to keep the differences alive and justify us in drawing our salaries for abusing one another.</P>
    <P>I got no pleasure from watching the troubles in the Fianna Fáil Party in the last few weeks.  I thought it was a sad thing for the country.  I do not admire the Fianna Fáil ethos but I do not suppose they admire mine; that is a secondary thing.  But the people have rights which come before our taste in ethos and our prejudices.  I thought it sad that the element in that party which I regarded as more reasonable and openminded &mdash; Deputy O'Dea appears to be one of them &mdash; did not have their way.  There are exceptions on both sides and I do not want to be absolute about it.  I am not speaking simply about the crude issue of the leadership.  Who leads the Fianna Fáil Party is a matter for themselves, and it would be an impertinence for me to try to stuff my views about it down their necks.  This element in the Fianna Fáil Party has been silenced, pushed out of <Col N="383" /> sight behind the same old yapping, and &ldquo;hurroo-for-the-village-go-boy&rdquo; which has replaced to a great extent any serious critical assessment of what the party stand for and where they are going.  That is a great pity; but it is still more pathetic when I read in the morning papers what a respected and well-liked Member of that party, Deputy Faulkner, is reported as saying.  Deputy Faulkner is a man of some backbone.  He is not easily moved, as we know from his performance at the time of the postal strike a few years ago. At that time he was not very flexible; but inflexibility has, in some respects, a quality of its own.  We on this side of the House respect his qualities, and I know he is very highly regarded on the Fianna Fáil side; but my heart sank when I opened the paper and read that he had said he &ldquo;had always regarded the Fine Gael Party as conservative.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He may have learned that at his parents knees, or perhaps his grandparents, but does he really think that that is a fair or relevant thing to say about the party confronting him here today?  Above all, is it worth saying such a thing, when we look at the scale of the problems confronting us, all or many of which arise out of this confrontation which that Deputy, respected though he be, is deliberately trying to keep alive?  I am willing to stop sneering at Fianna Fáil &ldquo;a slightly constitutional party&rdquo;, and to renounce all the other chestnuts in the Fine Gael repertoire of abuse, to put all that on the shelf and forget about it.  Perhaps the confrontation has lessened; but it is depressing that a man of Deputy Faulkner's standard should say that we are a conservative party.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that when the State began in 1922 there was reason to describe in that fashion the interests which supported William T. Cosgrave. That would naturally have been the case; and if Mr. de Valera had won the civil war, it would have equally been applicable to those who surrounded him, within a very short time.  All the elements in the country who were not particularly interested in politics, had no particular reason <Col N="384" /> either to wish the English ill or well, and no special interest in the Irish language, but merely wished to get ahead in life, keep a roof over their heads, farm their lands, do their business, put their children through school &mdash; in other words what I might call the normal self-interested members of the community, those with a stake in the community, who wanted stability and peace and to be allowed to get on with their lives &mdash; tended naturally to support the Government that looked like giving them stability.  Those elements naturally coalesced around the Government led by William T. Cosgrave.  This would equally have been the case had de Valera won the civil war and been faced with the task of constructing this State in the twenties.</P>
    <P>To conclude from that that this party is conservative, and to use such an expression in a budget debate in 1983, as Deputy Faulkner did yesterday &mdash; a few days after he had been on the losing side in that sorry and bruising confrontation is saddening.  This is the party and the only party, along with the Labour Party, which brought the old age pension age successively down to 66 years from 70, which it had been, ever since such a thing as an old age pension was invented, under the Fiánna Fáil Government.  It was &ldquo;Red Richie&rdquo; who introduced the unmarried mothers' allowance and the allowance for prisoner's wives.  What is conservative about that?  What is stick-in-the-mud about that?  Where is the trace of the gombeen man in that kind of measure? It was the Government led by Liam T. Cosgrave which removed VAT from foodstuffs in 1973.  Was that grinding the faces of the poor?  Was that a William Martin Murphy operation?  They removed VAT from foodstuffs, which the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government said could not be done.</P>
    <P>I make every allowance for the fact that Deputy Faulkner is asked by his Whip to go and make a speech.  I do not wish to upset or offend him, because I respect him, but it is sad that one of the best of the Fianna Fáil Deputies should still, in the year 1983 when we are surrounded by such horrible problems as 180,000 out of work, many because of the <Col N="385" /> application of policies such as surfaced in 1977, be exchanging language like that across the House.</P>
    <P>The current shambles &mdash; and I describe it so advisedly &mdash; over this constitutional amendment for which both parties are responsible, is the fruit and only the fruit of this idiotic confrontation.  We were afraid that the Fianna Fáil Party would tell lies about us, take advantage of us, go around the country whispering that we were &ldquo;not sound on the issue of abortion&rdquo;. It was on that tone that Deputy Haughey set out in the 1982 November election.  Fianna Fáil were afraid that they could not afford to be overtaken in piety by us.  That is no way to run a country.  I have made my speech on that subject.  I do not believe in changing the laws on abortion and I shall do whatever my party decide is wise in order to prevent their being changed, even though I do not see any need for a constitutional amendment.  We are in the present situation of having the amendment hung around our necks &mdash; I believe unnecessarily, because none of us wants abortion, or has any notion of voting for it, and no Supreme Court judge has any notion of making the present law unconstitutional &mdash; because we are afraid of one another, do not trust one another and cannot count on one another to behave responsibly in the national interest when one side is in office and trying to get ahead with a serious job.  The people are the ones who suffer from this.</P>
    <P>I left the Front Bench and laid down hopes of office, for the moment anyway, in order to try to make that point.  I enjoy being a Minister, being in office.  I did as good a job as I could, worked as hard as I could and got satisfaction from it.  I do not like not being in Government.  I would prefer sooner to have a useful job to do, in which I could contribute something to the country, but I have to stand back here in order to say these things.  I hope that I shall be there long enough to hear them reciprocated from the Fianna Fáil side.</P>
    <P>I have said enough about the budget. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been indulgent in letting me wander some distance away from the strict terms of the <Col N="386" /> budget.  I wish the Minister great success and, with the reservation which I have expressed about the residential property tax, I recommend the acceptance of the budget to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly, as always, has been a most interesting and colourful speaker.  In his contribution not only has he criticised very much his own party and his Coalition colleagues in the Labour Party, but as we expected, criticised the Fianna Fáil side.  He is very concerned that Fianna Fáil should continue as a major political force.  I assure the Deputy that he need have no fears in that respect.  It may not be too long before we are back on that side of the House, fully exchanging views on opposite sides on that occasion.  We will be back, perhaps in a fairly short time, shorter than the Deputy might think.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly also took very much to task the Labour Party in so far as the residential property tax was concerned. We all accept that, on appearances, the Labour Party have had very little input into this budget.  It is absolutely amazing that that party should have contributed to and supported within Cabinet many of the measures in the budget.  Their support for some of the measures is beyond all reason and belief.  During the past few Dáil sessions I have listened to Labour Party speakers, particularly when they were sitting on the Opposition side.  At that time they were the champions of the old age pensioners, the unemployed and welfare recipients.  It is fair to ask what has happened now to that concern, now that they find themselves sitting in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, the Minister's first budget, introduced last week, has been recognised by most experts, particularly economic experts, as a disaster.  We all expected and would have accepted a tough budget provided it was seen that the measures taken would contribute in the near future and in a very practical way towards improving the economy.  But what we got last week from the Minister for Finance was the work of an accountant, an exercise in bookkeeping which only went towards rectifying figures on the debit <Col N="387" /> and credit sides.  One would not think that there are out there 187,000 people unemployed viewing the measures taken in that budget.  Indeed the situation as far as unemployment is concerned is worsening. There are many more thousands of workers on the brink of losing their jobs.  There are hundreds of companies in serious difficulties at present and on the brink of disaster.</P>
    <P>We had hoped this budget would have offered some prospects for those workers and companies but, unfortunately, that was not so.  It had been recognised by most groups within the country that business needed a fillip, an injection in these difficult times to maintain employment and, if at all possible, create new jobs.  In that respect also the measures introduced by the Minister last week were a dismal failure.  Probably it was one of the worst, most unimaginative budgets possible in the circumstances and did nothing whatever for our ailing economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed to concentrate exclusively on raising taxation with little or no attempt being made to curtail public expenditure.  The effect of this budget will be to raise prices, rendering it more difficult for firms and businesses to trade and compete with, of course, an ultimate effect on employment.  It will depress very dramatically the living standards of most people, those in the poorer section and those also in the so-called middle class striving to keep their heads above water.  There is no doubt that its effect will be to add to unemployment.  At pressent something between 7,000 and 8,000 jobs per month are being lost.  Nobody likes to be pessimistic.  We all like to look forward in a more positive and optimistic fashion but commentators have forecast that before the end of this year this budget probably will have played a major part in raising unemployment numbers to as high as 250,000.  On the surface that may appear a pessimistic viewpoint but one must be practical.  Viewing the present situation and the unemployment figures, realising also the number of companies experiencing difficulties, those pessimistic figures are possible.</P>
    <P>One wonders whether the Government <Col N="388" /> or the Minister for Finance really understood the seriousness of the problem. The Minister, in introducing such a budget, gave the impression he did not. The word &ldquo;equity&rdquo; was mentioned frequently throughout his statement but, in my view, the measures introduced were anything but equitable.  Once again the PAYE taxpayers are being caught for approximately £350 million.  In real terms an old age pensioner will lose anything up to 10 per cent when one takes into consideration the new tax impositions and increased taxation which will result in higher prices and a higher cost of living generally.</P>
    <P>On the other hand many of the measures taken will create a boom for the black economy.  The Minister has received deputations, as have all Deputies, particularly from the motor and tourist industries.  The motor trade has been hit very badly with additional taxes, duties and value-added tax.  Before the election we were promised by Fine Gael that they would strengthen the value of the £ in one's pocket, making our industries more competitive.  How on earth can anybody relate that type of aspiration to these budgetary measures?  In fact we have had two budgets, one last week and another earlier in January in which something in the region of nearly £200 million was taken from the pocket of the motorist, the man who takes a drink and the smoker.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot in recent times about companies owing taxes but not paying them.  I do not hold any brief for any firm or business that retains PAYE deductions and PRSI contributions.  Over the weekend I read a statement by Deputy McCartin, with some of whose comments I agree.  But I could not go all the way with him because one must remember that deductions, whether they be in respect of PAYE or PRSI, belong to the worker and are passed on to the State.  Therefore no firm or business has any right to retain such payments for any length of time.  Neither do I hold any brief for those who constantly criticise businesses, accusing them of soaking workers, taxpayers and so on.  We must remember that, from a business point of <Col N="389" /> view, we are dealing with people who invest money to create jobs.  If we did not have continued investment obviously employment would suffer.  As far as taxation is concerned companies, businessmen are being harassed to such an extent that eventually they are bound to say: &ldquo;What is the point?  Why should we continue to invest?&rdquo; The fact that so many businesses have been closing in recent times is evidence of that fact.</P>
    <P>No attempt whatever was made in the budget to spread the tax load or distribute the tax burden more widely.  The PAYE worker, who already shoulders a disproportionate share of the burden, received a knock-out punch on this occasion.  The Minister took the easy option and it would appear from his statement that there is more to come.  It is clear to most people that such measures could very easily lead to serious unrest.  Indeed one would be justified in posing the question: where were the Labour Party when all of this was taking place?  In the past, and I presume still, the Labour Party called themselves the defenders of the worker. I might quote the following passage from an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Friday, 11 February 1983:</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have been outplayed comprehensively at the budgetary game... Labour's captain, Mr. Dick Spring, bought the dummy pass.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that is so, but I doubt very much if the Tánaiste or any Labour Minister would be sufficiently naive to buy that type of dummy.  I believe that the Labour Party members were fully aware of the consequences of the measures being taken in this budget, measures penalising the worker and which will certainly destroy any initiative on the part of investors to create more jobs.  Furthermore, they are measures which will probably seriously hamper existing employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly spoke about the residential tax which we are told will raise something in the region of £10 million.  As Deputy Kelly indicated, the Minister has no idea how much money will be raised from this form of taxation.  It is an unjust measure because it will not tax people who have wealth in a just and equitable <Col N="390" /> way.  Nobody seems to know how this scheme will be administered but it seems to be the only contribution made to this budget by the Labour Party.  It is an ill-devised scheme which will do nothing whatever to generate any additional revenue from those who have wealth.</P>
    <P>There is also the silly measure of reducing duty-free liquor imports from 1.5 litres to 1 litre per person and we are told that this will save another £7 million.  The number of cigarettes which may be brought in by an individual is reduced from 300 to 200.  These examples show how ludicrous and fictitious are the figures in these budget proposals.  It is not possible for the Minister to say that the Exchequer will save £7 million through one of these measures.  How will it be done?  This is Mickey Mouse stuff in comparison with what is happening at the border where container loads of goods are being smuggled daily.  The budget proposals will certainly make smuggling more attractive and the incidence will increase.  What measures are being taken to prevent it?  Jobs are at stake and many legitimate companies who have been paying their taxes are being let down.  Individuals living near the Border will certainly take advantage of that situation by purchasing petrol, liquor and cigarettes in the North.  This is all very well for the individual but legitimate traders all over the country are deeply concerned at the large-scale smuggling which is costing the Exchequer millions of pounds every year and putting jobs in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The cut of £10.3 million from the Fianna Fáil Estimates for non-capital health expenditure will hit the poor and the elderly and certain schemes, such as the drug refund scheme, will have to be abandoned.  Health boards will suffer and I understand they will be left to their own devices to raise money, possibly from the local authorities.  The old and the ill will suffer most of all.</P>
    <P>There is also to be an additional 1 per cent levy on gross income.  This is a cruel imposition on the worker and it is additional to the employment levy introduced last year.  The worker is quite justified in asking how this money will be used.  How <Col N="391" /> many jobs have been created as a result of the 1 per cent levy imposed last year?</P>
    <P>Where is the money going?  These are legitimate questions and the workers are entitled to answers and to see the results in terms of jobs created.  We are told that this new levy is a temporary measure but when taxation is introduced there is nothing temporary about it.  It is 1 per cent this year and perhaps it will be 2 per cent next year.  These measures destroy the morale of the worker by taking more and more money from his pocket while he sees nothing for it.</P>
    <P>There have been increases across the board in VAT, tax benefit for mortgage interest has been slashed and there are new charges for local services.  There have also been increases in motor tax, television licences, petrol, and servicing of cars.  Higher PRSI charges are to be announced.  I estimate that these increases will cost the average worker up to £20 per week and a person in the higher income bracket with a salary of £20,000 a year will pay an extra £3,000 in tax.  A dramatic loss in income is a frightening experience for anyone, be he a labourer or an executive and particularly for the middle income earner who may be in his fifties and trying to bring up his family and pay for their education.  It will be virtually impossible for such a person to accept such a huge reduction in living standards.  It will obviously affect the man who has a high mortgage or a young married couple in the same position. These are the people who will be affected by these measures.</P>
    <P>If one could see a ray of hope at the end of the day as a result of these measures, perhaps they might be accepted, but during his speech the Minister hardly mentioned the problem of unemployment. He expressed regret that we have such large scale unemployment and I think he also indicated that it was a problem affecting the whole Western world. What consolation is that to the Irish worker who is paying more and more in taxation, knowing that no effort whatever appears to have been made by the Government to create an environment which will bring about extra employment <Col N="392" /> and encourage investors to put more capital into employment-generating enterprises? This is the most negative aspect of this budget and it seems to have been a hopeless exercise.</P>
    <P>As a result of ever-increasing charges on trade and service industries we will have the inevitable nixers.  Those involved are facing a boom and will take away potential turnover from legitimate business people.  This is bad at any time but in a recession it will cause greater hardship to business and additional loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  We have had abuses in the past and probably we will always have them.  Over the years I have listened to Ministers for Finance from all parties using the same old cliché that they were looking at new measures to catch those who were not paying their fair share of tax, but nothing seems to happen.  Each year we hear the same pious statements but evasion continues and the legitimate taxpayers are asked to pay more.  One must ask the inevitable question, how long can we keep this up? Can we come back next year and introduce further measures to increase tax?  I do not think we can.  We have reached the end of that road but where do we go from here?  That is the most serious prospect facing any Government because we have over-taxed the old reliables.</P>
    <P>Before the dissolution of the last Dáil Fianna Fáil published their economic plan, <i>The Way Forward.</i> That plan was reasonably well received and a description such as that in political terms means a lot.  It was a constructive and well thought out plan which involved a number of people from different occupations. It had the support and co-operation of economists, banks and trade unionists, set targets for development and detailed where finance could be saved.  At the same time it did not propose any further burden on the PAYE taxpayer.  The plan envisaged the provision of many new jobs to be brought about by improved competitiveness in industry and more selective investment.  It was estimated in the plan that 215,000 new jobs could be provided between now and 1987.  That figure was not plucked from the sky but was based on a detailed survey and analysis <Col N="393" /> of what could be done in the overall context of a proper economic plan.</P>
    <P>Prior to the election we were aware that Fine Gael or Labour did not have a firm economic plan and last week's budget proved that without doubt.  Last week's disastrous exercise has been condemned by many financial commentators because it provides an ideal recipe for higher inflation and will contribute to the closure of many more firms.  In the absence of any plan from the Government, <i>The Way Forward</i> should have been accepted in some form.  All the details were set out in it and the Government were not justified in dismissing it.</P>
    <P>We have a young population and in the region of 35,000 young people leave school each year seeking employment. What prospects have they of getting a job?  Taxpayers would be happy to accept harsh budgets if there was a prospect of employment for our young people. Emigration will not solve our problems any more.  When we had high unemployment many years ago emigration always helped us.  Our young people were able to go abroad and get employment and as long as they were not on the live register our problem was solved.  We are in a dilemma with a huge, young and well-educated number on the unemployed list. Many of them will not accept the hopelessness of their situation.  Obviously, that provides a breeding ground for social unrest and discontent.</P>
    <P>The Government must act responsibly and urgently.  We must have a proper plan and a commitment by the Government to create employment for school leavers.  In the past much employment was provided by the construction industry but that industry is on its knees.  Like many others sectors of the economy it was looking to the Minister for some relief and an injection of capital so that they could at least maintain existing employment.  As a result of the budget the volume of output in that industry will decline shortly and revised spending patterns will be reflected in a sharp increase in the industry's jobless.  Local authority housing will suffer, leading to a further decline in the activities of the construction industry.  Fewer people will be able <Col N="394" /> to afford their own houses and will have to seek local authority houses.  As a result of cutbacks local authorities will not be able to build many houses and that will lead to bigger waiting lists.</P>
    <P>As a member of Dublin City Council I am aware of the serious housing shortage in the city.  Local authorities who are already short of funds have been told that they must raise £65 million but suggestions have not been sent to city or county managers by the Minister for Finance. Additional finance will be needed from now on but I do not know how local authorities can raise that money without introducing further draconian measures on householders.  It is possible that it will lead to the reintroduction of rates.  The Minister did not mention the question of rates at all.  Fianna Fáil abolished the old rating system, one of the most unjust systems ever operated, because it was not based on means.  However, from now on local authorities will find themselves in a dilemma, having to meet increased charges with less revenue coming from the Exchequer.  Obviously charges will have to be imposed fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions have been made about charges for garbage collection, for water, for street cleaning, and so on.  It will take time to introduce these types of charges and it will take even longer for the revenue to start flowing into the local authority.  In the meantime the services will be seriously affected.</P>
    <P>This budget provides no hope for anybody, whether they be business people, the employed or the unemployed, old age pensioners or social welfare recipients.  This is the greatest failure of all in the budget.  It offers no hope.  It has no silver lining.  In times of recession it is the role and responsibility of the Government to lead.  The Government and the Minister in his budget last week failed appallingly in this respect.  People will follow and co-operate if there is a prospect of better times ahead.  Unfortunately, there is nothing whatever in the budget to suggest that there will be better times, or that there is any hope of a quick recovery.  It will drive people further into recession and make the task of recovery <Col N="395" /> much more difficult if not well high impossible.</P>
    <P>The easy options we had in the past are no solutions to economic difficulties.  An additional 10p here or 20p there to raise additional finance for the Exchequer is not the answer any more and will not be in the future.  It is imperative for the Government to devise new ideas and new economic policies to keep the country going.  One of the greatest disappointments in the budget was the failure of the Minister to reshape the cost structure of our State organisations.  In private business when you have financial difficulties you have to prune your operation accordingly to get better efficiency at a better cost.  State operations should be the same.  Radical action is needed, but the will must be there to take the required action.</P>
    <P>Far too many people are living off a decreasing number contributing to the State.  Failure to deal with this problem is nothing short of downright irresponsibility. The private investor will think twice before pumping more investment or capital into industry.  As we all know, that means the loss of additional jobs together with a substantial loss of revenue to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years budgets introduced by Fianna Fáil Ministers provided approximately 20 per cent to 25 per cent increases for old age pensioners, social welfare recipients, and so on. Those increases contributed in a positive way towards improving the lot of the old and the disadvantaged.  I do not think anybody in this House would begrudge that increase in prosperity for our old people who are in the winter of their lives, who worked hard all their lives and contributed to the State as taxpayers. They are entitled to that consideration. It has always been Fianna Fáil policy to give priority to those people.  Unfortunately, it would seem to be Fine Gael policy to be niggardly with the old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly spoke about differences of opinion between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael going back over the years.  I do not want to refer back over 20, 30 or 40 years. <Col N="396" /> That is not being positive.  The records show that Fianna Fáil have always been much more thoughtful and constructive in their approach to old age pensioners. The increase of 12 per cent for long-term pensioners is niggardly.  Of that I have no doubt.  When one considers the obvious increases in the cost of living which will follow very shortly, one realises that the 12 per cent increase will become a reduction over a period.  We must not forget that that increase comes into operation in June, whereas in previous budgets it was introduced in April.  This is a mean saving at the expense of people who are in a vulnerable position and who cannot defend themselves.  They have no organisations or trade unions.  This is taking advantage of that section of the community in a very mean way.</P>
    <P>On the question of VAT the Minister announced a 5 per cent increase from 18 per cent to 23 per cent and from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.  This will cause serious problems for business people as well as private individuals.  Last year the Fianna Fáil Minister announced that VAT would be paid at the point of entry.  I had grave reservations about that because I felt it represented a serious imposition on legitimate traders and business firms which were giving good employment.  Many of those firms had to cut back because they got themselves into financial difficulties as they had to pay out large sums of money for goods they had not yet received.  It must be remembered that the trader who has to pay VAT at the point of entry has to stock his goods and sell them.  Perhaps he has to give credit to customers or clients.  In many cases he might not be paid for three, four, five or six months, if at all.  Consequently it is not too difficult to see the serious imposition this has represented to many legitimate business traders.</P>
    <P>Most Members of the House will know that such high rates of VAT together with the imposition of VAT at the point of entry has led to increased smuggling and illegal importation.  Container loads of goods are coming across the Border in the darkness.  There is a system in operation along the Border with a look-out to ensure that the customs officer is not on <Col N="397" /> duty.  Many people in business know this is happening.  I am quite sure the customs authorities are also aware of what is taking place.</P>
    <P>Millions of pounds are being lost to the Exchequer.  The illegitimate trader does not pay tax.  He may not have the same type of operation as the legitimate trader. This is having very serious effects on the employers and companies who are endeavouring to live within the rules, to pay their taxes regularly and to create and give employment.  The Minister must look at this area very seriously.  It is not good enough to indicate that the system of payment at the point of entry will be reviewed in 12 months' time.  With the new increases in VAT it is urgent that the system introduced last year should be scrapped and the Minister might possibly consider this in the context of the Finance Bill when it is introduced in the House. Our VAT rate is one of the highest in Europe and must be a serious blow to traders, especially those who operate within a reasonable distance of the Border.</P>
    <P>We have had the spectacle over the last few months of pictures in newspapers and on television of the thousands of shoppers who are taking trips to Holyhead and the North every weekend.  That is money leaving the legitimate trader here, who is giving employment.  It is also money leaving the Exchequer because not alone is the Exchequer losing taxation but the lost employment is an additional drain on the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The Minister also announced a £3 million cutback on Garda overtime.  Any cutback in Garda pay, overtime or otherwise, will have a serious effect on law and order, particularly in the cities.  In Dublin over the last 12 months there has been a huge increase in crime.  It is still growing at a very serious rate.  Citizens are not safe.  Attacks are taking place on young and old people.  Homes are being broken into systematically night after night in different areas.  In parts of my own constituency, Dublin North Central, it has been reported that five or six houses on the same park or road have been broken into on the same night at the same time. It usually happens between 3 a.m. and 6 <Col N="398" /> a.m.  If there is to be less Garda activity due to cutbacks, the crime rate will rise to an appallingly high and unacceptable level.  Many residents' groups and associations are already discussing ways and means of forming vigilante groups, and if this happens it will lead to a complete breakdown in law and order as we know it.  Any cutback in Garda activities, whether in pay, overtime or equipment, is a totally negative exercise and will only lead to further wanton destruction and cost to the taxpayer in the final analysis. It cannot be justified in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have briefly mentioned the motor industry.  At the end of this year the special import duty imposition, as agreed within the EEC context ten years ago, ceases.  I would like to know what the intention of the Minister is at the end of 1983.  Does he intend to retain them or to replace these duties in some other form?  The motor industry has already suffered terribly.  It has given excellent employment over the years but thousands of jobs have been lost, especially in the past 18 months.  Car sales are down drastically.  The safety aspects of cars is declining because motorists cannot afford to pay for a legitimate service.  This is an area that has had taxation imposed on it, year after year, in the same way as the drink and tobacco industry.  However, a motor car is not a luxury; it is a necessity for commuting to and from work.  Additional costs by way of the capital outlay for a car and extra taxation on petrol are adding very seriously to the burden of the motorist.  As a result, there is a further drop in car sales and a loss of jobs in that industry.</P>
    <P>The strategy in the budget is wrong. There is nothing constructive in it and it can only cause serious damage to our economy.  It will increase unemployment and stifle capital investment.  We all agree that the deficit must be reduced and that public finances must be brought under control, but merciless taxation on the worker and on employment is not the answer to those problems.</P>
    <P>Since the budget was announced the economic experts, the public and representatives of business have been numbed <Col N="399" /> with shock at the additional high rate of tax increases.  There is nothing to indicate that the situation will be any better at the end of this year and that is the worst failure that can be attributed to this budget.  It is not too late for the Minister, when introducing the Finance Bill, to review a number of the measures he has taken.  Otherwise the creation of full employment will be stifled and we will be back here at the end of this year in a worse mess than we are in at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget has been criticised by the man in the street.  The principal criticism has been that it is the toughest budget ever, draconian, and that the worst effects have not been mitigated. One constituent remarked to me that this budget was worse than anything that Hitler did to the Jews.  The interpretation of the budget by the media, the Opposition and the man in the street begs the first question prior to the budget.  Do we realise the extent of the crisis we are in?  Often, when spokesmen for the Government or the Opposition talk in hundreds of millions of pounds, the average man in the street is lost.  The easiest way of expressing our difficulty and the level and extent of our crisis is to say in broad terms that the Government, prior to this budget, were incurring a loss of approximately £3 million per day.  Like any household or business, there are limits to the losses that can be sustained. Moreover, this loss is not peculiar to the 1980s.  In 1977 approximately 75p in every pound of our principal tax, PAYE, did not provide one hospital bed, did not fill one pothole and did not heat one school.  It only paid the interest on the solution to yesterday's problems in terms of central debt service.  I understand that prior to the budget the figure this year was 100p in every pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day of reckoning has come and it will not go away.  The background to the situation has been identified clearly. First, there was the increase in the price of oil.  That money went to the Middle East or to Mexico and it did not return. We compensated ourselves by borrowing in order to maintain our standards of <Col N="400" /> living.  Moreover the problem was compounded by the monetary and economic policies of our trading partners.  It is not sufficient to say we are a small country. We must look at the economic policies of our trading partners because we must remain competitive.  If Britain, our largest trading partner, Germany and America adopt stringent monetary policies we are obliged to follow suit in terms of rationalisation and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The most frightening aspect is that if the Government did not act now, in 1984, 1985 or 1986 we would have a situation where not only all returns from PAYE, excise duties and VAT but nearly all our revenues would go merely to pay back the mortgage we put on our future by not trying to rectify the financial situation. Our creditors, through the IMF, would take the appropriate action regardless of any democratically elected Government here.  As a civil service structure they would administer the kind of cuts they would think essential and representations to mitigate the worst effects would not be entertained.  Leaving aside the dire financial situation facing the Government, if we consider the overall economy we see the last year 8 per cent of our gross domestic product &mdash; £1,000 million &mdash; was lost on the trade deficit.  That money has gone out of the country on a trade imbalance never to return.</P>
    <P>Secondly, private investment, which is the greatest barometer of economic activity, dropped by amounts ranging from 7 per cent to 10 per cent depending on the sector.  For 1982 the borrowing figure was £1,945 million.  There is no relationship between the growth in output and the level of borrowing and that situation cannot be sustained over a long period. There has been a decline of 4 per cent in our competitiveness with EEC countries. We have had a 14 per cent pay increase for 1982, Germany had a net pay increase of 4½ per cent and Britain 9½ per cent. Yet, we are expected to export competitively to their markets.  More than 40,000 people lost their jobs in 1982, an additional 20,000 people were available for work and 349,000 man-days were lost through industrial action and sickness. This is the bottom line so far as our <Col N="401" /> economy is concerned.  The people in the corridors of power and in the civil service structures will have to become aware of what is going on in the real economic world.  Inevitably, the day of reckoning has come.</P>
    <P>What conclusions can we come to? Because of loss of competitiveness we must deflate our economy and we must reduce inflation to come into line with our competitors.  While the effects of deflation may mean an increase in unemployment, we must at least make sure that we do not lose further ground.  Many politicians have not grasped one of the most fundamental aspects of economic policy.  Any growth in the economy cannot be gained efficiently by extra Government expenditure.  Whether on the current or the capital side, the thesis that the Government by pumping in more money are adopting the right measure to encourage growth in the economy is fundamentally wrong.  It is an essential ingredient but to see it as the basic philosophy is the principal reason we are in our present mess.  Growth in the economy and job creation can only be achieved by a net increase in the volume and value of our export sales.  Unless we produce more, unless we have more earnings from abroad, we do not owe ourselves any increase.  If we do not achieve that growth we do not deserve to preserve our living standards.  That is the principal feature that underlines the budget and it must underline the Government's economic policy.</P>
    <P>Because successive Governments have not accepted that as an underlying strategy has meant that the Government themselves are the cause of the problem. Whether it is the tourist industry trying to attract overseas revenue, or any sector trying to sell goods and services competitively, the burdens of taxation built into our infrastructural costs are such that the Government have become the problem.</P>
    <P>Where do we look for solutions in over-all economic terms and in terms of the approach to be adopted?  The principal aspect that must be considered is the question of leadership.  For too long we have had too much waffle from too many politicians.  The difficulty is that many <Col N="402" /> politicians who made their political careers in the seventies are now in the leadership of the respective political parties and they got there on the promise of a better standard of living and leading people to hope for a better future.  Now the political difficulty is that they must explain why that is no longer a reality. The real difficulty is leadership towards moderation, firstly in terms of incomes and secondly in terms of demands on Government services.  In terms of incomes policy we cannot compensate ourselves for increases in cost of living to determine a standard of living which we have not earned.  A basic economic principle is that that is simply unsustainable. I appreciate that with the high levels of unemployment this reality is dawning on the trade union movement and across every sector of the economy, but unless we take corrective measures now and unless we have the same approach to pay policy as was outlined for social welfare and unless there is no compensation in terms of pay increases for these extra revenues raised, the whole purpose of this budget will be self-defeating.  In terms of Government services and current and capital services the Government are going to pump £7,751 million into the economy.  I will deal later in detail with the demands on Government services which are unsustainable and which may unfortunately be uncontrollable at this stage.</P>
    <P>The second important aspect of any solution is the fact that we must realise, as Deputy Mac Giolla said in this debate, that to balance the books is one side of the argument in terms of repaying our debts; the other is to produce more and to increase one's earnings.  We must develop in terms of our natural resources and industry a cohesive production policy. We must co-ordinate the rationale of Telesis.  We must integrate the National Development Co-operation venture, the strategic industries that we have and training in primary productive areas, whether for farmers or fishermen, so that young people who are taking over land or entering into careers are equipped sufficiently for them.  We must have a cohesive production policy for employment <Col N="403" /> to ensure that we get the best value for money in terms of growth and we must invest money strategically in growth areas on a viable basis.  I will come later to the actual employment features of this.</P>
    <P>The third solution to our problem lies in considering the major structural defects of the State.  How efficient are our monopoly State services?  How cost-competitive are the ESB in providing electricity as a basic energy resource for every manufacturing concern?  How efficient and cost-competitive with another £23 million are our postal and telecommunications service and our whole transport system?  If they are not competitive, if the structures are not efficient, that has a knock-on effect on everyone trying to create employment, to make a profit or to produce more and increase our GDP.  If those structures are wrong no amount of efficiency further down the line in manufacturing industry or agriculture can compensate for that fundamental lack of competitiveness. Therefore, we must overcome that structural problem and create a new awareness of efficiency in those public bodies.</P>
    <P>The fourth area in relation to a solution of our problem is a greater emphasis in terms of approach and commitment by all in terms of buying Irish goods.  I have not got the figures from the Irish Goods Council in relation to what level of expenditure per week would create what number of jobs, but I have a figure from Britain which indicates that if every housewife there spent £8.60 per week more on British goods &mdash; the goods indigenous there &mdash; that would create in two years a million jobs.  That is the level in proportion of the employment loss we are dealing with through people not having the loyalty and commitment to buy and use Irish goods and services.</P>
    <P>I will now go into detail in relation to leadership towards moderation of demand on Government services.  People have no conception of the seriousness of our situation.  The essential aspect of leadership now in Government circles must be towards this moderation.  Here we look for leadership from Fianna Fáil, <Col N="404" /> and what do they say?  How ironic it is that I was one of the TDs speaking on Government motions in this House who respected aspects of <i>The Way Forward</i> and saw merit in them, but now I am appalled when I consider the credibility of the principal Opposition party, no longer the largest Oireachtas party, and that they voted against the increases in VAT.  That is justifiable and I appreciate it, but simultaneously they say through the media and in this House that we have funked the issue of the current budget deficit and that the figure should have been £750 million.  If they had not the guts to go ahead with the VAT increases, where in the name of heaven were they to get £350 million?  They have not answered, and their credibility in terms of providing the leadership is non-existent. That is the reason we are permanently &mdash; or for the next four years at least &mdash; on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>We must look at the long-term.  People may say that they will accept this budget if it is a once-off harsh measure.  However, next year's budget may be even harder.  The reality is that we have a budget deficit of £900 million this year. To reduce that progressively until 1987, with a drop in buoyancy and so on, we will need to raise extra taxes to the level of somewhere between £275 million and £350 million every year.  If we look at what house rates and VAT on clothing and footwear might bring in we will see that we have major problems.  It would be wrong for anyone on any side of this House to think that this budget in any way will balance the books.  It does not go anywhere near to achieving that.</P>
    <P>As a TD I would like to detail in every sector the demands on Government services and the need for leadership in moderation.  For example, in my constituency quite reasonably pensioners, widows, the unemployed, the sick, and the handicapped come to me to say that a pay pause of 10 per cent or 12 per cent with the effective cuts in PRSI, short time and so on is a very meagre increase which does not and possibly will not keep pace with the increase in the cost of living. That is a very legitimate point of view. Also I accept the PAYE taxpayers' point <Col N="405" /> of view that a 1 per cent levy, no increase in the tax bands, probably more net payment of PRSI and other increases which will hit them directly in terms of charges for local authority services will leave them worse off.  That is a very reasonable argument.  Why should they pay more <i>pro rata</i> than persons in other sectors?  In my constituency 1,600 families are housed in mobile homes that are leaking or living with in-laws, and we will be building only 100 houses.  These people have a genuine case for demanding expenditure to build more houses.  The hoteliers have a very genuine case.  They are taxed almost out of existence.  They want a reduction on VAT which has risen from 18 per cent to 23 per cent.  They say that the imposition of VAT on food is almost unconstitutional, that food is a basic necessity and how could we impose this tax on it?  Theirs is also a very reasonable case.  How can they attract more tourists when they are taxed uncompetitively? My constituency also needs a new hospital, more geriatric beds, and when I see the waiting list I realise that that also is a very reasonable request.  The vintners were marching here, and I accept that certain increases in taxes will affect them.  With a 10 per cent increase in excise duty on drink, and, say, a corresponding 7 per cent drop in consumption, the Government will still gain from the increase but the publicans are the real losers because their volume is down and therefore their profit is down.  This is a very genuine case.  All over my constituency I am meeting the ASTI and parents in relation to the £13 million saved in relation to education and in relation to the school transport cuts.  I can genuinely see why married couples on unemployment assistance cannot afford to pay for transport services in the junior cycle.  I understand that the Petrol Retailers' Association are going on strike because of the penal increases in relation to tax on petrol.  The garages wanted a deduction from 18 per cent VAT on workshop repairs to 3 per cent and it has gone to 23 per cent.  They have a genuine case.</P>
    <P>I met six pensioners over the weekend who have lost their medical cards.  They have a genuine case.  There are people who have essential items on the GMS for <Col N="406" /> very severe illness and there is £6 million saved there.  Those people have a genuine case.  In relation to farmers, the IFA are very well organised in my constituency. They have put a very legitimate case for no further capital taxation as there is no corresponding relationship to their ability to pay.  We know the story about the resource tax case.  They refused to pay it on justifiable grounds and one could accept that.  They refused to pay the 2 per cent levy as they said that was inequitable. They refused to pay rates and they went to court over it.  One can see they had some reasonable points.  We can see the need for industrial and infrastructural development, the need for advance factories. In my constituency we need extra ESB 38KB lines to get heavy industry in there.  We need better roads and better telecommunication services.  We need an industrial effluent plant to attact heavy industry.  We see a situation in relation to terms of employment of VAT at the point of entry.  That £140 million should have been taken away altogether and it would have meant that jobs would have been retained.</P>
    <P>We had the CIE link between Rosslare and Limerick Junction, a very worthy case.  We see CIE fares gone up by 25 per cent.  We see pensioners and others who cannot afford to pay water rates.  There is no way we are allowed reintroduce house rates.  I accept the need for security. We need more gardaí.  We have to maintain the Defence Forces.  All the arguments I have outlined are legitimate reasons why we should spend more money, take in less taxes because either the expenditure item is so sensitive, needy or the taxation item is simply inequitable, does not relate to the capacity to pay or deprives people of the incentive to work.  It is about time that TDs said that we have got such well organised pressure groups in the country that if all their demands were met the Government could close down at 5 o'clock on next Friday evening.  The reality is that everyone has such expectations of any Government, despite what political party are in Government, in terms of more expenditure and more relief on the taxation side that two into one simply do not go.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> There is a great need in the country for leadership to explain that there are diametrically opposed views which cannot be reconciled, and the leadership role at this point is to tell people they should moderate their demands on Government if they want to have a Government that is democratically elected and not some IMF civil servants who will not listen to anybody.  That must be sold by every politician because the most tragic thing about all this is that if we do not face up to our problems, if we have not got the necessary rectitude, the bottom line is &mdash; this cannot be said often enough because we need to be sensitive about it &mdash; whether it is the IMF, the EEC or the World Bank, nobody owes us a living. Unless we are prepared to arm through an extra volume of trade in our exports we have no right to protect our living standards or Government services.  That is unpalatable but it is the truth and has to be sold in terms of leadership and moderation so that we can start to return to the areas in which we can look for the fundamental basis for growth and prosperity again.</P>
    <P>As the youngest Member in this House I am not prepared to see budgets that do not make some attempt to resolve the situation because my generation simply cannot and will not pay for the reluctance and inability of this generation to reconcile its financial difficulties.  That deals with the criticism that this budget was too harsh.  It deals conclusively with the aspect that the Government have no sensitivity in dealing with people's problems. It clearly shows the pressures on the Government, the crisis we are in, the gravity of the financial situation of the Government and the financial state of our economy.</P>
    <P>The second criticism that has been levied at this budget is that there is no social planning, no social justice, no light at the end of the tunnel, no economic planning, no long term view about how we will solve our problems.  There are a few points I would like to make in relation to this because to some extent one could see the validity for such criticism.  To produce a blueprint for the social and economic <Col N="408" /> plan, some way forward that will relieve us of all our problems, it is practically and mentally impossible to do that in eight weeks.  The second point is that we had a plan in 1982.  We had a plan that went into all aspects of economic activity, that looked at employment, inflation, the terms of trade, cost competitiveness, incomes policy and every facet of the economy, our infrastructural problems, our geographic problems, our trade problems and everything else.  The reality is that no amount of planning and no amount of magic will solve this problem. Moreover, for a plan to be realistic you have to set out targets, objectives and you have got to put figures on paper.  If we have learned anything in the seventies we have realised in economic and social terms that nothing is static, that everything is changing and evolving and that targets that might have been laid out in <i>The Way Forward</i> in October are no longer simply operative.  We must realise that plans are over-rated.  Instead of plans, magic blueprints and simplistic solutions to our problems we must look for overall policy objectives and targets which we would like to attain.</P>
    <P>There is no way in which we will overcome our problems unless we try to set about the broad objective of trying to create a mecca in the country for greater industrial, agricultural and general production. We cannot do that unless we can create the viable basis whereby people can go to work on a Monday morning, make a profit in their concern and get a reasonable wage out of it.  I have outlined already the structural defects in terms of essential cost inputs of electricity, transport and telecommunications that are already way out of line.  If we had the leadership that could moderate our demands on Government services, if we could have moderation in incomes policy, if we could thereby bring about an improvement in our overall cost competitiveness, there would be a consequential immediate increase in volume value output in external trade.  That is the way we will grow and overcome our problems. Then we will tax the wealth and spread it around sensitively and socially to provide the goods and services in terms of <Col N="409" /> health services and educational services which the country so badly needs.</P>
    <P>I say this because the fundamental political principle this party stand for is that we must create the wealth if we are to distribute it.  If a Government attempt to distribute first they end up with nothing for anyone as a result of the burden on the productive sector and that means that the economy grinds slowly but surely to a halt.  I see no alternative to the remedial action that has been taken in the budget.  If we failed to take this necessary action now we would be faced with a situation in which the International Monetary Fund or some of our creditors would take the necessary action.  Leaving aside the question of an insolvency situation, let us consider the economic consequences of not taking corrective measures. We would continue to struggle from one recession to the next and into a situation in which there would be so many people in Germany, Switzerland and America who would be owed money by us that we would be forced to devalue our currency.  I have my own views about the possible advantages of devaluation but enforced devaluation now would be disastrous for our economy because it would leave us in a vice grip of imported inflation that would rock the very foundation of the economy.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must stand back from these pressures and realise that the Government were elected to govern and not to be pushed around by pressure groups.  The Government were not elected to act in a short-term way that would undermine the long-term gains we need to cope with the growth in our population. At very hard times like these there are advantages in approaching in certain ways some aspects of governmental activity.  I hope that out of what we are doing will emerge a new awareness of the need to get value for money spent by the Government.</P>
    <P>Regardless of who is in office there is always the charge in respect of cuts in any Department that such cuts are insensitive, irresponsible and wrong morally.</P>
    <P>We have a situation in which Ministers rely on their record of the extra expenditure they negotiated at the Cabinet table <Col N="410" /> as a result of their commitment to their respective areas.  We need a positive policy in overall terms in relation to getting value for money and in this context a policy of privatisation.  I can think of two examples whereby we could reduce service costs while the Government basically would continue paying for the services but whereby we would get better value for our money.  The first area is that of geriatric care.  In some instances beds for geriatrics are costing up to £196 per week.  Very few such beds cost less than £100 per week.  I assume these costs take into account the capital and maintenance cost of the hospitals as well as the labour costs and so on.  Not so long ago I met a newly-formed association concerned with private nursing homes.  This was during the period of office of the last Government and this group were beseeching the Government to provide a supplement of £70 per week for geriatric patients being looked after in nursing homes but the Government were refusing to provide the money in respect of certain patients.  Some registered nursing homes were in receipt of the supplement but the then Government would not consider paying the supplement in respect of more beds.  At the same time there were being considered programmes for extra expenditure on new geriatric hospitals. Continuing also was the expensive administration of the health services through the health boards.  One would not need to be an economic genius to realise the cost advantage of £70 per week as against £196 and to realise that if the service could not be provided for that money any loss would be sustained by the owners of the private nursing homes.  For too long we have expected the State to act in a direct way.</P>
    <P>The other area I am thinking of is that of school transport.  It would be cheaper for the Government to pay the parent of each child attending primary school, say, £250 per year towards the cost of transport than to provide the present services, regardless of the new provisions.  The bus drivers tell me that because CIE act as agents for the Department of Education, they could provide a service to the parents that would be cheaper while at the <Col N="411" /> same time getting more from the parents than they are getting from CIE.  One can only conclude that the bureaucratic, inefficient middle man, CIE, in their present structure are such that there is a basic lack of cost efficiency in the provision of primary school transport.  If the boards of management of all primary schools were to find the coaches, engage the drivers and provide the service while we would give them 50 per cent of the total cost, I am convinced that the State would save money and that the parents would have a better service.  At least they would not have to worry about being 50 yards on the wrong side of the road or about the distance they live from the school or about the ages of the children and so on.  These then are two concrete examples of the sort of improvements I have in mind but, with some thought, I could go through each Department and find areas in which, instead of the State being involved directly in doing jobs or in providing certain services, if the money was spent by way of subcontracting, whether in regard to roads or any other area, we would have cheaper, more efficient and more cost competitive services.</P>
    <P>I trust that by reason of the cutbacks there will be a new public awareness, a demand for better value and a lobby on TDs of the kind I outlined earlier for more expenditure and less taxation but for new efficiencies in the various areas. That is positive policy and should be pursued.</P>
    <P>While accepting that the budget is a financial matter and is not directly associated with the question of employment policy, the principal tangible aspect in this respect in the budget is the cutting of the IDA grant to the extent of £6 million and the provision of £7 million for the National Development Corporation. One might think that £6 million is a savage cut in respect of the IDA who are under so much pressure in every area to attract more foreign investment, to fill the advance factories and to produce more jobs.  While I have enormous respect for the IDA as a structure and for certain personnel within that body, I suggest that this loss of £6 million could be <Col N="412" /> offset by closing down the public relations arm of the Authority.  The IDA have become so big, though not as bureaucratic as some other State bodies, that their public relations arm is frighteningly inefficient and politicised, not in a party political way, but politicised in a way aimed at selling themselves, projecting themselves as being the ones who are doing a good job and that if it were not for them industrial manufacturing employment could not be maintained.</P>
    <P>In my constituency one factory went into receivership, was liquidated but local representatives and business interests combined to get the company going again.  The IDA rescue section were involved, providing a grant of less than £30,000.  The company was reorganised under a new name employing 70 per cent of the previous number employed.  Six months later the IDA announced through their public relations office that they had saved that factory and but for their intervention jobs would have been lost.  The reality of the situation is that if they had not got help from the IDA grant they would have come under the employment incentive scheme, which would have been worth more than £60,000.  It would have been better if the IDA had never been involved.  Two major concerns were promised for Wexford for the past 18 months but after detailed negotiations, complex financial arrangements and difficulties in the legal area, they pulled out.  The IDA are announcing too much and doing too little.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the IDA for the recession or for the difficulties they experience in attracting industries, but they have become so big that it appears one of their principal policy objectives is to defend themselves, which they are doing through sophisticated public relations exercises. Any money that could be diverted from that area and from expensive lunches and large expense accounts would not be a bad thing.  I hope the cuts will be in that area and that they will not be felt by a reduction in grant payments to hard-pressed expanding industries.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation was the fundamental aspect of Fine Gael employment policy prior to the election, <Col N="413" /> and we will all be monitoring its progress.  It is vital for this corporation, using IDA personnel and resources, to get involved in the secondary processing of our natural resources, whether it be fish dumped on the piers, or the processing of foodstuffs, or ensuring that we get a reasonable market and employment out of our afforestation programme.  It is critical that in these areas we get our act together.  If we do not we will be devastated by imports, although in all three instances we have climatic and physical advantages which should put us in a cost competitive position from the start.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, apart from the co-operative movement, there is no relationship between the primary producers &mdash; farmers, fishermen and foresters &mdash; and the people trying to retail those goods.  Our products are not being processed or are being exported on the hoof, or fish is being dumped back in the sea.  This shows we do not have our act together in these areas.  I hope the National Development Corporation will use the State equity to combine the primary producers and processors so that we get full added value and employment potential from these sections.  I have made my views on this area known many times and I do not wish to pre-empt anything that might take place when we are dealing with the legislation in this area.  The difference between the National Development Corporation and the IDA is that one is grant incentive to private industry and the other is State equity ownership to be injected and developed, to pull out when the firm is making money or when shareholders want to get the majority share-holding, and then the money can be channelled into new industries.  The amount of money involved is not important but the National Development Corporation must be involved in businesses which are viable and they must get moving straightaway.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks in the Department of Education, particularly those dealing with career guidance, as shown in the Book of Estimates published last November and agreed by this Government, are shortsighted and the Government should review this area.  I appreciate that there <Col N="414" /> is no scope in that Department to find this money, but the Youth Employment Agency should take up the full cost of career guidance in primary education. This agency is one of the few, if not the only, State bodies with enough money to the end of this year.  That agency has pointed to the post-primary education system as part of a root cause of our employment problem, saying our educational system does not prepare young people for employment and that that might be the direction in which they could move and work in conjunction with the people at present administering the post primary education system.</P>
    <P>I do not see any allocation in this budget for a scheme similar to that in Queens University, Belfast, where they have incubator factories.  Residential State facilities should be provided for graduates, people who are unemployed, who have experience and want to do something for their country and themselves by creating wealth and employment. There could be a Start Your Own Business Centre run by the Irish Management Institute, AnCO, the IDA or some other State company.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the task force on employment.  I hope the sub-committee will not be at departmental assistant secretary level or departmental secretary level because the wheel will have to turn a great many times before it reaches the industrial level.  If a person wants to do something tangible about a task force in my county he goes to the county development team and, instead of having one individual with half a secretary in the county hall, he gets a CTT man and an IIRS man.  They provide a localised complete consultancy service on the ground. That effectively will help industry to cater for market changes and work on product development.</P>
    <P>We must look at ways of spreading the work load, whether it be lowering of the pension age or job-sharing.  The public sector must pilot such a scheme.  In any discussion on employment people in politics must be honest enough to say there is no way there will be enough jobs for everyone in the short term, and that we <Col N="415" /> must examine ways of spreading the existing work.</P>
    <P>I come now to employment protection. As I have already said, if there is one useful thing that a Dáil committee could do, it would be to examine every redundancy which has taken place in the last three years, to see if there is a common ingredient contributing to so many factories in so many areas going out of business with a consequential serious loss of jobs.  One ingredient is cost impediment but another lies in imports.  I do not close my eyes to the reality of free trade, of our involvement in the EEC, of the advantages in terms of the common agricultural policy, beef and milk exports and exports of all farm produce &mdash; the advantage of obtaining £500 million or £700 million.</P>
    <P>There are areas in which we are behind our European competitors in terms of bureaucracy, of technocratic red tape that simply prohibits exports.  I give two examples.  In my own constituency a manufacturer of ordinary household wire cables cannot export easily into Germany because all the licence application forms are in German and so many standards and regulations have to be applied that it is simply not possible.  The position regarding France is worse and Britain now has a new measure for a basic cable standard for which licences costing money have to be obtained.  You cannot sell cable on the British market unless you meet this standard.  In Ireland, people import too readily, forgetting about the Irish producer.  We will have to get our act together very quickly if we want to protect employment and must have regulations acceptable in terms of the EEC.  Technical trade barriers must be set up to prohibit our importation of unemployment on a horrendous scale. One example is the milling industry, which subject I raised recently on the Adjournment.  Unless we put VAT on flour imports at point of entry &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I dealt with the need for the Government to have a cohesive production and employment policy.  When the fine print of this budget is examined, many savage and severe cuts will be seen to affect all sectors of our economy.  There will be greater demands for extra expenditure and less taxation, which demands will be irreconcilable.  We will have to accept some very painful surgery and must govern so as to ensure that by 1985 or 1986 we will have a fundamental basis for employment creation and for opportunities for our young people.  Unless we have that, we do not deserve and cannot obtain any protection of, or increase in, living standards, because we simply will not increase our external trade, or protect our home markets sufficiently.</P>
      <P>I commend this budget to the House. In the short-term it is difficult to sell, but in the long-term it will be seen to be nothing less than barely necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very interesting to listen to the speeches of the last three contributors.  Deputy Kelly of the old school was very sincere and quite entertaining. He is not pleased to be described as a conservative, but if we are not allowed to so describe him, there is no description left for the man.  His contribution was very wide ranging and interesting from the political point of view, but it did not contribute very much towards economic thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brady was rather negative in his approach.  I agree with quite a lot of his criticisms, but examination of the Estimates submitted by the outgoing Government reduces considerably his arguments.  His remarks about the reducation in the allocation for local authority services, with which I shall deal, take on a completely different aspect.  The Fianna Fáil Estimates for local authorities allocated £43 million less than the Coalition Government.  The Deputy's argument against the Government is typical of Fianna Fáil arguments and bears out the very point which Deputy Kelly was making about the ideological similarity between the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil <Col N="417" /> Parties.  As he said, the basic difference is the old Civil War drum.  Both have approached the economy in precisely the same manner of cutting back on services and increasing taxation on precisely the same people, as always.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates pointed out how bad things are, how we have overspent and all the bad housekeeping which has resulted in the present dreadful economic situation.  He does not ask who overspent, who were the bad housekeepers, or who brought us to this situation.  Was it the ordinary citizen who works for a wage or salary, who owns no productive property, who is not involved in and who has not the facility to be involved in any wheeling and dealing and tax evasions? Did the ordinary citizen set up companies, liquidate them, set up a new company, liquidate it, buy villas in Spain or set up property companies, borrowing £30 million from the banks and then going out of business?  The ordinary citizen is not involved in any of that wasteful expenditure which has brought us into this situation and was not one of those from whom the taxes were removed when estate duties, rates and wealth tax were abolished back in 1974.</P>

      <P>I had just commenced last evening when time expired and I had said that I accepted fully the Minister of State's statement that it had not been the intention of the Government that any child would be denied the right to education because of school transport charges.  But I said also that it was a fact that there were children being denied, or about to be denied, that right, particularly in respect of secondary school education because of the imposition of these school bus charges.</P>
      <P>I should like to extend, as one woman to another and, indeed, as one friend to another, my congratulations to the Minister on her appointment.  Anything I shall say here this evening will not be directed in any personal manner to the present incumbent of that office.  Rather it will be directed to the Minister for Education and the policies now being pursued by the present Government and I know they will be accepted in that light. On a personal note, I might say that the Minister and I shared the same secondary school for some period of our lives.  In that light I should like to put it to her that we were lucky enough to receive the education we did and that there is a very great onus on us both, she in her present office and I as a very humble backbencher of the Opposition Party to put forward the educational views I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Education informed us yesterday evening &mdash; and we hear it constantly &mdash; that the imposition of the school bus charges was contained in the Book of Estimates the present Government inherited.  I should like to put the record straight in this respect and say that it was under consideration in the Book of Estimates the present Government inherited. I should like to put that fact very clearly. We published our Estimates and put <Col N="419" /> them to the electorate.  In their wisdom, or perhaps non-wisdom, as may be proved later on, the electorate chose not to accept the Fianna Fáil Party and their programme.  Instead, they chose an alternative Government.  I contend very strongly that it is now up to the Minister for Education and the Government, that it is their policy not ours.  I never heard of a party who came into power and said, &ldquo;Oh, yes, we are wearing your shirt, that is the shirt we are going to wear&rdquo;.  Surely they must don their own clothes now.  I might add also that the consideration of these Estimates has led to a considerable input by all concerned in our party, both front and back benchers, particularly from Deputies with a rural base or bias. There is no doubt that the imposition of school transport charges &mdash; and I know this will be denied strenuously by the Minister when replying &mdash; will be most definitely detrimental and discriminatory for the rural schoolgoer.</P>
    <P>We have a long tradition of education in Ireland.  I hear people say now, &ldquo;Why can Johnny and Mary not walk to school like their father or grandfather did in years gone by?&rdquo; That may be all very well but we must remember that when Johhny's or Mary's father or grandfather was going to school there were not gigantic, Euro-haul lorries scuttling along the roads of Counties Roscommon, Longford, Westmeath or, indeed on all our roads.  We are living in a far different age, in an age of speed, transport and dangers of all kinds.  It just is not possible to say, &ldquo;Let Johnny and Mary do as their father or grandfather did 20, 30 or 40 years ago&rdquo;.  Travelling to Dublin in the car one day listening to a radio programme I heard one listener ring in with this point of view.  Certainly such a proposal is not tenable in the light of modern day traffic conditions.</P>
    <P>To revert to the way these school transport charges were announced, I suppose the Minister did the right thing by taking the plunge, as she saw it, giving out the unpalatable facts straight out.  But they were announced in a very arbitrary fashion. Whether or not it was the intention of the Department of Education one cannot <Col N="420" /> say but most certainly grave misapprehension built up amongst people. They felt that the entitlement of the medical card holders' children extended to junior and senior cycles.  Perhaps it was misconstrued by those who listened to the radio or read the papers, but the impression given was that children of parents holding medical cards would travel free on the buses throughout the system. As we all know that is not so, they are not free at the junior cycle, they are free at the senior cycle.</P>
    <P>I think it was <i>The Irish Times'</i> esteemed education columnist last week who contacted Professor A. Dale Tussing in America who, as the House knows, wrote that explosive document in 1978 entitled <i>Irish Educational Expenditures</i>&mdash;<i>Past, Present and Future</i> about what we are now facing, the huge burden that education would be on the taxpayer's back, on all our backs in Ireland in the early eighties and throughout the eighties until the demographic situation sorted itself out again; until, if you like, the population bulge evened out.  He expressed himself surprised that the charges had been imposed at the junior rather than at the senior cycle.  It is just a point I throw out.  It seems like a reversed situation.  Education in Ireland is compulsory until the age of 15.  That means that most children pass on to a secondary or vocational school at the age of about 12 or 13.  According to whatever school they are attending they have then a three or four year cycle, three years to group certificate and four years to intermediate certificate.  That is the very period during which access to education should be as free as possible because it is compulsory.  I fail to see the logic, justice or equity in imposing a charge on children who, in effect, must go to school.</P>
    <P>Perhaps if you like I should declare myself here: I was a secondary school teacher and I am a parent.  None of those things makes me any way specially equipped to contribute to an education debate but perhaps it does mean that in the educational sphere I can talk about specific cases, with becoming modesty I hope, in that I know what I am talking about.  I used to teach in a rural secondary <Col N="421" /> school some three miles from Athlone, with a very large catchment area and a growing student population, now somewhat over 600 which is fairly considerable in a rural secondary school.  I have consulted the principal, vice-principal and indeed all concerned in that school on many of the things I shall say.  Therefore I know I am correct in my facts and I hope they will be accepted as such.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did say that nobody would be denied the right to education.  I have three or four cases of young people whose parents have been in touch with me and told me exactly what their household outgoings are, as well as their monetary intake.  Far from this new imposition being half the price of a packet of crisps, which was not a very appropriate comment, it is the straw which will break the back of these parents. These charges were bad enough on 23 December but they assume even graver importance in the context of the budget.  The take-home pay of most people will be affected and the increase in VAT rates will be widely felt.  It is against this background that the school transport charges must be considered.  It also appears that fees for the intermediate and leaving certificates are to be increased from £20 to £30.</P>
    <P>We have also heard with great regret of the requirement that a student must have two honours to qualify for a VEC scholarship to a regional technical college.  I have asked the CEO of the local vocational educational committee, of which I am a member, to do a survey of the students who entered Athlone RTC to ascertain how many would have been able to do so had the two honour requirement existed.  I know that at least half of them would not have qualified because they would not have obtained two honours.  I am introducing this matter to the debate even though I know it is not entirely relevant.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned these special cases and I will give the Minister the details. Unless these people received supplementary welfare benefits it would not be possible for them to pay the fees.  These are specific cases and I am sure that every Deputy could cite similar cases.  I know <Col N="422" /> we are living in times of economic pressure when everybody must tighten the belt but I submit that education is not an area where this can be done.  I know that one cannot see an immediate return from expenditure on education but in future years we will pay a heavy price if we cut back now.  There will certainly be a cutback if the school transport charges are imposed in full.</P>
    <P>It has been reported in one of the newspapers that the Minister is considering the setting up of a review body to look at the cuts in education.  If this is so, there should be a termination date in April or May, well before the start of the school holidays, so that parents will know where they stand.  These charges were announced in the middle of a school year and people have no option but to pay and to put up with the cuts in remedial teaching and in guidance counselling.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State told us that school transport was costing the State £33 million a year.  Is this money being spent to the best advantage?  Perhaps more children could benefit from school transport over wider areas.  I feel that some of the money is not used economically.  I hope that the meeting held today between the Minister of State and the association of private bus owners will have some productive outcome.</P>
    <P>I heard on television the Minister's comments at the end of the Young Fine Gael seminar in Galway last weekend. She said that no school, even with less than 500 pupils, need be without a guidance teacher.  With respect to the Minister, that is most misleading.  Of course they may have a guidance teacher but it will mean a diminution of subject choice within a school.  This cannot be good either for pupils or teachers.  People do not understand this and when they hear a statement such as that made by the Minister they immediately ask what all the fuss is about.  It can be blandly stated that there will be a guidance teacher but it will be to the detriment of another subject.</P>
    <P>There is also a popular misconception about the pupil-teacher ratio, which has now been increased from 17:1 to 19:1.  I taught for 10 or 12 years in a secondary <Col N="423" /> school and I had very few classes of fewer than 25 pupils and sometimes as many as 30.  It does not mean that every secondary teacher stands in front of 17 or 19 pupils, except perhaps in odd classes.  When one considers subjects such as honours mathematics at senior level, honours history or chemistry and subjects such as art or music, which do not have a wide clientele but which must be on the curriculum of any school aiming to give a good education, one realises that the pupil-teacher ratio is greatly expanded.</P>
    <P>There is also the misconception that teachers work only a few hours per week. Even during my public life I have never been as physically and mentally tired as I used to be at the end of a day teaching. Work does not end when a teacher goes home.  There may be scripts to correct and a teacher must do preparation and read in order to keep abreast and be in a position to inform and encourage students. Any teacher I have known has also tried to foster a relationship with students.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke of the catchment boundary facility and I was very interested because it is a very complex subject.  He stated:</P>
    <P>Catchment boundary facilities are more complex in that they arise from the conditions of the post-primary transport scheme.  For the purposes of this scheme the country is divided up into two areas, each area being served by its own adequate post-primary centre.</P>
    <P>To many Members catchment boundary facilities will not mean anything but it means a lot to me because the school I was involved in has a large pupil intake who are now being described as catchment boundary facility pupils.  They did not know they would be described as such until they discovered they had to pay £10 on top of the £14.  They cannot change school in midstream.  They cannot run away from Summerhill College and go back to Ballyforan or Roscommon or wherever they should be.  They are attending that school because there may be an affinity towards it.  It is not quite <Col N="424" /> the same boundary as a primary school and the Minister of State acknowledged that in his contribution.  It is a more complex situation.  I hope the Minister will comment on the catchment boundary facilities and tell the House that it is her intention to review this.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the House that Summerhill College in Athlone, if all the pupils opt to go to their own boundary, will lose 70 pupils next September.  We cannot ask girls aged between 14 and 17 to leave a secondary school in which they have built up a rapport with their teachers and made friends with fellow students.  It would be wrong to ask such a pupil to change midstream.  I am proud to be a member of a party that has been associated with many steps forward in education. The late Donogh O'Malley introduced free school transport and following that we had the setting up of the RTCs. I had the honour of serving as chairperson of the board of management of a regional technical college for some years and I am aware of how well they serve areas.  They fill a great industrial, commercial and social need for adjoining countries.  I was proud to have been associated with that venture by Fianna Fáil. We also had the growth of education in the seventies but the two steps that raised most ire among parents, teachers and students were introduced by Coalition Governments.  The proposal to reduce the school entry age was introduced by Deputy John Boland and now the cutbacks&mdash;in particular the school transport charges &mdash; are being introduced by Deputy Hussey.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I were the recipients of a very fine education.  We were lucky but I do not think we can deprive anybody of education.  Regardless of economic circumstances I do not think we have the right as legislators, as people representing people, to deprive any young boys or girls of an education.  I was struck some weeks ago when reading in the business section of <i>The Sunday Times</i> an article by the business editor about a visit he made to Dublin.  He dealt with our economic situation and in referring to a walk he took down O'Connell Street he said he was struck by the number of <Col N="425" /> young people who were lively, forward looking and trustful.  He said their faces were alive, bright and sharp.  I submit they are that way mainly because they have been educated, they have seen, tasted, learned and read and been able to absorb all that education gives.  The people we will knock out of education by introducing transport charges are those who should not be knocked out, the people who will become the drop-outs. Many girls will leave secondary school because of that transport charge.  It is possible that the environment at home may not be helpful to them continuing in education.  In April or September they will say to their mothers that they will not go back to school.  Their mothers will say that it is all right if they do not go back.  Those girls will be deprived of what would be an enormous advantage to them in later life.</P>
    <P>We cannot quantify this.  We cannot say that girls would get a job if they had the leaving certificate but we can say that if they were educated they would have the inner resources to cope later.  They would have a command of themselves to cope and would have learned of social graces and behaviour and everything that will gear them to cope with the demands and vicissitudes that will come later in life.  I know many pupils who were not promising academically, who would not get As and Bs &mdash; what do they mean when we add up everything in life &mdash; but because they were educated to leaving certificate standard they left school with an inner resourcefulness that enabled them later in life to cope with the harsh realities they had to face.  I did not mean to go on for so long but I got carried away.  Education is my subject and I was involved in it all my life.  What I have said has not been said in rancour but in the guise of offering advice.  I plead with the Minister to review the cuts in education particularly in regard to school transport, guidance counsellors and remedial teachers, and see if it is possible to get money to keep the services as they are.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to a mention by Deputy O'Rourke of the existence of a review body to, according to her, review the cuts in education.  It is necessary to make clear that the review body which I referred to is a committee which will examine exceptional circumstances of an individual school.  The review body will examine circumstances where, for example, there might be a loss of teachers with a particular combination of subjects that might occur at the same time.</P>
      <P>The debate furnishes us with an opportunity to set out the reasons and clarify the situation in respect of the decision taken by the previous Government and subsequently confirmed, subject to some modification, by this Government.  It is not inappropriate also that discussion of the various issues involved should take place during the period when the economic and financial state of the nation is being reviewed in the context of the measures introduced in connection with the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to introduce a charge in respect of school transport was not taken in consideration of particular features of the operation of a system in isolation from, or without regard to, the overall general state of available financial resources.  The reduction of £5.4 million in the estimate of cost in 1983 of operating the school transport service was one of the measures taken to enable total expenditure to be kept within the limits of the provision contained in the volume of the Estimates for Public Services published on 18 November 1982.  I do not believe that Members of Fianna Fáil can claim that they were not aware of the fact that a charge was being introduced in respect of school transport.  Members of that party when in Government made the <Col N="427" /> decision, and it would not be unreasonable to assume that some measure of consultation and information took place with the general body of Deputies and Senators.</P>

      <P>I am quoting now from the statement of 18 November 1982 issued to the press by the Minister for Education, Deputy Brady:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be no charge introduced for pupils of national schools eligible for free transport in accordance with the school transport regulations.  The cost of the scheme for primary and post-primary schools has, however, been growing to such an extent that measures need to be taken in regard to it.  Since no alteration is contemplated on the range of the service, the measures required to control cost must involve the introduction of a charge in the case of second level school pupils. Consideration is being given to the question of the arrangements to be <Col N="428" /> made for the implementation of such charge.  It is contemplated that such arrangements would take the form of the issue of a season ticket, that there would be a lower rate for junior pupils and that a concession would be made to take account of the circumstances of members of larger families.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gerard Brady is an honest and decent man who would say what he meant and mean what he said.  He would not indulge in the tactic of subsequently attempting to run away from a decision which he had announced or, to use Deputy Byrne's observation, &ldquo;play politics with the children of Ireland&rdquo;.  Deputy Brady did not say, as Deputy Byrne sought to imply, that consideration was being given to the question of the introduction of a charge for school transport. What he did say is as follows, and it is necessary to make the point:</P>
    <P>Since no alteration is contemplated on the range of the service, the measures required to control cost must involve the introduction of a charge in the case of second level pupils.</P>
    <P>He said also, that consideration was being given to the question of the arrangements to be made for the implementation of such charge.  There were details to be worked out &mdash; as I fully realise from my own subsequent experience &mdash; some of them in consultation with CIE, which could not be finalised at that stage.  However, consideration of the arrangements had advanced to the stage where Deputy Brady could say that it was contemplated that such arrangements would take the form of the issue of a season ticket, that there would be a lower rate for junior pupils and that a concession would be made to take account of the circumstances of members of larger families.</P>

      <P>I hope I will be given injury time.  May I say at this point that I take full responsibility for my Government's and my own actions, not alone in relation to the introduction of the school transport charge, but also in relation to the other measures to which Deputy Byrne referred last evening, but I also insist that Fianna Fáil should acknowledge their decisions in relation to these matters.  I intend to ensure that they are obliged to, despite Deputy Byrne's efforts to remain in culpable ignorance of the facts.</P>
      <P>Subject to the modification that school transport would continue to be provided free for pupils in the senior cycle whose parents or legal guardians are holders of a medical card, the present Government in consideration of all relevant factors decided to confirm the decision of the previous Government to make a charge in respect of the school transport service.</P>
      <P>What were the relevant factors which induced, or obliged, the present Government to confirm the decision of the previous administration?  The overriding consideration to which all decisions had to be subordinated was the necessity to recognise that there was a definite limit to the available financial resources for the public services in 1983 and that this limit necessitated a restriction being placed on the amount of the provision which could be made for those services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Education I had to consider whether there were alternative measures which could be taken to achieve the level of savings in relation to estimated expenditure in the education group of votes and decided upon by the previous administration.  For ease of reference I would draw the attention of the <Col N="430" /> Deputies to the series of measures set out in column (1) of pages 6 and 7 of the document, <i>Principal Features of Budget.</i></P>
    <P>It will be noted that the two major items of savings were £5.4 million in respect of the school transport service and £4.2 million as a result of adjustments in school staffing.  Deputies cannot have it every way.  If they wish to criticise, or disown, the action taken by the previous and present administrations in respect of the decision to introduce a charge for school transport, what alternative measures do they propose to put in its place? Are they suggesting further adjustments in the staffing of second level schools, including the loss of employment for existing teachers, a disimprovement of the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools, a restriction of the scope of the school transport services at primary and post-primary level?  Or have they some proposals not yet divulged which will surprise us all for their ease of implementation and the readiness with which they would be accepted?  If they have such ready solutions to hand, I only wish they had come forward with them at an earlier date, but now perhaps better late than never.</P>
    <P>The charge for pupils of the junior cycle is approximately £1 per week.  The actual cost of providing the service is many times greater than that.  The range of the service is comprehensive.  It is available for pupils whose place of residence is three miles or more from the post-primary centre serving the area in which they live and it is availed of by pupils whose parents would have no difficulty in providing transport otherwise for them, as well as by pupils whose parents are not so well off.  At £1 per week it is good value for money for those availing themselves of it no matter from what standpoint it may be assessed.</P>
    <P>It was introduced as a feature of the measures for the extended provision of post-primary education and was supported wholeheartedly by successive administrations in the seventies.  In some respects it is apposite that, when it is now found to be necessary to introduce a charge to enable the service to be maintained on the same comprehensive range <Col N="431" /> as previously, both the former administrations and the present administrations should have been involved in the decision to introduce the charge.</P>
    <P>The provision in subhead D3 of Vote 28 in the published volume of the Estimates for Public Services for 1983 is £28,550,000.  For the purpose of the categorising of expenditure it is classified as non-pay.  It represents a very considerable charge among those items of expenditure in the education group of Votes which represent the outlay for support and maintenance of the school system other than for payment of the salaries of teachers.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of comparison it may be noted that the provision for the grant in lieu of tuition fees payable to secondary schools is £6,530,000 and capitation grants to primary schools, £10,400,000. The provision for the school transport service has increased from just over £5 million in the financial year 1973-74 to £13½ million in 1978 and to £28½ million in 1983 after the introduction of the charge is taken into account.</P>
    <P>It was perhaps inevitable that the time would come when stock of the situation would have to be taken and the present economic and financial difficulties have only brought about such a need sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Given the necessity for a reduction of public expenditure on school transport and of the order indicated, the options open to either administration, previous or present, were very limited.  In effect, they reduce to two: either seriously restricting the service, or securing a contribution towards the cost of its operation from those who avail of it.  This is not the first time the growing costs of school transport have had to come under scrutiny. On 12 May 1980 a series of measures to curtail the school transport service were issued by the Department of Education with the approval of the then Government.</P>
    <P>These measures involved changes in the age-distance regulations governing eligibility for school transport and increases in the numbers of eligible children required to justify the establishment <Col N="432" /> or maintenance of a service.  In the event, these measures were withdrawn, not because the financial necessity for their introduction had disappeared, but because it was made clear to the Government of the time that savings in school transport made in this way, that is by seriously restricting the service, were not acceptable.  All the evidence available to my Department.  from representations, Dáil Questions, deputations etc., clearly indicates the high value rural people, in particular, place on this service, not only as a convenience but as an essential means of access to education.  The definite policy of the Government is to maintain the services in its present form as far as it is possible to do so, and the introduction of charges is seen as a means by which this policy can be given effect.</P>
    <P>The choice made by the Government is irrevocable and I must affirm that there can be no going back on the decision taken regarding the introduction of charges and that by delaying, deferring and otherwise obstructing the implementation of the new measures, they are merely endangering the service they all so avidly wish to retain.  I must emphasise as well that the measures taken are of general application and do not allow for the opting out of special interest groups of any description, with the exception of the handicapped, which were excluded in the calculation of the revenue required to meet the shortfall in the operational costs of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In reaffirming the measures taken with regard to the introduction of charges, I am not excluding the possibility of review of the school transport service.  Indeed, such a review was specifically requested by the Government and as the Minister of State, Deputy Creed, mentioned last evening, the initial steps of this review have already been taken.  When the review is completed the Government will not hesitate to bring about the changes that are seen as feasible and desirable. Until then, however, there can be no question but that the current arrangements stand.  The alternative, one which would certainly not be wished by me and one which I am sure would not be wished by the proposers of the motion, would be <Col N="433" /> a breakdown or serious curtailment of the service we are all anxious to retain. An aspect of the review of particular concern to me and to the Government is the age of the school transport fleet and the inevitability, in the years ahead, of having to replace this fleet on a phased basis.  The capital implications of such replacement are very serious indeed, and a decision to commit capital sums of the order required cannot be taken without a thorough examination of school transport, in the context of surface transport generally.  The review requested by the Government is, therefore, of the highest urgency.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal in detail with the points raised by the Deputies in this debate.  Many of them were a reiteration of the facts concerning the history of the school transport system and the regulations governing it.  A substantial number dealt with matters, which, though vital to education, had little direct relevance to school transport.  And yet a number dealt with issues which do not arise in connection with the new school transport measures.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to put the question of the cost of school transport in the context of education costs generally and it is in this connection the introduction of modest charges in respect of transport must be seen.  Given the overall financial context within which I, as Minister for Education, have to work, I am satisfied that the cutback in the total provision for education was no more severe than it had to be and that the Government had special regard to the needs of education in allocating to it a total sum of some £900 million for 1983, during a period of unparallelled economic and financial difficulty. My task as Minister for Education was to spread any shortfalls in as sensitive a way as possible and I have no hesitation in stating that I did this in accordance with my priorities.  The fact that these priorities were in broad agreement with those of the previous administration is neither here nor there.  Expressed in compact terms, what they amount to in this situation is that the fundamental importance of primary education must be recognised, that the fabric, quality and <Col N="434" /> accessibility of post primary education must be retained and that there is, at the end of the day, little to be gained by having an elaborate and free school transport service transporting children to inadequate schools to receive an inadequate education.  In all the circumstances, I consider that the modest school transport charge is a small price to pay to preserve and protect more fundamental aspects of the education service and I am confident that no child need suffer educationally as a result of these charges.</P>
    <P>All through last evening and again this evening I listened with care and attention to the points made by the proposers of this motion.  I might be justified in asking where have they been these last few months.  Clearly they have been out of touch with the debate concerning the financial state of the country.  They may not have read <i>The Way Forward</i>, for which they can be forgiven, but it is hard to imagine that they gave the Book of Estimates for the Public Services, 1983, published by Fianna Fáil when in office, equally cavalier treatment.  Or maybe they treat the Book of Estimates as a work of fiction, a mere statement of intent, to be adapted and adjusted to subsequent profligacy by fracturing the various expenditure lists into smidiríní and carrying out running repairs by frequent recourse to the Dáil for Supplementary Estimates.  Indeed, one could be forgiven for thinking that this is the case. Whatever excuse there is for back-bench Deputies not realising the significance of a Book of Estimates, the same cannot be applied to a member of the previous Cabinet and a former Minister for Education at that, Deputy John Wilson, who intervened in this debate to suggest that we should have demanded more money for the school transport service.  Did he intervene in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet when a sum of money of £28.2 million was being allocated to this service as against an estimated requirement of £33.6 million or had he lost interest in educational matters at that stage and left it to his colleague, Deputy Gerard Brady, to defend this inadequate provision?</P>
    <P>
      <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> Let us make no mistake about the facts.  The insertion of £28.3 million into subhead D.3, Vote 28, Office of the Minister for Education, for the running costs of the school transport service, was quite unambiguous as was the statement issued by the then Minister for Education on 18 November 1982.  There was no question but that this estimate predicated changes in the operation of the school transport service either by restricting the service or by introducing charges.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for me also to put some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who proposed this motion into the picture.  Their party, when in office, aimed to reduce the current budget deficit for 1983 to £750 million.  A significant proportion of this trimming of the current budget deficit was to be made by pruning expenditure on public services.  Such trimming involved cuts in services and/or introduction of charges over practically all State services.  The Coalition accepted this approach but moderated its severity by accepting a slower rate of reduction of the current budget deficit.</P>

      <P>Perhaps in time and to the extent that they have not already done so the Deputies who now object to charges for school transport or their colleagues in opposition, will successively object to any cuts in Health, Social Welfare, Agriculture, Environment and so on, and will be equally vocal in their opposition to any measures to increase revenue to pay for the services, to the curtailment of which they object.  Or maybe what we are witnessing in this debate is the last hiccup of free-spending Fianna Fáil, the party with no thought for tomorrow, the party which through its profligacy has saddled the population of Ireland, young and old, with an intolerable burden of debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no departure from the hard facts of life.  We can have only what we can afford.  In facing these facts in an overall budgetary strategy, cutbacks <Col N="436" /> were not only necessary, but inevitable and within that context it is unreasonable to expect that education could escape scot-free.  I am fully confident that by taking these measures we will protect the existence of the school transport system which I believe parents are very anxious to retain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion so ably proposed by Deputy Byrne.  First, as other speakers have done, I congratulate the Minister for Education and the Minister of State to whom I make many representations because of the problems of school transport.  I hope that the Minister of State in particular will be as sympathetic as was his predecessor in trying to solve some of the problems relating to school transport particularly in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very disappointed the Minister spent so much of her time attacking Fianna Fáil.  Surely she must realise that as Minister she must accept responsibility for the drastic cutbacks that were announced in December and in the recent budget.  She announced those serious cutbacks before Christmas without any consultation with teaching organisations or parents' associations or even with her own parliamentary party.  Yet she and her Minister of State have come to this House and have attacked Fianna Fáil for the cutbacks.  The imposition of charges for school transport was the most hurtful blow of all, particularly to the rural community and that is why so many rural Deputies on this side of the House put their names to the motion and contributed to the debate.  The Minister <Col N="438" /> has put the clock back in rural Ireland to the time when schooling was a system of class bias.  The progress made by Fianna Fáil during the years since the late Donogh O'Malley introduced free education has now been halted and the comprehensive system that we built up is being dismantled by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I was sad to hear that there is an overall cutback of £22.5 million.  The Minister told us that £5.4 million would have to be found in addition to the allocation she made for school transport.  I was disappointed last night to hear the Minister of State say he would not accept that any child could be denied the right to education because of these charges.  Let us remember that we are talking about a charge of £14 in junior cycle, £24 in senior cycle if the family have not a medical card and also a charge of £24 throughout the entire second level education for a child who lives outside the catchment boundary. That is an important point in rural Ireland where catchment boundaries are badly in need of review.</P>
    <P>I am a national school teacher and I say we must not lose sight of the fact that the concessionary fare for children in national school has been increased from £3.50 to £10.  This is something about which the Minister and the Minister of State have said very little.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not stand up in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Rourke said, children will not change schools in order to go to a school within their catchment boundary.  Those of us involved in education know that if a child starts in a school on an educational course he or she will stay with the school and it is only proper that this should be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We drew attention to the difficulties for parents who have to find the additional money.  The matter of school transport charges cannot be taken in isolation. The total cuts of £22.5 million are interlinked and the cumulative results do not seem to be appreciated by this Minister. The transport fees are one part of the problem but the Minister has also changed the pupil-teacher ratio in the <Col N="439" /> vocational sector.  In that sector it is 19 to one and in other second level schools it is 20 to one.  This will have serious repercussions not only for the teachers because undoubtedly some of them will lose their jobs but it will also mean larger classes and this will affect remedial pupils.  There will also be a more restricted choice of subjects.</P>
    <P>I give the example of a school in my constituency with 400 students.  It has 24 teachers and a career guidance teacher who is ex-quota but because of the cuts announced by the Minister the school will lose two teachers.  This is because the Minister has said that a school with fewer than 500 pupils cannot have a career guidance teacher ex-quota.  In all cases those schools will lose at least one teacher.  I ask the Minister to consider how such a school can organise a curriculum and deal with practical subjects such as woodwork, building construction and technical drawing.  One teacher could not possibly deal with all those subjects.</P>
    <P>I should like to take up the point mentioned by Deputy O'Rourke regarding career guidance teachers.  The Minister made a statement recently in Galway that &ldquo;Of course we are not doing away with career guidance&rdquo;.  If the career guidance teacher is inside the quota that teacher will be asked to devote time to counselling and preparation, and of course only minimal time can be so devoted by that teacher, as well as teaching the normal subjects.  It is almost like asking a career guidance teacher if he would prefer to be shot with a single-barrel or double-barrel gun.  That is the choice being given to a career guidance teacher and to a school.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for the slight digression.  I will go back to transport fees.  The problem starts with the child who is a slow learner or in need of remedial attention.  I fear that that child's parents will ask why they should waste their hard-earned money on sending their child to school if the child is to be stuck in a class of increased size or the subjects are more limited than they were.  We heard an example last night from the Minister of State as to the cost for what he called a 13-year cycle in primary <Col N="440" /> and post-primary school.  He said, &ldquo;For a single child in a less well off family the charge for school transport over the entire 13-year cycle of primary and post-primary education is £126, less than £10 per school year, about 28p per school week or approximately half the price of a packet of potato crisps per school day&rdquo;. I notice tonight that the Minister has raised that fee from 28p to £1 a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Very conveniently the Minister has taken a 13-year cycle where the child will travel free in the primary sector, will have to pay for three years in the junior cycle and, the Minister of State claimed, will be free in the senior cycle. Averages can be dealt with very conveniently and you can arrive at 28p per school week as a total transport fee for that child.  I would like to give the Minister some different figures.  We are told that every parent will have to pay for children in the junior cycle and the transport fee for three years would be £126.  The intermediate certificate examination fee has gone up to £30 for 1984.  It was only £15 in 1982 and it is £20 this year.  Similarly for senior cycle students studying for the leaving certificate the fee for two years' transport will be £144 with examination fee again £30.  Of course, there are other miscellaneous expenses referred to by Deputy Byrne last night.  Parents must make voluntary contributions to the schools and have to meet other expenses to educate their children.  The fees we are talking about are much more complex than the very convenient figures that have been given by the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I was making was that we will, of course, have increased class sizes and a smaller choice of subjects. Also we must consider what will happen <Col N="441" /> if further students fall off in attendance at school.  We may then have even lower staff levels, larger classes and fewer subject options.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not take into consideration the problem of distance from school and the remoteness and isolation of parts of rural Ireland when she announced those cutbacks.  Also a situation peculiar to co-educational schools has not been looked at.  In my constituency the majority of schools are in that category.  Many schools have traditional boys' subjects in boys' schools and girls' subjects in girls' schools.  The Minister might not like to know that that situation still obtains.  A co-educational school must have a full range of subjects and obviously the strain on the staffing and resources of such schools will be greater than in the case of all boys' or all girls' schools.  The important point here is that all these schools have the same quota.</P>
    <P>In announcing these cutbacks, starting with those related to transport then the question of the pupil-teacher ratio and the decision about career guidance, the Minister is doing irreparable damage to the teaching profession and to the educational system.  I did not come in here tonight just to talk about teachers as I happen to be a teacher, but the Minister is demoralising teachers in the profession. The net effect is that she is saving money certainly but at a terrible price. That price is a total upheavel of the entire school system.  We have the youngest population in Europe.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister of State mention last night that he was going to meet a private bus owners' association who have expressed an interest in participating more in the school transport scheme.  The Minister of State said last night that they are very involved already in the transport scheme but they claim &mdash; and should be given an opportunity to prove &mdash; that they can transport children to our various schools at less cost than it takes CIE and the Department of Education to transport them.  I was interested also in an article I read concerning CIE buses in which CIE stated that they have almost 900 buses in the school transport scheme most of which are due for <Col N="442" /> replacement between 1984 and 1986. They estimated the cost of replacing these buses at today's prices as in the region of £30 million.  Obviously, the whole question of school transport must be looked at.  I am glad that in our document <i>The Way Forward</i> we said that we would look at an economic way of providing school transport for our children.</P>
    <P>Let me return to the most disppointing aspect of this debate which is that the Minister of State last night and the Minister for Education here tonight have not seen the obvious problem for families who will not be able to pay these transport fees.  The Minister asked us on this side for some advice and how we could help in this.  Deputy O'Rourke, who is a teacher, said that she knew of families who could not pay the school transport charges.  I also know of families in that position.  It struck me that the Minister could do with some local knowledge as to how families can cope with these problems. For example, school principals would surely be able to tell the Department which families would not be able to pay the fees.  The local community welfare officers would know the people who are in dire financial straits because those officers are paying welfare allowances to many who are in difficulty and also they investigate the applications for medical cards which seem to be the criterion for deciding whether students in senior cycles will have free transport.  It is sad when the compulsory age for attending school has been raised to 15 and at the same time the Minister comes along and puts a charge on children in the junior cycle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it legal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question.  Children are bound by law to go to school but the Minister for Education tells the parents of those children that they will have to pay for that service.  I believe the parents of those children who are in such difficulty have a constitutional case.  I could not see, when the idea of a medical card was brought in, why it could not be extended to include the children of all parents from first year to leaving certificate <Col N="443" /> year in our second level schools.  That was brushed aside last night by the Minister of State and he would not consider at all the extension of medical cards.</P>
      <P>There are other factors which relate more to the recent budget than to the education cutbacks.  The Minister is aware that the social welfare benefits in budget are not adequate.  They are in the region of 10 per cent for short-term benefits and 12 per cent for long-term benefits. This means that a man who is unemployed gets a miserly 10 per cent which is not even enough to keep pace with the cost of living.  If that particular man can find the money to send his children to second level school he will have to pay for that.  An increase in the children's allowance was always a feature of the budget until this year.  This is the first time, as far as I know, there was not an increase in children's allowances.  A decent increase in this allowance would help a family in financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Minister is imposing the school bus charges on less well off families whose real incomes are falling and will continue to fall if this Government stay in power.  The Minister, just like the Government's strategy in the budget, is again discriminating against poor people. A recent publication by the ASTI on the campaign against the education cuts states what the Coalition Government promised before the budget and in relation to school transport states that the scheme in general should be free.  I am amazed, if the scheme in general should be free, how the Minister for Education can come in here and will not accept that a child will be denied the right to education because of the imposition of these school bus charges.  I am very disappointed at the attitude of the Minister and of the Minister of State in relation to this motion.  They should have accepted it.  The people in the Fine Gael and Labour Parties should have ensured that children would not be denied the right to education.  Unfortunately, we have had a very disappointing response from the Government benches.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity of summarising the debate.  I would like to thank all those who contributed to the debate on the motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to ensure that no child is denied the right to education because of the imposition of school bus charges.</P>
      <P>Those from this side of the House who made contributions stuck rigidly to the sentiments of the motion as did The Workers' Party representative, Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla.  The points made were clear, concise, practical and very much in line with the thinking behind the motion whereas the speakers from the other side of the House wandered aimlessly from the motion.  As far as I can see they tried to use up their time rather than defend the situation which they have caused, where numerous children will be denied the right to education because of their parents' inability to pay the transport charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I clearly outlined in my opening remarks, and I would now like to repeat, that the services which have always been free of charge will now have to be paid for at the following rates: pupils up to intermediate certificate level, £42 per year; senior cycle pupils, £72 per year; children of medical card holders exempt at senior cycle level only.  Up to 100,000 pupils will have to pay those extra charges.  A family may have to face an annual bill of £150 in school transport charges alone.  Special fares for pupils not eligible for free transport are being increased to the following rates: primary pupils from £10.50 to £30 per year; post-primary pupils from £10.50 to £72 per year.  Ordinary city school tranport charges for post-primary schools are also being increased from 10p to 20p for a single journey.  It is self-evident that these charges will be particularly damaging in <Col N="445" /> rural areas and large families will be severely affected.</P>
    <P>Like the other speakers last night and tonight I have received from many people telephone calls, letters, calls to my home and office telling me that they cannot afford to send their children to secondary schools.  The number involved will be 14,000 pupils and I have not heard this figure refuted.  How will the Minister accommodate those 14,000 children who, because of their parents' means, cannot afford to go to school?  We have had 15 years of free education.  Are we now to take a step back to the situation where only the well off can afford to send their children to school?  There are now almost 200,000 people unemployed.  How many of those families will be able to send their children to school?  This question has not been answered.</P>
    <P>What is to happen to all those children who find themselves with little to do? There are many in the country who still believe in the old adage that the devil finds work for idle hands.  It is very likely that some of those children will end up in court at a very young age.  Does the Minister realise what she is doing by denying them the right to go to school?  Why should the Minister's children have the right to education while children of some unemployed parents in rural areas cannot? This is blatant discrimination.  It is a mystery to me how the Minister can countenance such a move, how she could, with one stroke of a pen, put the livelihood of so many young people in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>We all know that the leaving certificate is a very necessary element in any job qualifications.  The Minister should not tell me that this is not the case.  I have met many people who cannot afford to go to school and I have also heard this from many Deputies around the House. My county colleague from the Minister's side of the House said the very same thing today.  He told the House that the cuts were shortsighted.  The children I am talking about will now be out on the roads with nothing to do at 12 years of age. Children are obliged to remain at school until they reach the age of 15 but because of these transport charges many will now <Col N="446" /> have to leave school at 12.  Last evening I asked, and I repeat the question now, what these children are expected to do. We now have the situation in which to be poor is to be against the law because the children through no fault of their own will be breaking the law by having to leave school early.  We all know of the growth in the incidence of crime.  It is obvious that that growth parallels the growing levels of unemployment but can we not expect even greater levels of crime in the future as a result of children having to leave school at such a young age, children whose parents are likely to be unemployed? What can we expect of these children later in their teens?  The imposition of school bus charges must be the worst blow to education since the foundation of the State.  The Coalition are solely responsible for this situation.</P>

      <P>The Coalition are in power now and blaming Fianna Fáil is no defence whatever.  When will the people opposite realise that they are not in Opposition?</P>
      <P>On 7 January this year Deputy Gerard Brady said, and his statement has not been refuted that I know of, that the proposals in respect of the Fianna Fáil cutbacks were presented openly and were put before the electorate without equivocation. He went on to say that the abrupt manner in which the Coalition announced their cutbacks was at variance with the common practice of consultation with the groups most immediately involved, the teachers and the parents. Let us compare the activity of the former Government in this respect with the behaviour of the present Government. While we presented openly our proposals before the election, the Coalition parties said, as Deputy Kitt has reminded us, that the school transport system in general should be free, that the pupil-teacher ratio would be improved, that career guidance should be extended.  None of these promises has been fulfilled. Instead, the people were misled in the worst way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil introduced free education <Col N="447" /> in 1967 and that included free school transport.  Since then every child has had the opportunity of being educated whereas up to 1967 only those who were well off could afford to educate their children.  The remainder left school at 14. Employment and society were geared then to meet that situation but now there is an entirely new situation in which employment is geared for children not younger than 16.  Consequently, we must readjust in order to cater for those who will be leaving school at 12.</P>
    <P>The new charges do not apply only to those living in rural areas.  City bus fares have increased by 100 per cent.  Should the Minister not have consulted with the various interests in education with a view to working out the economics of the situation and avoid having to interfere with the curriculum or imposing hardship on families who are already hard pressed?  I accept fully that economies must be made but surely other avenues should have been explored before deciding to drop the guillotine on those young and innocent necks.  I appeal to the Government to continue the free school transport system so as not to interfere with the right of children to education.</P>
    <P>The Government White Paper on education which was published in December 1980 referred to the free school transport scheme as having been conceived as an adjunct to the policy of free second-level education so as to ensure equality of access to educational opportunity irrespective of the child's place of residence.  But panic, ignorance and thoughtlessness have now changed all that.</P>
    <P>In a statement issued by the Minister on 11 January of this year she said she was not satisfied that there was any substance in the view expressed that the revised transport arrangements would affect the viability of rural schools.  She went on to say that these schools would continue to be attended by pupils of the areas they served.  I refute that statement in total because, as the Minister knows well, children will not be able to continue at school because of the transport charges.  In a press release of 23 December <Col N="448" /> 1982 the Minister said that no charge would be introduced for national school pupils eligible for free transport and that in the case of pupils at second-level schools the arrangements would involve the issue of a season ticket at a lower rate for junior cycle pupils.  She said also in that statement that it was proposed to introduce a concession that would take account of the circumstances of larger families.  I should like very much to hear about this concession but in my exhaustive research I have not been able to find any trace of it.</P>
    <P>In a joint report issued by the ASTI, the TUI and the INTO, there is reference to the Minister saying that she wants to reform the curriculum in schools and to introduce more practical and technical subjects.  Again, I should like to hear how that will be possible in terms of the present proposals.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Government to listen to the views of parents, teachers, pupils and the various unions and organisations concerned as well as the views of Fianna Fáil and The Workers' Party Deputies and, I suspect, some Fine Gael and Labour Deputies also in regard to the dropping of this proposal.  I appeal to all Members of the House to support the motion.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the salient points of this whole issue are as follows: 14,000 children each year will not be able to avail of second-level education; there will be fewer teachers in schools resulting in bigger classes; there will be a decline in the education system; specialist subjects are on the way out with less chance for the pupils most in need but worst of all children will be denied the right to education. I am appealing particularly to the Labour Party for their support.  The Government's status will not be changed by losing the vote this evening.  Labour Deputies must be feeling the brunt of this proposal.  They have the opportunity now of letting their supporters see that they care.  I appeal to the Minister, to her great maternal instinct, to extend to every child the right to education.  A vote for this motion is a vote of confidence in the future.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dumping of Nuclear Waste.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the generous manner in which he facilitated me in bringing this important issue before the House.  This is the first opportunity I have had to raise on the Adjournment so serious a matter and I appreciate the difficulty involved. My purpose is to establish the instructions given to the Irish Delegation to the London dumping conference on the attitude they should adopt in relation to the dumping of radioactive waste at sea. With no disrespect to Minister Collins, I am disappointed that the Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment is not involved in this conference.  It is symptomatic of the difficulties of our Government Departments in co-ordinating our position on nuclear dumping at sea that the Minister is here and not at the London dumping convention, where we should appropriately have a ministerial presence.</P>
      <P>I refer to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of February 15 1983, in which the writer draws attention to Ireland's poor record on nuclear dumping and to the documentation supplied to all Members of this House's hoped-for Clean Seas Committee. Each year, thousand of tonnes of radioactive waste are dumped in the Atlantic 380 miles south-west of Ireland, 90 per cent of which comes from Britain, with smaller amounts coming from other European countries.  Grave concern has been expressed by responsible environmental bodies that the Minister has accepted uncritically the advice of the Nuclear Energy Board.  Concern has also been expressed that the Nuclear Energy Board are accepting, in the same uncritical manner, advice from the British nuclear industry, despite evidence which clearly points out the dangers of this nuclear dumping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the only marine nuclear dump site is that 380 miles south west of Ireland which has been in use since 1967 and to date over 145 tonnes have been dumped there.  Britain is believed to be anxious to expand its dumping programme <Col N="453" /> significantly in the future.  Many of its nuclear reactors are nearing the end of their operating lives and large quantities of radioactive steel and concrete will need to be disposed of.  At the London dumping convention this week a considerable lobby, including Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Canada, have indicated that they will support the amendment to ban all nuclear waste dumping at sea.  I agree with those who say that we, as a nation, have absolutely nothing to gain from this waste dumping, other than a threat to our health and to our environment.  However, in spite of this, our position to date has been one of acceptance and passive support of this dumping.  To date, the NEB have endorsed the dumping programme on the basis that no proven damage to marine or human life has been ascertained.  However, no monitoring of the dump site was undertaken until 1981 and so far no results are known, or are likely to be known until at least next year.  Contrary to popular belief, the waste containers are not sealed but are designed to allow sea water to enter them, thus furthering contamination of the sea bed and the sea life around them.</P>
    <P>In view of the lack of adequate evidence guaranteeing the safety of the dumping, it is imperative that this dumping be discontinued.  A summary of the environmental case against sea dumping contained in a report entitled <i>Sea Dumping of Nuclear Waste and its Effects on Ireland</i> was, I understand, submitted to the NEB in July of last year, with an invitation to comment.  However, so far they have received none, nor has the summary been refuted.  There is growing opposition from local authorities to dumping.  So far more than 40 local authorities have passed resolutions against the practice and called for Government action.  Already there is evidence that the Irish Sea is seriously affected by radioactive dumping. Recently the Department of Physics at UCD pointed out in a report that the Irish Sea is the most radioactive in the world as a result of Windscale dumping in Cumbria.  That is a very serious position and something of which the Minister <Col N="454" /> should be aware.</P>
    <P>Therefore the questions I should like to pose to the Minister are as follows: Is the Minister satisfied with the information he is receiving from the Nuclear Energy Board and does he accept that it is a balanced view in the light of other European countries, such as Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Spain and Italy and the position they have taken?  Have reports of our observers on nuclear dumping been made available to the Minister and his staff, or to any of the Government Departments responsible for this by the NEB?  Can the Minister indicate the degree of pollution affecting the Irish Sea from the Windscale nuclear reprocessing plant at Cumbria and what is being done by his Department or the Government generally to monitor and ensure that we have a say in what is happening there?  Can the Minister indicate the degree of pollution caused by the dumping off the north west coast of this country?  Can the Minister indicate what studies have been carried out when the barrels which are dumped 380 miles north west of this country rest at the bottom of the sea over a period of time?  Are observer reports on nuclear dumping in the Irish Sea available to the Minister?</P>
    <P>Finally, in view of the seriousness of this issue, will the Minister now undertake to ensure that decisions on nuclear dumping, such as those I have referred to, are monitored closely by him and other Government agencies responsible and arrange from time to time for the information made available to him to be placed in the Oireachtas Library for the perusal of Members?  Will the Minister indicate why he or another Government Minister did not attend the London dumping conference?</P>
    <P>I consider this issue to be one of the most serious.  The dumping site north west of Ireland is the only &mdash; and I want to stress this &mdash; sea dumping site in the world.  There is at present controversy in Japan where there are 235,000 barrels stored on land.  They are anxious to dump them in the Pacific but there is opposition from the Pacific islands and countries that would be affected by it.</P>
    <P>I might point out also that America <Col N="455" /> ended their dumping practice in 1972. Despite very serious in-depth research into the question of nuclear dumping at sea they have not resumed the practice. I understand from sources in the American Embassy and elsewhere that there is no intention now by America to resume sea dumping because of the information available to them.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that if our environment and health are to be threatened by this dumping 380 miles north west of Ireland then we must take this matter very seriously indeed.  I suggest that the Minister at least monitor and be certain that our Nuclear Energy Board are taking the right decisions, are taking political decisions based on the will of the Members of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall conclude by saying we have no nuclear capacity in this country nor do we want it and in my view the people have made that clear.  Nonetheless we are being affected by our neighbours' dumping in the sea.  I would ask the Minister to take this whole matter extremely seriously.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that, as the conference is ongoing at present, it is too early to predict its outcome.  It does not at this stage look likely that any amendment to the convention which would have the effect of immediately terminating dumping would command the necessary support to be adopted.</P>
      <P>For the information of the House the position adopted by the Government is that we are opposed in principle to the dumping of radioactive waste in the present dumping site in the north east Atlantic. Of course the site is not off the north west of Ireland, it is off the south west.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the countries nearest to the dumping site we are in a most vulnerable position in relation to any adverse effects on human health or marine life which may arise as a result of the dumping which has gone on now for a considerable number of years.</P>
      <P>Up to the present, the Irish Government have co-operated fully through the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in implementing the multilateral consultation and surveillance mechanism in accordance with which dumping has been carried out in recent years to ensure that the procedures agreed are complied with.</P>
      <P>Despite our limited resources we have on numerous occasions provided escorting officers for these operations.  Deputies will be aware that there is mounting opposition by environmental groups and other interests.  Doubts have been created in the minds of many people by the fact that no reliable quantitative evaluation can be undertaken of the effects of these operations.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go into the scientific and technical implications of the matter at this stage.  The point has to be made, however, that very many people believe that sea dumping of radioactive waste constitutes a danger to the health of this and future generations and are demanding that dumping should be discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> At present the only site being used for the dumping of radioactive waste at sea is in the Atlantic at a point equidistant from Ireland and Spain.  The Irish Government shares the concern of the Spanish Government and desires to see an end to this practice.</P>
    <P>The Irish delegation as a first priority supports a proposal submitted by Kiribati and Nauru to terminate dumping at sea as soon as possible.  The most recent reports I have from the convention indicate that this proposal, which would meet our objectives, will fail.</P>
    <P>For these reasons the Irish delegation strongly supports the Nordic amendment to the proposal submitted by Kiribati and Nauru as best meeting the interests of all parties affected.  This Nordic proposal provides for the cessation of dumping by 1990, a ban on the opening of new dump sites and a limitation on the quantities of waste to be dumped in the period up to 1990.</P>
    <P>While the objective of the Government is to have dumping terminated as soon as practicable it is necessary to secure a two-thirds majority of those present and voting at the convention to carry an amendment which would be binding on all the subscribers.  In the absence of sufficient support the existing arrangements which allow dumping of low-level radioactive <Col N="458" /> waste will continue within the Nuclear Energy Agency mechanism.</P>
    <P>I would of course like to point out to the House that there is a total prohibition on the dumping of high level waste at sea under the mechanism.</P>
    <P>In answer to the Deputy's query as to why I am not attending the London dumping conference, I should say it is being attended by high level officials, as is the case in nearly all other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of exemption from the co-responsibility levy is one for the Council of Ministers of the European Communities. At present milk producers in the disadvantaged areas pay a reduced rate of levy on the first 60,000 kg (13,000 gallons approximately) of milk delivered by them.  The continuance of this special diferential in favour of producers has been proposed by the EC Commission in their price proposals for 1983-84 and I, of course, support it.  Indeed I will also be seeking to have producers in the severely handicapped areas totally exempted from the levy.</P>
      <P>In addition the Commission have proposed that aid be provided again this year to support the income of small scale milk producers on the lines of the scheme approved last year.  Under last year's scheme Ireland received about £4.5 million which largely compensated producers in the disadvantaged areas for the amount of co-responsibility levy paid by them.  I am hopeful of an at least equally advantageous outcome this year.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit for 52 weeks from 11 July 1981 to 12 July 1982 based on his insurance record of 52 contributions in 1979-80.  From 13 July 1982 the weekly rate of benefit payable to him depended on his insurance record in 1980-81.  As he had only 30 contributions in that year his weekly rate was reduced to £28.30.  To qualify for maximum benefit he would have needed at least 48 contributions paid or credited.</P>

      <P>The person concerned attained age 66 years on 15 June 1979 and claimed contributory old age pension.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of this pension requires a person to have a yearly average of not less than 20 reckonable contributions from the beginning of the contribution year in which he entered into insurance to the end of the last complete contribution year before he attained pension age.  As the claimant entered into insurance in the final week of the 1958 contribution year the average test period in his case is from 6 January 1958 to the end of the 1978 contribution year.  Including credited contributions for the first 51 weeks of 1958 he had a total of 350 qualifying contributions in this 21-year period and as this is equal to a yearly average of only 16 he does not qualify for a contributory old age pension. This decision was upheld by an appeals officer whose decision in the matter is final unless new facts which were not previously available come to light.</P>

It was stated that it was hoped that an examination of the policing arrangements in Galway would be carried out early in 1982.  Unfortunately this did not prove possible as the team found it necessary to concentrate on other tasks, including an examination of deployment of personnel in Dublin and the implementation and monitoring of pilot schemes designed to improve policing in rural areas.  The examination of the policing requirements of Galway are now planned to commence in April next and the question of providing a Garda station on the eastern side of Galway city will be considered in the light of the findings of this examination.</P>
