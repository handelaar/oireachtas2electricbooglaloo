    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in the national interest and in order to preserve for future generations important features of a cultural, historical, architectural, educational or recreational nature, he will give favourable consideration to the acquisition by the State of Carton House and estate at Maynooth, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Minister of State of the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon) Minister of State of the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State of the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The preservation of Carton House and demesne is a matter of great artistic and cultural importance and the possible means will be kept under review to enable this to be ensured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister agree that notwithstanding the current financial stringency which prevails it might be better to pursue more actively the sentiments expressed in the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>: The basic position is that Carton House and demesne is in private ownership and is the subject of a number of planning permissions at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> A number of use models have been prepared for possible public ownership or public use of the house and demesne and all these must be fully explored.  I can assure the Deputy on my own behalf and on behalf of the Taoiseach that every possibility will be looked at which could bring about the continued preservation of the house and demesne, including their being used as a possible artistic and cultural focus for the surrounding region, but, as the Deputy said, in any such review the state of the public finances must be kept in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister agree that the zonings for that area would be very strongly in favour of his wishes and that any of the planning permissions which are currently before Kildare County Council would be out of order? Would he use his offices to make sure none of them is successful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>: It would be indiscreet for me to comment on any planning permission at present before Kildare County Council or An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>: While the estate is in private ownership at present, is the Minister aware that it might be possible to approach the owners with a view to acquisition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>: As I said originally, there is a variety of possibilities but at this stage it would be premature to enter into detail and would not help what this House would desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: How does the Minister interpret &ldquo;near future&rdquo;?  Does he envisage any substantive amendments other than those mentioned by me at the end of the Second Stage as being acceptable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: The &ldquo;near future&rdquo; I hope will be in the next few weeks.  It is intended to introduce a number of amendments to improve the Bill and to meet some of the points raised by staff associations and trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the precautions taken in the Post Office to prevent the tapping of telephones, other than under warrant signed by the Minister for Justice; if he considers the present precautions adequate; if he will consider reviewing the precautions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: It would not be in the public interest to disclose the precautions taken.  The arrangements are reviewed periodically to determine whether they could be improved and are being so reviewed at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware of the widespread belief that the number of official warrants issued is only a small proportion of the actual taps made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: That question could be more appropriately tabled to the Minister for Justice.  All I can say is this: great efforts are made to ensure that only lawful warrants are executed and that there is no illegal tapping of telephones.  I have instituted a review to see how we can improve these precautions and that review is going on at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: Can the Minister give a guarantee that there are no unofficial telephone taps at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I want to make it absolutely clear that there are no taps in existence other than lawfully warranted taps of which I am aware and great precautions are taken to ensure that that is <Col N="1744" /> the case.  In those circumstances it is wrong that Deputy De Rossa should make unwarranted allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will consider introducing legislation to provide severe penalties for any person found guilty of unlawful telephone tapping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: Under the existing law it is an offence for a member of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to intercept a telephone message contrary to his duty.  The penalty laid down is imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The legal position in regard to telephone tapping by other persons and in regard to other unauthorised access to telephone calls is being reviewed at present with the object of introducing further legislation to cover them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: Does the Minister not see any implied indication in the question that there is unlawful tapping, and would he not make the same admission to his brother?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is no implied admission whatever.  I can assure the House and the Deputy that all possible precautions are taken by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to ensure that there is no illegal tapping of telephones. We are now reviewing those precautions in an effort to improve them.  Included in that review is consideration of legislation to provide for severe penalties for such unofficial tapping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <P>8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when it is envisaged that illegal radio stations will be controlled and regulated; and the steps being taken in the interim situation prior to legislation, to take strong action against the operation of illegal radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>These stations operate in breach of the Wireless Telegraphy Acts and of international agreements, to which this country is a party, governing the use of the radio frequency spectrum generally.  It is my intention to introduce legislation within the next few months which will strengthen the powers of my Department to take effective action to suppress these stations.  In the meantime my Department will take action against such broadcasting stations under existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware that there are now more than 70, perhaps 80, illegal radio stations operating in the State?  Will his proposed Bill provide for commercial or community broadcasting, or both?  Will the Minister tell me particularly whether RTE will be involved in such stations and will he give me a commitment that the employment level at RTE will not be in any danger?  Will it be commercial or community interests who will be provided for in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: All I can say is that there is a considerable number of illegal stations operating.  I do not know the exact number but I would be surprised if it was as high as the Deputy suggested.  I know the number is considerable.  I am at present considering exactly what proposals I should put to the Government in connection with the development of legal local radio.  It would be premature for me to disclose what my thoughts are yet because I have not reached finality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister has said <Col N="1746" /> he intends to introduce legislation within a few month but he has not yet decided whether the Bill will be catering for commercial or community radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I hope that before the end of the year I will be able to introduce legislation which will bring an end to illegality in broadcasting and at the same time make provision for the development of legal local radio.  The exact make-up of such local radio has not been decided &mdash; it is a matter for discussion in the Department and we hope to have discussions with outside interested parties before I bring the Bill to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>: In Programme for Government the Minister clearly expressed preference for community radio.  His predecessor, Deputy Cooney, told me some time ago that he, too, had a preference for community radio.  Will the Minister, therefore, concede that it will be community radio?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: That programme has been thrown out since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy will know of the great difficulty people have in interpreting words.  It depends very much on what the Deputy and I mean by the word &ldquo;community&rdquo;.  All I can say is that I am considering the development of legal local radio stations and as fast as possible bringing to an end illegality in broadcasting.  The House should welcome this advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the possible change in the Minister's and the Government's thinking in this area of radio broadcasting be influenced by the fact that the Minister has succeeded in getting his man in as controller of programmes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: When the Minister is considering the balancing of his new arrangements would he consider giving some share in these arrangements, even for commercial local radio, on the basis that presumably it will be possible to extract from commercial interests anxious to engage in commercial local broadcasting very hefty fees for that privilege, thus contributing to the financial position of the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>: Has the Minister buried Deputy Nealon?  He has not referred to that Minister of State in his comments. We all understood that the Minister of State had been put in by the Taoiseach to manage and to control broadcasting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister not consider reintroducing the 1979 Wireless Telegraphy Bill and the 1981 Independent Local Radio Bill which were very good pieces of legislation proposed by the Minister's predecessor?  Then the Minister would get a speedy passage of the Bill and the matter would be resolved once and for all.</P>

      <P>: The appointment of Deputy Nealon, the Minister of State, was specifically at my request.  The appointment was made so that we could give the priority we are now giving to broadcasting.  We hope to get those pieces of legislation precisely because we have the Minister of State for that purpose. The two Bills to which Deputy Leyden <Col N="1748" /> referred could serve as the basis for the legislation we are proposing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will make a statement on the location, dimensions, furnishing and equipment of the office premises used by An Bord Telecom since their establishment or at present reserved for their future use; the appropriateness of this accommodation in relation to the present size of their staff; and the total cost to date to the State of this accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: The accommodation concerned will, it is expected, be fully occupied within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The position is that 25,000 square feet of office accommodation in Merrion House, Merrion Road, were leased for An Bord Telecom.  Following consideration by them of other premises on offer at the time, the board concluded that this was the accommodation best suited to meet the particular purposes they had in mind.  Standard type carpeting and furniture were supplied for the premises by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board envisaged at the time that they might be in a position to take over control of operation of the telecommunications services reasonably quickly and that they would use this as a headquarters for their top management staff.  This expectation has not been realised and when it became clear early in 1981 that the space available was in excess of the board's immediate requirements 10,000 <Col N="1749" /> square feet were sub-leased.  This continued until September 1982.  This area will be occupied on a continuous basis from next month for departmental training purposes.</P>
    <P>While the staff of An Bord Telecom and of Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited, which total ten, are the only permanent occupants of the remaining 15,000 square feet, the rest of that accommodation is used regularly for meetings of the two boards, for conferences and training seminars, for meeting customer groups and by staff of my Department working for the board.</P>
    <P>The net total cost of the accommodation up to the end of 1982 was £963,953. This included rent, rates, heating, lighting, and also fitting-out costs which amounted to £330,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have a few questions for the Minister arising out of this.  Recognising that the arrangements made here were not made by him, is it not correct that this house which was formerly called Ravensdale, or something of that kind, on the site of the old IMCO works has been in State hands in one shape or form since February 1982, if not longer?  Is that correct?  In other words, for well over a year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: With expenditure of £963,953 we are at spitting distance from around £1 million.  That is £100,000 to house each one of these ten An Bord Telecom officials.  Can the Minister tell me to whom the part of the building taken for An Bord Telecom was sub-leased?</P>

Would it be wrong of me if I were to guess that the sub-lease &mdash; I have no knowledge of this and I am asking the Minister in complete innocence &mdash; was engaged in merely in order to put some kind of face on the fact that ten persons were occupying this palazzo on the Merrion Road?  In other words, a convenient State customer was found to take a certain portion of the premises from them for purposes for which they have plenty of room elsewhere.</P>

The property concerned was considered to be the best available for the purposes for which it was wanted.  The people in question could not anticipate the regularity of changes of Government which delayed the enactment of the legislation.  That was one of the principal contributors to the very high cost of the building compared with the number of people occupying it.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I put down the question like this because the Minister is in charge of these services by law, and I wished him to state his own position before pursuing that of his colleagues.  Is the Minister telling me the Minister for Justice has statutory authority, as distinct from common law authority, to intercept mail or telephone communications?  I think he is wrong about that.

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I can help the Deputy by drawing on my own experience as Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Defence can authorise a request to the Minister for Justice, but only the Minister for Justice can authorise and sign a warrant for the interception of mail.  No warrant can be signed by anybody else, nor have any other warrants ever been received in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <P>: I do not mean to contradict the Minister because I am speaking off the top of my head.  Leaving aside the question of whether the authority is statutory or, as I think, non-statutory, is it the case that if it is non-statutory the position of the Minister for Defence is just as informal as that of the Minister for Justice?  What security has anybody that there will not be a further list of Ministers or other authorities added to the number of those at whose request a warrant to tap a telephone may be issued?</P>

      <P>: Under the savings certificates rules, which are administered by my Department on behalf of the Minister for Finance, when a holder of savings certificates dies evidence of a grant of administration or probate may be sought as proof of a claimant's entitlement to the proceeds.

The limit of £100 of saving certificates is laid down in rule 37 of the saving certificates rules which were drawn up in 1926.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. O'Dea</b> asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that the billing telephone method used by his Department has caused public disquiet; his plans, if any, to change this system or, at least, to change the manner in which a subscriber's bill is explained to him by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not aware that the method of billing has given rise to disquiet. However, ways in which the presentation of the bill could be improved and subscribers given a better understanding of how the bills are made up have been receiving on-going consideration. A leaflet explaining the make-up of telephone bills was issued with the recent quarterly accounts.  Other improvements such as giving meter readings, the date of meter readings and the destination of calls made via the operator are being examined and, if found to be practicable, will be introduced later this year.  The possibility of giving details of metered trunk calls is also being explored and may be implemented on a pilot basis towards the <Col N="1758" /> end of this year at an appropriate fee to cover the costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister must be aware that the billing system is a cause of major disquiet to consumers.  Will he inform the House if there has been any progress with regard to providing a two-monthly billing system rather than the quarterly bills now being issued?  Such bills are very large due to recent increases and people find it difficult to remember the telephone calls they have made.  The present system is causing disquiet and it requires an immediate overhaul.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Department have no plans to introduce a system providing for bills every two months.  To improve the understanding of the billing system, reporters from the national press and RTE were invited in January last to inspect the system.  A number of &ldquo;open days&rdquo; were launched throughout the country where the general public were given an opportunity to study the system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister seriously telling the House he is not aware that the problem of overcharging of telephone accounts is the cause of much worry?  Deputies are aware of the situation because they are getting an enormous number of inquiries on this point. I had not intended to intervene on this question but I was amazed that the Minister does not seem to be aware of the extent of the problem.  I suggest to him that he would commit himself today to ensuring an improvement in the area of overcharging.  What advice will he give to subscribers who receive bills for extremely large amounts?  Should they pay the bill and claim a refund, or should they dispute the amount there and then?</P>

The general aim is to improve the system so that we reduce that percentage.  Most of the bills are calculated by computer: it is not the computer <Col N="1759" /> that makes a mistake but the information fed into it may be incorrect.</P>

      <P>: When a person makes a long distance call through the exchange, will the Minister explain if the operator is required to take the caller's number and ring back?  The Minister will agree that it is accepted in his Department that a number of people are giving false numbers and that the bill is charged to an innocent party who did not make the call. If the operators are instructed by the Department to call back in all cases, why is this not done?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

Further improvement in the general standard of the postal service in Dublin can be achieved mainly by clearing all mail at the due despatch times and this will be secured primarily by better arrangements at the central sorting office.  It is on improving these that efforts are being concentrated at present, although the possibility of additional processing at some district offices is being borne in mind.</P>

      <P>: Would the Minister agree that there are 12 quite spacious district sorting offices which are very much under-utilised between the hours of 8 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. to 5 p.m.?  He made the point that it would be too costly to organise matters on the basis that I proposed.  Would he not accept that frequently items of State mail which are due to the State delivery section are coming out of district offices early in the morning, cannot be handled there and are sent back into town for State delivery?</P>

      <P>: My question was to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs but I understand it has been transferred to another Minister.  My question asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether his Department have placed any contracts with Telectron (Ireland) Ltd.; the value of these contracts; and if in view of the imminent closure of this company with the subsequent loss of 500 jobs and the fact that any fulfilling of contracts may now result in the provision of employment in another country, the urgent steps he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if as a result of the announcement by Telectron (Ireland) Ltd. that 500 jobs are to be lost he will immediately undertake an investigation into the reasons and with particular reference to what Government orders have been placed with the company and in what country the work will be carried out.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if he is aware of plans by ATT International to close the Telectron factory at Tallaght, County Dublin, with the loss of 500 jobs and to reduce the workforce in its Gweedore, County Donegal, factory by 34 workers; if he is aware that the company is in breach of its legal obligation in relation to statutory notices regarding collective redundancies; the steps he intends to take to protect the jobs involved and the legal entitlements of the workers and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I propose to take the three questions together.  I will deal at first with the question addressed to myself.  I should like to say that Deputy Mac Giolla's question is only in part my direct responsibility, part of it is the responsibility of the Minister for Labour.  However, I will be giving a reply on the basis of information supplied by him to all the questions.  I fully share, like the Government, the concern over the company's announcement which is implicit in the <Col N="1776" /> questions.  I have already initiated inquiries on the lines suggested by the Deputies and I will be meeting my colleagues, the Ministers for Labour and Posts and Telegraphs, shortly after I have answered these questions to review the matter further.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that the Industrial Development Authority have already made very strong representations to the United States parent company at the highest possible level requesting urgent discussions and a suspension in the meantime of the threat to close the Tallaght operation.  In regard to the question addressed to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs by Deputy Harney, the position is that the firm has orders from the Department for pulse code modulation equipment and digital radio links, as well as for some minor items of equipment. The value of the pulse code modulation equipment remaining to be delivered is about £2.5 million, and the value of the order for digital radio equipment is about £14 million.  Over half of the order for digital radio links is in respect of civil works such as the erection of towers and buildings, and the balance is for equipment.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is, naturally, greatly concerned over the recent development and his Department are in contact urgently with Telectron about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Gweedore operation was referred to by Deputy Mac Giolla and I should like to tell the House that the decision to make redundancies in that plant was made by the company with a view to ensuring the viability of that plant and safeguarding the remainder of the employment there.  I will give the sequence of events as far as the notifications of redundancies are concerned. Under the Protection of Employment Act a notice was received in the Department of Labour on 6 April 1983 that 37 workers would be made redundant in Gweedore as from 30 May 1983.  Secondly, a letter dated 31 March notified the Department of Labour that 197 workers would be made redundant in Tallaght.  Thirdly, on 25 April, yesterday, the Minister for Labour was notified that the Tallaght factory would be closed with <Col N="1777" /> a loss of 500 jobs.  Superficially the latter part would seem to be a breach of the Act but it is understood that the company is arranging to pay the workers for a period of 30 days.  Those formal replies were prepared in the short time available by the various Departments.  The Government discussed this matter this morning and are gravely concerned at the developments.  It has been agreed by the Government that the Ministers for Labour and Posts and Telegraphs and myself should meet immediately to discuss the matter further.  I should also like to tell the House that the managing director of the IDA is in contact with the American parent company.  In fact, he may be speaking to the company now.  I had hoped to have an initial result from that communication for the House but, unfortunately, due to various difficulties it was not possible for the managing director to make contact before these questions fell to be answered.  I can assure the House that the Government of course take this matter very seriously and will do everything they can at the highest possible level to ensure a reversal of the decision, which seems to have been taken very precipitately indeed.</P>

I will be discussing the matter with the Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs and Labour in the next few minutes and at this stage, and given the very short time since we received this alarming information, it has not been possible for a final view to be formed on the matter.  Discussions are taking place at a high place about this.</P>

      <P>: In view of the fact that this announcement was made yesterday and that the questions by my colleagues have at least warned the Minister of the need for urgent action, I <Col N="1778" /> should like to ask the Minister if he, or any of his colleagues met the management of the company.  Has the Minister made the company aware of the facts of life regarding what they appear to be trying to do?  If the Minister has not met the management of the company yet I should like to know why he has not done so?  If the Minister has not met management will he summon them immediately to meet him in the House so that the matter could be raised later this evening or at worst tomorrow morning?  Will the Minister arrange with his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs; that payments on foot of these contracts be stopped immediately until such time as undertakings are given to the work force in Telectron?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: There have been constant contacts since this announcement yesterday between, on the one hand, my Department, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the IDA and, on the other hand, the company's representatives here.  This matter is being pursued with the utmost force by the Government and, as I indicated already, the matter was discussed this morning by the Government and certain arrangements were made.  The decision was taken by the international board of this company and it is at that level that the decision must be reversed.  I am not certain that a meeting here with the local management would necessarily bring the matter to a conclusion.  I am not saying that it would not be useful and it is one of the matters we will consider.  The important thing is that we dissuade the international arm of this company from the decision they have taken.  I have just been given a note to the effect that the international president of the company, ATT, has agreed to meet the IDA to discuss the request from the <Col N="1779" /> Government and the IDA to suspend the decision to close.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister's approach indicates that the Government are approaching this matter as if it were the case of another small factory closure. It is due to an accumulation of factors over several months.  Does the Minister realise what a disaster this is to the south-west area of Dublin?  The growing new city of Tallaght, which was planned by the Department of the Environment, now has almost two-thirds of its projected population.  Is the Minister aware that this area has little, if any, industry left following this closure?  Many people living in Tallaght are already unemployed and this is the worst disaster area in the country.  The closure of this industry should mean an emergency disaster plan by the Government.  Deputy Gene Fitzgerald's query is very relevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>: Does the Minister agree that much more urgent action must be taken?  Will he indicate that such action is being taken by adopting the steps proposed by Deputy Fitzgerald and bringing the representatives of the company into his office?  It is stated in today's newspapers that the company were losing £3 million a year and that they would lose more than that this year.  Does the Minister agree with that statement?  Will he ask the company to produce the books in order to prove whether they were making a great profit or losing money?  This information must be brought before the House rather than our being brought to the understanding by the company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am sorry if I gave <Col N="1780" /> Deputy Mac Giolla the impression that this matter was not being treated seriously by the Government.  I assure him that it is being treated very seriously.  We realise how important this undertaking is for the area of south-west Dublin which he has the honour to represent.  It is an area where there have been a number of employment problems already and the Government fully recognise that this is a severe blow to that part of County Dublin.  I have said already that the Government discussed this matter this morning.  We have now succeeded in making contact with the international management in North America.  This was delayed until this afternoon due in part to problems of time difference.  Discussions are to take place immediately these questions are concluded directly between the Ministers concerned.  I would also indicate to Deputy Mac Giolla that the information he requested in regard to profit levels or lack of them is highly relevant and is a matter which will be pursued most strenuously with the company to establish their position exactly. As Deputies have pointed out, this company, quite apart from the orders they have received, have been in receipt of substantial grant moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister not agree that this matter is too urgent to have meetings left to anybody but Minister?  Would be explain to the House why he does not think it necessary for him or another of his colleagues to meet the president?  The methods being used by this company must surely be a new departure and I share Deputy Mac Giolla's concern.  I fail to understand the delaying tactics of the Government and the Minister in responding to yesterday's announcement.  But for the questions tabled today, little or no action would have been taken.  We are told that the Ministers will be meeting shortly but why did they not meet yesterday?  This is a matter of extreme urgency which is being treated in a very casual manner by the Minister.  I demand that he should explain to the House why he, rather than some official, should not meet the president of this company.</P>

I certainly do not rule out the possibility &mdash; and this may well be decided by the Ministers this afternoon &mdash; that I or one of my colleagues will meet the international management now that contact has been made with them.  This is a matter of sufficient seriousness to warrant an intervention at that level, if such intervention can yield results.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>: This Bill is worthy of serious consideration because the general public will become aware that as legislators we have made this effort to come to grips with the situation that has developed over quite a long period.  One might be tempted to say that it is better late than never.  We hope that by the introduction of this Bill the general public will realise the necessity for the Bill.  The problem of offenders and their numbers has reached such a dimension that our prisons and restraining institutions are overcrowded and this Bill is an effort to treat this matter with the sincerity it deserves.  We have a very serious situation in regard to petty crime and vandalism, particularly by young people.  They will now be brought under the regulations <Col N="1907" /> in this Bill.  It very often has a very disastrous effect on young people if they are sent to prison and places of detention.  I do not want to indicate that we should take lightly the seriousness of the crime committed against people and the public at large.  We are all aware of the concern expressed by groups of people, community associations and individuals about crimes being committed against them.</P>
      <P>This Bill shows that we are at least making some effort to deal with this situation which has been allowed to develop.  I hope we may arrest the progress of petty crime, vandalism and the various criminal acts which can be dealt with under this Bill.  The old adage of prevention being better than cure is something we probably have lost sight of. The Department of Justice for many years have been wrong in not ensuring that Garda barracks were erected to coincide with the development of very large urban areas.  I am using my constituency as an example.  In 1932 the development of the first scheme of a few hundred houses took place on the north side of the city.  Over the last 50 years masses of housing estates have been built to accommodate people who were living in slums and hovels.  However, Governments through the years have neglected vast areas of operation such as Gurranebraher, Church Street, Knocknaheny, Farranree, The Glen and Mayfield by not providing Garda stations.  These should have been provided when such areas were developed.  I hope the Department of Justice will waken up to this.  For 20 years or more we sought the provision of a Garda station in one of the areas I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>: I am trying to make it clear to the public what we hope to achieve under the Bill.  I am also mindful of the increasing number of young people.  Statistics show that our young population is growing.  As a result of Government policy in a number of areas we will have more of them to look after.  I must be allowed to make these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was not just thought about last week.  It is almost two years old.  The situation has worsened in that time. <Col N="1909" /> Education must be referred to.  The number of young people who might be denied education because of Government policy will create further problems.  We should warn young people away from the situations they innocently could become involved in.  We must educate them so that they will not go in the wrong direction. There are many bodies, for example, Foróige, where the energies of young people could be better directed than to vandalism and crime.  We must ensure that they do not become caught up in the groundswell of misdemeanours of some young people.</P>
    <P>It has always been accepted that prison sentences for young offenders rarely have the desired effect.  This Bill might be a yardstick by which to judge the value of community work as opposed to the danger of putting young people into institutions. The report on the community services order as a method of dealing with offenders gives examples of tasks which can be performed by young offenders within the community.  I have reservations about some of them.  However, that is something that can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill is worthy of support for its efforts to discourage young people from straying from the straight and narrow. More importantly, it will help to remove the stigma of having been in prison or places of detention.  We will be showing our compassion as legislators if we ensure that this Bill is passed, initially to create an awareness in society of the consequences of being in prison.</P>
    <P>The public will also benefit by the energies of these people being used in a practical way, as suggested, by taking part in worthy projects in the community.  I hope the Bill will not be restricted in any way by lack of finance.  At the risk of being told I am straying from the point, I have to say I am worried about the figures in the Estimates for the Department.  The position is a little frightening because, for example, on the capital services it was ascertained that the 1982 outturn was £16.5 million.  The estimate planned by Fianna Fáil to provide for this year in that respect was £18 million.  The estimate of the Coalition is down to £11 <Col N="1910" /> million and I hope that, wherever cheeseparing is done, this Bill will not suffer for lack of finance.</P>
    <P>Deployment and use of gardaí leaves something to be desired and I hope that the Minister for Justice will regard my comments as being constructive.  I know from experience and from evidence I got from various people concerned, that quite an amount of a garda's time is taken up in the barracks with secretarial work. There is nothing to beat the physical presence of gardaí on the streets.  I am not in any way criticising the efforts of the Garda because they are doing a tremendous job and I hope the introduction of this Bill will make life a little easier for them.  I hope every effort will be made to ensure the satisfactory operation of the Bill and, possibly, further developments. I welcome the Bill.  I hope it will be seen as a commitment by the Oireachtas to come to grips with a situation which has gone too far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>: This is an important debate and unusual in some respects because of the degree of all-party support that its concept enjoys. That is evidenced by the fact that, during the lifetime of the last Dáil, the then Government and Opposition were simultaneously working in this area and produced Bills which they laid before the Dáil within a matter of some days or perhaps a week of each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also unusual to the extent that this debate has been hijacked by Deputies and used as a vehicle to express their views on matters that go well beyond the scope of the legislation.  I listened to Deputy Lyons who was prevented by you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, from wandering too far and I know the Opposition spokesman, Deputy Woods, and the Ceann Comhairle had the same problem a week ago.  It is understandable that Deputies on all sides are anxious to avail of every possible opportunity to express their concern and that of their constituents in relation to the problems of crime and vandalism in our streets.  Over the past few weeks, I have attended a very large number of meetings of residents <Col N="1911" /> and community groups where the subject under discussion was the problems facing local communities in these areas.  At a number of those meetings, representatives of the Garda were present.  They have obviously been asked to put forward their suggestions and whether they see a solution.  All these meetings have had the same theme.  It was suggested that in some respects they are unduly restricted by our code of criminal legislation and they sought changes there.  That will be the subject of separate legislation which will be coming before the House shortly. I do not want to comment further on that at present.</P>
    <P>They also made the point that they feel severely handicapped by the perception that a deterrent no longer exists.  They have all drawn attention to the fact that the overcrowding in our prisons and places of detention has achieved such a degree of public notoriety that it has further whittled down whatever deterrent might otherwise exist.</P>
    <P>On several occasions in the last year or so this House, at Question Time and elsewhere, has directed itself to the unhappy situation in which we find ourselves, that many persons sentenced after due consideration to terms of detention or imprisonment by the courts are released before the lawful expiry of their sentence, not because there has been an adjudication by the prison authorities or anybody else that they have been rehabilitated by their period in custody and are now in a position to take their places in society, but simply on the basis that there is no room for them in our places of detention.  The Minister for Justice made references to this fact in moving the Second Stage of the Bill.  Deputies on all sides would for that reason alone be anxious to extend the range of options available to the Judiciary and to provide our judges in criminal trials with another option, apart from imposing a custodial sentence, particularly if the custodial sentence is unlikely to be served.  That is a particularly urgent problem which gives the measure before the House a degree of immediacy that it might otherwise lack but if we never have that situation this <Col N="1912" /> measure must be taken seriously and is entitled to the support of the House. Until now our Judiciary have been extraordinarily circumscribed in the options available to them.  Effectively they have the choice of imposing a custodial sentence, imposing a fine which for various reasons is likely to bear no relation to today's monetary values, in most cases the maximum that can be imposed having remained unchanged for a number of years, or to impose a suspended sentence and in effect allow the departure of the offender from court without imposing any penalty.  Faced with that situation a number of judges have to an extent taken the initiative into their own hands and experimented in the area of restitution and quasi-community services.  It has become the practice of a number of our judges to postpone sentence in particular cases to allow the offender before them an opportunity to show his good faith. Frequently that takes the form of making a substantial monetary contribution to a charity or in some cases assisting the work of that charity.  That shows that the Judiciary are in support of the basic concept and anxious to extend the range of options available to them.</P>
    <P>We must accept that our prison system has its failings and that as legislators we have a responsibility to provide an alternative. We are not alone in having that responsibility.  There has been an increasing examination internationally of just how effective or ineffective our prison system is and an increasing international emphasis on a search for alternatives. That stems from a feeling that in many instances a non-custodial sentence may be the more cost-effective in that it provides a greater opportunity of rehabilitation for the offender and in some instances at least the community will benefit directly by the community work that will be undertaken in pursance of an order of this variety where work is done for the benefit of the community which would not otherwise be undertaken.  That is a task to which criminologists in this country and also in Britain, Scandinavia and the US have been directing their attention.  We are in a position to observe the lessons of other jurisdictions and to <Col N="1913" /> benefit from their mistakes where mistakes have been made.  Such reading as I have been able to do on the British experience indicates that since the introduction of community service orders in the early seventies the experience has generally been very satisfactory.  Their experience has been taken up by a number of other countries in the common law world between Canada and New Zealand. It is felt that it has a number of advantages.  First of all it gives the offender a chance to be directly involved in repaying the community and in making direct atonement to the community in respect of an offence that he has been found to commit.  Particularly important at a time of recession when employment is not easy to come by is the fact that it provides him with an opportunity to do that without interrputing his employment or any course of education that he may be pursuing.  Even within the very limited extent to which the scheme or an analogous scheme now operates in this country we have seen communities benefiting directly in that the communities have acquired facilities and have had work done for them which in all probability would otherwise not have been done.  I refer to the pilot schemes that already exist for the early release of prisoners to engage in community type work as a result of which a number of community facilities have been built, the scout den in the Finglas area being one.</P>
    <P>Another reason that this concept has received the support of the community is a feeling that through some such mechanism it is possible to get closer to the age-old objective of making the punishment fit the crime.  Reference has been made already in this debate to the very great lengths to which some states in America have gone in that area.  For example, those convicted of drunken driving are required to serve their sentences by working in hospitals tending to serve the needs of accident victims many of them hospitalised as a result of the activities of other drunken drivers.  I realise that this is perhaps a step further on which it may not be possible to take immediately.  We must walk before we can run, but Deputies on all sides in this House and the <Col N="1914" /> public at large would see something very attractive indeed in bringing offenders face to face with the consequences of their recklessness and their actions.  I hope that we will be prepared to move in that direction.</P>
    <P>I want to make a number of suggestions that I hope the Minister will have an opportunity to consider.  One advantage of this measure is that it does not interfere with someone's present employment or, as I indicated earlier, with any course of education that he might be receiving.  The logical extension of that would be that nothing would stem from a community order which would in any sense inhibit the prospects of future employment.  The attitude adopted towards the keeping of records in this area is important.  However harsh or unfair, it is obvious that at a time when there are far more applicants for any job vacancy than there are jobs an employer is in a position to pick and choose.  In those circumstances a prospective employee with a criminal record is obviously in a bad position.  It would seem, in part at least, to defeat the spirit and sentiment of the Bill if by keeping records that somebody has been sentenced to a term of community service that person's prospect of obtaining employment were to be in any way impaired.  On the other hand, I can see that any court would be anxious when dealing with an offender and addresing itself to the question whether this was an appropriate option to know whether the person has previously undergone a period of community service.  I hope it might be possible to devise a scheme where the fact that a person has participated in this scheme would be recorded, but only for the purpose of assisting any future court before which he or she might appear in deciding on the most appropriate manner to respond, and it would not be regarded as a criminal record for the purpose of applying for a job, travelling abroad or any of the other occasions where one might be asked if one had a criminal record.</P>
    <P>In much of this debate it has been assumed that this measure will be applied mainly to younger offenders.  Obviously it has a particular relevance to these <Col N="1915" /> people and we all hope it will be used extensively in that area, but I would not wish to support the idea that this scheme should be confined to young offenders. A great deal of the discussion implied that the court which will use this scheme most will be the District Court.  I would not like to be taken as supporting the notion that the operation of the scheme should be so confined.  One of the real problems at present facing any member of the Judiciary in dealing with an offender, if the offender is already in employment, is the certain knowledge that to impose a custodial sentence will in almost all cases involve the loss of employment, in all probability leading to great difficulty in finding alternative employment.  For that reason alone there is a likelihood of further offences being committed.</P>
    <P>Responding to the economic climate, the courts have found themselves increasingly reluctant to impose a custodial sentence on an offender in steady employment. That reluctance is greatest when the offender comes from what is loosely referred to as a middle class background. At present the courts have the choice of imposing a custodial sentence, with devastating and far-reaching consequences beyond what the offence merits, or of sending the person home.  For some of these offenders a period of community service would be salutary and I hope this weapon will be invoked by courts at all levels and in respect of offenders at all ages.</P>
    <P>I notice the Bill does not confine the operation of the scheme to any particular court, except to the extent that it excludes the Special Criminal Court.  I understand why that decision was taken.  The fact that the offence was tried there involved an adjudication that the offence was such that the ordinary courts  would not appear adequate to handle it.  Having said that, it might seem incongruous to say that the offence was not so serious that this option should not be available, but if you look at the cases that come before the Special Criminal Court over the year you will see that a trickle of people got involved in serious illegalities as a result of foolishness <Col N="1916" /> and thoughtlessness rather than malice, and the court responded by imposing suspended sentences.  In those cases a period of community service might have been a very effective additional weapon. For example, a respectable person with a responsible background who foolishly got himself involved on the fringe of an illegal organisation comes before the court which is satisfied that his involvement was on the fringe and decides to impose a suspended sentence.  In my view such a person could only benefit from being required to work in a hospital where he could see how much people suffer from serious injuries which are analogous to those suffered by the victims of his organisation.  In some cases this option might be helpful.  In those circumstances, I wonder if it is wise specifically to exclude any court from the operation of this scheme?  As one goes up the hierarchy of the courts one sees that the occasions on which it would be appropriate to invoke the community service order will become rarer and rarer, but however rare, I query if it is desirable to exclude that possibility.</P>
    <P>It also seems inconsistent with the approach taken in considering what offences come within the scheme.  The only offences which seem to be excluded from the operation of this scheme are murder and treason, where a fixed penalty is prescribed. That recognises that there may be occasions when even very serious offences for which a mandatory penalty is not prescribed may be appropriate for this scheme.  Having adopted that all-embracing approach in the area of sentencing, I would have thought it desirable to adopt a similar approach when deciding what courts should exercise this function.</P>
    <P>Whether this system works depends on those who administer the probation and welfare service attached to the Department of Justice and on the attitude adopted by the courts.  In some parts of Britain when the system was first introduced it exacerbated rather than solved problems.  Some benches of magistrates took the view that this was a useful addition and they started to sentence people to terms of community service who previously <Col N="1917" /> would have had their cases dismissed under the Probation Act or would have received small fines.  The net result was that those parts of the country continued to experience an overstretched prison system.  In addition, the people in those parts also found themselves with a probation service that was overstretched.</P>
    <P>That is the danger here.  I would think it desirable that when this legislation has been passed by both Houses the Minister for Justice will sit down with the Judiciary and talk to them about the spirit of the legislation and the motivation for its introduction.  From those discussions one would hope that an agreed policy would evolve about the circumstances in which it would be appropriate to invoke the option.</P>
    <P>I cannot see this legislation doing anything but good. How much good it will do will depend on the flexibility of those who are called on to administer the system.  We are lucky that that task has been assigned to the Probation and Welfare Service who have already shown themselves to be highly committed and highly professional.  I hope the legislation will have a speedy passage through both Houses and that the administrative steps required will be taken to make the possibility of imposing such sentences a reality. I hope these steps will be taken quickly and that in the near future our Judiciary will have this valuable weapon available to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will be brief because this is a Bill on which all parties are agreed.  However, it behoves me as an urban Deputy to add my voice to those who have spoken on the general condition or welfare of law and security in urban and suburban Dublin in particular: I will leave the other parts of the country to Deputies who represent them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a Deputy for almost 20 years with the privilege of representing the people of Dun Laoghaire for that time, and I have seen a gradual breakdown of respect for law and authority throughout the nation.  Unfortunately, particularly in the last five years, respect for our institutions and for authority generally has deteriorated and been translated <Col N="1918" /> into brutalisation of the community in the city and county of Dublin.  I use the word &ldquo;brutalisation&rdquo; deliberately because it is a lack of tolerance of the civilised approach to our fellow human beings in the community I represent: the brutalisation of old people in their homes, whether by rape or assault and battery; the destruction of homes; the brutalisation of young people walking home at night on their own, young men or women who cannot any longer decide to go to dances or discos from which they would have to walk home.  All that has become a thing of the past.  The right and the freedom of people to live in safety in their homes or to walk from point A to point B within the community in which they live are things of the past.</P>
    <P>One cannot go to a theatre or to a function in the city without coming out to find rows of cars vandalised, with windows broken back and front and all around, and any property in the cars stolen. That is why I call it the brutalisation of our society.</P>
    <P>This Bill will go only part of the way as a solution.  It does not deal with the whole problem.  It does not go to the nitty-gritty of the problem.  I have given this matter a lot of thought as have a number of other Deputies.  We ask ourselves what is the solution.</P>
    <P>Where I live in Dún Laoghaire there has been a gradual breakdown in the last number of years in law and security.  My comments are not a criticism of the Garda Síochána in Dún Laoghaire or the greater Dublin area.  The Garda have not been supported adequately by successive Governments.  I am not now dealing with matters related directly to the Bill but for discussion in the House on another occasion, but I feel compelled to say that the time has come to support the Garda by providing for them the legislation which they require to keep a tighter grip on the community.</P>
    <P>In Irish political terms I consider myself to be a relatively liberal person &mdash; that is a matter for others to judge but that is my perception of myself &mdash; but unfortunately liberalism is coming under stress and strain through the breakdown of law and security in the greater Dublin <Col N="1919" /> area.  I do not like to see courts sitting without juries, and we have them at the moment, but the times we live in demand it, and as long as the problems continue we must have that type of court.  Equally, I do not like to have to say that we must have more stringent laws with a prospect of the erosion of the freedom of the individual. Unfortunately, the individual we are dealing with is the criminal.  Therefore, we in the House must have a look at the laws under which the Garda Síochána are working, in matters like questioning and so on.  The public perception of law and security &mdash; to me &ldquo;security&rdquo; is a better word &mdash; is to feel free to walk abroad in one's community, to live in one's home in peace without the prospect of being attacked in it.  These are becoming things of the past.</P>
    <P>The second plank in my platform is the question of support for the Garda and the rules and regulations under which they operate.  Support for the Garda might solve a particularly vicious problem which is arising in the community. One has an obligation to face the realities, and the realities are that the people in the Greater Dublin area, the city and county, require protection.  If we do not give leadership, if we do not enact laws to give effect to that leadership, Dáil Éireann &mdash; and I am one of its greatest defenders &mdash; will lose the respect of the people.  Unfortunately, that may be the subject for another debate if Deputies try to undermine the Oireachtas to get a couple of lines in the newspapers.  I find that unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides an ease and an aid for our creaking prison system.  My information is that when a convicted person presents himself at the door of a prison &mdash; I will not name it &mdash; he is told: &ldquo;We have not got enough room for you. Come back in a few weeks and present yourself again&rdquo;.  That is intolerable if it is information I receive is good.  I hope that situation will not arise when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>As has been said, the only two offences to which this Bill will not be applicable are murder and treason.  As I understand <Col N="1920" /> it, they are the only offences excluded. The Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham, mentioned that the two offences excluded are murder and treason.  He should know on the basis that he is a member of the Government introducing the Bill.  Undoubtedly the Bill will give some help and support to our outdated prison system.  The responsibility lies with the Oireachtas to make the prison system work.  Unfortunately at present it is not working properly.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham, an erstwhile barrister, suggested that the Minister for Justice might consult with the Judiciary on the consistency of the application of community service orders &mdash; in other words, that the punishment should fit the crime.  People against whom a crime is committed should be compensated in some way by the person who committed the crime assisting in restoring the property so vandalised.</P>
    <P>For example, drunken drivers should be given a community service order to assist in hospitals to which victims of car crashes have been brought as a direct result of the criminal action of a drunken driver.  I can think of a number of hospitals in this city to which victims of car crashes are brought to be restored intellectually and physically.  I am not moralising. I am suggesting that the victim of a car crash should be seen by the person who broke up that person's body.  The drunken car driver should be shown the consequences of his criminal action.</P>
    <P>Some people paint graffiti on our walls, mindless, stupid anti-Irish expressions like &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo;.  I use the words &ldquo;anti-Irish&rdquo; because the ordinary British were the greatest supporters of tourism in Ireland.  That has become a thing of the past because we have a mindless group of people who proclaim their patriotism through the barrel of a gun in one hand and a paint brush in the other hand.  This has had a serious effect on the minds of British tourists.  People who are caught painting mindless graffiti on our walls should be made clean those walls publicly of their handiwork.</P>
    <P>When people are brought before our <Col N="1921" /> courts for the brutalisation of elderly persons, the District Court should order them to work in an old folk's home or a senior citizens' home to re-establish their respect for the type of person they have criminally assaulted.  Some people who break into houses actually go to the point of destroying the home by tearing off wallpaper, breaking up furniture, and so on.  They should be given a community service order to restore that home to its original condition so far as is within their competence.</P>
    <P>The transgressors should be seen by the transgressed to be operating in the area in which they committed their criminal actions.  By that I do not mean that a person who commits a crime in Dún Laoghaire should be forced to work in the Dún Laoghaire area.  I do not think that would be reasonable, although the stage may be reached where it may happen. Perhaps a person who commits a crime in community A should be asked to work in community B.  Such people are entitled to a degree of anomymity.  That lies at the base of my proposition that people who engage in graffiti should be made to remove them publicly.  It is a question of balance.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill worries me.  Section 4 (1) (b) provides that a court shall not make a community service order unless the offender has consented. When the Minister is replying perhaps he will tell us why the consent of the individual has to be obtained.  Is it because of the Constitution or because of some international conventions by which we are bound?  Perhaps the Minister will deal with that aspect.  If that matter can be clarified, Fianna Fáil, through their spokesman, Deputy Woods, might consider introducing an amendment to abandon the idea of obtaining the consent of the person convicted who is asked to operate a community service order.  My view is that the person should not have any option.  I do not think the subsection would be in the Bill in the form in which it is unless there was some specific reason for its inclusion but if we are not bound by international conventions and if it has been inserted only for some philosophical <Col N="1922" /> reason I think we should have another look at it.</P>
    <P>The co-operation of the social services groups will be absolutely essential to the operation of the Bill, as will be the co-operation of trade unions and employers. Unless the crime committed is of a heinous nature, I think employers should be asked to allow the person convicted to remain in employment during the day and to carry out community service at weekends in the spare time of the individual concerned.  An attempt should be made to reserve the job for the person doing community service.  Employers should not be placed in the role of moral arbiters.  Some of us do things on the spur of the moment for which we are abjectly sorry afterwards.</P>
    <P>During the debate the question of vigilante groups was raised.  I thoroughly deplore vigilante groups.  I see them acting in the role of judge, jury and executioner and I find that utterly unacceptable. As a Dáil representative I cannot and will not support such groups.  It is deplorable that in a part of our city a group of people actually went around knee-capping others and there was very little fuss about it.  That is what a vigilante group can do.  I can understand, and it is beginning to develop in my constituency where a group of people stay up at night to protect their housing estates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In certain states in Dún Laoghaire people have taken it upon themselves to guard their estates at night time.  That is legitimate as long as they call the Garda in the event of a crime being committed or about to be committed. That is very important.  Vigilante <Col N="1923" /> groups have no special rights in our community and they should be rejected as a cancer.  The whole concept is utterly unacceptable and within the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party I will resist strongly any move in that direction.</P>

      <P>: I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister for Justice and all associated with its presentation to the House.  One of the most serious developments in recent years has been the increase in crime and vandalism.  As politicians we have done little or nothing about it other than recruiting more and more gardaí.</P>
      <P>In 1978 we recruited 717 gardaí, 670 male and 47 female; in 1979 we recruited 302 gardaí, 285 male and 17 female; in 1980 we recruited 449 gardaí, 404 male and 45 female; in 1981 we recruited 517 gardaí, 445 male and 72 female; in 1982 we recruited 983 gardaí, 925 male and 58 female; in 1983 to date we have recruited 100 gardaí and we intend to recruit somewhere in the region of 700 to 750.  All in all we have 10,888 gardaí in this country: in other words, we have a garda for every 315 people.  We must ask ourselves where is this leading us?  Is this the solution to the problem or are there other alternatives? I feel strongly that there are other alternatives but there has been a lack of will to find them.  We see politicians on television and hear them on radio boasting about the number of gardaí that have been recruited but if they were objective about the situation they would have to admit their failure to cope with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As politicians we must face up to our duties and responsibilities.  We know that jails and institutions have a low success rate.  While they succeed in punishing they do not succeed in deterring of rehabilitating and there is much evidence on <Col N="1924" /> this point.  Between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of first-time convicted prisoners go back to jail sometime in their lives. Many people sentenced to prison are convicted of petty offences but we are doing a disservice to society when this happens because often the crime does not fit the punishment.  For this reason I welcome the Community Service Bill and I regard it as a positive step forward.</P>
    <P>My reservations about the Bill are really about the politicians themselves. Sometimes I think we are our own worst enemies.  We come here and set up more bureaucratic machines without any thought as to the personnel necessary to propel such machines and some months later we find that we are merely a cog in the machines we have set up.  For example, last year we passed the Courts Bill. It was a worthy concept to transfer powers from the Circuit Court to the District Court but some months later we had on our backs the District Court clerks and our own constituents.  This was because we did not provide the District Court clerks with the personnel or facilities to implement the Bill.  Now our constituents have to wait up to nine months to get barring orders enforced, to obtain eviction orders and so forth.</P>
    <P>Last year, this House introduced a Litter Bill which was a very worthy ideal and a good concept.  Its passage through this House took many days, but the reality is that there are only 30 litter wardens.  The only people who can implement this legislation are the litter wardens, but nobody in my constituency has ever seen one.  Similarly, there are only 180 probation officers, many attached to prisons and bogged down with their existing work.  There are no spare probation officers. In other words, they must be recruited, trained and given the resources to carry out this work, or we will grind to a halt before we begin this work.</P>
    <P>When replying, would the Minister let us know the number of probation officers he intends to recruit, the training he intends to provide for them and if money has been provided in the Estimates for the implementation of this Bill?  A similar Bill has operated successfully in the United States, Canada, France, Sweden, <Col N="1925" /> England and Northern Ireland and there is no reason why it should not work here. The only reason for its failure could be if it were not properly administered.  I ask the Minister for Justice and the probation officers to put a wholehearted effort into ensuring its success.  If it fails, we have only ourselves to blame.</P>
    <P>There are many advantages to this Bill. It provides offenders with the opportunity of having a say with regard to how they will pay for their crimes and provides the courts with a choice as to the type of sentence to be imposed.  It returns something to the community which has been taken from it.  I have reservations on the type of work offenders will be asked to do.  The types suggested in the Bill would deal with mentally handicapped and other young children, with the elderly and, to some extent, with the refurbishing and construction of buildings.  These latter are preferential.</P>
    <P>Despite our large crime figures, most of the crime is committed against property. Most young offenders do not illtreat people.  A car window is broken, or a handbag is stolen.  While these offenders have some respect for people, they have no respect for property and one may ask why.  It would be easy to see why, if one had been raised in Seán MacDermott Street, in a small, enclosed environment, in a small dwelling, with no chance of ever having a large house with a garden at the back, of owning a car, or having money.  This is the only form of capitalism these people know.  For psychological purposes, it would be better to relate the work to property, so that the young people involved would realise that it costs money to replace a car window and that one has to work to get money.</P>
    <P>We all know that our prisons are bursting at the seams.  This Bill may have the effect of saving many people from imprisonment and might help that situation. Preventive measures such as this are excellent.  Imprisonment for the young is a psychological blow much worse than any physical blow.  Society is then faced with the very difficult task of getting these people to readjust and to cope with society. It would be better to leave these people in the community and let them <Col N="1926" /> serve their time working in retribution for their crimes.</P>
    <P>In welcoming this Bill, I have one reservation.  Many people convicted of crimes of vandalism are under 16, but this Bill deals only with the over sixteens. Most people begin their life of crime at 12 or 13 years of age.  If they are to be imprisoned for the first three years of their criminal life, they become <i>au fait</i> with prison values and are in the company of experienced and hardened criminals. It is virtually impossible to rehabilitate such young children.</P>
    <P>Our age of criminal responsibility, which is seven, is totally absurd, being the lowest of the whole European system. That age needs to be raised.  This matter cannot be delayed any longer and having brought this Bill successfully through the Dáil and implemented it, the Minister for Justice should turn his mind to dealing with those under 16, lest it be too late. Nobody seems able to cope with the problem of 12 year olds who eventually end up as hardened criminals.</P>
    <P>This Bill should and will work.  Given the personnel, the necessary financial resources and the will, the Minister for Justice should be able to review its success in a year's time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>: I come here to add my voice in welcome of this Bill.  Certainly, it is a step forward and is long overdue.  I hope that the Bill has been well researched as to its effectiveness and its costings.  I shall be looking through it section by section. Worthwhile contributions will be made on Committee Stage, rather than on this Stage.  There will then be a teasing out of matters relating to its effectiveness. Should this Bill fail, it would have a disastrous psychological effect on the whole community.  I hope those responsible for the framing of this Bill have had its contents well researched and are convinced of their effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can read Garda reports, in their own magazine, where they tell us that law and order are totally out of control. We have been talking about this for many years but with little or nothing being done to prevent what is now happening.  We are now reaping the results of past <Col N="1927" /> neglect.  There were many opportunities available to us and here I am not speaking only of the Department of Justice but also of the Departments of Health, Education and so on.  On a number of occasions Private Members' Bills were introduced here in an endeavour to bring about a greater realisation of the dangers of what was happening.  As Deputy David Andrews said, brutalisation seems to be the order of the day.  No longer are people safe even in our hospitals.  In Cork recently we were warned by the Garda of things happening to people and their property on their visits to hospitals.</P>
    <P>In parts of this Bill I detect a &ldquo;softly, softly&rdquo; approach.  For example, why should an offender have a choice in any court?  The provisions of this Bill will cause many complications for judges.  For example, first he must assess an offender when he will be inundated with reports of probation officers and social workers. In this respect I foresee a judge or justice postponing sentencing until such time as he has had an opportunity to consider the reports of the probation officer or social worker involved in the case.  Our courts are bogged down already by such reports. How on earth can a judge be expected, when perhaps 20 offenders may appear before him in any one day, when he will be confronted with reports about the various individuals, to make an assessment as to whether he should pronounce a sentence of jail or community work?</P>
    <P>I shall touch on just a few points to which I hope the Minister will reply later. For instance, in the case of an offender carrying out community work for so many hours a day, what protection has the person who brought that offender to court or who served as a witness in the case in court?  What supervision is there of that offender?  If he is instructed to work perhaps five hours a day on some type of community project he is then free without supervision.  These are questions I hope will be teased out on Committee Stage.  Many people contend that it would be a terrible thing that a man who broke into their house and who is now perhaps working down the road four or five hours a day is then free to come round to their <Col N="1928" /> area again.  What provisions are there in the Bill for such eventuality?  Should such an offender be brought before the court again where the judge would change the order of the sentence?</P>
    <P>I am somewhat worried also about the choice of sentence.  We all know that all provisions are abused and that when an offender appears before a judge he will know in advance exactly the kind of sentence he wants rather than the judge telling him the kind of sentence he is going to impose on him.  The Minister must take another look at the relevant section because I fear that these provisions will be interpreted by the public as a kind of &ldquo;softly, softly&rdquo; approach or an excuse to keep people out of jails, leaving our jails available for the more serious criminal only.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about work for an offender but there is no mention of preventive activity or of any training during that work period.  This is of vital importance because many young offenders come from broken homes, suffer from lack of security at home, are deprived, unemployed and lacking in education. But it would appear that all of the provisions in the Bill have been drawn merely for the sake of having offenders repay the community for what they have done, full stop, rather than involving them in some kind of rehabilitation or training as part of their sentence.  Otherwise we might as well put them in jail where together they can plan so that on their release they can continue their criminal activities.  Some part of their sentence period must be devoted to training or rehabilitation and I would ask the Minister to give this serious consideration.</P>
    <P>While on this whole subject of justice it must be remembered that over the years there have been very serious bank robberies in the perpetration of which our security forces have been placed at considerable risk.  Worse still, what about a bank manager and his family who now live in fear?  Why on earth cannot some method be devised by which a bank manager closes a bank and lodges the key of the door at the nearest Garda station until the bank is due to be reopened the following day?  To my mind the holder of <Col N="1929" /> a bank key is a man carrying a bomb. Those of us who know bank managers are aware that they and their families are now living in fear.  In this respect banks should face up to their responsibilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree but I fail to understand why, in all of the provisions of the Bill, there is not included some preventive measures such as training and so on. The Minister was afforded a tremendous opportunity in this Bill of touching on other areas such as training, prevention of certain types of crimes, especially those committed by young persons.  The previous speaker mentioned vigilantes. Community associations have a big part to play in the implementation of the provisions of the Bill.  People have a responsibility in regard to the criminals who live in their community.  Too often people are aware of what is happening in their area but do not inform the authorities concerned. On Committee Stage emphasis will have to be placed on making the legislation effective.  It is important also that the money necessary to implement its provision is made available.  Above all it is imperative that the system is properly monitored so that any changes that are necessary are made.  The legislation represents an important step forward and it would be a pity if it failed because of lack of finance or the necessary staff to implement its provisions.  That would be disastrous and it would have a serious psychological effect on the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I listened with interest to the contributions to date.  It is obvious that all Members are looking forward to the other criminal justice legislation which the Minister intends introducing shortly.  Most of the comments dealt with crime and the problems in the community but I intend to confine my self to the Bill under discussion and reserve other comments for the forthcoming legislation. Deputy Andrews expressed legitimate concern about his constituents who on <Col N="1930" /> returning from the theatre find, as he said, that their cars have been brutalised. That reflects the situation in his constituency but many people in my constituency do not have the option of going to the theatre.  They are more concerned about being able to leave their homes to go shopping or for a walk.  In that respect I should like to refer to what Deputy Myra Barry said about the number of gardaí and the tendency in recent years to continue to recruit.  I have made a point of studying the deployment and use of gardaí in my constituency and throughout Dublin and have come to the conclusion that succesive Governments seem to have overlooked the great need to examine the role of the Garda in our society and their efficiency.  It is extremely difficult to get gardaí to patrol troubled areas in my constituency following requests by shopkeepers or householders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am referring to the community service scheme and how it will operate.  It is necessary to ensure that our existing services are properly and efficiently controlled.  I do not think that is happening.  I accept that we are dealing with convicted persons and not the causes of crime in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the view of Deputy Andrews in regard to accidents caused by drunk drivers or convicted persons.  Very often such people do not realise the terrible injuries they inflict on innocent people.  I am aware of that because my father-in-law who was such a victim has been a paraplegic for four years and my brother was killed by a car.  There is merit in getting young people to visit our prisons to learn about life inside.  The Minister pointed out that where a fine was inappropriate there was no other remedy for our courts but to send people to prison and because society had to be repaid the <Col N="1931" /> Minister felt it would be appropriate if there were alternative remedies.  The word &ldquo;rehabilitation&rdquo; can be disregarded when discussing our prison system because it is not possible to rehabilitate anybody under it.  We need a committee of professional people to examine and implement proposals for the rehabilitation of prisoners.  There has been a lot of criticism by some of our judges that people have been let out of prison before their sentence was completed but such moves are often on compassionate grounds by the governors and supervisors. Very often it is through ignorance by our judges&mdash;I do not mean that in a derogatory way&mdash;that certain people are sent to prison.  When those people arrive at the prison they are graded and are not all mixed together.  We have all heard remarks, made mostly out of fear, about sending people to prison.  Most of the remarks about locking up every offender are made by those who have never visited a prison, because I so not think many people who are not directly concerned ever visit prisons.  There is room for the rehabilitation of convicted offenders under this Bill.</P>
    <P>An area requiring examination is that relating to medical officers in prisons. Their reports should be corroborated and verified before they are submitted to courts for consideration by judges.  I have had some very unpleasant experiences in this area.  I was privy to the result of an examination by a medical officer of a certain prisoner who was on a drug charge.  The person was later released but I was appalled on questioning him to find that the medical officer had merely opened the door of the visiting room and looked at the fellow for ten or 15 seconds and that that was the extent of his examination.  His recommendation to the court was that this person was a drug addict and offender who needed to be put away for a long time.  I was horrified because I know the person involved and a number of others and I will be making this point to the Minister on another Bill.</P>
    <P>Community service is an interesting innovation.  We should not simply say that because it has worked elsewhere &mdash;<Col N="1932" /> and there is no proof of that &mdash; it will work here.  There is a strong opinion that people who receive the dole should work for it.  I do not think such a system would work and the question then arises as to whether this system will work.  Will offenders work effectively for the community? I am not sure they will.  When we consider the position in relation to legitimate employment we see there is much laziness in public bodies such as corporations and county councils and in semi-State bodies such as CIE and Aer Lingus.  These people are paid well and enjoy security but it is very difficult to get some of them to work.  We all know of complaints about the services provided by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and others.  The Minister is expecting minor miracles in believing that people who have been convicted of offences will work effectively in the community. How is this to be achieved?  Some offenders may not look on such work as punishment.  Where then is the deterrent?</P>
    <P>I am not saying that in every case people should be imprisoned.  From my attendance at meetings I know that there is a great lack of understanding and people who do not know what they are talking about suggest that everybody who commits an offence should be put away. Usually it does not affect the people who make this suggestion but sometimes members of respectable families can have a brush with drugs and panic then sets in. There is no lonelier or more neglected place than prison because a prisoner is forgotten about and there is very little public awareness of what that person goes through.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see coming from this Bill another army of dossers because we must be very conscious of our work ethic.  We must get away from the &ldquo;soft job&rdquo; attitude and the lack of determination to work.  Projects should be given to individuals, not groups.  It would be very difficult to have groups of offenders working together.  That would entail one supervisor to every five or six people even if they were spread through the community. I asked what punishment would be available in the event of work not being <Col N="1933" /> carried out properly.  I see that the Minister has a remedy in that he can bring offenders back to the courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister favours a wide range of sanctions for the courts and that is not a bad thing because our judges are restricted as to what they can do in the case of offenders in certain circumstances. There are some people who might just have a brush with crime and it is unfortunate when they have to be sent to prison.  It is good to widen the choice available to judges.  Criticism of the Judiciary will be even greater than at present for failures under this system. The Judiciary are not adequately safeguarded under this Bill in relation to decisions they might make.  I will be seeking amendments so that the high standards of our Judiciary can be maintained and not weakened as a result of this measure. On the other hand, decisions as to sentencing under this Bill will be made by people who are not entirely familiar with or suitable to decide when community service should be done by an offender.  Sentences will be passed by people who have never dirtied their hands and would not know what work is effective and rehabilitative.  The work must be such as to enable satisfaction to be derived from it by the offenders, jobs which give a sense of achievement such as properly building a stone wall.</P>
    <P>I know of a case a long time ago where there was a serious robbery committed in Dublin and one of the offenders was sentenced to prison.  He was a very competent person with his hands and he overhauled every machine in Mountjoy while he was there.  There was not enough for him to do but it probably helped him to keep his sanity.  It would be admirable if we could suit the work available to the skills of the offender.</P>
    <P>There are interesting jobs which can be done, which one gets satisfaction out of doing, such as draining land, cleaning a river and other jobs like that, which might be suitable to the community but there is not much hope of a decent amount of work being done.  There may be a stigma attached to such work by an offender but that might be part of the punishment.  There is a provision in the <Col N="1934" /> Bill for an offender to be able to discretely carry out this work.  We all make mistakes and do things we very often regret and we would like to make amends for.  If we could make amends quietly we would feel satisfied if we were given the opportunity to do that.  We should not make a big issue of this and those offenders should not have to wear distinctive clothing, be paraded down the streets or marched up by uniformed officers to certain areas to carry out this work.  That would not be rehabilative but rather humiliating.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned accommodation in prisons and he referred to the relative comfort of a cell and stated:</P>
    <P>Unlike prisoners in many other countries in western Europe most of our prisoners enjoy the relative comfort of a cell each.</P>
    <P>What is meant by that?  I presume the Minister has visited prisons and places of detention.  There is very little comfort in a cell and there is nothing comfortable about the edifice on the north side of the city, which was built over a century ago. A cell might be a place where one might go mad or hang oneself, as happened too often in the past.  Maybe it is a place to contemplate.</P>
    <P>It is a good idea that first offenders are given the option of carrying out community work.  I am not too happy about the method used by the Department of Justice in hoodwinking the people of Clondalkin in the way they set about building a women's prison there.  Now it seems to be a much larger undertaking than was envisaged although there were many protestations from the people in that part of my constituency.  I understand the building there is to open soon as a general prison.  Government Departments should not set out to fool people.  Deputies have the right to ensure that we get honest answers from Departments in relation to such undertakings.  This was well in train before I was elected and I hope it works out all right.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be very suitable in relation to women prisoners.  I visited the women's prison in Mountjoy a few times. There were only a few prisoners in an <Col N="1935" /> appalling building.  Those prisoners are very badly catered for.  There were 16 when I visited this prison and all of them could be let out and supervised.  On one occasion when I visited this prison I was appalled to see two 16 year old girls on totally unsuitable sentences.  Those girls were drug addicts and should not have been in that prison.  There was no rehabilitation possibility for them there.  They had locked themselves in their cells for a couple of weeks because another prisoner, who was also on a drug charge, had come in and they were terrified of that person.  We have had very few women prisoners in the past and very little attempt was made to rehabilitate them. Some of the offences they were in for, such as street offences, are so trivial nowadays, by comparison with what goes on, that they should never have been put into prison.  I hope, when women prisoners come before the courts in the future, that the courts will recognise the enormous good quality of the female population and how seldom they have offended the criminal law.  Services should have been provided for those people to avoid sending them to prison.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated when introducing the Second Stage:</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that where a person is convicted of an offence for which the court considers that in the ordinary way the appropriate sentence would be one of imprisonment, the court may, with the offender's consent, instead order him to perform a specified number of hours of unpaid work.  The work contemplated is work of a kind that will benefit the community but that people cannot readily be got to do in the ordinary way for pay.</P>
    <P>When I read that I asked myself who wrote this?  What work is the writer talking about?  Is he a civil servant, does he know what is going on in the real world where one has to work?  I remember crawling through 22 inch sewerage pipes with two law degrees in my back pocket for pay.  What work is the writer saying here can be done under the Bill that cannot to done for pay?  Almost anything <Col N="1936" /> will be done for pay.  The unemployment problem would be less severe it there was a lot of this type of work for which it was decided to offer money, whether it is work under water, people having to go through pipes, do sludge clearance, mining, sewerage clearing, dredger work or anything else like that.  It is not so long ago when there were no flush toilets in the dressing rooms in the Phoenix Park and they were able to get people to go there with horses and carts to empty out the latrines.  There were also jobs around the city where ashes were collected on carts.  There were other jobs where people went around to collect the food scraps from houses to feed pigs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am drifting a little bit but I am directly relating what I am saying to the work which the Minister spoke about. This is where I believe the Bill has flaws in it because the wrong people are deciding about the matter again as happened in the past.  I accept your ruling.  I was going to talk about the appalling kind of jobs that are done for pay.  I believe that work without pay is out.  The list of jobs given in the Bill are very soft by comparison with what people who are in paid employment have to do.  There are many people who would gladly change their job if they could do some of the work which is suggested in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is out of touch with reality. There is a void between the administrators and the community.  It is the community which is suffering and which would know best what should be done to help it.  It was a grave error to set someone up in a lofty office far away from all the trouble and set down what he thinks should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to a sub-committee of distinguished lawyers, academics, sociologists and public servants which was set up in Britain and considered for four years what changes might be made to existing non-custodial sentences.  People who are terrorised by <Col N="1937" /> vandals were not taken into consideration when the Bill was drafted.  The opinions of the majority of people are never sought and one would think it is deliberate that a few people decide what should be done for the majority.  I hope the idea of such a committee is scrapped.  It was used in the past but did not work.  What would lawyers and academics know about the conditions that would give rise to these situations?  What would they know about the remedies when they do not know the causes?</P>
    <P>I am a working-class person who struggled against the odds to go through the legal system.  It was easy for me to see the void which exists between the legal profession and the man in the street.  I was not welcome and it was not made easy for me to enter the system.  The ordinary person has to kick the door down to get in and fight his way through to survive within it.  These people are not suitable to look down on the terrible conditions and atrocious problems inflicted on the community as a result of lawlessness and disorder and decide what is good for the community.  The remedy lies within the community.  They must be consulted. This is making the mistake of the rulers knowing what is best for the downtrodden.</P>
    <P>The source of this document is British legislation.  Much of British law has been transferred into our laws.  We are aping Britain unnecessarily.  We cross the sea to get their legislation as if we could not formulate our own unique answer to this problem.  Did my distinguished colleague, Deputy Kelly, not warn the House about following Britain's lead in everything?  The class system still exists in Britain.  We know how unsuitable British answers for Irish questions were in the past.  We can formulate our own answers and do not need the cuddled, protected-from-inflation and recession-proof lawyers of the British system to outline the answers to our community problems.  We need a sympathetic but firm body of Irish people who are familiar with the problems to formulate an answer which, because of its unique Irishness, will best suit the situation.  We must grasp this opportunity.  We are capable of doing <Col N="1938" /> so.  We have plenty of talent.  The business community are at their best as are the professions.  Both can take on anyone in the world.</P>
    <P>We have always had a great understanding of other people.  However, it is difficult for people from across the water to understand the kind of people we are. Yet, what do we do?  We take a British Act and try to suit it to an Irish situation by summarising its principles and putting them before the House.  It is almost an insult to the House.  Although the principle is good it is not necessarily the correct solution.  However, it is the only one before the House and we must decide on it.  Perhaps by commenting on the Bill it will be changed and we will come up with something more suitable to our needs.</P>
    <P>I know this measure has been taken separately from the Bill which will come before the House in the next few weeks. Perhaps if we waited until after that Bill becomes law we could give better effect to community service.  I would welcome a complete review of the custodial system in addition to a review of the court system, sentencing, the education of lawyers, the appointment of judges, the removal of judges and the monitoring of their performance, plus the efficiency of the Garda Force in their operations.  As Deputy Myra Barry said we have bragged about successive Ministers increasing the Force every year.  We now have 10,000 gardaí but no one has asked if the Force is efficient, how easy it is to get gardaí out on patrol and how well they are doing.  However, that is a different area, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I do not want to try your patience by referring to it.</P>
    <P>I would welcome an overhaul of the entire custodial system, but not by a sub-committee of distinguished laywers, academics, sociologists and public servants. What is so distinguished about lawyers except for the amount of influence they can muster, the money they earn, whether they win or lose, and the political influence they can bring to bear on their careers?</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his statement that the Bill we are debating coincides, to some extent, with the relevant British <Col N="1939" /> legislation although the opportunity has been taken to improve where possible, in the light of British experience, on the corresponding British legislation.  It is terrible that we have so many educated, qualified and suitable people who cannot draw up our own Bill without basing it on Bills in other countries.  I am not sure whether it will suit.  We are told the pilot scheme was extended throughout Britain and seems to be doing very well. Research would have to be done to verify that and I do not think the problems of a population of 60 million people are comparable to the problems of a population of our size.  We are looking for a specialised package in our community, say in Dublin city, and then one for the other large cities and towns and I do not see why we cannot come up with our own solution.  Have we no initiative?  Confidence and imagination may be lacking in the Department of Justice, the Department of Finance and the civil service generally; it is not lacking in Irish people or Irish business but it awaits positive initiatives from those Departments.  I have no doubt that those initiatives will be forthcoming from the Government.</P>
    <P>There are different grades of prisoners and, without having heard what criminologists say, I imagine they would be composed of first offenders and unfortunate people who become entangled with crime through falling in with the wrong company.  Then there are more hardened offenders, gang leaders and organised crime godfathers.  These categories should be graded so that community service would help to rehabilitate them. I am not talking about the prison system because this Bill is talking about offenders and this is an opportunity for us to instal a rehabilitative system, because when habitual offenders are absorbed into the prison system, it is very difficult to rehabilitate them.  Usually, as they grow older, they stop committing offences and there are not many old people in prison.</P>
    <P>There has been an explosion of petty crime which has led to more serious crime in the last five or ten years and many people have fallen into these early categories. <Col N="1940" /> This is an opportunity to rehabilitate more people.  Prisons are not big enough to hold all our offenders but there is an opportunity here provided we are able to apprehend them.  There is no mention of that and there is an assumption I cannot go into here, because it is not contained in the Bill, that we will be able to apprehend offenders and that the large numbers of crimes committed in the community will be detected, that the offenders will be brought before the courts, that this Bill will be enforced and that the judge will be able to make decisions based on it.  I do not see how you are going to have a massive increase in detection of crime and convictions, given the sluggishness of our court system, how difficult it is to apprehend people and the number of gardaí and their efficiency.  We are talking about existing offenders.  We will be able to filter them through this system and get them into community service but we will still have the main body of criminal activity and criminals operating.  That needs to be tackled separately but it is another day's work.</P>
    <P>In Canada there is a provision for model prisoners who, when they come into prison, are quickly spotted.  They are given an opportunity within the system to behave like normal people outside. They are graded and put into less restrictive prisons and quickly brought back into society.  There is no possibility of rehabilitation in Irish prisons, certainly not in Mountjoy.  That can be easily verified. One would have to have non-association with experienced offenders. In relation to the type of work in the community, I envisage offenders doing strenuous work with a very high achievement rate, with physical and mental training during that term because I am terrified of the chances of people falling into a dosser mould.  So many jobs and companies have been destroyed by elements who will not work themselves or will not let anyone else work.  It is a great responsibility on whoever is going to supervise this system to make sure that it works properly.</P>
    <P>I do not think that probation and welfare officers at the moment are geared to supervise the work of offenders.  That <Col N="1941" /> area must be investigated very thoroughly and costed by the Department, otherwise we will have something of the magnitude of AnCO and its inefficiency looking after our offenders.  There is no use in bringing people out and saying, &ldquo;There you are, work away at that&rdquo;. These people must be qualified and trained and know what they are doing.  I hope that some thought will be given to that.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned a phrase which I suppose I am harping on, &ldquo;useful work&rdquo;, work which no one else would do, for which they could be paid.  I do not think that any such thing exists.  The Minister has talked about useful work done which otherwise might not be done.  That is a contradiction in terms.  The Minister referred to the lack of funds for this service because of restraints on the economy at present.  I hope that he will enter very carefully into the long-term cost of providing this service.  Too often we set up a scheme and start off something that will cost £100,000, £200,000, then it is £2 million, and then £12 million. We had that in school transport which was to cost £1.3 million and now it is £33 million.  Someone with foresight must look at the problem.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate in having one of the lowest prison populations in Europe. This Bill makes an attempt, maybe worth-while, to resist an increase in our prison population.  The only way of doing that is to have this Community Service Bill which provides that offenders can go out into the community, but I hope as a result of that we will not end up with a whole population of criminals outside all the time.  The slow down of the rate of increase in the number of offenders being committed to custody could mean that with a large number of clever offenders we would have a growing known number of criminal population among the community, and that would be bad.  That is why we must be careful to make sure that this system is not capable of being manipulated by unscrupulous criminals who are able to use it to continue with their criminal activity.  I am sorry to be cynical about the position of getting people to work for nothing when the soft <Col N="1942" /> job, so to speak, is so sought after in Irish life and very often we cannot get people to work in well-paid, secure jobs.  Perhaps the Minister will consider employing some of these people in some Departments of the public service and semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>I like the idea that the community are being given an opportunity to involve themselves in dealing with their members who step out of line.  That is an important observation by the Minister because it shows an understanding that respectable, first class citizens can slip up.  A member of our society who just happens to do something stupid or make a mistake has an opportunity of restoring quickly his integrity in the community.  I feel deeply for such people when they end up behind bars, particularly those who merely make a mistake.  Such institutions as, say, Mountjoy are very severe in their administration but I know that the governors there do an excellent job in grading and keeping the different wings and floors separated so that possible &mdash; if I may use the word &mdash; contamination is less likely to occur when an offender first enters. Depending on the seriousness of his crime, he has an opportunity to segregate himself from habitual offenders.  Such a person as that can go through hell while behind bars.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate if such people are mixed with criminals.  One deterrent against acts which can mean imprisonment is the knowledge that prisoners have practically no sympathy from the community and anyone incarcerated in prison is presumed to be guilty, to have done wrong.  There is an understandable desire on the part of terrorised members of our community to lock up everybody who is causing trouble, but that is not entirely the solution to that problem.  It should be mandatory for the people envisaged by this Bill to pay visits to prisons such as Mountjoy and examine the routine there.  It might be difficult to have conducted tours but such persons would be offenders and therefore entitled to go.  To one spending time just walking around that institution the sight of people being locked up for the night, having to pick up their breakfast and go back to <Col N="1943" /> their cells to eat it behind locked doors, the same for lunch, having to go in single file and being totally supervised, would in itself be a deterrent.  Then that offender could go about his community service in the knowledge that should he not carry out fully the order of the court he will end up in that prison.  The realisation of where he could end up would be a natural deterrent to his offending again. I often feel that a tour or visit by schoolchildren to Mountjoy Jail would be more beneficial than a tour of Leinster House. It might teach them to stay out of trouble. Prospective offenders cannot envisage the depressing awfulness of prison and that is why I think that what I have suggested would be beneficial.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the judge dealing with the case is required to satisfy himself that the offender is a suitable person for community service and for this purpose he must consider a report about the offender prepared by a probation and welfare officer.  This is indulging in guesswork, not judgment.  It is unfair to judges in the event of future criticisms as a result of an abuse by an offender.  I am concerned that our Judiciary will be subject to criticisms of this kind because they are dealing with very large numbers of cases. This kind of sentence is very liberal and light and the intention is to rehabilitate, but it can easily be abused.</P>
    <P>If a community service order has been invoked and an offender is working for a private individual and something serious happens, there is the possibility that the judge might be criticised very severely. This legislation says that the judge must satisfy himself that the offender is a suitable person for community services.  How does he do that, especially if the person is a first offender?  A judge does not know what the future holds for any individual, but if an offender commits a crime while carrying out work under the community services scheme the judge should not be held responsible.  This Bill should be amended on Committee Stage and I will put down an amendment to ensure that our Judiciary, who have been severely criticised in recent times, will not be abused and lose the confidence of the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1944" /> There must be a rehabilitative content in the order.  The mental state of an offender should be taken into consideration. The mental state of an offender who commits his first offence might be such that he cannot take on a job and he may be so depressed that he is unable to work. I do not see any mention in this legislation of psychiatric or other tests for such offenders.  Before an offender is sentenced he has the option to choose to do community work or accept another sentence. He may be so shocked at the prospect of having to spend time in prison that he might not be able to opt for this scheme or, having chosen community work, he might not be able to carry it through.  There should be a provision in the Bill to cover such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was considering the feasibility of establishing a committee to monitor the operation of the scheme. The committee will consist of voluntary and official social aid groups, the Judiciary, trade unions and employers.  I will be referring many times to the non-political appointment of committees made up of members of the Judiciary and other bodies.  I appeal to the Minister to be very prudent when appointing members to these committees.  I applaud his statement that an important aim of this Bill is to try to ensure that compliance with the community service order does not jeopardise the defendant's employment or his availability for employment or unduly disrupt family life.  This is a very far-seeing approach because it allows a person who steps out of line to make amends and to get back into the community.  One of the flaws of our present system is that if a person makes one slip he is on record and put into prison from which he might never mentally or physically recover.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very imaginative, but we must ensure that nobody abuses it.  If an offender is sentenced to do work under this scheme it should not be in his own area where he could be recognised by his neighbours and friends who would know he had committed an offence and had to do this work.  Some people might say that this information should be published, but with this far-seeing improvement we should allow the offender to do the work <Col N="1945" /> in another district where he will not be recognised.  This will enable him to get back into the community and nobody will be any the wiser.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the selection and training of staff.  I hope it will not lead to another AnCO.  Getting people to work and knowing how to motivate them is not a job for the amateur or for the person who does not know what he is doing.  The probation officers and social welfare officers have the job of watching prisoners, but the people working in this scheme should be professionals. They should know how to tackle the job; they should strive for a sense of achievement and when they go home at night they should feel they have given something back to the people with whom they were dealing.  It is no use letting them loose.  I am very concerned about this talk of the work ethic and so on. There are thousands of people in our public service and semi-State institutions, in secure pensionable jobs who, even though they have well paid pensionable guaranteed employment, will not work, do not know how to work and will not let anyone else work.  It would be detrimental, therefore, if people who are unskilled in this area were given the task of supervising and operating this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is with great reservations that I welcome the principle of the Bill.  I will not say that I reject the taking, almost verbatim, of a British Act, but it is unsuitable in an Irish context.  Several times this Bill makes reference to the British measure and gives quotations from it.  One sentence refers to the relevant British legislation and the British experience.  It refers to &ldquo;the corresponding British experience&rdquo;.  I do not think it should be necessary for us to do that.  Indeed we might ask ourselves what are the people in the various Departments doing.  When they are given a task to do by the Minister for Justice they apparently ring up the Ministry of Justice in Westminister and ask them to send them a copy of their Act.  Then they trot it out here, present it to the House and we have to discuss and pass it instead of an original Bill <Col N="1946" /> which we think would be best suited for the country.</P>
    <P>We should produce our own solution for an Irish problem.  It is laughable in 1983, after all the trouble we have had over the centuries and the complaints we have had about aping and following the British, that we should have a Bill based on the British Act.  I am not criticising the British but we have the ability to produce our own solution.  In the past we have always said that British solutions did not suit Irish problems.  We should be coming up with our own Bill.  It is disgraceful that we should have an almost verbatim copy of something in existence in Britain.  We are capable of doing better and I recommend to the Minister that he does not bring this Bill into force until after the introduction of his Criminal Justice Bill which we expect to be before us soon.  I am sure many Members will be contributing at length to that Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will be a lot briefer and a lot blunter than my friend and colleague, Deputy Skelly.  I do not welcome the Bill with the degree of enthusiasm of my colleagues.  I accept it is an attempt to introduce a theory into the fight against crime, but I came into politics because of my deep concern about law and order.  I come from a town, Dundalk, with the highest crime rate outside Dublin.  The restoration of law and order to the streets of cities and towns must be our prime objective.</P>
      <P>The proper time to talk about law and order at length will be when the Criminal Justice Bill comes before the House, but we cannot divorce law and order from this Bill.  I suppose my views on this question would be considered a throw-back to another age.  I have no doubt they would be scoffed at by many legal and academic people.  I belong to the hang them and flog them brigade, and I do not make any apologies for it.  I indict successive Governments and Dálaí for their failure to come to grips with something that is causing great distress in every village and town throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, my views may be scoffed at by theorists and sociologists but I believe they are being echoed by the <Col N="1947" /> ordinary man in the street.  Deputy Skelly, being very compassionate, expressed a lot of concern for criminals and for their comfort in the various prisons. My concern is for the victims of those criminals.  Sociologists, do-gooders and liberals have gone too far.  The incidence of liberal thought in the Judiciary has gone from one extreme to another, and politicians have sat by and allowed the Judiciary to do it, probably thinking that politicians have no function in the matter.  I take issue with that viewpoint. Judges are appointed by the political system and are paid from public funds.  They have a lot to answer for in the matter of maintaining law and order.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions have been made by different people, but I believe the best rehabilitative process is through deterrents. It is the absence of deterrents that has brought law and order to its knees here.  The only growth industry in this country seems to be contempt for law and order.  We have apologists for crime and criminals: we have people agonising over what makes people commit crime. We have people apologising for criminals because, perhaps, their mothers let them fall on their sides when they were kids.  I do not accept these various theories.  I believe criminals must be punished and, as I have said, it is the absence of the application of the deterrents which are available to the Judiciary that has resulted in the appalling escalation of crime.</P>
    <P>I have strong reservations and grave doubts about the Bill because I do not believe it can be operational or functional. While possibly it is excellent in theory, I do not believe it will meet with any degree of success.  The answer to crime is the restoration of discipline in society.  I should like to see discipline restored in our schools where it was abolished recently.  Discipline must then come into the District Courts and the Circuit Courts.  We need more jails.  We need a jail in every county.  If there is a necessity for a jail in every county we should build jails.  We can provide millions of pounds for fly-by-night American companies.  We can grant-assist many <Col N="1948" /> doubtful industries.  We can come to the assistance of many companies, and even buy them on behalf of the State, which have proved unsuccessful in private hands.  We must provide money to build more jails.</P>
    <P>The average man in the street is crying out for the restoration of law and order. With due respect to the Minister this Bill is unrealistic.  I want to pose a question: how many crimes will be committed by people doing community work?  We have seen the unholy spectacle of bail.  People are now let out on bail for murder, which used to be the ultimate crime.  There are many recorded instances of people committing serious crimes while out on bail. As an ordinary citizen I object to bail for serious crimes, particularly murder.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the crime of murder has been downgraded from being the ultimate crime to being a nine days wonder. Recently two unhappy sentences were recorded in the courts in relation to the horrible crime of murder.  People are deeply aggrieved at the sentences meted out on both those occasions.  The Garda have been criticised.  I should like to go on record with a vote of confidence in the Garda.  We have an excellent force, on a par with any police force in western Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am like the reporter with a ten page story and only two columns to report it.  I welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue.  Making the wrongdoer compensate the community is an old concept, but making the wrongdoer contribute a service to the community is a new one.  I <Col N="1949" /> do not agree fully with the sentiments of the previous speaker when he said discipline is the way to eliminate crime.  The Garda Síochána report for 1981-82 shows there was in increase of 23 per cent in crime.  The increase in crime and the increase in social problems go hand in hand.  Crime is on the increase because the gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged in our society is becoming wider and wider.</P>
      <P>Poverty in the form of lack of job opportunities and lack of recreational facilities must be one of the reasons for the increase in crime.  The concept of community service is a good one.  Unless we wean people from crime at an early stage, they will progress to the more serious types of crime.  We can help to reduce the effects of crime by introducing a Bill such as this but unless we get down to eliminating poverty in our society, we will never succeed completely in eliminating crime.  I am not suggesting for a moment that crime is confined to people who are unemployed and living in disadvantaged areas, but those problems are contributory factors.  I am trying to be as brief as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome the concept of community service, but the success of the Bill depends on co-operation between a number of important groups, the co-operation of the Garda which we know will be forthcoming, combined with the co-operation of the community associations, the public at large and the probation service.  This co-operation is vital.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the setting up of Garda stations in new areas.  In the development of new areas and the provision of essential infrastructural services, this has been overlooked. Unless we set up our Garda stations at the development stage in new areas, it is difficult subsequently to get the Garda accepted as another part of the community. This should be considered by the Minister in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention the question <Col N="1950" /> of parental control.  Many of the crimes we see reported in newspapers are committed by young people.  I cannot understand how young people can gain access to alcoholic drink so easily.  There is an onus on the Garda and the community to ensure that access to alcoholic drink is difficult for young people.</P>

      <P>: Today, I am looking to this House for solidarity and support for the people of Central America in their struggle for justice and survival.</P>
      <P>In matters of gross and persistent violation of human rights; in situations of extreme human suffering, where basic survival is at stake, then, those of us who enjoy the full freedom of a democratic society must take up the task of denouncing these crimes against humanity which are taking place in Central America.  The situation in Guatemala and El Salvador is morally intolerable and demands a bold stance and courageous action from those of us who are motivated by a deep sense of compassion for the victims of these horrible crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 10th December 1981 this House debated the situation in El Salvador and called for a negotiated political settlement to solve the deep crisis of that country. Today the situation has not improved and indeed it is worsening.  The conflict in Guatemala has reached dimensions almost as serious and as grotesque as El Salvador and now we have what is termed a &ldquo;covert&rdquo; war trying to destabilise the Sandinista Government in neighbouring <Col N="1952" /> Nicaragua.  This war is being waged from Honduras and tension is now so high between these two countries that there exists a possibility of full-scale war.  Any one looking at a map of Central America will realise that such a war could ignite the whole of the region.  It is crucial, therefore, that major efforts be made to solve these problems, before Central America becomes yet another quagmire into which the prospects for world peace sink deeper.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we here in Ireland have a special interest in the region because of the vital and courageous work which our missionaries are carrying out.  I have been privileged to meet with them on the ground in El Salvador and in Nicaragua, when I travelled there with the Inter-Parliamentary delegation in January 1982.  I have seen at first hand the atrocious conditions and constant fear under which they must work.  I publicly pay tribute to the Franciscan Fathers and the Holy Claire Sisters for their work on behalf of the voiceless and the oppressed and for their courage in staying with their parishioners. Lest any of you think that I might be overstating the case, let me say that 26 priests and sisters have been killed in Guatemala and in El Salvador in the last two years including, of course, Archbishop Romero, of San Salvador shot while saying Mass in March of 1980.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for most people to come to terms with the dimension of repression in Central America.  During the Civil War in Nicaragua an estimated 60,000 people were killed.  From the coup in El Salvador in October 1979 until the end of January 1983 the Human Rights Commission of El Salvador quoted a figure of 46,637 people killed.  In Guatemala the Justice and Peace Committee detailed the Killing of over 10,000 Indian peasants since President Rios Montt took over in a coup of March 1982.  Social, economic and cultural rights are virtually non-existent today in Central America.  Torture, disapperances, assassination and wholesale massacres by the official security forces&mdash;police and military&mdash;and death squads and paramilitary groups continue <Col N="1953" /> to be persistent and systematic, particularly in Guatemala and El Salvador.</P>
    <P>There have been very many international delegations representing government and private organisations visiting the Central American region in the last few years.  Reports have been published by these delegations, which include among others members of the European Parliament, the Irish Inter-Parliamentary delegation, Canadian Parliamentary delegation, members of the US Senate and Congress, The Council of Europe, the British Council of Churches, and the Canadian Inter-Church Committee on Human Rights in Latin America. All of these delegations conclude that the systematic pattern of human rights violations within El Salvador continues to be perpetrated by the Salvadorean authorities. Moreover, each delegation has had extensive documentation provided to it by the Human Rights Committee of El Salvador and the Legal Aid Centre of the Archdiocese of San Salvador.  This documentation includes personal testimonies, photographic material, and statistical reports which can be backed up by full files of information maintained in El Salvador.</P>
    <P>The Army and the three major security forces are singled out as being the primary sources of institutional violence in El Salvador.  They work alongside civil defence units in combined operations and they act in conjunction with Orden, a paramilitary right-wing group, which the Salvadorean Government claim was officially disbanded in 1979.  Amnesty International, however, in a book published only two months ago state:</P>
    <P>Testimonies received daily by Amnesty International implicate all branches of the Salvadorean Security Services in the killings.  In addition to the regular armed forces, El Salvador also relies on special security forces such as the National Guard, which combines police and military functions, the National Police and the Treasury Police.  All those units have repeatedly been named in reports of political killings.  Recently, a special new unit trained by US military advisers <Col N="1954" /> has been blamed repeatedly for killing of unarmed peasants in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Turning to Guatemala, the situation there regarding the behaviour of the armed forces and civilian army auxiliaries known as `Civil Defence Patrols' is no better.  Survival International on 3 September 1982; the Institute for Policy Studies and Council on Hemispheric Affairs, August 1982; and the Inter-American Human Rights Commission of the Organisation of American States in August 1982 issued statements in which they lay the blame for the brutality and genocide occurring within Guatemala squarely on the shoulders of the Guatemalan Government.  Moreover, Amnesty International, on the basis of extensive documentation received from March to July 1982, accused the Guatemalan Armed Forces of widespread killing, including the extra-judicial execution of large numbers of rural non-combatants, including entire families as well as persons suspected of sympathy with opposition groups.</P>

      <P>: The argument has sometimes been used that much of the violence in Central America has been carried out by right wing death squads who are isolated from the normal functioning of the security forces.  In this regard, it is useful to recall the testimony of the Salvadorean army captain which was made before the US House Appropriation Sub-Committee in April 1981. Captain Faillos testified as follows:</P>
      <P>It is a grievous error to believe that the forces of the extreme right, or the so-called death squads operate independently of the Security Forces.  The simple truth of the matter is that the death squads are made up of members of the Security Forces and acts of terrorism credited to the squads, such as political assassinations, kidnappings and indiscriminate murder are, in fact, planned by high ranking military officers and carried out by members of the Security Forces.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes hard to grasp the dimension of the human tragedy which lies behind these types of statistics.  However, on March 13 of this year, one woman was killed in El Salvador.  She was somebody who was well known to many Members of this House &mdash; Marianella Garcia, cofounder of the El Salvador Human Rights Commission.  Her death deprives Latin America of one of its most brilliant and fearless campaigners for human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I first had the privilege of meeting Marianella Garcia at a Council of Europe Colloquium on Human Rights in Latin America held in Madrid in September of 1981.  Subsequent to that, I organised a meeting with 22 representatives of Dáil Éireann on a visit by her to Dublin.  I had an opportunity to study, at first hand, the method of work carried out by her <Col N="1956" /> commission when she briefed me and other members of the Inter-Parliamentary delegation prior to our visit to El Salvador in January 1982.</P>
    <P>Marianella Garcia came from a well-to-do family and had established herself as one of the country's most promising criminal lawyers by the time political disappearances began to cause disquiet in 1977.  She was a member of the Salvadorean Parliament and of the Christian Democratic Party.  She was a professional woman from a privileged Salvadorean home.  She gave up this life of ease and luxury to struggle against repression in her own country.  Marianella travelled frequently to Europe to give testimony to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights about the disappearances and violence that went on in El Salvador. She had survived several attempts on her life, including one in 1978 when her home was bombed and a year later her car was fired on in broad daylight in San Salvador.</P>
    <P>In 1979, while defending two young political prisoners in court, as she left the courtroom she was picked up by the National Guard who, acting on the advice of one of the judges, who was unable to deal with her competence in the court, had her interrogated in an attempt to intimidate her.  However, she persisted with her work, meticulously following up every reported case of corpses which appeared on the rubbish heaps of San Salvador and endlessly presenting writs of <i>habeas corpus</i> on behalf of the families of disappeared persons.  Marianella was finally forced to flee to Mexico early in 1981 after her name was published on a &ldquo;death list&rdquo; which was handed out to the national press in El Salvador by the military. From Mexico, she took over the international dimension of the Human Rights Committee's work, travelling to many countries and presenting the information which had been made available to her commission.  It was Marianella's desire to fulfil that task with complete accuracy that led directly to her death.  During recent months, there has been growing evidence that the military in El Salvador have obtained from some source chemical agents, including <Col N="1957" /> napalm, and are using them against the civilian population.  Because two of the Human Rights Commission's best workers had disappeared last August, the commission were having difficulty in gathering the necessary evidence in such a way that it could be presented to the UN Human Rights Commission.  Marianella took the decision in mid-January to go back into El Salvador to document the growing incidence of refugees with burns and blisters which would show the use of chemical agents.</P>
    <P>Marianella Garcia was killed by the military some time between the evening of 13 March and 14 March, 1983, as she interviewed a group of 20 refugees in a camp some 25 km outside San Salvador, the capital.  The details of her body injuries have led many organisations to believe that she was tortured before being killed.  She had several bullet wounds in her head, part of her left arm was blown away, there were dozens of deep lacerations all over her body and both her legs were broken.  The military of El Salvador issued a statement that Marianella Garcia had been killed when she was leading a guerrilla group.  To those of us who knew this respectable, dedicated and meticulous lawyer who had steadfastly refused to join any of El Salvador's opposition organisations, this claim is as ridiculous as her murder was revolting.  It seems strange to all of us who knew her that Marianella Garcia should herself have become yet another victim of the brutality in El Salvador.</P>
    <P>One thing can be said with almost total certainty and that is that no-one will ever appear in court or be sentenced for the murder of Marianella Garcia.  The judicial system in El Salvador and, indeed, in Guatemala is totally ineffective.  Those members of the official security and parliamentary forces responsible for the torture, disappearance and assassination of tens of thousands of Salvadoreans have never been prosecuted or sentenced in court.</P>
    <P>Even in the cases of those US citizens who have been killed in El Salvador and in spite of intense pressure by the United States Administration for an adequate <Col N="1958" /> investigation, there has not yet been a single case of anyone formally sentenced in court for the murders of the four North American sisters, or the two North American land reform advisers who were shot dead in the coffee shop of the Sheraton Hotel in 1981.  Regarding the case of the US nuns and the lay missionary, which is of particular interest to us here in Ireland, given that Jean Donovan had studied in this country for over a year, the families of these missionaries have stated publicly in the United States that there has been a consistent attempt to cover up for the high-ranking military officers who were responsible for their murder.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, the Irish papers have carried details of the decision to formally delay the prosecution of five low-ranking members of the National Guard who were arrested in conjunction with the murder of the nuns.  If this case seems to be blatant in its disregard for basic justice, then the manner in which the two persons accused of killing the North American land reform advisers is even more bizarre.  Both of these were placed under the jurisdiction of the Fifth Penal Court in El Salvador.  However, one of the accused, a Captain Avila, disappeared from El Salvador and is reputed to be living in a neighbouring country. The second officer, Lieutenant Lopez, according to the <i>New York Times</i> report of November 4, 1982, is now living in the safety of Miami and two judges have ruled that there is insufficient evidence to try him.</P>
    <P>Another result of the violence in both Guatemala and El Salvador is the huge number of refugees and dispossessed people who have been forced to flee from their homes.  As we have heard repeatedly, El Salvador is only the size of Munster and has a population of 4,500,000. One million Salvadoreans have been forced to leave their country as a result of the violence.</P>
    <P>Half a million of them have left to seek refuge in neighbouring countries living a difficult life as refugees.  Their situation has grown more precarious during 1982 as violence has increased in many countries in Central America.  The borders of <Col N="1959" /> El Salvador have become militarised and many thousands of refugees have been killed trying to escape to the relative freedom of Honduras.  This was highlighted for us by the <i>Sunday Times</i> in <i>May of 1980</i> when they informed us of the murder of 600 Salvadoreans trying to cross the River Sumpul into Honduras.</P>
    <P>Moreover, throughout the course of 1982 the International Community, through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, have been alerted to the serious difficulties facing the estimated 100,000 Guatemalan refugees who have sought refuge within Mexico's borders. The Bishop of Chiapas in Mexico published a pastoral letter in August of 1982 in which he detailed the impunity with which members of the armed forces of Guatemala were able to cross the border and intervene in refugee camps removing innocent civilians who subsequently disappeared and were killed. Accurate statistical data on the extent of the number of displaced people inside Guatemala is difficult to obtain.  However, the Guatemalan Bishops have estimated that up to one million persons have been displaced within the country and an additional 200,000 peasants have had to leave Guatemala.  This means that one in every seven Guatemalan citizens are denied the basic and most fundamental right to freedom of movement and residence within their own country.  As well as the grotesquely difficult life which faces these people, sometimes locked up in camps which resemble military detention centres, and unsure of the plight of loved ones and family members who were lost in the haste to leave, these refugees face an appalling future as no attempts to resolve the fundamental problems of the region are being made.</P>
    <P>Any reasonable person might ask what has caused the situation?  How is it possible that such murder and wanton killing can take place on such a scale in what are after all relatively small countries?  In order to understand the denial of human rights, the political instability in Central America, we must look at the facts of the extreme deprivation of the majority of the population which has characterised <Col N="1960" /> that part of the world.  The majority of the people in Central America live at subsistence level with their political and economic situation controlled by a small and wealthy élite in many cases backed by a series of governments who maintain their power by the most brutal and repressive measures.  Central American countries should be reasonably easy for Ireland's people to understand.  Their populations are not dissimilar to ours. The vast majority of the population are Roman Catholics and are closely tied to the land by culture and, of course, necessity.</P>
    <P>El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua &mdash; under Somoza &mdash; were considered to be among the most backward and least developed countries in Latin America.  About 65 per cent of the population are peasants who economically live at subsistence level intensively working small plots of land and frequently having to seek employment as sharecroppers on large estates in order to survive.  A large section of the population of Central America have a very low income indeed, are illiterate, have no means of political participation and live in a state that can only be described as extreme social and economic deprivation. These disparities between the wealthy land-owning elite and the mass of the populations have caused serious political upheaval in Central America throughout this century.  In Guatemala, for example, one of the main causes of social injustice is the inequality of land ownership.  Land is the key to survival in Guatemala and yet 72 per cent of the country's total land is owned by a tiny 2.1 per cent of the population.  Land, therefore, represents a source of wealth and for the majority of the Guatemalan people it is their only means of livelihood.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the pattern of agricultural production further impoverishes the majority of the Central American people.  Large estates are dedicated to export crops of which coffee, cotton, sugar cane and bananas are the most important.  Such cash crops demand a large supply of labour.  Since the majority of peasants in El Salvador and Guatemala have no land there is plenty of <Col N="1961" /> labour available and this also contributes to the very low wages which seasonal workers receive.  Most people would be astonished to know that in Guatemala, according to World Bank statistics, agricultural labourers receive an annual wage of £127.  The result then of such unequal distribution of land and an emphasis on the export of cash crops at the expense of producing basic food for people has resulted in extreme poverty for the majority of the people in the area.</P>
    <P>Hunger and malnutrition are daily problems in Central America.  El Salvador for example, has the lowest calorie intake <i>per capita</i> in the entire Latin American Continent.  Seventy five per cent of children under five years of age suffer from malnutrition and infant mortality figures are very high indeed.  As one might expect life expectancy is considerably lower than it is in Europe.  Housing conditions are grossly inadequate.  In Guatemala, for example, endemic disease among the poorer sections of the urban population and rural areas is a major problem and results in the fact that 94 per cent of Guatemala's population do not have access to something as basic and simple as running water.  The rural population have a lack of medical services which, coupled with poor public health infrastructure, means that few people have on a regular basis any type of even primitive health care.</P>
    <P>All of the countries of Central America have compulsory education at primary level.  However, the Central American high birth rate means that most countries in the area have up to 50 per cent of their population under fifteen years of age.</P>
    <P>Let us turn now to the situation existing inside Nicaragua.  I do not think it necessary for me to go over the corruption and excesses of the Somoza period which ended in 1979.  The Somozas ran Nicaragua like a personal estate.  They grew rich in the low wage export economy of Nicaragua, policed by the National Guard.  The family owned farms, businesses and shares not only in Nicaragua but also in neighbouring countries.  By 1979, it was estimated that Somoza was worth 500 million dollars.</P>
    <P>In the midst of much propaganda and <Col N="1962" /> rhetoric about Nicaragua, let us have the facts of what the Sandinistas have achieved and let them speak for themselves. I am quoting now from a bulletin prepared by the London-based Catholic Institute for International Relations which says:</P>
    <P>The achievements of the Sandinistas reflect their priorities and support in the country.  The poor are both beneficiaries of and participants in the rebuilding of Nicaragua.  In a period of approximately eight months the Nicaraguan Government implemented a massive literacy campaign throughout the country which reduced illiteracy from 53 to 12 per cent of the population. This earned Nicaragua the UNESCO 1980 Prize for Literacy.  In under three years, 1,258 schools have been built; 464 of these directly by the State and 764 by community efforts with materials donated by the State.</P>
    <P>Health expenditure has risen dramatically. The rate of infant mortality has declined significantly as a result of the health campaigns, widespread health education and improved health services.  The Government have taken special measures to ensure the availability of basic necessities such as maize, rice and beans and the World Bank recognises that Nicaragua has recovered very rapidly from the war and significantly raised agricultural production for the local market.  The Sandinistas have done this by bringing the expropriated Somoza estates into a land reform which has cultivated idle land.  Moreover, the Sandinistas have stressed that efficient farmers, regardless of the size of their farm, have nothing to fear.  Their priority is to make Nicaragua's land as productive as possible.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the economy of Nicaragua is a mixed one.  Those of us who have been listening in recent days to the claim that Nicaragua is a Marxist-Leninist State will be surprised to note that 70 per cent of all productive assets remain in private hands &mdash; hardly a Marxist State.  Eighty per cent of all agricultural production is still in the hands of the private sector, <Col N="1963" /> including the important cotton estates which form the backbone of Nicaragua's exports.  Through the nationalisation of Somoza's land holdings, the State controls indirectly about 26 per cent of the country's land, but only half of this is cultivated land.</P>
    <P>Can many Central Americans then, who are poor and exploited, be blamed for turning to Nicaragua to look for an example of the way forward?</P>
    <P>Let us turn now to look at some of the international implications of the Central American situation.  One of the ways in which unrepresentative political forces have been able to stay in power in Central America has been through the substantial military and economic aid that has been given to them by successive governments of the United States.</P>
    <P>Many people in Europe, and in the United States, particularly in the Congress and among the Bishops' Conference, have argued that what is needed in each of the Central American republics are negotiated solutions and not military ones.  If we take the case of El Salvador, I have to note with alarm the massive increases in US aid over the last three years.  In 1980, the US Government gave just under six million dollars in military aid and this had increased to 82 million in 1983.  At the same time Congressmen protested that 65 per cent of all military aid going down to El Salvador is taken from emergency funds available to the US President under the Foreign Assistance Act.  Senator Barnes of the Congress Sub-Committee on Inter-American Affairs has stated that this is an unnecessary precedent which is being used by the Reagan Administration to avoid a full and democratic debate on increasing involvement of the United States within El Salvador.  That has been taken from the Presidential Clarification on El Salvador, volume 1, hearings before the sub-committee on Inter-American affairs of the Committee of Foreign Affairs of which Senator Barnes is chairman.</P>
    <P>In particular, it is worth noting some of the important statements that have been made by the Catholic Bishops in the United States in which they criticise the <Col N="1964" /> Government's policy.  Let me quote an abstract from a letter by Archbishop Hickey, Archbishop of Washington, to the Inter-American Affairs Sub-Committee. He said:</P>
    <P>Now, more than ever, we, as Americans, need to encourage a political and economic solution to the massive injustices still current in El Salvador.  These are the core of the conflict.  If justice and an opportunity for a decent life are assured for the campesinos it would undermine those who desire to prolong the conflict.  At their annual meeting in November, the American Catholic Bishops strongly reaffirmed certain principles which they consider are important for the United States policies towards El Salvador.  In the face of renewed debate on Capitol Hill they bear repeating: (1) opposition to outside military assistance from any source.  The Bishops supported political means (i.e. collaboration with other countries) to ban from elsewhere as they opposed the importation of arms from the United States; (2) support of the call of Archbishop River y Damas for a broad-based political solution to be achieved by a halt to the conflict and constructive dialogue among all parties.</P>
    <P>Also, let me quote from Archbishop Roche, in his capacity as President of the United States Catholic Conference.  He said:</P>
    <P>Internal issues of social justice and human rights are the principal questions in El Salvador.  Increasing United States military involvement &mdash; our present direction &mdash; is not a contribution to redressing these internal questions. It is a dangerous course with a result as potentially damaging to us as it is to Salvadoreans.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that I would like to call on the Irish Government to play an energetic role in the United Nations to seek a negotiated solution to the problems of El Salvador and also to find ways of stopping the threat to destabilise Nicaragua. Successive Irish Governments have made many important statements at <Col N="1965" /> the United Nations and our record on Central America is a good one.  Moreover, at its recent session in March of this year, Ireland was elected to the vice-chairmanship of the UN Commission on Human Rights.  This places us in an extremely important position as regards work to prevent further violation of human rights in El Salvador and Guatemala and above all to fight for ways of ensuring that the rule of order is applied in both Guatemala and El Salvador.</P>
    <P>In my view, the Irish Government should attempt immediately to get a discussion going at the level of the Council of Ministers of the EEC in order to support within the United Nations the initiatives being put forward by the Contadora countries.  In this way, we would be helping those democratic civilian governments in Latin America, who are close to the problem and knowledgeable about its impact, to put forward a programme which will guarantee a long-term solution for the Central American problem. Ireland, as a small country, with no vested interest in the conflict, and with a high moral standing within the United Nations and in Europe, is in a unique position to proclaim the urgent need for the creation of new and just social, economic and political structures in Central America.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we must attempt to make some effort to alleviate the terrible distress being suffered by refugees and victims of violations of human rights in the area.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I would request our Government to make available from the Emergency Aid Budget, funds to humanitarian organisations who are providing much needed food and medicines for these refugees.  Moreover, at the level of the EEC Commission, our Government should urge our representatives to insist that the Commission continue to provide emergency aid to Guatemalan and Salvadorean refugees and that a substantial proportion of this be forwarded through the non-governmental organisations who have the ability to ensure that aid rapidly reaches those most in need.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the tradition of Ireland, I reiterate the view that each of the Central <Col N="1966" /> American Republics has a fundamental right to self-determination.  We who live in free and democratic societies, must work for the establishment of genuine democracies in the area.  We must prevent further bloodshed taking place.  We must ensure that assassinations, disappearances, arbitrary imprisonment, acts of terrorism, kidnappings and torture and a complete lack of respect of the dignity of the human person be stopped forthwith.</P>

      <P>: I thank Deputy De Rossa for his co-operation.  I am glad to be able to accept on behalf of the Government the motion moved by Deputy Niall Andrews.  I am very glad of the opportunity which the tabling of this motion provides for the Dáil to discuss the plight of Central America.  The overall situation there is characterised by poverty, injustice, violence and arbitrary death.  Such conditions are always intolerable.  They are even more so where the victims are denied any possibility of effective redress through the operation of a normal democratic political process with its accompanying juridical framework guaranteeing human rights and respect for life and property.  It is the absence of democracy and apparently of any means of effective political redress which accounts largely for the violence which has plagued Central America.  We in this House do not believe that power grows out of the barrel of a gun: but from the rule of law rather than from the rule of force and from the <Col N="1968" /> ability of men and women to work together to translate values into facts. This is a concern which we share with other countries which uphold and defend democratic values.  In Central America too often those who rule have tried to maintain themselves in arbitrary power through the use of the gun.  Too often those who suffer injustice have felt impelled to resort to violence against such arbitrary and oppressive rule.  The cycle appears to be almost never ending. Yet clearly this is a situation which cannot be allowed to continue.  Peace must be restored to Central America and the people there must be allowed to solve their own problems peacefully in their own way, without outside interference.</P>
      <P>Even though geograpically Central America is distant from this country, this does not mean that we can be indifferent to its fate.  We all have a role to play encouraging a dialogue both between and within the countries of Central America which will serve as the basis for the establishment of a permanent peace in the area.  This debate offers the Dáil an immediate opportunity of voicing its support for efforts to bring about such a dialogue and for stating our hope that conflict in Central America and the suffering of the people there can soon be brought to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in this context that I feel we should all welcome the recent initiative taken by the Contadora group of countries, Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela, to bring the five countries of Central America together around the negotiating table in the search for peace.  So far the response to the Contadora initiative has been good.  On 20 April the Foreign Ministers of the five Central American Republics met in Panama with their counterparts from the Contadora group to hold an initial round of discussions. Some indication of the importance of this gathering can be gained from the fact that this is the first time that the Foreign Ministers of the Central American countries have met since the Sandinista forces came to power in Nicaragua in 1979.  It would, perhaps, be too much to expect that these initial talks would lead to the immediate solution of all the complex problems of <Col N="1969" /> Central America.  What is most important, however, is that a new dialogue has begun and we must all hope that from these initial contacts will emerge the basis for a lasting peace in the area.</P>
    <P>The encouragement of such a dialogue leading to a negotiated peaceful political solution to the problems of Central America is, of course, a central element of the policy of successive Irish Governments and of Members of all parties in the House.  Essentially the Government's policy in relation to Central America has three main objectives:</P>
    <P>1.  The furtherance of respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>2.  The promotion of essential social and economic reforms.</P>
    <P>3.  Support for the creation of the necessary political and diplomatic basis for a peaceful settlement to conflict and tensions in the area.</P>
    <P>The first of these concerns is familiar to Deputies and is, I feel sure, a matter of general agreement.  All the evidence points to a consistent violation of human rights on a massive scale in a number of Central American countries.  The catalogue is a depressing one.  The virtual collapse of the judicial process, illegal detentions, torture, disappearances, assassinations and a generalised lack of respect for human life have all been documented and detailed by the United Nations and other bodies concerned with human rights.  So great is the scale and so deep-seated the roots of the tragic situation in Central America that it is hard to see any effective remedy in the short term.  Nonetheless, successive Irish Governments have sought to bring pressure on those responsible for human rights violations through focussing attention upon abuses in such fora as the United Nations.  Ireland's record in this sphere is, I believe, an honourable one. We were one of the first countries to raise the issue of human rights violations in EI Salvador at the United Nations when we spoke on this matter in the Economic and Social Council of the UN in May 1980. Since then Ireland has co-sponsored a General Assembly resolution on the situation <Col N="1970" /> in El Salvador, in December 1981. We have also co-sponsored a similar resolution on Guatemala in December 1982.</P>
    <P>Resolutions of the General Assembly represent only one aspect of United Nations activity in the field of human rights.  The UN Commission on Human Rights also plays a very important role in investigating in detail the human rights records of individual countries and in assessing the extent to which countries have been implementing the relevant General Assembly resolutions.  Given the importance of the commission, I am glad to be able to inform Deputies that in January of this year Ireland began a three-year term as a member of the commission. Through our membership of the commission we are, therefore, closely and directly involved in monitoring the human rights position in Central America.</P>
    <P>In this connection the Irish delegation in Geneva has been dealing with the report prepared by the Special Representative on EI Salvador of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which was published on 20 January 1983.  This depressing document concluded that &ldquo;serious massive and persistent violations of human rights&rdquo; continued in EI Salvador during 1982.  One of the most disturbing aspects of this situation is the involvement of the state apparatus in these violations.  Civilian deaths caused by the security forces and by para-military death squads in 1982 numbered between 5,000 and 6,000 according to figures supplied by the Archbishop Romero Christian Legal Aid Service of the Archdiocese of San Salvador and the official Human Rights Commission of EI Salvador itself.  And even these figures, huge in themselves, actually represent a decrease on previous years.</P>
    <P>The poignancy of the tragedy in EI Salvador was brought home very directly to us in Ireland recently by the murder of Ms. Marianella Garcia, former President of the El Salvador Human Rights Commission. Ms. Garcia had visited Ireland on several occasions and, indeed, had met with many Members of the Oireachtas. In the statement I issued on 16 March last I expressed my profound concern at <Col N="1971" /> the news of her murder and paid tribute to her devotion to alleviating the suffering of the people of EI Salvador.  The disturbing and conflicting reports of the circumstances surrounding her death led to many demands for an urgent investigation into the matter so that those responsible could be brought to justice.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, given the circumstances in El Salvador, we can only remain sceptical about the outcome of such investigations.  The failure of the security forces and the judicial system to apprehend and punish those responsible for human rights abuses has been a persistent feature of Salvadoran life during recent years.  Even in cases involving considerable publicity and international pressure, such as the murder of foreign nationals, little progress has been made in apprehending and punishing those responsible.</P>
    <P>In fairness it should be acknowledged that the Report of Special Representative of the UN Commission on Human Rights did point out that there existed among the higher levels of government in EI Salvador a desire to improve the situation concerning human rights.  It is to be hoped, therefore, that the government and the judicial authorities there will adopt all legal measures necessary to prevent and to speedily punish violations of human rights and that they will institute an effective control over all the members and units of the armed forces and security forces.  Ireland has urged that this should be done in our statement to the UN Commission on Human Rights on 2 March this year.  Furthermore, we also voted for the resolution condemning human rights violations in EI Salvador which was passed by the Commission.</P>
    <P>EI Salvador is not the only country in the region where systematic and serious violations of human rights are occurring. Many of the features which have been observed in EI Salvador are also present in Guatemala.  Thus, for example, the United States State Department, in their report for 1981 dealing with human rights' practices in Guatemala, tell us that:</P>
    <P>While the number of killings which <Col N="1972" /> appeared to be politically motivated ranged from 70 to 100 each month in 1980, the estimate for 1981 was 250 to 300 per month.  Most of these victims were non-combatants.  Kidnappings in 1981 ranged from 25-30 per month. There has been no evidence of arrests or prosecutions for any of these assassinations or kidnappings.</P>
    <P>The accession of General Rios Montt to power in March 1982 gave rise to some fleeting hopes of an improvement, and for a time there was a belief that in the urban areas at least, the activities of the death squads had declined.  However, during 1982, it had become apparent that any possible improvement in the cities had been more than offset by the repression which was taking place in the countryside. There, the Guatemalan army have sought to suppress the opposition guerilla groups, and to deprive them of the support of the local Indian population. The civilian death toll in the countryside has been variously estimated, from 2,600, to 8,000.</P>
    <P>It was as a result of reports of killings such as I have referred to above that Ireland together with Austria, Canada and Sweden became a co-sponsor of a resolution on the Human Rights situation in Guatemala at the last General Assembly of the UN.  In that resolution the General Assembly expressed its deep concern at the serious violations of human rights and particularly mentioned the `widespread repression, killing and massive displacement of rural and indigenous populations'.  Since then, disquiet has also been aroused by the decision of the Guatemalan authorities to execute a number of political prisoners.  Despite appeals from the Pope and from many other countries for clemency, the Guatemalan government carried out these executions on the eve of the Papal visit.</P>
    <P>One of the results of the conflicts in both Guatemala and EI Salvador has been the displacement of population on a massive scale.  In EI Salvador it has been estimated that about 230,000 persons out of a population of about 4.5 million have left the country due to the violence there.  Moreover, 300,000 are <Col N="1973" /> estimated to be living as refugees in other parts of El Salvador, having fled from their original homes.  In Guatemala, the activities of the Guatemalan army have led to the virtual depopulation of many areas of the western highlands.  Estimates of the number of people displaced range as high as 500,000.  Against this background I would appeal to the Guatemalan Government to allow international humanitarian organisations to bring assistance to those displaced.  A large number of refugees have also crossed the border into Mexico, where international organisations are having great difficulty in supplying them with food and other essential supplies.  We must support these organisations to ensure that help is brought to those who need it.</P>
    <P>We have sought to provide humanitarian assistance within the context of the limited resources we have available.  The Government have made several grants from their Disaster Relief Fund to various international and non-governmental organisations who are providing relief services in these countries.  In 1979, £15,000 was allocated to Nicaragua.  In 1981, the Government allocated £100,000 for the relief of distress in El Salvador.  Last year, £15,000 was allocated for assistance to refugees in various Central American countries.  These amounts are not large in relation to the size of the overall problems but they do indicate the Government's commitment to contribute to their solution.  This year, the Government propose to continue to provide assistance to these countries through the Disaster Relief Fund and details of this will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the problem of how effective action can be taken to improve respect for human rights in Central America.  Clearly, it is important not to relax our efforts to focus international attention on the issues and to maintain constant pressure on the Governments directly concerned.  We must continue to publicise any lack of respect for human rights in the various countries of the region.  In this regard, resolutions of the General Assembly of the UN and of the United Nations Commission on Human <Col N="1974" /> Rights, as well as the reports of the Commission, will perform a vital role.</P>
    <P>But, any attempt to alleviate the suffering of the inhabitants of Central America and to foster greater respect for human rights there, if it is to have lasting success, must also seek to tackle the fundamental problems which generate the instability, unrest and violence in the area.  Those familiar with the history of the region recognise that the present conflict has deep political, social and economic roots, which can be traced back well beyond the turmoil of the last three years.</P>
    <P>The basic problem in Central America is the failure of political and economic structures to react adequately to the needs of the population and to institute essential reforms.  The recent sharp deterioration in the regional economy has only heightened existing inequalities and tensions and made reform more urgent. The rapid growth of the urban population has not been accompanied by any significant changes in the distribution of wealth or in the allocation of resources.  Equally, in the countryside the concentration of land ownership in the hands of a small elite effectively reduces the mass of the people to the level of landless labourers. Thus in Guatemala, for example, it has been estimated that at one end of the scale an elite 2 per cent of the population enjoys 25 per cent of the national income while at the lower end 50 per cent of the population &mdash; nearly all Indian peasants &mdash; receives only 10-15 per cent.  Such gross disparities and the inability to effect peaceful changes in the situation through democratic institutions have a direct bearing upon the strength and success of guerilla movements.</P>
    <P>In the face of such injustice one can only conclude that the violence and conflict in the region derive largely from inequalities of wealth and income and reflect the widespread desire of the people for greater social and economic justice.  It is essential, therefore, if any real progress is to be made in ending violence and instability, that problems of social and economic justice should be tackled and solved.  The countries of Central America are poor.  Consequently to <Col N="1975" /> bring about successful reform they will require economic assistance from outside.</P>
    <P>The United States and Europe, both of which are concerned about developments in the area, are obvious sources from which such economic assistance can be forthcoming.  Both can play a significant role in providing the vital funds which will enable reform programmes to be launched.  Already in March 1981 the United States set up the Caribbean Basin Initiative which can provide a major stimulus to development.  At the same time, the ten member States of the Community have been anxious to increase the aid given by the Community to help Central American countries overcome their social and economic difficulties.  The European Council, in its meetings in March and June 1982, decided in principle that such aid should be increased. As a result of this decision, in November 1982 the Community agreed to make available 30 million units of account, some £25 million, for helping countries in the region which have suitable programmes of agricultural reform.</P>
    <P>Effective action to remove deep-seated social and economic inequities must be linked to political reforms and to the creation of representative political structures which enjoy the support and reflect the wishes of the people.  Although, in this regard, there have been some signs of progress in recent years, major difficulties remain.  In EI Salvador, the direct rule of the military has been ended and some initial steps taken towards the creation of a democratic political system and the introduction of land reform.  Elections for a Constituent Assembly were held there in March 1982.  However, although a significant proportion of the population took part, the elections can hardly be said to have offered the people of EI Salvador a genuine choice since the left-wing parties did not participate. Presidential elections have been fixed for December 1983 but if the circumstances of last year's elections to the Constituent Assembly are not to be repeated, however, changes will be necessary so as to <Col N="1976" /> facilitate the participation of the left, including the parties which make up the Popular Revolutionary Front.</P>
    <P>Meaningful elections can only take place in conditions of peace.  It is to this end, therefore, that I would urge that negotiations should be held between the representatives of both sides engaged in the conflict in El Salvador.  Such negotiations would aim at achieving a peaceful political solution to the conflict in that country and make way for the holding of genuinely free elections in which all political parties could participate.</P>
    <P>The overthrow of the Somoza regime and the victory of the Sandinista movement in Nicaragua in 1979 marks, perhaps, the most significant political event in that country's history.  Once in power, the Sandinista movement promised that free elections would be held and that Nicaragua would be a pluralist society. Events in and around Nicaragua have since led to the declaration of a state of emergency there with adverse effects on political freedoms such as the imposition of censorship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: Elections are not now to take place until 1985.  We hope that the process which has begun under the auspices of the Contadora group will quickly lead to the establishment of peace in Central America and that the Nicaraguan authorities will restore full political freedoms to the people of that country and hold early general elections.  The people of Nicaragua, who have suffered so much under tyranny, deserve no less.  Certainly, they would not wish to substitute a new dictatorship for the one they had overthrown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is no intention of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: Similarly in Guatemala it is essential, if any political progress is to be made, and if necessary social and economic reforms are to be introduced, that early and free general elections <Col N="1977" /> should be held.  It is the Irish Government's hope for Central America, and I am sure that this hope is shared by all members of the Dáil, that stable representative governments can emerge in the region which will be responsive to the needs, and respectful of the rights, of their people.</P>
      <P>The final element in any attempt to bring peace and stability to Central America lies in the creation of an appropriate diplomatic forum in which the countries of the region can meet and discuss their problems.</P>
      <P>There have been numerous peace initiatives in the past which have sought to promote a dialogue and negotiation as a way of alleviating tensions.  Unfortunately, none of these proved acceptable to all the countries of Central America. That is why the latest initiative of the Contadora group, to which I have referred earlier, represents a significant development.  It is the first initiative that has succeeded in bringing the five Central American countries together to one negotiating table.</P>
      <P>The Contadora initiative is also important in that it provides an opportunity for the creation of a framework within which each individual country as well as overall regional problems can be tackled. Already, before the latest Contadora initiative had got off the ground, Nicaragua and Costa Rica had made successful bilateral contacts aimed at easing their border problems.  It is now to be hoped that as a result of the meeting in Panama on 20 April a similar bilateral process between Nicaragua and Honduras will be established.  We must hope too that the Contadora initiative may also facilitate contact between the warring parties in EI Salvador and bring a speedy end to the conflict in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiative of the Contadora countries seeks to achieve a lasting peace in Central America based on the principles of self-determination and the right of each country in the region to determine its own destiny free from outside interference. These are principles to which we in Dáil Éireann would all wish to affirm our support.  We would also welcome the proposal of the Contadora group that a <Col N="1978" /> first step on the way towards establishing such peace is through the suspension of arms shipments to the area and the withdrawal of outside military advisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: In sum, therefore, we hope that a process has begun in Central America aimed at achieving a peaceful negotiated solution to the problems and conflicts in that region.  This debate gives Dáil Éireann an opportunity to make clear its principled support for that process, and for the Government's continuing efforts to improve human rights in Central America.  The struggle of the people of Central America is in large part a struggle for peace, democracy, human rights and economic and social justice.  In this struggle they have the sympathy and full support of the Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete sub-paragraphs 5 and 6 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Calls on all States to abstain from intervening and to suspend all supplies of arms and military support to the Governments of EI Salvador and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>Urges the Irish Government to play an energetic role at the UN to ease the threat of outside intervention and destabilisation of Nicaragua.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to restore the original motion which was on the Order Paper up to yesterday.  I put my name to the original motion in the belief that it had all-party support.  Subsequently I was asked if I would allow two subparagraphs, 5 and 6, to be changed.  I did not agree to subparagraph 5 being changed but did agree to a minor change to subparagraph 6.  When the motion was printed today I found that both subparagraphs had been changed.  I did not agree to this.  Consequently I put down an amendment in order to restore the original motion to the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>: On a point of order, <Col N="1979" /> in discussion with Deputy De Rossa this morning I presented him with a motion. A minor change was made to that.  The Deputy was not available at the time but I spoke to his leader, Deputy Mac Giolla, who agreed to the amendment.  If there is any misunderstanding, I apologise.  In view of the seriousness of the motion I appeal to the Deputy to go along with the all-party motion which has been put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: I did not agree to the change in subparagraph 5 nor was it agreed to by Deputy Mac Giolla.  The Government of the United States are presently engaged in a systematic destabilisation campaign against the Nicaraguan State.  Since coming to office the Reagan administration have developed a policy of hostility to the emergence of an independent government in Central America and have placed the turmoil in Central America within the framework of an east-west conflict and confrontation. The US purports to present as the basis of its interference and intervention in the affairs of a fellow member of the United Nations unfounded allegations of Nicaraguan military support for El Salvadorean guerrillas, and portrays Nicaragua's defence forces as a military threat to other Central American nations.  It would appear, on the basis of the case being made by various American spokespeople, that the objective of the American Government is to overthrow the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be made clear that the Nicaraguan Government or people have never made any territorial claims on neighbouring countries.  Neither is it trying to destabilise their governments or export its revolution.  The Nicaraguan revolution in 1979 deposed a dictator who had been imposed on the people for almost 50 years.  Today's unrest in Central America is not caused by Nicaragua but by the same social, economic and political injustices which sparked the revolution in the first place.  I intend to deal with the charges which the American Government made against the Sandinistas and to show the manner in which <Col N="1980" /> intervention from outside is attempting to destabilise the situation in Nicaragua. Currently, there are numerous groups of 50 to 100 armed counter revolutionary groups operating in the north-west of Nicaragua.  Their big hope, which has been stifled for the moment, was to pull off a major invasion.  It has failed so far because of lack of local support and, in fact, met with very stiff opposition.  One Sandinistan commander has been quoted as saying &ldquo;What have Somoza exguardsmen, who tortured the people for years, to offer the poor peasants of Nicaragua?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The great danger now is that, as the counter-revolutionary activities have failed, an attempt will be made to force the Nicaraguan Government into a direct confrontation with the Honduran army. There have been consistent reports in the past two months of Honduran army attacks on Nicaraguan border posts, instigated, it would appear, to draw Nicaragua into direct confrontation.  It would also seem that this is due mainly to pressure by the American Government.  US military assistance to Honduras has increased dramatically since the overthrow of the Somoza regime in Nicaragua. In 1980 it was $3 million, in 1981 it was $5.5 million, in 1982 it was $10.6 million and in 1983 it has risen to $15.3 million.  That is in addition to a further $21 million to modernise Honduran airports. The air of tension created by the US campaign against Nicaragua, along with their large and exaggerated joint military manoeuvres in the area over the past two years, has greatly increased the worry of invasion.  The need for the US to negotiate directly with Nicaragua and for the Irish Government to sponsor peace moves by the UN in Central America is, therefore, extremely urgent.</P>
    <P>I will give a few examples to emphasise the degree to which the United States are involved in the destabilising of the Nicaraguan situation.  On 23 February 1982 Mr. Patrick Leahy, a US Congressman and a member of the Intelligence Committee in Washington, said that President Reagan's administration were carrying out clandestine operations in Nicaragua to overthrow the government.  The Nicaraguan <Col N="1981" /> Government, since coming to power, have succeeded in many achievements. It can be plainly seen that their attempts to satisfy the basic needs of the people are being frustrated by the need to divert large resources to the defence of the people and the country.</P>
    <P>In the last two years of the Somoza regime there was a 32 per cent negative growth in the gross domestic product. Illiteracy was 60 per cent.  The literacy campaign of the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua has been a fundamental part of their campaign to rebuild the country. In 1981 spending on education more than doubled that spent by the Somoza regime and it is now being spent on the ordinary people of the country.  Local committees have been mobilised in a thorough campaign of health education.  Schemes of vaccination against malaria and a programme of educating people in relation to nutrition and to reduce the high infant mortality rate have also been instigated.</P>
    <P>Under the Somoza regime in 1978 and 1979 inflation was 84 per cent.  In 1981 that was reduced to 30 per cent.  Under the Somoza regime in 1979, 40 per cent were unemployed.  Under the Sandinista regime in 1981 this had been reduced to 16 per cent.  Clearly, the government in Nicaragua are making very great strides, despite the efforts to overthrow them.</P>
    <P>There are constant charges by the USA that the Sandinista Government are Communist controlled and that they are undemocratic and so on.  Public property and co-operatives contribute less than 40 per cent of the gross domestic product while the private sector in Nicaragua contribute 60 per cent.  The private sector control 80 per cent of agricultural production and 75 per cent of industrial production is also in their hands.  Clearly, that cannot be considered to be a state in the hands of a Communist government.</P>
    <P>It is also claimed that the country is under the domination of Soviet or other socialist countries.  Only 5 per cent of economic activity is with the socialist countries whereas 60 per cent is with the USA.</P>
    <P>A further charge made by the USA is that the Sandinista Government are running guns to the guerillas in El Salvador. <Col N="1982" /> The US have repeatedly claimed this, despite the fact that they have failed to produce any evidence to support their claim and that the Nicaraguan Government have denied it.  When asked on different occasions for proof of this charge, they failed to produce it, despite the fact that the US Government have sophisticated monitoring equipment in the area and an AWAC plane for monitoring the movement of vehicles and so on.</P>
    <P>The main point I wish to make is that there is a very strong American campaign against the Nicaraguan Government which is being carried on at a high level. I detected some of this coming through in the Minister's response to the debate when he implied that the Nicaraguan Government were not doing all in their power to serve the needs of the people. One of the most serious charges made by the USA against the Sandinista Government was that of persecution against the Miskito Indians.  This charge has continually been made by the US representative at the United Nations, Jean Kirkpatrick, and also by Alexander Haig.  They continue to repeat this charge despite the fact that it has been denied by independent sources such as Pax Christi and by Patricia Hynes of the Mary Knoll Lay Missionaries in Managua, Nicaragua.  On 1 March 1983 Jean Kirkpatrick said, before the Foreign Relations Committee in Washington, that the assault on thousands of Miskito Indians in Nicaragua by the Sandinista Government was more massive than any other human rights violation of which she was aware in Central America today.  That is an extraordinary statement, given that it has been denied by independent sources and having regard to the number of assassinations in El Salvador, which is directly supported by the United States.  Alexander Haig also attempted to prove this by presenting photographs at a press conference on 28 February 1981.  He states that they show a massacre of Miskito Indians carried out by Sandinista forces in Nicaragua.  However, a couple of days later the State Department of the USA admitted that the photographs were taken in 1979 and correspond to the <Col N="1983" /> Somoza period.  Clearly the propaganda which the US is promoting is false and in many cases direct lies.</P>
    <P>They also make a charge that the Sandinista Government are involved in religious persecution.  One such story which has been promoted claims that Bishop Schaefer from the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua has been under house arrest.  This was reported in the international press. However, the bishop himself spoke out clearly against that report, stating that he had never been arrested.  Again, this report came through an independent source, the Mary Knoll Sisters in Managua.</P>
    <P>A further quotation in relation to the charge of religious persecution is from the Bishop of Matagalpa, Monsignor Santi, who said in his homily on the day of his consecration, &ldquo;Anyone who says there is no religious freedom in this country is a liar&rdquo;.  That is from a bishop in Nicaragua itself.  Clearly there is comparison between what the American Government are supporting in El Salvador and their attempts to destabilise the situation in Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>The Opposition to the Nicaraguan Government is made up mainly of exguardsmen, the Guardia Nationalia, and also of dissident elements who have failed in an attempted military overthrow of the Sandinista Government.  A Mr. Enders, who I understand is Assistant Secretary of State on Central American affairs, has said that the counter-revolution is being led by apolitical leaders.  One of the people whom he claims to be apolitical is Edgar Chamorrow who is involved in the counter-revolutionary group called the FDN and also with a person called Vareli who is the ex-military attaché in Washington under General Somoza.  Clearly the Government are using disaffected elements who have fled from Nicaragua and who were involved with the Somoza regime to try to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about this is that the US representatives attempted to justify their activities.  Jean Kirkpatrick who is the US representative at the UN has said that the US has not only a moral <Col N="1984" /> right but a duty to support the destabilisation of Nicaragua.  As a result of that statement the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are to investigate violations of US law and the breaking of the principles of the agreements of the Organisation of American States.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in some detail with the situation in Nicaragua because it is important to emphasise that a very strong American propaganda war is going on at present in order to justify American activities in the area.  It is clear that they see the success of the government in El Salvador as hinging on their own success in destabilishing Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the situation in El Salvador fairly briefly because it has already been covered by the previous two speakers, but it must be said that the El Salvadorean Government is one of the most repressive regimes anywhere in the world.  Hundreds of thousands of people have died in the last few years murdered by Government forces and right-wing murder groups.  Anyone who saw the television coverage of the funeral of the murdered Archbishop Romero or heard the graphic reports from Ann Daly describing the events will never forget how hundreds of people were viciously murdered on that occasion.  Despite the appalling record in El Salvador and the continuing outrages there, the US Government continue to support this dreadful administration.  Therefore the Irish Government must take a principled stand.  While the Minister has outlined very laudable aims in relation to human rights, social and economic reform and the peaceful settlement of conflicts in the Central American area, the Government here must be more specific and must take their stand with the progressive forces in the Central American region.  They must add their voice to those of other Governments in the Latin American region, in Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Panama, who have condemned all types of foreign intervention, direct or indirect, in Central America.  They must also call for an end to the US provocative acts against Nicaragua arising from Honduran territory. Also a very effective step by the Irish Government would be to withdraw <Col N="1985" /> their invitation to President Reagan to visit this country until he ceases to give military and political backing to the oppressive regimes in Central America whether in Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador, and ends his policy of attempting to destabilise Nicaragua.  Furthermore, in relation to El Salvador the Irish Government must accord recognition to the FMLN and the FDR as the representative political force in El Salvador if realistic negotiations are to take place prior to elections in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy H. Byrne has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the appointment of a receiver in Springs of Wexford with a consequent loss of about 60 jobs.  He has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>: I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for your kind permission to raise the issue of the appointment of a receiver to Springs Wexford and the prospect of a loss of 65 jobs.  You may note that I said &ldquo;prospect of a loss&rdquo; rather than a loss because I believe these jobs can be saved and I say to the Minister that with his co-operation that this can be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment levels in County Wexford have now reached an all-time high of 6,063 or 17.8 per cent of the work force in County Wexford.  Wexford town itself has 22 per cent of its work force idle and this is far in excess of the national average of 13 per cent.  Springs of Wexford are the latest casualty.  However, this industry can be saved with commitments and with careful handling.  &ldquo;Springs Wexford&rdquo; were founded in 1935.  They manufacture springs for lorries and agricultural trailers and steel components for ESB pylons.  Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta manufacture the much-celebrated Armer beet-harvester for export, but Springs Wexford supply the components for conveyor chains.  CIE are <Col N="1986" /> another customer of theirs, as is the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>The present difficulties did not arise overnight and one must be critical of the parent body, Harcourt Holdings, for just pulling the plug, with little or no advance notice to the workers and the company, which has been in existence since 1935, with some men employed for as long as 40 years.  The local TDs, myself included, met the unions and the receiver yesterday on the factory floor, and it was pathetic to see men, whose service to the company ranged from 15-40 years, many of whom have mortgages and are married with families, just told that the company was closing shop.  It was pathetic because this old-established firm is solid, with outstanding staff-management relations, and has been making profits during all its history.  Last week they were carrying on with their business in the usual confident, responsible, workmanlike way only to be told that Harcourt Holdings had collapsed and a receiver had been appointed to Springs Wexford.  As I said, that work force have always behaved responsibly. During a rationalisation programme of 1974, 40 workers lost their jobs with a minimum of fuss.  During the recession the workers at Springs acted responsibly, putting their jobs before other considerations. There is a sincere and genuine effort now being made to keep Springs open and on talking to the workers yesterday this is their primary aim.</P>
    <P>Mr. Charles Russell Murphy has been appointed receiver and is at present seeking a buyer.  I understand there are three interested companies and it is here the Minister can show his commitment to the terrible unemployment problem of Wexford.  I ask him, if he considers it judicious to name these companies.  The IDA have been approached, as have Fóir Teoranta.  While the delay of the parent company's disclosure of problems was poor form, the IDA were aware of the situation for some time.  If this is the case the IDA are partially responsible for the position Springs now find themselves in.  The IDA and Fóir Teoranta should have been able to keep the ship afloat. The IDA have had their fingers burned before now, and burned badly in Wexford, <Col N="1987" /> with Lifesavers who were to create 600 jobs.  The company went broke and pulled out after a year.  The IDA now are not prepared to gamble further.  I ask them to come out from behind that failure, carry out investigations and get back to the role they are supposed to play.  I will come back to the problem in hand.  I call on the Minister to demand from the IDA and Fóir Teoranta, that the interested bodies in the company will be given every help, within reason, in order to retain these 65 jobs in Wexford.  The receiver and workers are working together as a team with a good understanding and their common aim is to keep the door open.  The Minister must ensure that the full weight of his office is behind this teamwork.  Half measures are no good, half commitment is not enough.</P>
    <P>We can remember in Ross Company, New Ross, two years ago, when 170 people were made redundant and a receiver was appointed.  The receiver is still there and Ross Company is a graveyard with plant and machinery rusting and the yard becoming more unattractive every day that passes.  That type of policy in Springs Wexford is not good enough. Wexford county and Wexford town particularly have been ignored by the IDA in recent years.  If they put their backs into this project I have no doubt but that this firm can continue in operation, and if this effort fails, much of the responsibility will be with the Minister and the IDA.</P>
    <P>The present plight of this Wexford company brings to light a difficulty that we in Ireland have been experiencing for some time now, that is the problem of our semi-State bodies importing commodities that are being manufactured here.  How can the Minister justify on the one hand, allowing semi-State bodies under his jurisdiction and guidance, to import goods manufactured in other countries by firms which are in direct competition with companies in this country and, on the other hand, because of this stupid activity, having to support our companies because of self-inflicted troubles?  Would it not be wiser to instruct our semi-State bodies to use <Col N="1988" /> Irish-made materials, to retain and create Irish jobs?  When we are promoting a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; Campaign, let the Minister set the good example by insisting that all Departments and semi-State bodies use Irish-made materials.  It is disgraceful that we should create jobs abroad at our own expense and at the expense of Irish workers.</P>
    <P>If he were to do this, Springs Wexford would have no difficulties, because instead of CIE importing springs for their buses, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann importing beet harvester components, and the ESB and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs importing their steel requirements, they would all purchase their requirements from this Wexford firm which is the only manufacturer of this type of product in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I noted with interest in last week's issue of <i>The People</i> that the Minister for Labour has appointed a special adviser to examine the viability of Springs Wexford Limited.  I suggest that it is not enough to appoint an adviser.  This matter must have the intervention of the Minister or his colleague, the Minister for Labour.  Advisers are not enough at this stage because the situation is too serious, and the unemployment problem in Wexford is too great.  I ask the Minister to put his weight behind this project.</P>
    <P>To recap: a receiver has been appointed to Springs Wexford and a sincere and genuine effort is being made by workers, management and the receiver to locate a buyer for this firm in a responsible fashion.  We call on the Minister to ensure that his office, the IDA and Fóir Teoranta match their efforts, and immediately, and we call on the Minister to ensure that Irish-made materials are used by all State and semi-State bodies.  It would be disastrous if we were to allow this excellent work force and this excellent product to be put on the scrap heap.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: I support the sentiments so ably expressed by my colleague, Deputy Byrne, in relation to the presence of the receiver at Springs Limited, Wexford, and the threat of closure hanging over the factory, and consequent loss of 65 jobs.  In County Wexford at present <Col N="1989" /> we have more than 6,000 people unemployed. Of that number, 2,300, or 22 per cent of the work force, are unemployed in Wexford town, and if Springs were to be closed it would be disastrous for the workers and the economy of the town.</P>
      <P>Unemployment levels are now above the national average in all areas throughout the county, which has not succeeded in attracting any major new foreign project since 1979 and is badly in need of a major promotional drive by the IDA and the Department.  Wexford County Council have developed the required infrastructure for industries, but the IDA, for reasons known only to themselves, completely and consistently have ignored the plight of the unemployed in Wexford.</P>
      <P>My home town of Enniscorthy has 16 per cent of the total workforce unemployed, more than 1,600 people, and I have no doubt that the town has been forgotten, as well as the south east region, as far as Ministers and the IDA are concerned.  Gorey has a 17 per cent unemployment rate and New Ross 15½ per cent.</P>
      <P>Getting back to Springs, the work force is 65, many of whom are in middle age with years of service ranging from 20 to 40.  To dump them on the lengthening dole queue will have serious consequences for their future.  Many of them joined the firm at 15 years of age and have given loyal and dedicated service throughout the years.  The relationship between the workers, the unions and the management has been top class always and every effort must be made to save the jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am led to believe that Springs, part of the troubled Harcourt Holdings, are a viable and profitable company, all the more reason why it should be saved. News of the calling in of the receiver came as a major shock to the workers and the people of Wexford town and has cast an air of gloom and depression on the town.  Having attended a meeting of the firm yesterday and talking to the workforce, I am aware of how concerned they are and how important it is to them that the factory be kept open.  The workers know that if this factory is <Col N="1990" /> closed, with the high unemployment rate already in Wexford they will be consigned to the dole queue for the remainder of their lives.  That fear is uppermost in their minds at present.</P>
    <P>There are a number of options open to the Minister for saving the company. Coming from a county bordering Wexford, I know the Minister is aware of and concerned about the high unemployment figures in the south east region.  I respectfully ask him to put pressure on our State and semi-State bodies to purchase their requirements from Springs Limited and to refrain from purchasing abroad.  This applies particularly to CIE who, I am led to believe, are importing most if not all of their bus springs from British Steel despite the fact that they can be produced in Wexford at very competitive prices and of much better quality.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also look for orders from the Sugar Company, Bord na Móna, the ESB and possibly from Fords of Cork.  Failing that, pressure must be brought on the receiver and the IDA to market the firm and to ensure that a buyer will be sought immediately to keep the workers in employment.  They are skilled workers whose expertise, and the products produced, would be a tremendous loss to the economy.  Of course closure of the factory would also mean that more imports would come in which in turn would mean exporting our jobs.</P>
    <P>Therefore I ask the Minister to ensure that a solution be found immediately to keep Springs open.  I feel that the parent company, Harcourt Holdings, have treated the workers of Springs with contempt, very unfairly.  Now Springs must be taken out of this group and put on a sound footing.  I believe that with the political will and the help of the IDA and Fóir Teoranta, the firm and the jobs of the workers can be saved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am delighted to have the opportunity to lend support to my colleagues' words on behalf of Springs Limited. I would underline their appeals to the Minister of State who has particular responsibility in this case to ensure that everything will be done to see that Springs Limited will be kept going as a <Col N="1991" /> viable concern.  I will not repeat all they have said but I concur with it.</P>
      <P>The key to the success of Springs and its future lies in encouragement by the Government of the semi-State bodies to place orders with the company.  I do not think we need look further than CIE, who alone could give the company enough work to keep them going for the foreseeable future, Bord na Móna, the Sugar Company, and others which have been referred to, and I underline what my colleagues have said.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure the Minister will have much to say to us on this matter and therefore I will not take up his valuable time.  He is far more learned than I on this subject.  All Wexford Deputies and Senator Howlin are extremely concerned about the future of Wexford, particularly Wexford town where the unemployment rate is now 25 per cent, well above the national average.  Wexford was one of the first industrialised rural towns in Ireland which had many older type industries which needed a lot of investment and updating of management structures. We were hurt extremely badly in the recession during the last ten years, particularly in the industrial sector.  Many jobs were found in manufacturing by the IDA but we have not been able to compensate for job losses in the older industries.</P>
      <P>Since 1935, Springs Limited have been solid employers in County Wexford and I appeal to the Minister to look to the semi-state bodies to ensure there will be a future for Springs.  The appeal from all of us here is on behalf of the 65 employees.</P>
      <P>As has been said, Springs are the only company manufacturing laminated springs in Ireland.  Indeed the manufacture of springs is only 50 per cent of their output.  They are in the light engineering sector for which there is a tremendous necessity for growth here.  I therefore repeat my appeal to the Minister to indicate to us what the Government plans are for saving Springs and to tell us how the semi-State sector could be encouraged to direct more work, more orders, to this company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am grateful to Deputy Byrne for having given me the opportunity to discuss this situation in the House and to share the concern expressed by the Wexford Deputies at this unfortunate position which has arisen in this long-established company, part of the industrial fabric of Wexford town for nearly 50 years.  The company give employment to 65 people, mostly men.  That number was about 100 some years ago.</P>
      <P>I understand that the receiver is very pleased with the responsible attitude of the workers, something in itself which will be of benefit to the company in their efforts to secure a takeover.  I am saddened to see that in recent times a number of companies, having got into trouble, were put into further difficulties by employees sitting in.  I want to say clearly that the tactic of the sit-in is most detrimental to the workers and the prospect of those workers being employed in a new ownership situation.  Such sit-ins have been detrimental to the IDA in their efforts to promote factories which get into difficulties.  Therefore I am very pleased to note the responsible attitude of the workers in Springs.  I am satisfied that it will have beneficial results.</P>
      <P>The problems which led to the recent appointment of a receiver arise largely from the difficulties besetting the group of which Springs Ltd. are a member, rather than problems relating to Springs Ltd. themselves.  In 1982 the relevant State organisations &mdash; the IDA and Fóir Teoranta &mdash; approved a financial restructuring package for the group which the group, for their own reasons, did not take up.  That was most unfortunate.</P>
      <P>In this regard I must take Deputy Byrne to task.  He said the IDA are partially to blame for the present position in Springs Ltd.  That is not the case.  I want to point that out quite clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>: I did not say that.  I said if that were the case they would be partially to blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is not the case.  I do not want to cross swords with Deputy Byrne because we both have the same <Col N="1993" /> objective.  I have a responsibility to state that the IDA and Fóir Teoranta approved of a restructuring package of which the group, unfortunately, did not avail.  It would not be correct to say that the Wexford company have not got difficulties. They have.  Hopefully they will be resolved.</P>
      <P>Like many other companies they are experiencing strong competition in all areas of their activities, in the manufacture of springs and chains as well as general engineering work.  I am aware also that they have to face particularly strong competition from imports in the market for springs and chains, but my understanding of the matter is that most of this competition is from companies within the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>We are a member of the EEC and we must abide by its treaties.  We are in a free market.  We are benefiting from being within that free market because we can export all our produce freely within that market.  We too must open our borders to goods from other countries.  As the House is aware, this taking of protectionist measures, even if that were desirable, is not feasible.  If proof can be provided that any company or companies are exploiting a dominant position in the market place, I will ensure that the matter is investigated immediately.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, the problems which resulted in the appointment of a receiver at Springs Ltd. arise mainly from difficulties within the holding group.  I am hopeful that the efforts of the receiver and the State organisations who are already co-operating closely in the matter will be successful in securing an early take-over which will result in continued employment for the work force in Wexford and, in this regard, I understand that already three interested parties have made what must be considered to be serious inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the receiver has guaranteed continued employment for all of the work force for the next two weeks while the possibility of a take-over is being explored.  I am hopeful that, even if a take-over is not secured within that <Col N="1994" /> timescale, employment could continue to be maintined well beyond that date under the receiver's management.  I am optimistic about a take-over in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputies made reference to State bodies and their purchasing policies.  State bodies are obliged to adhere to normal procedures in relation to tenders.  In that context they are also bound, in relation to contracts over a certain value, to advertise internationally.  I should like to see State bodies in a position to purchase more Irish goods, but they must conform to the competition rules of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred to the Ross Company who are also in receivership in New Ross.  I am familiar with that company. The IDA have a primary responsibility to ensure that when a company take over another company in receivership, the take-over is financially backed and secure in the long term.  There is no point in the IDA or any State agency approving a take-over by a company who, in their opinion, are not capable of sustaining the revived company.  That is a proper and responsible approach. Hopefully the right company will appear on the scene.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat taken aback by Deputy Burke's suggestion that I have been taking half measures or that I was only half committed to companies in difficulties. That is not so.  The IDA, Fóir Teoranta and other State agencies are fully committed to preserving existing employment as well as promoting new employment and new industries.  I reject any allegations of half measures or half commitment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The statistical information requested by the Deputy is set out in a tabular statement, which I propose, to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with both the effectiveness and appropriateness of the present methods of treatment available.  Tuberculosis reponds to antibiotics readily available in this country.  The effect of the antibiotics is to render the patient non-infective within a period of 48 hours. Most patients are themselves cured of tuberculosis by appropriate antibiotic therapy in two to three months.  A small number of cases are found to be resistent to antibiotics and require special treatment. This treatment is available through the community and hospital services.</P>
      <P>During the period 1971-1980 there was a downward trend in the number of persons being treated for tuberculosis.  The figures in recent years however show that the number of persons being treated has levelled off.  The total number of new cases being reported annually also shows a similar pattern during the period 1971-1980. Under existing tuberculosis programmes, therefore, there may be little scope for reducing the incidence of the disease further and a review of current policy is necessary.  Such a review has been commenced by my Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he proposes to raise the basic rent subsidy of £5.00 available under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme in view of the fact that the basic allowance has been unchanged since 1977; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>: The figure of £5 mentioned is the maximum amount of weekly addition to other income which may under regulations be paid in the normal course by a health board.  Amounts in excess of £5 may, however, be paid with the consent of the Department and this consent is readily given.  With a view to improving the effectiveness of the administration of the scheme of supplementary welfare allowances I am, however, proposing to increase the limit up to which the health boards may make payment without reference to the Department.</P>
      <P>The making of an amending regulation will require the sanction of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will explain the reduction in the revised Estimates for the Public Services in the allocation for supplementary welfare allowances from £21,649,000 in the 1982 provisional outturn to £21,130,000 in 1983 section K.10 Head 47; whether the criteria for receiving supplementary welfare allowances are being changed in order to achieve such a saving; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Expenditure by the health boards on supplementary welfare allowances is financed from two sources, <Col N="1785" /> namely, contributions from the local authorities and grants from the Vote for my Department.  In 1982 large payments arose on certain items such as arrears in respect of earlier years and the double allowance granted in January under the National Fuel Scheme which, under a Government decision limiting local authorities' contributions, had to be met fully from my Department's Vote.  These items will not recur in 1983 and this is the reason for the reduction in the estimate for the sub-head concerned.</P>
      <P>Overall expenditure on supplementary welfare allowances is expected to increase to £33.26 million in 1983 from £30.1 million in 1982 and there is accordingly no question of an overall saving or of a change in the criteria for receipt of allowances.</P>

      <P>: While some preparatory work had been done on a draft White Paper on housing when the previous Government were in office, the work was still only in the preliminary stages at the time of the change of Government.</P>
      <P>In so far as the present Government are concerned, their primary objectives in regard to housing are those set out in the joint programme for Government. As regards other aspects of housing, the Deputy may be assured that it is my intention that policies generally should be subjected to a process of continuing review. As to whether it would be appropriate to develop and issue a comprehensive statement of policies in the form of a White Paper, this is something that I will keep under examination in the period ahead. In the meantime, any new measures seen to be desirable and capable of being met within the available resources will be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1788" /> for the Environment (a) the total allocation to each county under the local improvements scheme in each of the years 1977 to 1981, inclusive; (b) the number of outstanding applications in each county on 31 December 1982; and (c) the average cost of the scheme in each county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Details of the total allocations under the local improvements scheme to each county council for each of the five years 1977 to 1981 are set out in Table 1. Table 2, based on recent information supplied by councils, gives details of the position as at 30 November 1982 in relation to applications received under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Precise information is not available on the average cost per scheme.  The cost of the schemes is financed mainly by State grant and partly by contributions payable by the landholders concerned.  Column 6 of Table 2 gives, for each county, an estimate, based on the information furnished by councils, of the amount of State grant which would be required on the assumption that all the schemes were undertaken.  Applications may be subsequently withdrawn, or schemes may not otherwise be undertaken due for example to the failure to pay local contributions, withdrawal by one or more of the landholders concerned from a proposed scheme or refusal by one or more landholders to permit entry by council on land for the purposes of a scheme.</P>

      <P>: On the basis of information submitted by the applicant that the mortgage deed was executed in March 1982, a provisional approval to the mortgage subsidy issued to him.  However, it has now been established that the mortgage deed was in fact executed on 18 November 1980, and, consequently, this applicant does not qualify for the subsidy which is payable only in respect of mortgages where the deeds were executed on or after 10 April 1981.

On notification from his solicitor that he was in fact engaged to be married, a fresh application form for completion in joint names was issued in January 1982.  To date it has not been returned to my Department. Further information in connection with the grant application requested on 21 <Col N="1794" /> October 1981 has also not yet been received and consequently no further action can be taken in the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that in relation to the issue of certificates of competency for public service vehicles no anti-tilt facilities exist for such vehicles in this country and that such vehicles are therefore not properly insured under the law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>: As regards the first part of the question, I am so aware.</P>
      <P>Regulations under the Road Traffic Acts require all buses having accommodation for more than 14 passengers to meet specified standards of stability which are expressed in terms of a minimum safe angle of tilt.  This requirement is enforced by the Garda as a condition of public service vehicle licensing and proof of compliance with stability standards is normally furnished to them by the manufacturers or distributors of the buses concerned.  Where a person converts a goods van to a public service vehicle, the onus of proof of compliance with stability requirements rests with the applicant for the licence.</P>

      <P>A scheme for improvement works at Cromane was drawn up in 1981 when my Department offered a 75 per cent State grant to Kerry County Council towards the cost involved.

    <P>(d) The total numbers of day telephone and night telephone operating staff required at the commencement of the current year were 3,300 and 1,970 respectively; the requirements for later years are dependent on the effect of a number of factors such as extension of automatic working, improvement in the telephone network and introduction of new services, and it would not be possible to forecast these accurately at this stage.</P>

      <P>: It is expected that Araglin exchange will be converted to automatic working in 1984.  The equipment at Araglin will work through a new digital trunk switching exchange to be provided at Dungarvan.  This is the most economical and practical means of providing automatic service for the area.  Under automatic conditions, Araglin subscribers will have the facility of direct dialling to the Fermoy (025) area at the local call charge rate.</P>
      <P>Earlier forecasts for introduction of automatic service at Araglin have proven unattainable because of the magnitude of the overall telecommunications development programme.</P>

      <P>: In accordance with longstanding policy to motorise rural postal deliveries, whenever it is feasible to do so economically, the part-time postman post at Doneraile, which became vacant last December, has been amalgamated with two other part-time posts to form a full-time motor post.  In any event the person concerned would have had no entitlement to the post because of his relationship with the former occupant. His only periods of employment as temporary postman were for a total of 12 days up to 5 March 1982, well before the death of his father.</P>

      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 711 and 712 together.</P>
      <P>In reply to previous Parliamentary Questions about the location of the post office at Firhouse, it was explained that following the resignation of the postmaster at the shopping centre, no one from there applied for the position when the vacancy was advertised despite a canvass of the shopkeepers.  The only suitable candidate was appointed in order to maintain counter services in the area although the new post office was not as convenient to some people, including the residents of Tymon Heights as the former had been.  Matters raised in a recent letter from the Tymon Heights Residents' Association regarding the post office, including its location, are under examination and will be replied to shortly.  So far as the pattern of savings business is concerned, the number of transactions has declined since the transfer of the office to its present location but the indications are that most of the lost business has been transferred to neighbouring post offices particularly the new office at Glenview.</P>

These modifications would give rise to substantial additional expenditure and since the Office of Public Works was loath to recommend the additional expenditure for grant to the Department of Education it decided to re-examine the question of access to the site <i>ab initio</i>. Such examination has revealed that alternative access, at reasonable cost, which would be acceptable to the local authority, is feasible, if an additional plot of ground is made available.

      <P>The person concerned was allowed occupational injury benefit from 27 January 1982 in respect of an incapacity resulting from an accident at work on that date.  He was also allowed pay-related benefit from 10 February 1982, thirteenth day of incapacity.</P>

The 85 per cent limit applicable to the person concerned is £76.80.  Accordingly he was entitled to pay-related benefit at £1.80 weekly from 29 December 1982 and payment of pay-related benefit due was made when arrears of flat-rate unemployment benefit were paid to him on 1 February 1983.</P>
      <P>Combined payments of £76.80 representing flat-rate unemployment benefit, £75.00 and pay-related benefit, £1.80 are being made to him as they become due at regular weekly intervals.</P>

      <P>: The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 5 January 1983 to 12 April 1983, date of the latest medical evidence received.  He is not, however, qualified for payment as according to the records of the Department he had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions, paid or credited, in 1981-82, the contribution year governing his claim.  He was advised of the position on 25 January 1983.</P>
      <P>An officer of the Department called on the person concerned on 25 April 1983 with a view to ascertaining if any further contributions were due in respect of 1981-82.  The position is, however, that no further contributions are due and he is not therefore, qualified for benefit.</P>

      <P>The total amount charged to the Garda Síochána Vote in 1982 in respect of traffic accidents and malicious damage to vehicles was £438,000 approximately.

      <P>Costs charged to the Garda Vote in 1982 could, in some cases, relate to accidents or damage which occurred in previous years and, similarly, the cost of some accidents which occurred in 1982 would not be discharged and charged to the Garda Vote within that year.

In the meantime, the long-term accommodation requirements of the school are being considered and when these are determined the preparation of sketch plans may be initiated.</P>

      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 925 and 926 together.</P>
      <P>Eligible pupils, both junior cycle and senior cycle, attending the post-primary centre serving the catchment area in which they reside and whose parents/legal guardians are holders of a medical card are exempt from the school transport charges.  This exemption does not apply in the case of ineligible pupils, that is, pupils who reside less than three miles from their appropriate post-primary centre, nor in the case of eligible pupils availing of catchment boundary facility to attend a centre other than that designated as serving the catchment area in which they live.</P>
      <P>Parents who have paid school transport charges in respect of pupils who qualify for exemption should apply directly to the local CIE office for a refund.  This application should give the names of the pupils concerned, the school or schools attended, the numbers of the travel permits held and the date of payment.  The medical card and a stamped self-addressed envelope should be enclosed.</P>
      <P>If there are any special difficulties and the Deputy supplies my Department with full particulars of all the children availing of school transport in each of the families concerned, including the schools attended by them, I will have the matter investigated.</P>
