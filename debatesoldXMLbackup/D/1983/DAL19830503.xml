      <P>There are no official statistics specifically relating to marriage breakdown available at present, but I am circulating in the Official Report details of proceedings for divorce <Col N="2" /><i>a mensa et thoro</i>, custody and guardianship, maintenance and barring orders and of social welfare payments to deserted wives in recent years.</P>
      <P>The 1983 labour force survey at present being conducted by the Central Statistics Office in respect of a sample of 45,000 households includes a specific question about actual marital status and it is hoped that, on the basis of this question, meaningful classification of the population according to marital status will be possible.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State agree with a recent newspaper estimate that there are up to 70,000 adults involved in marital breakdown in the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no firm estimates of the number of people involved in marital breakdown.  The survey I have mentioned will be conducted nationwide. Respondents will be asked to indicate one of the following descriptions: widowed, married, married but separated, deserted, marriage annulled, legally separated, other separated, divorced in another country.  That will give a clear picture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that as this is just a survey it is unlikely to give the accurate figure which I am seeking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unlikely to give an accurate figure.  Unfortunately if the 1981 census of population had allowed for the category `separated' which was requested by many groups at the time we would have a clearer picture now.  However, that was a decision taken by the Deputy's party at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <P>Contributions from the non-quota section of the ERDF in respect of the special border areas programme are made to the Exchequer as a partial recoupment of its expenditure on the programme.</P>
      <P>In 1983 on-going projects which commenced in 1981 and 1982 will be aided from the special fund together with new projects which will be started in 1983. The list of new projects has not yet been finalised.  It would not be possible, therefore, to give a breakdown by county of expenditure in 1983 or a definitive list of projects which will be aided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy it is not yet possible to say what projects will be aided in 1983 because decisions have not yet been made.  It was on that basis that I said that it is not possible to give a breakdown by county of the projects which will be aided.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a date.  As the Deputy is aware, projects are put forward for aid from this fund by a variety of organisations.  I share the Deputy's anxiety that these decisions be made as quickly as possible so that we will be able to get these projects in hand.  That is for new projects which would be brought forward in 1983.  Expenditure on projects initiated in 1981 and 1982 will, in a number of cases, continue this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is found in all schemes of this kind that in any given year a number of projects are put forward which, for one reason or another, do not comply fully with the terms and objectives of the schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister ensure that in future if schemes are to be rejected it will be done quickly to enable them to submit alternative proposals for the funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said, in reply to Deputy Wilson, that I am anxious that the various bodies and organisations which put forward proposals would make their decisions as quickly as possible.  I shall take that matter up with them.  However, I do not have any function in deciding on the projects that those bodies would consider and, if in a given year the number of projects which are eligible <Col N="7" /> under the scheme does not take up the total amount of funds available, then the organisations that are charged with putting these projects forward should take note of that and ensure they put forward projects which will take up the full amount of the allocation.</P>

      <P>The statement shows the amount of Exchequer borrowings in Deutschemarks, their equivalent in Irish pounds at date of drawdown and the rate of interest. In the case of floating interest rate loans, the highest and lowest applicable interest rate margins over the Eurocurrency interbank rate are indicated.</P>

      <P>Is it true that the rates of interest charged to the Irish Government on money borrowed in Deutschemarks is only a fraction of that charged to the ordinary borrower for agricultural or industrial purposes here?  If moneys available to agriculture and industry were at the same rates as those paid by the Government, would the Minister not agree we would have a much lower rate of unemployment and much higher agricultural and industrial production?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the interest rates are concerned, we have been fortunate for a number of years past in securing what are relatively favourable rates on international markets.  For example, although I think this is dealt with in the statement, we compare favourably with the Eurocurrency inter-bank rate when we borrow for the kind of loans that the Deputy has mentioned.  Those funds are needed for Exchequer borrowing requirements and it would not necessarily be the case that loans for other purposes would be available at the same rates of interest.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated, in his reply, that this money would not necessarily be available.  I was not speaking about money borrowed on behalf of banks or the ACC for lending to farmers, I was speaking about borrowing by the Government for their own purposes.  The Minister said that this money would not necessarily be available to industrialists and farmers for development.  Would the Minister indicate if he has in mind any means through which money so cheaply borrowed by the Government can be made available to agriculture and industry and which would alleviate many of the problems faced by those sectors?</P>

      <P>Is it true that the funds available were accumulated by Allied Irish Banks abroad which should have been returned for investment here and, if so, does the Minister not agree that it is almost exactly the same thing, an outflow of capital or a refusal to bring in the capital which the bank owned?  I would also like to ask if the Minister approved the investment by AIB of this capital held by them abroad in purchase of a new bank or if he was asked for his approval?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware, the acquisition in question is being funded from reserves and funds which the bank in question have generated through the operation of a considerable amount of business outside the State, through branches in the USA, UK and continental Europe.  It is from those funds that the bank are carrying out the acquisition. Since the funds were raised externally, there is no diversion of capital involved. The operation was carried out in accordance with the normal rules of clearance with the Central Bank and, since there was not a direct exchange control question involved, it was put into a particular category.  I am informed that the proposal was fully considered by the bank and I was informed of it shortly before the public announcement was made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not concerned with regard to investment abroad by Irish-owned companies?  Is he aware that the American Government have such controls and make specific arrangements for the return of profits made abroad by companies who invest abroad?  Has he any intention of introducing such controls here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my original reply, the matter falls outside the considerations now being raised by the Deputy, in the sense that the funds in question were generated by the bank from their <Col N="15" /> activity outside the State so there was no question of an outflow that would require a policy decision here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is exactly the same in the end whether funds are sent from here to the United States or whether funds belonging to AIB in the United States are not transmitted back here?  Would the Minister not accept that in so far as any institution here generates earnings abroad, the first consideration in the public interest would be that those funds should be transmitted back here?  From the point of view of the national economy, would he not agree that it is exactly the same, in effect, whether money is sent out from here to the United States or money belonging to the AIB is not transmitted back home?  Furthermore, does he not think that there is a very important issue of policy involved here?  It is not just a banking matter; it has implications of a far-reaching economic nature.  As Minister for Finance, he should interest himself in the policy issues of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's suggestion that this is the same as the question of whether or not funds should be sent abroad.  No movement of funds is involved here.  There is no transfer of funds from this country abroad. There is the question of whether funds generated outside the State should be used in a particular way.  In this connection there are a number of advantages from our point of view in having a banking involvement outside the State because a banking involvement of a proper kind outside the State can be of assistance to us in raising externally the kind of funding we need in order to fund the Exchequer's borrowing requirement. That is a very positive aspect of the operation in question.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given certain views of a substantive kind. Would he be prepared to go further and make a statement of policy about this type of banking operation?  For instance, would he be prepared to say whether people like the IDA, CTT and agencies of that kind were consulted about this and would they be in a position to give any view as to whether it would be beneficial or otherwise?  Would he accept that this should come within his compass and his brief as Minister for Finance responsible for the general economic management of our affairs rather than being left simply to the Central Bank and AIB as a purely banking matter, as apparently it has been left?</P>

      <P>I cannot say whether the IDA, CTT or any other body was consulted in relation to this measure.  I have not got that information.  The funding of the purchase over a period of years would not be very large in relation to the total external assets of AIB.  In that perspective I do not think that the question arises in quite the way that the Leader of the Opposition has posed it.  As to the general question of consultation of the IDA and CTT, I follow the Deputy's train of thought on this.  The case is that they have a specific brief, which is to attract capital into the country.  To the extent that they are successful in that operation and that we ourselves here create a climate which makes it attractive to bring capital in here, it would be a factor that would be considered by any banking group or anybody else with funds available at home or abroad for investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the areas which qualify for grant aid from the European Regional Development Fund in respect of the provision of amenities including water sports, angling works, etc., will be extended to include the severely handicapped areas of the western counties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the possibility of extending to the western counties aid at present granted from the non-quota section of the European Regional Development Fund for amenities in the Border counties. I am afraid that this would not be possible under the EEC Regulation governing the granting of the aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the non-quota section of the fund was being introduced in 1979 it was apparent that Ireland would be unlikely to benefit.  Ireland's agreement to the introduction of the non-quota section was dependent upon an assurance from the Council that aid would be provided to deal with Border problems in the most deserving regions of the Community. Accordingly the regulation authorising the non-quota section aid for the provision of amenities including water sports, angling works etc. in Ireland relates <Col N="20" /> exclusively to Irish Border areas and may not be extended outside those areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give any indication whether the total funds available in this area are being expended?  Are they being utilised?  Are funds available in this area that have not been spent and, in view of that, if there are substantial amounts would it be desirable to extend the areas into the severely handicapped regions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations adopted in 1979 governing the setting up of the non-quota section made provision in relation to Ireland in order to meet specific needs that were put forward at that stage.  As far as the other parts of the Deputy's question are concerned, he is asking about the total amount available and whether that will be used up.

      <P>Would the Minister confirm that I am right in thinking that moneys from this fund, which were allocated for the self-catering sector, were expended over a much wider area than the Border counties?  I got the impression that similar grants were available in non-Border counties?  Is that so?  Would the Minister comment on an allegation made at a meeting of the Mourne District Council that some of the money from this cross-Border fund was spent on the development of a small airport in Sligo?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that recipients of the non-contributory old age pension are not liable to income tax because the tax allowances and reliefs to which they are entitled should exceed their total income.  Similarly in the case of persons in receipt of the contributory old age pension who have no other income, no liability to income tax arises.</P>
      <P>Where the recipient of a contributory old age pension has income from other sources, the income tax allowances and reliefs available against that other income are restricted to take account of the pension payable.  This ensures that the pension payments will not attract a direct tax charge and that the tax due is collected from the other income.  Income tax allowances for 1983-84 are restricted by the amount of pension receivable in the current tax year and weekly or monthly tax free allowances are calculated accordingly.</P>

      <P>I may have missed an important part of the Minister's reply.  Is the computer at the disposal of the Revenue Commissioners not in a position at the touch of a button to provide the information Deputy Flaherty wanted? Does it not show what everybody's net income is after at source deductions?  Is it not possible to sum up the totals in a way corresponding to that in which Deputy Flaherty put down this question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, deductions for PRSI are levelled on reckonable earnings, that is gross income less superannuation contributions.  It is on that basis that the information I referred to is available. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest, as the Deputy does, that we should have a breakdown of the information on the basis of gross income levels and that, among other things, is receiving attention in the consideration we are giving to computerisation generally in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows: at end-March 1973 the foreign debt outstanding was IR£126.4 million; by end-June 1977 it had risen to IR£1,013 million &mdash; an increase of approximate 701.4 per cent &mdash; not a very appropriate figure.  Between July 1977 and June 1981, debt outstanding increased from IR£1,013 million to IR£2,957 million &mdash; an increase of approximately 191.9 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will acknowledge that in terms of percentage increase the figure has increased almost eightfold and that the increase in percentage rates was threefold from 1977 to 1981.  Does the Minister agree with the view that heavy borrowing for growing current and capital deficits is a good response to the economic situation facing us at the moment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure the second part of the question arises.  From March 1973 to June 1977 the foreign debt increased by more than £800 million and from June 1977 the increase was roughly 701 per cent.  As I said, the second part of the Deputy's question does not arise. Of course, foreign borrowing is one of the measures that must be used by any Government to cover particular kinds of difficulties likely to arise.  The question is the scale of the borrowing and the advisability to continue a high rate of borrowing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my statement to the Dáil on 22 March on the outcome of the EMS realignment, the agreed change in the central rate of the Irish pound against the ECU was a reduction of 3.5 per cent. The Irish pound value of the total Exchequer foreign currency debt outstanding on 21 March 1983 was increased by £276 million as a result of the realignment while estimated foreign interest payments for the remainder of 1983 were increased by £17 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my statement to the House on 22 March, the Government are determined that any increase in debt servicing costs this year will not be allowed to affect the overall budgetary arithmetic and we will closely monitor the trends in the public <Col N="29" /> finances as a whole with a view to taking any necessary action to achieve the budget targets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister note the difference in the figures between the time of devaluation, when the figure he gave was £250 million, and the later figure of £276 million?  He will acknowledge there is a difference in the figure he is now quoting and that given on the date of devaluation.  Allowing for that difference, what will the impact be on the budget deficit as a percentage of GNP? In his budget statement the Minister indicated that the opening borrowing requirement was more than £2,000 million, which would have been 16.8 per cent.  Then he indicated that as a consequence of his budget it would be £1,722 million, or 13 per cent.  Would the Minister now acknowledge that as a consequence of devaluation it will be closer to the original figure and that therefore the budget estimates have been driven off target?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first part of the Deputy's question I repeat that the figures I have given, £276 million and £17 million are the figures I gave on 22 March in this House.  The Deputy is well aware that on an occasion like the realignment meeting, or any other EEC Council meeting, immediately following a decision the effects of decisions taken will necessarily be approximate and therefore take some more time to work out.  The Deputy is not on firm ground when he makes particular points on the difference between £250 million and £276 million in circumstances of that nature.  As far as the effect of these developments on the current budget deficit is concerned, I have made the point that the Government are determined that the increase in servicing costs will not be allowed to affect the overall budgetary arithmetic and that we will be reviewing trends in public finances on the whole to ensure that the budget target will be adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Though the Minister may find it blandly reassuring to say that the Government are determined that <Col N="30" /> they will not yield from the overall budget arithmetic, will he tell us how he intends to give effect to that bland reassurance having regard to the impact which this will have on overall budget arithmetic and having regard to the statement by the Minister for Health, for example, that the Estimates for the Department will be well in excess of the original Estimate?  In view of that, how can the Minister make the point by way of bland reassurance that the overall budget arithmetic will not be upset?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue is not in any way bland.  It is evident that a trend of this kind will have to be corrected and the measures taken to bring about that correction will be anything but bland.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I am not in a position now to say what the measures will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with me that Irish foreign borrowing will be repaid largely in goods and services sold abroad, and therefore that the effect of devaluation on our ability to repay will be greatly reduced?  Out ability to pay will be greatly reduced by the fact that we will be earning more £s for goods and services sold abroad, and particularly agricultural goods.  Therefore the difficulty about repayments arising out of <Col N="31" /> devaluation is not nearly as serious as it would appear to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the general thrust of the Deputy's remarks.  There is already evidence that the devaluation which resulted from the realignment and from events since then, is having a positive effect on the capacity of our exporting firms to make progress.  To that extent, there should be a positive effect on revenue to the State over a wide area. The effect of a devaluation of this kind properly worked out and taken advantage of by our exporting firms and those competing with imports is not universally negative.  Deputy O'Kennedy asked a specific question to which a specific answer can be given.  The arrangements for dealing with those differences have to be considered in the light of trends in the economy as a result, among other things, of the beneficial effects of the devaluation.</P>

The total Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1982 was £1,945 million for 1983, £1,722.  That is the budget estimate.  The semi-State sector borrowing requirement was £521 million for 1982 and £664 million for 1983.

Does it indicate that, as a percentage of our export earnings, our creditworthiness is much better than the Taoiseach and the chairman of the Allied Irish Banks suggested abroad?

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have received a preliminary report from the Garda authorities on this matter.  I am informed that around midnight on Saturday night last the Garda were notified of a disturbance outside a licensed premises in Finglas.  On arrival at the scene, the members discovered that the exits from the premises were obstructed by three burning vehicles. There was no evidence of any other disturbance at this time.  The fires were extinguished by the fire brigade.  In the disturbances which had taken place before gardaí arrived, three persons were injured.  As charges are expected to be preferred in connection with the incidents in question, it would not be appropriate for me to make a detailed statement. I can assure the House that the Garda will take whatever steps are practicable to ensure that there will be no recurrence of such incidents.</P>

      <P>A ministerial conference in Paris.  I would refer the Deputy to the Government statement of 10 March 1983 which set out their policy in relation to current pay negotiations. The statement indicates that the Government respect the rights and freedom of all parties to the pay negotiations to argue their case from the viewpoint of their own knowledge, experience and interest. However, the statement pointed out that the Government have to take such steps as may be necessary to safeguard the national interest.  I understand that it was in accordance with Government policy, as indicated in the statement of 10 March, that the Minister for Finance felt it was approprriate to communicate with the insurance industry about a proposed pay settlement in one of the companies.  I am sure that the House will agree that Ministers should not be precluded from giving their views on particular pay settlements which are proposed, when they are satisfied that such action is justified in the national interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister of State's reply that the Labour Party policy now is the breaking of agreements formerly entered into by both sides and if he would not agree that this is a dangerous practice and something not acceptable to employer and trade union interests?  Is the statement attributed to the Minister last Sunday now firm policy as to what action the Government intend to take regarding agreements which have been made?  In other words, is the Minister speaking for the Government in what he said last Sunday, or was it another provocative approach by him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government attitude to agreements on pay has been clearly stated in their statement of 10 <Col N="44" /> March, where they asserted that the Government respect the rights and freedom of all parties to pay negotiations to argue their case from the viewpoint of their own knowledge.  The situation in which we find ourselves demands that we place ourselves in a position to benefit from such bright spots as can be seen on the economic horizon and that we place ourselves in a position to maintain and increase competitiveness.  Given the unemployment situation we face, anything less would be wholly unsatisfactory. It was in those circumstances that the Minister for Finance found it necessary to comment on a particular pay settlement, just as the previous Minister for Finance found it necessary to communicate similarly.  I am sure Deputy Gene Fitzgerald will recall the fact that on 27 September 1982 the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ray MacSharry, wrote a letter in very similar terms.  But, if the Deputy's memory is in any sense deficient, I would be delighted to read the letter and he will see just how similar they are.  That letter was addressed to the President of the Federated Union of Employers, written on 27 September 1982 by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald's colleague, the former Minister for Finance, and read as follows:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr Galvin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Friday, the Government were discussing the progress of the negotiations with the trade unions on pay restraint in the public sector this year and next when they learned that one of your members, the Zurich Insurance Company, had already settled on a 19½% pay increase for its staff as the opening settlement of the 23rd pay round.  I find it extraordinary that, despite the numerous contacts between your organisation and the Government, both at official and Ministerial level since last July, when this settlement was apparently negotiated, the matter has not come to light before now.  This sets an appalling headline for other companies in the insurance and financial sectors and makes the position of the Government in its current <Col N="45" /> negotiations with the public sector unions almost impossible.</P>
    <P>The Government have for months past been bending every effort &mdash; at enormous political cost &mdash; to achieve a major reduction in public sector pay increases.  Their efforts cannot succeed unless they have the support of the private sector, from whom a great volume of complaints has come about pay levels in the public sector and their repercussive effects on the private sector. It is a strange commentary on these complaints that independent analysis clearly shows that under the 22nd pay round public service pay has increased by 13½%, the rise in manufacturing has been 16½%, while in the insurance sector it has increased by over 20%.  In the face of this, the Government find it difficult to take seriously the complaints of the FUE and similar bodies about trend-setting pay increases in the public sector.</P>
    <P>I would remind you of the vociferous complaints of your members and others in the insurance industry at the time of the March, 1982 budget about the imposition of the insurance levy.  The Government, in response to assertions that the profits of the insurance companies could not absorb the levy, allowed them to pass it on in the form of charges to their policyholders.  Since it seems clear that the same profits are capable of sustaining unwarranted pay increases to their staff, the Government must now seriously consider increasing the insurance levy and taking steps to ensure that the companies are not permitted to pass it on. </P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to ask the Minister of State would he not agree &mdash; this is for the information of his ministerial colleagues &mdash; that there is a vast difference between the letter written by my colleagues, Deputy MacSharry, and the public statement of the present Minister for Finance on Sunday last.  Would the Minister of State not agree that that letter does not at any stage ask for the breaching of agreements formally entered into between employer and trade union bodies?  Would the Minister of State now support the contention he has made, seeing that he says his Minister who is away in Paris, would welcome this question?  Is he now endorsing the fact that the Labour Party are supporting the concept of breaching voluntary agreements formally entered into in accordance with well laid down industrial practice?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I can hardly agree <Col N="47" /> that the letters are in any sense dissimilar when the language used is all but identical. The situation was that on 27 September 1982 the then Minister for Finance became aware of a pay settlement which he found to be incompatible with the then Government's objectives.  He thought it appropriate to bring his and the Government's views to the notice of the employer organisations at that time. What happened last week was that the Minister for Finance became aware of a proposed pay settlement which was not in accordance with the Government's guidelines set out on 10 March and, following the precedent established by his predecessor, he brought his views to their attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has not answered my question. Does he not agree that there is a vast difference between the letter &mdash; the private letter, incidentally &mdash; which he has read out here, and which I think is another major mistake on the part of the Minister of State, and the statements of the Minister for Finance on Sunday last when he asked for the breaking of formal agreements which had been entered into in accordance with well laid down industrial relations practice?  That is the major difference.  Secondly, does the Minister of State not now agree that the Minister for Labour is endorsing these comments of the Minister of Finance as being Labour Party policy to breach well laid down formally entered into wage agreements? Is this the Government's attitude to wage agreements?  Would the Minister answer those two questions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The pay negotiations we are now entering into are absolutely critical for our economic and social well-being.  In those circumstances the Minister for Finance found it appropriate to communicate his views on one particular settlement that was clearly not in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Government on 10 March.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned on Tuesday last I had referred to the crime figures for 1981-82 showing an increase of 23 per cent compared with the previous year.  Having been reading the events of the past week it is my opinion that if we are to prevent a further increase in crime, we need a greater police force, that we need, so to speak, a garda at every street corner.</P>
      <P>We cannot hope to combat crime until we attempt first to treat its root causes. As I mentioned briefly on the last occasion, the widening gap between the privileged and the have-nots is increasing. Until such time as Governments realise how serious the whole crime situation is we cannot expect to bring about a decrease in the crime rate.  A high percentage of our population is under the age of 25.  They are well educated and have high expectations but unfortunately their expectations are not being fulfilled so far as jobs are concerned with the result that they are becoming frustrated, cynical and bitter about our democratic system.  If our young people are denied the opportunity of using their talents in a constructive way we will have much more trouble in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides the opportunity for young offenders to repay the community by way of compensating for the damage <Col N="151" /> they have caused.  The Bill is designed to operate in a way that will not leave the stigma of jail on the record of such offenders.  It is a means of weaning young people away from crime and keeping them separated from the hardened criminals in our jails.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Similar legislation has been successful in other countries.  A previous speaker said that we should not go along necessarily with the ideas of Britain or elsewhere.  I agree with that to an extent but the corresponding schemes in Britain, in Canada and in New Zealand have proved successful.  There must be a good deal of merit in introducing something that has been tried and found to be successful in other cases.  In the past number of years a number of projects undertaken in the Cork area involving prisoners in community works have been very successful.  However, the only fault I could find with them was that the participants were easily identified as prisoners. I trust that will not be the case in this instance and that the community will accept the Bill as a plan to keep young people away from crime.  Part of the plan should be the provision of facilities for proper leisure-time activities.  There is nothing like the discipline of a game or involvement in a club or organisation for keeping young people on the straight and narrow.  From my experience with sports clubs and youth organisations I am aware that very few members get involved in crime subsequently.</P>
    <P>I hope financial allocations to such projects are increased.  While I accept that money has been allocated for youth projects and sporting organisations it has not been sufficient, particularly when one considers that our young people have so much free time.  This is an ideal opportunity to try out leisure and sporting projects. It is a pity that major commercial companies tend to invest their money in glamour sporting events while so many community-based projects are starved of finance.  Our major commercial enterprises should invest money in community projects.</P>
    <P>We will be wasting our time in approving <Col N="152" /> these services if we do not consider the leadership that is necessary.  I am learning frightening things from young people and I find they are becoming more cynical about our democratic system. Unless there are changes from the top down, our young people will become more cynical, frustrated and bitter.  I have had contact with a number of young offenders and they have challenged me on many occasions about the way our democratic system works, in particular what they term as abuses of our democratic system by those in power.  What is thrown at me very often recently is the use of State cars and the payment of Ministerial pensions.  To be honest, I find it hard to explain or justify such expenditure to those who may be on unemployment assistance.  Before we can hope to control the crime rate or wean young people away from crime we, as the leaders in the country, must give the example. I accept that the last administration, like the Coalition Government, were genuine in their efforts to wean young people away from hardened criminals and keep them out of prison.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and I hope sufficient money will be made available so that the scheme can be administered properly.  It is important also that sufficient welfare staff are appointed to administer the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil mé chun fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo nó nach bhfuil.  D'fhéadfainn, mar a rinne daoine eile a labhair romham, é sin a dhéanamh ach go fírinneach níl mé ach beagáinín beag sásta leis an méad atá scríofa ann.  Caithfidh mise anseo, cosúil le chuile duine eile, labhairt de réir mar a mhothaím.  It is because of that, and appreciative of the fact that a Fianna Fáil Government and the Coalition Government have been associated with the presentation of the Bill, that in all honesty I must say I am very unenthusiastic about this legislation.  I shall endeavour to indicate why that is my position.  The people in my constituency &mdash; I owe my first allegiance to my constituents bearing in mind all the time the responsibility which is on me to give what might be identifed as <Col N="153" /> leadership &mdash; are law abiding, about 95 per cent of them, and they are prepared to go about their business and look for nothing from society except the right to live.  They seek the right to do that without offending or injuring anybody and they do not expect anything more than reciprocity.</P>
      <P>However, because of the times in which we live and the nature of man we have in the State certain institutions charged with protecting the rights and interests of those people, the Department of Justice, the legal profession and the Garda.  We have other organisations and other Departments concerned about the interests of those people but, in respect of this legislation, we are only concerned about the simple responsibility of allowing people the right to live their lives in peace.  I am not saying that this is the responsibility of the Government; it is the responsibility of all Governments and the fact that the problem has been compounded in recent months is not entirely the fault of the Government although it is their responsibility. It is not an understatement to say that the situation in the country, in my constituency and in the constituency of the Minister of State, is such that the 95 per cent of our people whom I referred to have lost faith in the Departments, our institutions and the professions charged with providing care and protection for them.  In particular, they have lost faith in the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not make that statement with any relish.  I do so with a certain amount of reluctance but if I remain silent any longer I will regret that I did not tell the House of how I feel about the times in which we live.  The legislation before the House seems to be a step further in making apologies to those found guilty of offences.  I have heard references to sensitivity that the stigma of a person having been found guilty of an offence should be removed, that in respect of the penalties which normal society requires for offences we should be making apologies.  I do not agree.  If we are to live in any class of organised society there must be an acceptance <i>ab initio</i> that there is reward <Col N="154" /> for doing the right thing and lack of reward for doing a wrong.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen told us of his interest in the young people of his constituency.  I have a similar interest.  That interest is not just superficial; I have an interest of involvement.  I can tell the House that they are fast losing faith in us because they see us condone a situation where there seems to be far more regard for the wrongdoer and far more consideration and provision for the criminal than for the young person who is living in accordance with the normal requirements of society.  Is there not justification for the young teenager feeling that way and, if that is so, are we not culpable?  If the young male teenager, charged with all the interest and sense of adventure that is his nature, is prepared at times to withdraw from those urges which would satisfy him but which are damaging to his neighbour and if he is prepared to forego the transient or ephemeral pleasure because he accepts it is not the correct thing to do or because there is a deterrent against his doing it, why in Heaven's name do we make it obvious to him that there will be a reward for the teenager who does not submit to that personal discipline, who allows his sense of adventure to run riot and who will yield to all those urges and harm himself and his neighbour?  Will the normal, well behaved youth not learn the lesson that he should so indulge?  That is what is happening.</P>
    <P>I refer again to an RTE programme made two years ago in my constituency which was full of sympathy and encouragement for the teenager who will take a car.  They interviewed a parent who said that his son had come to him telling him about such things as taking cars.  Nobody asked this parent whether he had told his son that this was not the correct thing to do.  There was a glorification of this activity. I do not want to appear to be saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; but it is significant that problems which have arisen of late in my constituency are headquartered at the point where RTE set up their headquarters when making that programme.  I do not want to attach full blame to RTE but I am entitled to comment in pursuit of <Col N="155" /> the case I am making that if we appear to accept the wrongdoer, if we appear to glorify him and his activity and if we allow that person who is breaking the law to get special attention, then we must run the risk of being accused of nurturing rather than discouraging such happenings.</P>
    <P>This legislation does nothing more than fan my cynicism.  We are told that we cannot get sufficient gardaí to patrol and carry out the law as it exists.  It is well known that members of the Garda will tell people their hands are tied if they have recourse to them in respect of some injury done to them.  That is the response being given by the gardaí to law abiding people who have recourse to the normal destination of all of us when in trouble, if we are being attacked by our neighbour or our property is being injured.  When people can identify the wrongdoer the Garda are quite likely to say that they know the person, that he has been before the courts ten times but they can do nothing because their hands are tied.  That is not good enough.  Until we have remedied this there is little point in presenting to the House this piece of paper containing aspirations and providing for a situation that may be appropriate in other nations where normal standards are higher than ours but which are practically useless in the face of the prevailing standards here.  That is not to dismiss from consideration knowledge I have about projects that have been pursued by men from Arbour Hill and Mountjoy in coming to my constituency and others and working on the provision of a scout den or other building to be used for community purposes.  I would do that only when everything else had been satisfied.  We are codding ourselves and the people if we think that what is proposed here will make any worthwhile contribution towards curing our ills.</P>
    <P>I return to my constituents and their simple demands.  I can boast of a greater number of PAYE taxpaying constituents than perhaps any other constituency. They are making a contribution towards the maintenance of law and order.  Of the many millions provided for the Department <Col N="156" /> of Justice, our judges, solicitors and lawyers, the people whom I represent make a considerable contribution.  I am not being too demanding on their behalf and there is no point in saying that the problems there arise because it is a built-up area.  Shame upon us and our planners if in our wisdom, or lack of it, we have put so many families of the same kind in one area.  I would not be able to put up with the adversity, the abuse and the lack of consideration under different Governments suffered by people living in my constituency.  They feel completely isolated.  They make a contribution towards the Garda, toward educating our doctors, teachers and our lawyers but they can never speak to one of them except when those people are paid to listen to them.  They cannot have recourse to those people in their normal social lives, yet they pay five-sixth's of what it costs to train those people.  We accept a situation that, because it is happening there, it is what one expects; but there is not an acceptance of the fundamental requirement in a democracy that those people more than any others are entitled to the protection of the State, especially when going about their normal business, which invariably means working hard.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that if somebody injures one of those people we in our wisdom will accept that the person causing the injury is making full restitution to the injured person and society if he condescends to perform some physical work which some civil servant or social worker decides he should do.  I do not accept that.  The problem in my constituency is that there are far too many good people anxious to do work in the community, and there is far too much work to be done in the community without depending on having it done by a person who causes harm to another person as provided in this Bill.  This work is to be done under certain officers.  Have they been appointed?  Probation officers in the Department of Justice tell me that they are far too busy.  I am aware that the Government have an embargo on the appointment of additional people.  Is there an embargo on the appointment of <Col N="157" /> additional probation officers?  What provision has been made?  I believe the speed at which this Bill has come before the House is an attempt at getting away from the unwelcome fact that we have not prison accommodation at the moment for the people spoken about in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Have the normal, traditional and well-tried means of bringing people to justice failed, or are we running away from them?  Does it look well to show to our neighbours, as well as to the people abroad, that we have brought our sense of justice and our laws to such a refined state that now any little boy who attacks or rapes his neighbour is put out painting a wall and we think that is very good?  We put that person out removing graffiti from a wall and we think that is an excellent form of rehabilitation.  I do not think it is.  We are all concerned when we do this that the person might only do it in darkness or when he is doing it nobody must know that he raped or injured his neighbour. The Minister of State in the House at the moment is a learned lawyer and a distinguished politician.  Does he accept that is the solution to the many existing problems?  Should we not see to it instead that, irrespective of the cost, the existing agencies, which are being well paid, apply themselves to carrying out the law in relation to the protection and the well-being of our citizens?</P>
    <P>I never indulge in the usual clap-trap of welcoming a Bill.  I am not dismissing this Bill as useless but as next door to it, because I do not see its immediate implementation. We have not got the work that can be done.  I see in it an escape from what we should be doing.  I have read all the contributions to date and I note that certain freedoms have been given to speakers.  I am quite happy that I am remaining within those freedoms.  I am also mindful of the fact that in respect of any Bill one is entitled, on Second Stage, to refer to what is in it or what might be in it.  I am very happy that I should not incur your interruption in relation to my contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  We have good and well paid judges, lawyers, social workers and a Garda force, bigger than ever, a frightening investment in what is supposed to provide law and order.  We know we have reached the point that there are impediments and inhibitions in relation to the execution of the laws by the people to whom I have referred.  I am sure everybody has heard the stock reply about the uselessness, even though somebody has been identified, of bringing that person to court.  The Garda should be asked if that is true and, if it is not, they should stop saying it.  If the position is that, having brought somebody before the courts, they find themselves before a district justice or a judge who is not sensitive to the requirements, who thinks that he or she is free to interpret the law in a way which is not in accordance with what is being provided for, I believe the time has come when we should say to those men and women they are not doing their business in the fashion provided for.</P>
      <P>I said a few years ago, having heard a few whispers from members of my party who are friendly with the men in question, that there was no doubt that the time had come when every district justice and judge should have to undergo a medical examination.  A person applying for the most underpaid job in the civil service must submit to a medical examination. That is for people who could find themselves with no better company than a brush or no better companion than a pen. Why should the same not apply to people who will have the responsibility of interpreting the law and administering justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My solicitor and Garda friends tell me that it is well known that the nature of a decision from the bench can be influenced by the prevailing state of health of the judge who is sitting in judgment.  I am not identifying any judge, but if I were, I would not make any apology for it.  I look upon them in the same way as I look on a TD, teacher or anyone paid by the State.  They are there to give a service. For too long we have indulged in an oversensitivity and over-respect for these good gentlemen.  They do not look for it. They are well able to defend themselves. <Col N="159" /> Occasionally some of them make excursions into the political field and I do not see why I, as one who represents the people who pay their salaries, should not be entitled to make what I regard as fair comment on them.  I do not do so under the protection of the House.  I have said this outside the House and so cannot be accused of abusing my rights as a Member of the House.</P>
    <P>It is well known that some of these gentlemen are not up to the responsibility of their appointment.  Perhaps that could have been avoided if before their appointment they were subjected to a medical examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for his forbearance.  It is not my intention to make his life more difficult than it is but I am convinced that it was in order for me to criticise the judges under this Bill. I am happy that I have done so.  Surely <Col N="162" /> judges play an important part in the legislation before us.</P>
      <P>We have solicitors who take advantage of the fact that the same people appear before the courts very often because every time that person appears the solicitor is paid.  I have heard the Garda being criticised but no criticism of solicitors because there is a fund made available by the people whom I represent for them.  The solicitor is paid directly or indirectly.  I am not saying he has a vested interest in doing that but I appreciate he would not have the same objection to returning to court as someone who is not paid for doing so or someone who had been injured and is not getting the satisfaction to which he or she is entitled.</P>
      <P>It is now May 1983.  Please God we will all be here in May 1984.  I hope I am wrong but I predict that what is envisaged here will not have got off its feet.  It is because of that I am speaking in such a critical and cynical fashion.  I repeat that it gives me no pleasure.  We should be applying ourselves to a situation where we stop looking on society casualties as the standard for which we must provide. We are doing all we can to rehabilitate them but meanwhile we must afford protection to the people who are suffering. I am amazed at the sensitivity of some people who say in respect of a prisoner who might be asked to do some of the work envisaged in the Bill that he should not at any stage feel hurt or that anybody is looking at him.  That may be a person who perhaps a month before removed an eye or injured the face or person of his neighbour.  What about that person and the stigma that he or she must carry for the rest of his or her life?  What about the person who is robbed and battered? What about the person who is denied the normal service provided by CIE because some of these wrong-doers have decided that buses will only pass a certain road if they allow it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda, the Department of Justice and CIE who are charged with providing that service are running away from their responsibilities and we think we are going to solve all these problems by talking about a Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill.  It is a waste of time.  When <Col N="163" /> people have friends in court or are familiar with somebody who is making something worth while out of it, that cannot be spoken about.  It is shoved under the carpet. We indulge in claptrap and talk about what they are doing elsewhere and how projects have succeeded in other countries.  The acceptance of law and order is being eroded daily.  If the Criminal Justice Bill was being introduced next week I would not be availing of the opportunity of interpreting Standing Orders in the fashion allowed.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a mechanism in this Bill whereby anybody who is guilty of an offence, especially an offence which injures his neighbour, should be brought to justice and suffer the appropriate penalty for it so that it will be a deterrent against the repetition of such wrongdoing. The legislation before us is not going to provide that.  It would be appropriate and applicable if everything else was as ideal as we would like it to be but coming at a time when there is such disorganisation, disarray and indifference and where there is this feeling that we have failed the people &mdash; and I readily accept that accusation &mdash; this legislation will only serve further to fan the feelings that they have towards us.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Member of this House I have never been critical of TDs until today.  As a profession we are as good as any other.  We have commitment and dedication and are anxious to perform the duties entrusted to us in the best manner possible.  However, in respect of this legislation, we are taking the easy way out.  We should have told the Minister for Justice that this legislation is in appropriate to the times in which we live.  The former Government had envisaged the introduction of this Bill.  I hope they had envisaged introducing it after the new Criminal Justice Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for his assistance.  The legislation we should be considering here is a new Criminal Justice Bill.  Until that is introduced, it should be clearly understood <Col N="164" /> that we are no longer happy with the approach towards the wrongdoer and making apologies to him.  That is only encouraging him.  The appointment of a new corps of social workers who will appeal to the better judgment of these young people is not going to solve the problem.  The problem will be solved when we ensure that the laws that exist are applied in the proper fashion, that those who administer the laws are as industrious, conscientious and courageous as we here are, and to establish that from now on there will be no bonus, no credit, no sympathy, no apologies to those who break the laws.  We can go back to 1916 &mdash; if one is disposed to go back so far&mdash; and to defining the word &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;, the freedom so dearly won, the freedom of being able to go to your place of employment, return to your home, socialise, go to bed, happy in the thought that when you rise next morning you will not have had an unwelcome visitor.

I am not familiar with it being wrong in that case. <Col N="165" /> There are virtues across the water and we can learn from them in certain areas.  I hope that in certain areas they might learn from us, but they will not learn from us in the matter of the hypocrisy of expecting that people will accept that because we put this legislation through this House we are moving any step further in the direction of providing for that freedom to which I referred.  Again I return to it, and I am at a loss to know why Deputy Kelly would seem mildly dismissive of that type of freedom.  Is that not what freedom is about?  If you have not got it, of what use is any other freedom? I notice, too, that my definition of that freedom so dearly bought by our great forebears evoked from Deputy Shatter something between a smile and a smirk.  I am at a loss to know why.  I hope that presently he will indicate to this House his thoughts on the legislation and he will defend the people who might be regarded by him as having been unduly criticised by me.  He will give us the benefit of the difficulties that perhaps the legal profession have and to which he is privy.  He will indicate to us how he expresses his concern for the constituent of his who is suffering in the fashion that I have described as existing in my constituency. Perhaps he has some information which he will give to me about some solicitors who will look after the interests of such people free, gratis and for nothing, who will take a fatherly interest and fatherly care in trying to restore the flagging faith in all our legal profession that exists in my constituency.  If so, I will be very happy to relate that and abide by it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with your protection, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It is farcical that, having regard to the circumstances and conditions prevailing when the people of this nation are looking to us and crying out that we apply ourselves in heaven's name to give them better value for the money they are paying and to afford to them normal protection, the only answer we can come up with is that we are now discussing and studying a piece of legislation called the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill which we hope will solve their problems.  I am sure we all agree that there are difficulties (1) in bringing the wrongdoer to court and (2) in getting whatever is the sentence applied.  Will we not have the same difficulty in having whatever the penalty is applied under this legislation unless we tidy up that which exists?  I noticed that there was no suggestion from the benches opposite that all was well with the courts <Col N="167" /> or with the Garda in the matter of the administration of justice at the moment. We all know the difficulties that exist about people on bail committing other crimes.  We all know about people being sentenced and it not being possible to carry out the terms of that sentence. What provision is made under this legislation, bad and all as it is, that any sentence passed will be carried out?  Who has monitored the situation?  Has the situation been monitored so that we know all the areas where these operations can be carried out?</P>

I hope his reply will ease my mind and that he will tell us he has been in consultation with the agencies which can identify for him the areas where these people can carry out the work envisaged here.  I also hope he will be able to tell us that provision has been made in this year's budget for the appointment of additional probation officers and that the embargo on appointments will not apply here.  If he can do that I will accept that he is in earnest about what is proposed here.  It will not make me very happy to say at some future time, &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.

    <P>It must be admitted that this Government and our Government have failed in one of their foremost duties, that is, to ensure our people are protected and those who commit offences, especially offences against our neighbours, are made pay the appropriate penalty.

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to strike a fairly neutral note in dealing with a Bill promoted by the Government I support.  The Bill was well-meaning in its original form, which was a British form.  It first surfaced in substantial form in the powers of the Criminal Courts Act, 1973, the sixty second Act in the twentieth year of the reign of Elizabeth II.  There was the usual decorous interval of ten years during which alternative methods of penal treatment were mulled over by our domestic authorities of all political complexions.</P>
      <P>Now we have our own little Bill, the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill, 1983, the guts of which have been lifted straight out of the British Act.  I cannot count the number of times I have complained about that in this House, nor can I count the number of occasions on which I had to criticise patterns of Government and administration here, not necessarily all statutory, in which we seem to have no ideas of our own and wait until the British have taken any kind of step before we take one for ourselves.</P>
      <P>The conditions of criminality and criminal administration which led the British to introduce this experiment ten years ago were equally visible to us.  Nineteen seventy three was the year in which our jails were already bursting with offenders, many of them very violent and troublesome people.  The kind of problems which led the British to make this experiment were just as obvious, if not more obvious, here as they were across the water.  I am not going to labour this point because I have laboured it since I was elected to this House over ten years ago, and I do not want to weary Deputies or anybody else on the subject, but this is simply one more example in the ignominious parade of legislation masquerading under an Irish title &ldquo;An Bille um Cheartas Coiriúil (Seirbhís Pobail), 1983&rdquo; which is a British legislative idea taken over here and given a green outfit with silver buttons to make it look native. I protest against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The spirit of 1916 was invoked unctuously by Deputy Tunney 20 minutes <Col N="170" /> ago.  I believe and share the sentiments about 1916 which underlie what he was saying, but by a bizarre twist of his mind, which no X-ray or stethoscope would show were it the case that politicians were ever subjected to the annual medical check which he so anxiously recommends for the Judiciary, he seemed to think that the difference which 1916 should have won for us is that we could sleep in our beds at night with properly patrolled streets and relative freedom from fear of marauders and Ribbonmen.  The DMP provided at least that standard of tranquility and security to the people of this city 70 or 80 years ago, but that is not what freedom was about, as I do not need to tell Deputy Tunney because I know his heart is in the right place on this theme.  That is not what freedom is all about.  It is about running our own affairs in a way which seems most appropriate to our own problems.</P>
    <P>I must stigmatise this Bill, knowing I do not offend the Minister of State sitting in front of me, Deputy O'Keeffe, who has both a mind and a skin tough enough to withstand stuff like this from me, particularly since he knows that this Bill represents an area of consensus among both sides of the House.  Whatever Deputy Tunney may say about it, it is exactly the thing that 1916 was not all about.  It was not all about tamely copying British legislation 10 years after.</P>
    <P>In case, Sir, you do not believe me, it is true that the Bill does not literally, word for word, reproduce the British sections, although there are examples in our legislation, many of them, in which English sections are reproduced word for word, the only difference being what the despised legal profession would call the operation of the <i>mutatis mutandis</i> principle. We were careful enough to take out some references that are no longer or never were applicable in Ireland, like &ldquo;county courts&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;circuit courts&rdquo;.  We took that much trouble with it.  We change &ldquo;London&rdquo; to &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo;, things like that.  We are well able to make such changes, it is well within our competence, we are not stretched or worried to do that; but anything more substantial, like recognising or analysing a problem <Col N="171" /> which is under our own noses and doing it now and not waiting for the English to do it for us, seems to be beyond us. Whatever about the men of 1916, in the first years of the State under the late W. T. Cosgrave and ensuing years under the late Éamon de Valera, we had innovation and we used independent thinking.  That has now become lost and submerged.</P>
    <P>The Bill in front of us does not follow the 1973 English Act literally word for word, but in every important respect it does.  It defines in the same way the conditions in which these community orders may be made.  It defines &ldquo;community service&rdquo; in the same way.  It defines conditions for revoking orders in the same way.  It defines even the numbers of hours per week and per year which may maximally be spent on community service with the very same number of hours.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any ethnic or climatic reason to go out of one's way to differentiate between the number of hours of community service appropriate for an offender in Inverness and those apporpriate for an offender in Tullamore, which Deputy Connolly was talking about a moment ago.  However, I consider it uncanny, not in the nature of a free people, that time and again in our legislation, down to the number of hours we define, we decide that because the British did it it is more than good enough for us.</P>
    <P>I have nothing against a 40-hour week of community service, or against a 240hour year, but the likelihood that we would have decided on these figures had we been approaching the matter ourselves without any knowledge of what the British had done, is infinitesimally small. It clearly is cogged, like so much of our legislation, straight out of the English Act, 10 years on, and as far as I can see, without any visible reflection of any lessons that the British may have learned themselves in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With your indulgence I want to make one more point about legislation of this kind.  It is an important point.  There is a principle in our law since Mr. Justice Hanna's decision in the Pigs Marketing Board case against Donnelly in 1939, that legislation, an Act of the Oireachtas, is to be deemed constitutional in the sense that a presumption operates in its favour which it is for the person challenging the Act to overthrow, rather in the way that an accused person in a criminal court is presumed innocent until shown to be guilty: in the same way, an Act of the Oireachtas carries a presumption in its favour that it is constitutional, and it is up to the person challenging it to demonstrate the contrary: the State is under no obligation to demonstrate its constitutionality; the onus is the other way around.</P>
      <P>That is a very logical and rational presumption and it is easy to see the reason for it because the courts have to assume in respect to another arm of the State that the Oireachtas has respected the injunction of Article 15 and has not enacted something that is repugnant to the Constitution.  That is the basis on which the presumption rests.  Although as a general proposition that is unchallengeable, I believe that that presumption ought to apply, if at all, with much diminished force when one has a statute which has been cogged straight from the English Statute Book, because that is visibly not a statute to which an Irish mind and the mind of this House have been directed <i>de novo</i>, directed from scratch.  It is something that has been taken from a strange jurisdiction with no written constitution, to which none of the rules to which we have become accustomed in the last 60 years applies, in which parliament is sovereign and can make or unmake anything it likes until it runs up against the walls of biological impossibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we take from the other jurisdiction a statute and put in into Irish dress and write it on green paper with minimal consideration which is visible from the fact that whole clauses of the statute, entire sections, whole phrases, are copied out word for word, then the presumption <Col N="173" /> of constitutionality must apply at least on rationale, when presumption exists at all, with much diminished force, and it is only a matter of time &mdash; it would be an impertinence to predict this &mdash; before some court finds to that effect.  I do not say I can see anything unconstitutional in this Bill, although I will point to something which seems to me to be caught in a corner, something which I believe an Irish draftsman approaching the matter from scratch would not have done.</P>
    <P>However, before I get to that rather technical matter I would ask the Minister of State, if he gets a chance to reply this evening, or the Minister for Justice, whether they would be good enough to let us know the cost of operating this system of community service.  What will be the cost of supervision?  I hope I will not have some smartie coming along to say I am applying preconception to criminality. Honestly, I know very little about criminality and I am not an expert on it in any shape or form.  I have appeared for accused persons at the Bar and that is the only context in which I have come across it.  I willingly admit that I very likely know far less about it than solicitors in practice, like the two Deputies here beside me.</P>
    <P>Far too little work has been done on the specific Irish mores of criminality.  I hardly need to weary the House by saying that we rely on English textbooks as though the patterns of social existence and the criminality that goes with them are likely to be the same in Macclesfield as they are in Bangor Erris.  We tend to do very little study nationally on the forms that criminality takes here or on the most appropriate methods of dealing with them.  We have done very little experimenting.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill is an experiment which was suggested to us by British experience.  I would like to know therefore whether any cost estimate has been made of supervising these offenders who will be made the subjects of community orders.  These offenders are not just any old offenders.  It will not be somebody who in other respects is law abiding, although I do not pretend there is a moral gap.  However, this kind of order cannot be made against somebody who normally <Col N="174" /> in the opinion of the courts would be adequately punished with a fine.  In other words, a grossly negligent driver, perhaps even somebody who injures another person, commonly is not given a prison sentence here.  Somebody who cheats the Revenue so far is commonly not given a prison sentence; somebody who gives short weight, somebody who sells drink to minors in pubs or supermarkets.  These people are not given prison sentences.  I will not try to explain that.  I will let a sociologist or a criminologist do so.</P>
    <P>It may be that the middle class have a kind of tacit or unspoken, unwritten form of privilege in this regard.  I do not know about that.  All I am observing is that there is a wide range of offences which are criminal offences, and about which people in this House are forever listening to complaints &mdash; people give out and say these criminals are the same as wretched, under-privileged youngsters who commit mayhem on the streets and in the suburbs &mdash; to which sentences of imprisonment are not as a rule or at all applied. Offenders of this kind are completely outside the scope of this Bill.  Why? Because the British say so.  Why? Because the British Act is like that.  That is the only reason.  The British Act has exactly the same fence around the conditions in which these orders may be made.  They are a substitute for imprisonment, not for a fine.</P>
    <P>I know almost nothing about this but I do know that community service as a penal measure is applied in some parts of continental Europe.  There was a passing reference to that in the Minister's speech. In Scandinavia they make a drunken driver do community service.  I do not believe there is anything wrong in making somebody who, in the ordinary way, is punished by a suspension of his licence and a fine perhaps, be seen to be weeding a public park.  Naturally that is a somewhat ignominious punishment.  I do not want to be taken as advocating it.  It is very easy to be glib in advocating punishments for others.  It is unlucky to do that, and I am not doing it now.</P>
    <P>The people who were behind this Bill, in whatever party and in whatever Department, did not look further than <Col N="175" /> across the channel.  Apparently they gave no thought to the possibility that community service orders might be appropriate in some contexts for that kind of offender.  They restricted it to the kind of offender for whom imprisonment is commonly doled out.  That is exactly the kind of offender, because of the kinds of offence to which it is usually attached, the average Irish citizen will not want to have hanging around his premises, will not want to have weeding paths or clipping hedges outside his house, will not want to have next or near him.  He will complain if he finds that a number of offenders of this kind are being employed in his vicinity, and employed not under constant police supervision, but in such a way that they can fill in the work in their own time, in any free hours they have.</P>
    <P>What will be the cost of supervising adequately the kind of offender for whom this Bill is tailored?  I do not know what the cost will be.  Perhaps it will not be very much.  The Minister made an allusion to the likelihood that he would have to recruit staff.  We may be perfectly certain that is exactly what he will have to do.  He said it may be necessary for the probation and welfare service to employ people either on a paid or a voluntary basis.  How many is he likely to get on a voluntary basis if they can be paid for it, and if a case can be made to pay them? What kind of industrial problems does he think he will have if he imagines he will be able to run one part of the service for nothing while paying the rest?  He said it may be necessary to employ people either on a paid or a voluntary basis to supervise the actual performance of the work.  I am damn sure it will be necessary.</P>
    <P>I am not a criminologist or a penologist. I am not advising a massive extension of the jails system.  Will it be all that much cheaper in the eyes of the Department of Justice than providing proper prison accommodation?  I am not advocating putting people in prison.  As a general rule, the best thing to do is keep them out of prison.  No matter what complaints come from a victimised community, on the whole you are more likely to <Col N="176" /> get recidivism and back-sliding into crime among people who have been sent to prison than among people who have managed to be kept out of prison.  I am not laying down the law about this.  I should like to know whether any cost analysis has been done on the likely product of this system in comparison with expanding prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Bill envisages the making of regulations for the refunding of travelling expenses, the offender's travelling expenses and presumably somebody to keep an eye on him while he travels down to Mountmellick, or wherever it may be, to do some community service there.</P>

      <P>I am asking these questions only because, regrettably, the Minister's speech contains nothing on this point.  I should also like to have known whether the Garda have any opinion about this Bill and, if so, what it is.  The Minister was silent on that as well.  The Minister in front of me will know I am not saying that in any carping sense.  I would ask that of any Minister.  That element is missing from the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>I should like to know whether the Garda look on this Bill as being one more headache, one more piece of cosmetic legislation which will increase the burdens on them, or whether they are willing to give it a chance.  Are they indifferent to it?  Are they cynical about it?  Are they bitterly opposed to it?  The Garda have collective opinions on these things.  Since they are the people who provide the cutting edge of the State in dealing with a criminality which most of us are lucky enough not to come in contact with, I would have thought their opinion was valuable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Garda view was that this would put a lot of rogues back on the streets, and put them back even quicker than they are now being put back, I would have been slow to go ahead with a Bill of this kind.  I emphasise that in saying that I do not want to insinuate that that is the opinion of the Garda.  I do not know what their opinion is.  For all I know it may be that they are anxious to give a thing like <Col N="177" /> this a chance.  That may well be the case. Very much to their credit, the Garda have done a great deal in trying to keep offenders, and particularly young offenders, out of prison.  It may be that they agree entirely with the spirit of this Bill.  At least the House should be told.</P>
    <P>The point to which I want to draw attention as an instance of where the draughtsman copied something from British legislation &mdash; and I believe he would have done better for himself had he pretended he was starting from scratch &mdash; is to be found in section 11 which deals with the revocation of community service orders.  Subsection (1) provides:</P>
    <P>Where a community service order is in force and, on application by the offender or a relevant officer, it appears to the District Court that it would be in the interests of justice, having regard to circumstances which have arisen since the order was made, that the order should be revoked or that the offender should be dealt with in some other manner for the offence in respect of which the order was made, the court may&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;do this, that or the other, things which may possibly be unwelcome to the offender.</P>
    <P>That phrase is far too vague for an Irish statute.  It may be all right for the English. In the much despised legal area which Deputy Tunney thinks so little of, we have erected far more independent measures and standards for ourselves than the State has in any other Department.  If I were showing a visitor from some other country around our constitutional supermarket, so to speak, there is no area I would show him more proudly as being an exemplification of the independence which was won in the way Deputy Tunney described, than the area in which the courts have been operating.</P>
    <P>The courts can operate only with the legislation put in front of them.  They cannot make legislation.  The District Court is now being given a power &ldquo;in the interests of justice&rdquo;&mdash; which is an extremely vague expression; it has a status in our law but not in a context like this &mdash; to adjudicate a standard which is <Col N="178" /> totally vague.  What are the interests of justice for a purpose like this?  &ldquo;...having regard to circumstances which have arisen since the order was made...&rdquo;  What circumstances?  Does it mean having regard to the fact that offences have been committed by the person about whom an order was made and that he has been convicted of those offences?  Has he committed some fresh offence?  If so, say so.</P>
    <P>Have the circumstances nothing to do with a fresh offence?  Have they come to light in regard to the ability of the Department to effect proper supervision?  What are the circumstances?  What is the basis on which this jurisdiction will rest?  That is a jurisdiction which may mean, possibly if it is not interpreted in a liberal manner, that some offender who is making a go of a community service order, or has almost discharged the number of hours he has been sentenced to community service, may find himself hauled back before the District Court and subjected to some quite different treatment, perhaps sent to prison, in consequence of the application of a standard which no one in this House can now define.  I do not know what is meant by &ldquo;circumstances which have arisen&rdquo; or &ldquo;the interests of justice&rdquo;.  The only explanation for those phrases being in the section is that they are in the English section.  The words of our section 11 (1) &mdash; the right to enact which we fought for in 1916 &mdash; are to be found in section 17 (2) of the British Act. My tongue has got the better of me, as it so often does, in some respects in this contribution but I did intend to make a serious technical point which I hope the Minister will see fit to deal with in his reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that I share the constituency of Dublin South with the previous speaker who has shown himself to be not only a wonderful orator but a new-found Republican.  I did not know that Deputy Kelly had such an aversion to British legislation or to adopting some of the provisions enacted there. I cannot say I disagree with him entirely but neither will I develop a fixation about it, because if an idea is good I do not see any reason why we should employ an <Col N="179" /> army of civil servants poring over statutes and precedents in order to reinvent the wheel.  I do not see any common sense in that approach, just because we have some difficulty with the freedom from Britain for which we fought so hard. Some of our own constitutional provisions have found their way into the colonial constitutions.  I take a rather practical view and feel we should adopt good ideas if they can keep down our costs of research and so on.  I would be quite happy to adopt good ideas whether they be American, Canadian, Swiss or British. Crime is not an Irish problem only.  It is a problem suffered by every civilised society and we must examine the situation in each country, not just Britain, to see how they are tackling crime.  The alternative is to employ a group of public servants for some indeterminate time to reinvent the wheel and figure out how to tackle crime without considering any of the approaches adopted elsewhere.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Kelly is saying that people should not go to prison and, on the other hand, that these community service orders will not work, the alternative is to turn people loose.  I would guess that this is not what Deputy Kelly would advocate, but I wonder what precisely he would do with offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find much that is wrong with this Bill in some ways, but there is some imagination in it and imagination is badly needed in the economic and legal areas and particularly in the area of crime.  I am prepared to give this Bill a chance and to see how it works.  If Deputy Kelly chooses to look at the scheme which has been operating since 1976 in Britain and <Col N="180" /> Northern Ireland he will see that it has had some success.  The alternative is to put people in cells and throw away the key.  That is not a real alternative for a civilised society.  We must be imaginative and consider new methods.  Is it not better for people to repay society by doing some work rather than languishing in prison at enormous cost to the taxpayer? It must make sense and the only difficulty is whether this Bill will work.  I am not too concerned about points concerning taxi fares and so on.  I am concerned that the scheme should be given an opportunity to work.  If it does not, we must try something else.</P>
    <P>The community will benefit because work will be done which would not otherwise be done.  The courts will benefit because they will have a better opportunity to make the punishment fit the crime. The prison administration will benefit because it will relieve congestion in overcrowded prisons.  There is public support for some move of this kind.  There is not a Deputy who does not daily attend meetings where the subject of crime is raised. The public are not quite sure what they want but they are asking for answers from the Dáil to the problem of crime.  I found support for the principles of this Bill at meetings.  The general public did not have access to the details of the Bill but there was a feeling that something must be done and, if the Bill is a step in the right direction, let us have it.  That is the mood of my constituents and I doubt if the mood is different anywhere else.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with offenders over the age of 16.  The Minister might consider having a look at a different type of work for people under 16 because that seems to be an area which is not getting the attention it deserves.  The age of criminal responsibility is still seven years of age. I have a seven-year-old son and I do not regard him as being of a mind or an age to be a criminal.  Anyone with children must realise that this is a ridiculous situation. All the lawyers have now left the House, which probably means that we can have a more reasonable political debate, because they would state that the age of criminal responsibility is a matter fraught with legal difficulties.  We must <Col N="181" /> untie those difficulties.  A child of seven cannot be a criminal, by any stretch of the imagination.  Perhaps there is another type of work of a less penitential nature available to youngsters, possibly of the boy scout bob-a-job kind.  This could be an extension of the scheme.  Having criticised Deputy Kelly, I must say that I share his view that an Irish hand could have been found to extend the ideas in the scheme.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk recently about how to tackle crime and headlines have been full of this vigilante nonsense. I want no hand, act or part in any vigilante groups.  They should not be encouraged. The Government should make it quite clear that it is the Garda who have responsibility for enforcing law and order and that nobody else should be permitted to take the law into their own hands however well intentioned.  I want to make that clear as my personal view on that subject.  I do not believe it has been said loudly enough because there is a feeling around that somehow it is public-spirited to take someone who has committed a crime behind a wall and beat the head off him.  There is a feeling around about that. If this Bill does anything to relieve that type of feeling that is great.  If not the Government should say quite clearly that this country will not have what have now become known as vigilantes; we just will not have them.</P>

      <P>I want to raise the question also of whether this Bill is suitable to tackle the terrible drugs situation here.  I do not need to recount the statistics on that subject.  Suffice it to say, from my research, one in ten teenagers in this country is now playing with heroin.  That is a frightening figure.  It is a hidden, sinister crime and one that is difficult to handle.  I wonder will this Bill do anything in that regard because, if somebody is accused, found guilty and sentenced to X hours of community work, how do we know that the other X hours of their time will not be spent continuing their trade in drug trafficking?  There is no way it can be supervised to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> While this Bill will be helpful in other areas I suggest it will be most unhelpful in that area of the fastest growing crime &mdash; as I said before &mdash; now the fastest growing business with the greatest turnover of any company in Dublin city today.  I do not think the provisions of this Bill will do anything in that regard. I would ask that some alteration be made in its provisions to allow for the handling of that drugs situation &mdash; perhaps extra supervision, perhaps extra reporting, some other area of greater or more intensive supervision if it happens to be a drugs offence.  I do not think the ordinary supervision will suffice.</P>
    <P>The whole area of law enforcement and of crime in Ireland today is one on which we could hold up this House for many years if we got into it.  I do not intend to do that today.  But I want to say this, that the suburbs of this city today are terrorised at the extent of crime in the city.  That takes me back to my opening point, that it is not just more laws, more gardaí and so on that are required, it is imagination.  I ask the Government, the Minister and the officials advising these people to bring a little imagination to bear on old problems.  To an extent that is what politics is about, tackling old problems in a fresh way.  That is what leadership is about, bringing fresh minds and approaches to old problems and my God, crime is the oldest problem we have.  I am asking the Minister and his officials to bring some fresh thinking to it, for example, such as the idea of trying to establish a police point in every substantial suburb.  There are whole suburbs, such as Dundrum, Rathfarnham, right across the board, each the size of an Irish town.  For example, Rathfarnham is almost the size of Galway city.  Take Dundrum and a few more places thrown in and one has an area the size of Cork city. Tallaght has up to 90,000 people with one Garda station, and so on.  The kind of imagination for which I am asking is that perhaps those areas could be broken down into communities, with a community police point whether it be only a telephone number, a letter-box, a sentry or even a local post office but, whatever it be, it would constitute a fresh idea and <Col N="183" /> establish a police point.  The greatest difficulty of which I have been told in dealing with crime in my constituency is that when people want to contact the Garda, particularly when in difficulty, they discover there is no local spot to do that, that they must contact the rather remote Garda stations that service the fast growing surburban population.</P>
    <P>What I am asking for is a community policing system.  I do not believe it would take any more money or an enormous number of extra men.  It requires just a little imagination to use our existing resources a little better.  Dublin city has become enormously impersonal.  Most of its estates would be the size of an ordinary Irish town, be that Portumna or whatever. There are estates the size of those towns.  But the difference is that those towns such as Portumna, Mullingar or whatever, have their own Garda station, their own police protection, their town hall, their civic services and their sense of identity.  But that is not available in Dublin, suburban Dublin particularly at present, in the huge concrete jungles that have grown up.  It is no problem now to build 2,000 houses.  Just put a name on it and walk away from it.  But there will be no town hall in these areas, no social services, no sense of identity there.  Of course there will be very serious crime in an area like that.  Therefore, let us try to get Dublin back to a more communitybased type of society.  Let us pick a place like Rathfarnham, let us turn that into a community with its own police point.  If it cannot afford a police station perhaps the post office could be used.  Let us bring some imagination to bear on it.</P>
    <P>For example, in my constituency there are 106,000 people, 30,000 of whom are youngsters in the sense that they are under 18.  There are two resident Garda stations in that constituency; I know there are some over-flows dealing with edges of it.  That is not the kind of community policing and connection with the public I want our gardaí to have.  I am suggesting, therefore, a community policing type of operation particularly in our suburbs, the idea that we establish a police point in large housing estates, be <Col N="184" /> it just a telephone, post office or whatever.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Garda Report for 1981 that there are 52 crimes committed per thousand of population.  It is significant to note that, while the overall detection rate is 37 per cent, there is an 87 per cent detection rate in offences against the person, meaning that in serious crime our Garda do a far better job than they are given credit for.  But bring it down to less serious crime, the day-to-day crime, the stealing of the video, of the television set, the kitchen furniture, whatever, there the detection rate is something of the order of slightly over 30 per cent.  Therefore we can see that our gardaí, when they get their teeth into the more serious crime, are able to handle it.  In that regard also I might talk of imagination.  When one looks at those statistics one sees that the major area of crime that goes undetected is that of the casual larceny and break-in and so on, the not so serious beatings as opposed to serious beatings.  In that regard, considering that one young person in four is now unemployed, why do we not bring some imagination to bear on that problem, perhaps by introducing some type of police warden instead of the fully-fledged official garda?  The House might recoil in shock and think of all the union problems, of second-class Garda &mdash; they are problems that will be thought of &mdash; but think of the opportunities as well as the problems.  We have a litter problem in this city with which the Garda had to deal at one stage.  Now what happens? We have got litter wardens to deal with it.  Nobody is causing any trouble about that.  We used to have the Garda dealing with all the traffic problems of this country; they were bogged down with traffic problems.  Then what happened? We had traffic wardens and nobody saw any great difficulty in doing that.  We had a particular drugs problem and we instituted the Drugs Squad.  Considering the figures I have put before the House today and the enormous amount of petty crime that is around, why not look at the idea of establishing petty crime wardens to take the burden off the Garda, to patrol the areas in which there is known to be a high incidence of petty crime?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> Do we need to have fully-fledged gardaí chasing people who have stolen videos from somewhere in Mount Merrion or who have kicked in someone's door or taken a tyre from a car, gardaí whose energy and resources are limited and needed in the pursuit of serious crime?  I suggest not.  Between them the 4,941 gardaí in the Dublin metropolitan area in 1982 clocked up 1.3 million hours in overtime and that was a reduction on the figure for the previous year.  In terms of the level of public expenditure I cannot object to the cutback since I am one of those who has called constantly for control of public expenditure, but I suggest that most of the Garda overtime to which I have referred was spent in the area of the detection of petty crime.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister and the Department to bring some imagination to bear on this problem and to consider the suggestion I am making.  At the time of the proposal to introduce traffic wardens objections were raised from various people alleging that such a move would undermine the Garda, would adversely affect Garda careers and so on, but we have traffic wardens and they are doing an excellent job.  I know this because I get tickets from them regularly.</P>
    <P>I see no reason for our not having petty crime wardens, too.  Perhaps the idea needs to be thrashed out a little more but I would ask the Government to consider the practicality of it.  It is not as farfetched an idea as it might seem.  There is no point in each of us coming here and talking about the increasing crime rate or telling about the old ladies who are beaten up and so on.  Somebody must suggest a way out of the difficulty.  We are all against crime, but someone must do something about it.  If the Minister is of the opinion that the suggestion I am putting forward would not be feasible, I should like him to tell us why he holds that opinion.  However, as a minimum I would ask him to give the suggestion serious consideration.  Perhaps I will ask him more formally about it later by way of parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>There is an item in the Bill which suggests that the prisoner, for want of a better word, has an option in regard to <Col N="186" /> undertaking community work.  I wonder if that will result in any good.  If there is to be a choice involved in this area of law in terms of offences, are we not opening up the whole area of law and of offences and of sentencing?  If a charged person is to be requested to undertake community work it may amount to offering him a choice as between the scenery in Mountjoy and in the Limerick area.  I am not sure that this is a good principle, but in the absence of the bevy of legal talent on the other side I shall have to wait for the Minister to reply on that point.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kelly mentioned, the Bill provides for a minimum of 40 hours work or a maximum of 240 hours work per annum.  On the basis of a 40-hour week, 240 hours represents six weeks work in a year and that is the maximum sentence. I wonder if by that provision we are allowing for a fair opportunity to determine whether the Bill will work.  Is this not too marginal, too mickey-mouse almost?  It is not really allowing the courts to breathe.  In his speech the Minister said he picked these figures out of the sky, as it were.  Deputy Kelly said they were taken from the British Act; but regardless of where they came from the Minister indicated that he had no hard and fast ideas about them.  I suggest that a total of six weeks work per annum is not going far enough.  If we are to try this approach let us do so properly and give the courts some flexibility instead of tying their hands too tightly.</P>
    <P>I wish to remind the House and the people, and more particularly the Judiciary of a Dáil debate that took place here some time ago concerning the sentencing policy of our courts.  I do not wish to dwell on this matter.  The Ceann Comhairle asked a previous speaker not to intervene too much in this area.  Suffice it for me to say that the spirit of the motion in question was that our sentencing policy should be more consistent.  I suggest that our Judiciary pay heed to that debate and pay heed to the wishes of the Dáil in regard to bringing more consistency into the sentencing policy. They should read between the lines instead of having the wishes of the House spelled out in too much detail for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" /> The success or failure of crime, particularly of serious crime, depends to a large extent on the operations of the Garda.  In that regard we must give the Garda the modern equipment, the back-up and the services they need.  I am aware that I am delving into a controversial area in saying that the Garda, particularly at the top level, need the maximum flexibility in dealing with serious crime.</P>
    <P>In regard to the kidnapping case that has come into the news recently I would find it difficult to criticise former Commissioner Garvey for the way he acted in that instance.  To an extent he was involved in a war with criminals and it is said that all is fair in love and war.  We must not have the hands of our top Garda officers tied totally in dealing with unscrupulous people.  They must have some flexibility.</P>
    <P>The principle in this Bill suggests that there is unpaid work for offenders, that there is work to be done and that the courts will determine if that work is to be done by offenders.  About three weeks ago the Taoiseach suggested that perhaps a scheme be made available involving unpaid work for our unemployed.  I notice that the Minister has got trade union agreement in respect of this Bill; but, if we could organise our affairs so as to make work available on an unpaid basis, why not do so?  We would not have to discontinue payments to people on the unemployed list who would participate in such work.  We could pay them the equivalent approximately of what they were getting by way of the dole.</P>
    <P>To summarise, I have called for more imagination in our system and I have put forward a number of ideas which I am asking the Minister to consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the position of Telectron Ltd. was discussed in this House on 26 April, two important developments have taken place.  Firstly, the company, subsequent to that discussion, decided to defer the closure of the Tallaght plant from 29 April to 6 May and, secondly, there have been a series of discussions with senior executives of both Telectron and its parent US company, AT &amp; T International.  All of the discussions, in part of which I have been directly involved, were aimed at averting the closure of the Tallaght plant and the maintenance of the company's other operations here.  Despite these discussions, during which various suggestions and proposals aimed at averting the closure of the Tallaght plant were put before AT &amp; T International, by the IDA and other Irish agencies, I regret to say that as of today AT &amp; T International have given no commitment beyond Friday, 6 May 1983 relating to the future of the Tallaght operation.  However, the managing director of the IDA has today departed for the US for the purpose of engaging in further discussions with members of the AT &amp; T board in the US. These discussions, which have of course as their objective the maintenance of Telectron's operations in Ireland, will take place over the next couple of days. They are likely to be long and difficult and will almost certainly determine the future of Telectron's future activities in Ireland.  For this reason I do not feel that it would be appropriate for me at this stage to speculate on the outcome of the discussions.</P>
      <P>Deputies will, I am sure, appreciate the delicacy of the current situation and since the future of the Tallaght plant is still very much in the balance, I hope that this debate will be such that nothing will be said that may be prejudicial to the negotiations which will take place in the US.  I know that will be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, when this matter was raised <Col N="189" /> in the House on 26 April a number of points were raised which I feel I could deal with now without prejudicing the discussions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney asked if, in view of the substantial amount of public money involved in contracts awarded by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to Telectron, the House could be given a commitment that this work will be carried out by Irish employees.  As promised on that occasion I have discussed this matter with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and his intention is that the equipment covered by the orders will be manufactured in Ireland to the extent originally envisaged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla, referring to the financial position of the company as reported in the media, asked for confirmation that the company was making losses of the order of £3 million per year. Because of the short notice I was not able to answer that question.  I have inquired into this matter and I can confirm that it lost a sum in excess of £3 million in the nine months ended 31 December 1982 and a total of £10 million in the three years ended 31 December 1982.  Prior to its recent announcement, the company did not expect the scale of these losses to decrease.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Walsh raised the question of whether the reason for the threatened closure of the Tallaght factory was to enable the company to switch production to the US.  I have no evidence which would support this suggestion.</P>
    <P>Finally, Deputy Molloy asked for clarification regarding the continued employment of the company's work force at its factories at Inis Mór, Aran Islands, and Bunbeg, County Donegal.  I understand that the position regarding the Inis Mór plant is not affected but, as Deputies will be already aware, the company have announced that 37 redundancies will take place at the Bunbeg plant.  That was known at the time of the Tallaght announcement.  As I stated here on 26 April, it was with a view to ensuring the viability of that plant at Bunbeg and to safeguarding the remainder of the employment there that the company announced its intention to make 37 of the <Col N="190" /> workers employed redundant.  This is still the company's position.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to prolong my contribution as I am sure other Members will be anxious to speak.  This is a matter that the Government have discussed in Cabinet and one which they regard as being very serious for industrial development here.  The Government are doing everything in their power, by means of meetings which I have had with a senior executive of AT &amp; T International and also by the contacts now being made by the managing director of the IDA at the highest level in the US, to safeguard the future of the Tallaght operation.  While I welcome this debate, which gives the House an opportunity of expressing a concern which they and I share about this matter, I am not in a position to give any more detail than I have given because of the very crucial point the discussions are now at.  I hope Members will be able to underline that concern and that the debate will indicate a wide measure of cross-party concern about this matter which will be of help to the executives involved in the discussions in the US designed to save this plant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure the Minister that it is not my intention to say anything that will prejudice the discussions that are taking place in an effort to save the factory in Tallaght.  The Minister assured us that the manufacture of the product would continue in Ireland, but unfortunately the Minister did not say where.  I should like to know if the product will continue to be manufactured in Tallaght.  Today the 500 workers of the factory turned out in a protest march. The position is very depressing for them and they are disillusioned about the whole situation.  Tallaght has been described as a new town with a projected population of 175,000 people.  When it was planned Telectron was one of the industries in the area which offered the <Col N="191" /> prospects of secure employment for some of the population.  Unfortunately, a number of the other firms have gone out of business due to the recession.  As a local representative I was disappointed to hear last week of the decision to close the Telectron plant.</P>
      <P>I am aware that discussions had been taking place about 190 redundancies in this plant and I am satisfied that the workers were prepared to co-operate on a proper and fair basis in this regard. They were totally disillusioned on their arrival at the factory last Monday week, on being told that the factory was to close on the next Friday.  Following the raising of this matter here and the intervention of union officials, the factory was to continue in production until next Friday. Unfortunately, the Minister is not in a position to give any assurance beyond that.</P>
      <P>The workers taking part in the march today were very depressed at the announcement here this evening that the position is not going to improve.  The families of 500 workers are affected.  The projected new town of Tallaght is to have a population of 175,000.  Many put their confidence in this new town by purchasing houses and hoping for stable employment. Telectron was one of the industrial concerns which offered stable employment. Nearby, there is the sad situation at the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  I sincerely hope that the Government will work more actively towards the settlement of this dispute than was the case with Clondalkin Paper Mills.  As one of the representatives of the area, should the proposal to close the factory on Friday next go ahead, I hope that the Minister and the Government will intervene, possibly by injecting capital, with a view to keeping production alive and the factory open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking today after the march, I said that my main concern was the continuation of production.  Once production ceases and the gates close, very little can be done.  I hope that the efforts of the managing director of the IDA, when in the United States discussing this very important matter with the management <Col N="192" /> of this concern, will ensure that production will continue at Tallaght.  It is all very fine making good speeches and announ cing that the manager of the IDA has travelled to the United States, but if this factory closes next Friday what will be the position of the workers?</P>
    <P>Tallaght had many old native industries over the years but many of these have now disappeared.  Successive Governments down the years have told us of great strides in industry and advised that the time had come to concentrate on the technological side.  This firm of Telectron showed great promise and offered a great future.  What has happened here and what went wrong?  Successive Governments have injected large amounts of capital into this development by way of grants and this company have secured a major Government contract. Things appeared to be going well, but suddenly something went wrong.  It is the duty of the Government to ensure a proper investigation, from the point of view of the workers.  This is not an industry which came into being overnight.  It has existed for some time.  Like the Clondalkin Paper Mills work force, these workers have developed tremendous skills which were not readily available at the time of the opening of the factory.  If this factory closes, these skills will be lost to the country and to the new town of Tallaght.  I hope that the Government will make every effort to save production at this plant.</P>
    <P>The lesson of Clondalkin Paper Mills should be learned.  That factory, or the site, has now been purchased.  However, the machines are still idle, the gates are closed.  Of what benefit is its purchase to the workers of the Clondalkin Paper Mills, the Government or the country?  I sincerely hope there will not be a repetition of this as far as Telectron are concerned. I ask the Minister to intervene on behalf of the Government before next Friday, to ensure that production in this plant will continue.</P>

      <P>The level of unemployment in Tallaght is one of the highest in the country from the percentage point of view.  It would be nothing short of a disaster if the new town of Tallaght were stricken by 500 job losses in one fell swoop at Telectron.  Such an eventuality would cause tremendously increased depression in this town.  It would have an effect far beyond the jobs actually lost, in that the loss of purchasing power of the workers and their families would work its way through the entire business system of this major, growing new town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of the utmost importance that those jobs be preserved.  The Minister has suggested that nothing should be said here which might prejudice negotiations which are taking place.  Of <Col N="194" /> course, he is quite right there, up to a point.  Nonetheless, we have responsibilities here, in particular those of us who represent the constituency of Dublin South-West, to raise a number of questions as to what went on in the matter of Telectron and its acquisition by the AT &amp; T multinational company of the United States.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out here that Telectron were losing substantial amounts of money in recent years, yet it is only within the last year or so that AT &amp; T, one of the major industrial complexes in the world, saw fit to buy and take over the Telectron company.  Is it suggested that they did not do their homework, their sums and investigate what exactly was going on in Telectron before they parted with an appreciable sum of money, running into some millions of pounds?  I doubt that.  I think that they knew, as a result of investigations and examinations, exactly what the position was in Telectron, exactly what the prospects were and what the cash flow would be.  I have no doubt that, if they wished, AT &amp; T could make a very viable company of Telectron and could import new research and development. That was denied to that company for many years past.  Let us hope that the efforts of the Minister and the IDA will change that.  The indications at present are that AT &amp; T will not do that but that, on the contrary, they callously intend to close down that operation and put 500 unfortunate people and their families on to the dole.</P>
    <P>Why are AT &amp; T doing that?  That question must be asked.  It is up to them to answer this.  Perhaps they bought this as an asset stripping operation with no intention of maintaining employment there from the word go but with the intention of stripping down their assets and realising them.  I hope that is not the case and that events will show that is not so. It is up to them to say if that is the case. Perhaps they came to the conclusion that they had spare manufacturing capacity in the USA, and in the expectation that they might perhaps be able to sell their product in Ireland without the necessity of having it manufactured here.  I feel those <Col N="195" /> questions must be asked and this company should answer them.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the Posts and Telegraphs contract work will be carried out here to the extent that was contracted for.  But the extent of manufacturing can vary greatly, from manufacturing all along the line to a very minor assembly operation that involves very little contribution to the work force.  I suspect that may be their plan, that the bulk of the manufacturing process will be carried out in the USA and that the remainder, the finishing touches, which is known in the trade as FAT, which stands for finish and test, might be planned for Ireland.  This means that perhaps out of £1,000 worth of goods a very minor portion, perhaps £50 or £100, would be attributable to the manufacturing process here.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the IDA must make approaches at every possible level, including to the United States authority at every level, to convey to them that if the Telectron factory is permitted to close by this US conglomorate which carries the US flag, its effect on the good relations which this country has with the USA, on which we pride ourselves, must be severely dinted, that we do not desire that and that we sincerely trust it will not happen.  This must not be allowed to happen because, apart from any other consideration, very appreciable sums of money, which have been paid for by the taxpayers, have already gone into Telectron. The Irish people are entitled to expect that they will in the fullness of time reap the reward from that investment. We were told before, when some other industries fell down, that we cannot complain about that, that we must look forward and get into the new technologies. What newer or more beneficial technology can there be than electronics?  The electronics industry has become a part of the life blood of this country and it is exemplified at Telectron at Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to ensure by every means, with the cooperation of AT &amp; T or without it, even to the extent of taking over and nationalising that factory and running it as a State operation, that the vital and essential manufacturing capacity <Col N="196" /> of the country is maintained and expanded.  This industry has an essential key role to play in the future of the country and, given the opportunity and research and development, which has hitherto been denied it, I believe that henceforth it will prove itself not only to the satisfaction of its workers and of Tallaght but to the benefit of the entire country.</P>

      <P>Like the other speakers, particularly the two Deputies from my constituency, I want to add to the record, as I did last week, my dismay at the decision of this company to pull out of Telectron at Tallaght.  I have to say, as Deputy Walsh and Deputy Taylor said, it will have very serious consequences for the people of Tallaght, particularly for the 500 workers of Telectron, their families and the whole Tallaght area.  It is particularly distressing because so many of the workers in this particular factory belong to the same family.  I know of one case where a husband, a wife and four of their children work in this company. When you have that situation in relation to one family multiplied over and over again in the case of Telectron it is a very sad situation for the Tallaght area, particularly for those workers and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly distressing &mdash; I recently spoke with the IDA &mdash; because the IDA do not seem to have any plans to bring any major industry into this area. The new town of Tallaght, with a population <Col N="197" /> of over 60,000, is the third centre of population in the country and it will have a very disastrous future if some major industries are not brought into the area and if industries like Telectron are not kept going.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this factory is kept going.</P>
    <P>This afternoon my colleagues and I were out in Tallaght and we met the workers who marched through the streets of Tallaght protesting at this closure.  It was very sad to have to watch those workers, many of whom are very young, who have got highly specialised technical skills.  It appears that if Telectron are allowed to go they will not be able to put those skills to any purpose unless an alternative employer is found.  It is very sad that here in Dáil Éireann, the national Parliament, we are powerless to do anything. We can make fine speeches and on all sides of the House there is wide agreement; but nobody, not even the Minister, seems to be in a position to offer any hope to those workers.  This must bring home to everybody that when we are dealing with multi-national companies we are powerless.  We will have to look at our legislation to see if we can operate some kind of control over companies of this size, which come in here, get very generous Government grants, and at the end of the day the decision to pull out the plug or to stay in operation is made, not in Dublin, not in the Dáil, not even in Ireland, but in America.  That is very strange, particularly as so much Irish money has been ploughed into this plant.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the point made by Deputy Taylor that this company currently have a contract from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for £16½ million.  I know the Minister referred to this but I want him to be very specific and indicate that all of this £16½ million will be spent in Ireland and that the work will be carried out by Irish employees in Ireland.  I understand from talking to employees in the company that officials in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs told the company that this work could, in certain circumstances, be carried out in the United States.  I understand all this work can be done here by Irish employees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The closure may well highlight the fact that the contract was given but particular details were not received.  An assurance should have been given that all this work would be carried out in Tallaght.  The workers say they are capable of fulfilling the whole contract.</P>
      <P>The plant and equipment in the firm in Tallaght are obsolete and the company have not put any money into technology. This is a highly specialised business and it is important that the technology and equipment should be as modern as possible. This company have not kept pace with their competitors.  This may well be part of the problem they have at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This company should not receive any more State money unless specific guarantees <Col N="199" /> are given that the 500 jobs will be secure in Tallaght and that any contracts which involve public money will be carried out at the plant in Tallaght.  I wish the IDA well in America but I hope they do not come back with just a few jobs and a lot of window dressing.  We do not want to be faced with a similar situation next year.  Whatever solution is arrived at must be final.  We want the company to compete in the electronics field.  Given proper management they should be able to do so.  Other companies in the same business are doing very well.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that this debate has taken place.  It is very sad that neither Government, opposition nor all party agreement can do much at this stage.  It brings home to us the importance of looking at our legislation in relation to companies of this nature where so much State expenditure is involved.  We must ensure that jobs are secure and that decisions such as this one will not occur again.</P>
    <P>The manner in which this company treated their employees in the past few weeks is appalling.  They negotiated redundancy payments, offered a grandiose plan for the future and then pulled the plug on Monday morning.  I hope no other company will behave in such a disgraceful fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me an opportunity to add my few words to those of my colleagues.  Deputy Walsh mentioned that we were at a protest meeting on this issue in Tallaght this afternoon.  A great deal of concern was expressed at that meeting at the calamitous effects the closure of the company will have on Tallaght.</P>
      <P>This is one of the oldest plants in Tallaght.  Tallaght has suffered a great deal of official neglect over the years.  It is Ireland's forgotten city.  If this plant closed down it will have serious social effects on Tallaght.  I appreciate the delicacy of the situation and I agree with the Minister that it would be best to be as constructive as possible in this discussion because of negotiations which are taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware of the hardships that <Col N="200" /> face families where the breadwinner loses his job particularly since jobs are so scarce.  Unemployment in Tallaght is very severe.  Anyone holding clinics in the area knows that there is a long queue of people looking for jobs.</P>
    <P>Telectron management have handled this matter less than satisfactorily.  A decision by the parent company to close the Tallaght factory with a loss of over 500 jobs at a time when negotiations were taking place for 200 redundancies has not been satisfactorily explained by the company. What can be done now to preserve the jobs?  It is of little comfort or value to the workers to know that we are debating the issue in the Dáil.  The question is what can we do to advance the position, save jobs and get the operation going in Tallaght.  Various Ministers in different Governments who handled different aspects of the contract were concerned with securing what was in the best interests of the country, the workers and the firm.  All Governments acted in good faith in this matter.  The only query I have in relation to this <i>impasse</i>&mdash; no explanation has been given by AT &amp; T &mdash; is why was this decision taken so suddenly when difficult negotiations were taking place?  The Minister said that discussions were taking place with Telectron and its parent company to determine what measures were necessary to ensure that this decision was not implemented.  If our discussion manages to help those negotiations then it will be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>In their statement the firm say they are losing substantial sums of money.  The Minister said they lost a total of £10 million in the three years ended last December. That is a substantial sum by any standards.  However, that situation did not occur overnight.  I assume that when taking over the firm AT &amp; T were conscious of the position and that it could not be turned around overnight.  They must have understood the financial difficulties after analysing the books.</P>
    <P>I cannot comment on the state of the firm's order book.  If they have not got any orders which they can meet in the short-term they are clearly in trouble. However, the Minister gave details last week which indicated that the firm had <Col N="201" /> substantial orders from the Department for equipment.  It was hoped the firm would be able to keep the work force going on these orders.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the fact that the products on which Telectron rely are obsolete and that they have been unable to market them abroad.  As a result there is a gap in their production.  If that is so it must be corrected.  However, they are developing new products.  They have an order worth £48 million for digital radio links.  If the gap in production can be bridged there should not be any problem in keeping the factory open.  I urge the Minister to direct his attention to this in the talks.  As the Department are the company's main, if not sole, outlet on the home market I urge that Department to do everything possible to make orders available to the firm so that production can continue.  In urging this, I am conscious that there are obvious limits to the volume of equipment that the Department can use and that it should not be expected to buy in excess of its needs.  I know too that there are other Irish manufacturers and that they must also be treated fairly.  However, within these constraints, I urge that the Department should help in the current situation to the maximum extent practicable.  I recognise that the telecommunications equipment requirements of this country are small and that, in themselves, can be no more than a base on which to build export markets.</P>
    <P>It is clearly essential that, if there is to be a thriving telecommunications factory in Tallaght &mdash; and I believe that with hard negotiations and goodwill on all sides that is possible &mdash; it must be geared largely to export because the home market would be insufficient to keep it going.  I assume in the discussions taking place that will be very much to the forefront.  This obviously requires action in a number of ways: good, modern and efficient equipment at competitive prices, well marketed and supported by adequate after sales service.  It appears that the position in the factory, even before AT &amp; T take-over, was less than satisfactory.  It suggests that changes should have been made sooner but they were not and there <Col N="202" /> is no point in bemoaning what should have happened in the past.  We are dealing with an ugly situation in the present. How do we avert a closure?  How do we make a practical arrangement for the future?  This debate can help in focusing on these issues, which will give hope to the workers to maintain their jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has allowed this debate and that he acknowledges the seriousness of the problem.  The Deputies in the area and I have not much hope but it is interesting that the Minister hopes that progress will be made because he appealed to Deputies not to say anything which might inhibit the progress which he felt might be made.  To some extent this worries me because there a number of things I wished to day about the running of this company but perhaps it would be better to leave them unsaid in case it might upset the negotiations which the Minister is making. The whole issue, including the many questions which were raised by Deputy Taylor, Deputy Walsh and Deputy Harney, asked questions which need answers and an inquiry is in order because, even if the factory is not saved, the procedures for the future need to be questioned. Why was a contract given to a factory which apparently was run down?  Their equipment was about 20 years out of date and does not compare with Ericsson, Athlone, which is 20 years ahead of it. Their quality control procedures were hopeless, their test equipment was very bad and, in this industry, if you do not have high quality control and top-class testing, you are out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Reynolds, may be able to tell the House if, before this contract was given, there was any on the spot investigation of the factory and equipment, of their capability of completing this contract and of their books and records.  As, at the time, they were apparently losing about £10 million, were they in a position to complete this contract?  Was any check made at the time of the running of the factory?  These questions need to be asked because Telectron had one outstanding feature, their design, research <Col N="203" /> and development team.  The design team were broken up gradually and some were taken over to the parent company in the United States.  It is probably a tribute to the expertise of the staff that there are at least three companies established by former members of Telectron &mdash; Lake Electronics, DATAC and Cornell Electronics.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of commitment to Tallaght and Clondalkin.  How far do we intend to fulfil the commitment to make it a town in which people can live and not a desert area?  Little has been done to develop industry for the hundred thousand population.  The way in which we solve the problem of Telectron will be an indication of our commitment to Tallaght.  People there were very proud of this industry because it was in the new field of high technology and if we do not stay in that business we will have missed the second industrial revolution.  There are 15,000 people employed in the electronics industry but they are in the low technology and low wage areas.  The design and development team in Telectron were in a position, if they had had the equipment, to bring us into the top bracket.  If we had even 1 per cent of the market in Europe it would bring us £1 billion in exports and that market is growing at a very rapid pace.  We must, therefore, see what we are going to do about this.  If a company are not prepared to stay in business, are we going to do anything about it?  We should use the expertise which was in Telectron instead of putting our faith in multinationals or in individual whizz kids.  We have the expertise and the State must have an involvement in ensuring that we are in the high technology area of the electronics industry. Perhaps the ESB should be approached if AT &amp; T are unable or unwilling to continue in production here because it is very important that we do not miss this opportunity.  I wish the Minister every success in his negotiations and I hope he will succeed.  If he does not, he should consider the whole area of new technology in which, as the people in Tallaght indicated, we have the expertise. All we need now is backing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the various points made by the Deputies representing the constituency in which this plant is situated, and the tragedy it seems to be at this stage in that area for the families of the 500 workers there.</P>
      <P>None of us could gain much consolation from what the Minister said in relation to the future of the plant.  He appealed to every Deputy in this House to take into consideration the delicate talks that have been going on for the last three or four days here in Ireland and are now switched to the west coast of America for the final decision on the future of the Telectron plant.  As a former holder of that office I do not entirely share that view.  Internationally businesses such as we are dealing with here, corporations of the size of AT &amp; T, will respect you just as much if you take your courage in your hands and tell them straight &mdash; they are straight talkers themselves as I know from having met them many times &mdash; what exactly the Irish Government feel about the situation here and clearly demonstrate your concern in relation to the situation as it has developed.  Ask some of the questions that have been asked here by Deputy O'Leary and others, straight across the table.  That is the way Americans do business at that level and I see nothing wrong with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Monday week was the first time that anybody here had any knowledge of this decision taken on the previous Friday in relation to the proposed closure of this plant.  I would have expected somebody on behalf of the Government, certainly the Minister for Industry and Energy &mdash; or if you want to be more diplomatic about it maybe the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; to be on the telephone immediately to the headquarters in Connecticut to ask the president of the organisation what the game was all about, to ask the questions that have been asked in this House.  If that had been done we might at this stage be in possession of some of the answers and knowledge we are now seeking.  I believe that that is what they would expect.  Any Minister for Industry and Energy should do what I did myself <Col N="205" /> many times in the short period I held that office and nobody took any exception to it, take up a telephone, ring the man over there and ask him what it is about and, if necessary, get on the next flight and go to him.  After all, we are dealing with the backbone of the electronics industry, with the future of 500 people, and with a company who enjoy at present a contract from the Irish Government for £16 million. In the ordinary run of business Americans would expect that if you were on the receiving end of a contract you would be very seriously concerned as to where it was to be supplied and the future plans for the company.</P>
    <P>That could be the approach and it would not be condemned by the Americans. I know that the IDA do an excellent job for us in negotiation, but in this serious situation that has developed here we need a little more than the chief executive of the IDA going out to Palm Beach tomorrow or whatever day this final meeting is to take place.  If the Government were really serious, showing their clear concern by demonstrating it, not alone would the first contact have been made but on that plane going but last night would have been a Minister for the Irish Government.  He should be at the table tomorrow when the future of 500 people, the investment here and the recipients of a Government contract and more contracts to come will be discussed. We all know of the very big involvement of Telectron in the Irish communications situation.</P>
    <P>I have heard nothing whatsoever of the original contract for digital switching which was originally awarded to Telectron. The Minister for Industry and Energy would not be in a position to give us any details of it.  I would have expected the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to be in here to take part in this discussion and to fill in some of the pieces of which I am aware and others of which I am not aware.  Questions could be answered and I would not be unfair to the Minister here in asking him, but a concern should be demonstrated clearly by the Government before that meeting takes place.  American presidents are well accustomed to <Col N="206" /> being phoned at all hours of the day and night at that level of business.</P>
    <P>In 1980 AT &amp; T first decided to look at Ireland.  They had become saturated in America, de-control, as they knew, was on the way, and they were beginning to look abroad to sell their services and products.  I met them in 1980.  The theory and logic behind their move in here were to look for a European base from which to serve the European and Middle Eastern markets and I asked them to have a look at Ireland.  Subsequently they came to Ireland.  They took 45 per cent interest in Telectron and in recent times, in the last two months, they took 100 per cent. Deputy O'Leary raised the point which I and any businessman would raise, that if you have 45 per cent of a company and control of the day-to-day management of that company, surely you know everything that is going on in that company on a day-to-day basis.  Why would any business concern, let alone AT &amp; T, take 100 per cent and in such a short time decide, peremptorily or otherwise, to close it down?  That question is unanswered and it should be asked of the people concerned. I do not know whether the people who were handling the situation here properly understood Irish industrial relations, but we would expect a little more from them than the attitude and approach they have shown in this situation. It is no harm to tell them so.  I had occasion during my short period in that office to tell international companies in here to be very wary and fully awake and educated to the situation in Ireland which can be totally different from what pertains at American corporation level.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong but I believe that the case was in the Labour Court for conciliation on the day this decision was taken in the US.  Maybe the case in the Labour Court was not heading in a good direction and perhaps that news was relayed back to a board who were sitting when they got that news.  Maybe they got a coloured version of it.  We do not know.  The only way to find out the real position is to take up a telephone, and find out; if not satisfied be on the plane with Mr. Padraig White, and with that concern demonstrated in action which they expect from <Col N="207" /> their own employees they would be very happy to welcome an Irish Minister.  I know the prestige in which an Irish Minister is held abroad when he goes on such a mission.  I do not know when the meeting will be, tomorrow or the next day, but the Minister would be well advised to be on a plane to put the case of the Irish Government, the case of future contracts and the whole business, in perspective and see that this operation carries on.</P>
    <P>There may well be short-term problems in the company.  Time was passing them by first.  Research and development have not taken place.  In my time as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in 1980 I was familiar with the questions that Deputy Mac Giolla raised.  Certainly they needed new products and new technology. When a decision was made here to change the basic infrastructure of Irish telecommunications from the old technology that was there into new technology and Telectron supplied so much into that network, obviously they were going to be in trouble.  This was the logic behind bringing CIT Alcatel and themselves on a joint venture in here so that there would be a transfer of technology from the French into Telectron and finally a build up of the company into the new era of technology that Deputy Mac Giolla so rightly described.  CIT Alcatel have put proven products, proven digital technology, into the French system.  There is a big future in it.  We cannot afford to let the opportunity go.  We have the expertise and the brain-power.  This also was expressed to me by AT &amp; T in May 1982 when, on a promotional visit, I visited their plant in Boston on route 124, and some of the Telectron employees were engaged there then on new research work and the Americans had the height of praise for them.  The whole basis of the operation looked right.  The biggest and strongest international company in the business, AT &amp; T, were coming in here. We had an Irish work force with expertise already trained.  All we had to do was retrain them to new technology and transfer new products from the biggest research laboratories in the world &mdash; 10,000 people are involved in Bell Laboratories. <Col N="208" /> It is a simple operation to transfer products from there over to here for manufacture.  Everything seemed to be in order and still does.  That is why the Minister should be on a flight and get a resolution to this problem.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute: &ldquo;supports the efforts of the Government to increase the production of raw material for the food processing industry and to promote the development of the industry along the most efficient lines.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the Government's approach to the processing industry &mdash; for instance East Cork Foods and Mattersons in my city &mdash; one sees that this amendment is contrary to the action they have taken over the last three or four months.  Actions speak louder than words.  I hope the Minister in his reply will give us some hope and show us a way forward for our food processing industry. Their approach should be positive because this industry needs assistance, guidance and, above all, monetary incentives to help them progress in the future. Our food processing industry has taken considerable time and money to develop to the present sage.  It is vital that we have a healthy processing sector in the interests of the farmers who produce the raw materials, the work force who man the factories and our balance of payments. Those involved in those three <Col N="209" /> areas will lose if we revert completely to commodity trading.  Surely no one wishes to return to the stage when all our cattle were exported on the hoof.</P>
    <P>In a recent publication the IDA showed that the food processing industry employ over 47,000 people throughout the country, not just in one or two areas. Up to recently this was a very secure industry providing stable employment but I wonder if this situation will remain for very much longer.  There have been a number of closures recently and rumours of further closures and short-term employment, as if there are not too many people unemployed already.  From the point of view of the national economy as a whole, the food processing industry accounts for something in the region of 25 per cent of the total value added in Irish manufacturing.  In addition, nearly three-quarters of that added value is exported and nearly 95 per cent of the input to our food industry comes from home sources as compared with only 16 per cent for all other firms.  The home market is vital to our processing industry and it is most disturbing that we have such import penetration.  In the interests of employment, the farmer producer and the damage that could be done to the national economy, action &mdash; and I repeat the word &ldquo;action&rdquo;&mdash; is urgently needed to prevent any further erosion in this important industry.</P>
    <P>I support this motion and call on the Minister to ensure that the necessary action is taken to see that this industry progresses and that the decisions the Government have taken in recent times with regard to the closure of certain processing industries will be reversed.  I will deal with that point later.</P>
    <P>Producer marketing boards should be established to regulate the sale of potatoes, fruit, vegetables and most of the imported vegetables.  The boards should be charged with responsibility for marketing, pricing, product development and presentation, which is so essential.  I will deal with presentation later.  They should also be responsible for bringing Irish products and produce to international markets, bringing them to the <Col N="210" /> standard of international presentation &mdash; there is no reason why we cannot do this &mdash; and ensuring that our produce is up to international hygiene standards. The boards would also explore all areas of import substitution and seek new markets for Irish vegetables and soft fruits.</P>
    <P>As well as promoting Irish produce for the home market, the type of board I have suggested must convince the Irish consumer to purchase domestically grown vegetables and fruit.  This sector in agriculture has been untapped and it has tremendous potential.  Irish farmers have proved that they can deliver if they have the incentive, but action by the Government has been starving the industry.  For example, the farm modernisation scheme has been scrapped and Fianna Fáil's four year plan for the development of agriculture is being sadly missed by the farmers. Our farmers lack confidence because they lack Government incentives.</P>
    <P>If I were to issue a message tonight, if the preaching of a message was called for, it would be one of hope, particularly to our young people in agriculture.  I would say to them that the jobs and opportunities are there but they require the commitment and the incentives called for in this motion.</P>
    <P>For small local industries to process, package and market our horticultural produce there are many old halls and disused primary schools in villages and towns throughout the country which could be used to house local enterprises based in the local environment and with all the raw materials available from the land.  I am talking about processing and presentation for the home market of potatoes and other vegetables, as well as fruit.  Such small local enterprises would employ four or five people.  This is the type of activity I have suggested for the type of board I have been talking about. I am not proposing major undertakings or a massive national board.  I am suggesting the setting up of local co-ordinating bodies purely at local level to foster small type industries based on agricultural products.</P>
    <P>Another advantage of such small enterprises would be that they would turn the tide against wasteful imports of horticultural <Col N="211" /> products.  At the moment we are importing vegetables and other horticultural products to the amount of £100 million per year.  This money could be kept in circulation in Ireland instead of going to the Danes, the Dutch, the British and the Cypriots.</P>
    <P>There must be something dreadfully wrong with out marketing of horticultral products when we import millions of pounds worth of potatoes annually. There is something entirely wrong with our system when we cannot package as well as other countries.  It means we are losing out in a big way.  The challenge is there to grow more vegetables, to process them and to market them, not just as well as the continentals but better.  There would then be no need for imports.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister set up a committee or commission to examine the vast imports of horticultural produce.  I suggest there is no need for this committee. We know the amount we import, we know the problems, and what we want is immediate action and that is needed not alone if we are to continue to keep people on the land.  We need urgent action, not committees and commissions and waste of time.  We know the problems and the remedy.  What is needed is incentive action from the Government and we hope the Minister for Agriculture tonight will give us some ray of hope, some light for the future.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about employment in agriculture.  My proposal is the creation of small type industries throughout rural Ireland.  This, inherently, would solve the second-son problem for many farm families as well as providing lasting jobs throughout the country.  It would also give off-farm employment not only for the second son but for farmers with small acreages.  The incentive should be there. Only political will can restore confidence in agriculture and provide much needed employment.</P>
    <P>It is my party's policy to provide these necessary incentives.  It was outlined in <i>The Way Forward</i> which proposed to assist agricultural marketing of finished products.  We must do this.  We must grow the vegetables, package them and present <Col N="212" /> them to Irish housewives.  The market is there in our towns and villages.  The setting up of such enterprises would ensure that there would not be vast imports of vegetables.  We would be doing something constructive by way of providing employment and improving our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I want to speak briefly about my own city.  Other speakers from my party will speak about other localised food industries which are in severe trouble.  To date the Government do not seem to be very concerned about providing alternative employment or ensuring the continuation of existing jobs.  In Mattersons in Limerick 85 to 90 people have lost their jobs.  The essential point is that it has been proved beyond a shadow of doubt to the Minister that losses in the canning section of Mattersons were reduced substantially since last year.  It was the contention of the management of Mattersons that, within another 12 months, the canning factory would pay its way.  They planned for a rationalisation deal which would mean the loss of very few jobs but would provide more flexibility in the work force.</P>
    <P>These proposals were put to the Minister but he gave no hearing to the various deputations who met him.  The canning section has now closed with a loss of 85 to 90 jobs.  The Minister was contacted by the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union group secretary at the end of February but he did not respond until around 15 March.  When the deputation met the Minister, he opened the discussion by saying the Cabinet had already made a decision which could not be reversed.  This is a despicable approach by any Minister or any Government. At least one would expect the Minister to listen to the views of the interested parties before a decision was made.</P>
    <P>The second deputation was led by the Mayor of Limerick, Councillor Tony Brommell, and consisted of a number of interested parties and unions.  The message from the Minister to the deputation was that the company had to close irrespective of the social consequences to the city.  Figures going back over a number of years were used by the Minister to <Col N="213" /> support and substantiate his claim that the industry was not viable.  That was a wrong decision and it should be reviewed.  There is hope for the industry.</P>
    <P>If the money allocated to redundancy payments and social welfare benefits now being given to the redundant workers had been invested in the company, it would have gone a long way towards ensuring the viability of the firm.  Batchelors are now expanding in a big way while the Government, with their despondent approach, have closed down the factory in Limerick.  The two deputations proved to the Minister that inputs had been falling in price.  It was pointed out to the Minister that Mattersons had a good name and quite an amount of goodwill in the mid-west region, and were the second oldest company in the region.</P>
    <P>There are major problems in the sugar industry, the Sugar Company and Erin Foods.  Are many of those problems of their own making?  Is there too much control at central level?  Should the control be decentralised and more of it based at local level?  Are the companies top heavy?  Should some of their structures be dismantled?  These are the questions I am throwing out, and which should be answered in the near future.</P>
    <P>If we had small-type industries with very little overheads and based on our own raw materials, provided they stayed small and the employment content was in the region of five, six or ten persons, they would be of immense benefit to the economy.  The cost factor of setting them up would be very low as compared with the price per job in some of the imported industries.  The approach by the Government does not say much for their attitude to the food processing industry.  They are about to close some existing plants.</P>
    <P>Considerable concern has been expressed recently about the importation of fruit and vegetables.  Traditionally this produce has been supplied locally.  We must look at some of our imports from the point of view of producing and supplying these items ourselves.  Provided the incentive is given, this can be done. An article in the farm and research publication of the Agricultural Institute of October 1982 states that about £19 million <Col N="214" /> of the £94 million spent on fruit and vegetable imports in 1981 could have been saved by substituting home-grown for imported produce and that total fruit and vegetable imports, including exotic and processed produce, amounted to £94 million in 1981.  I am sure that the figures would be increased for 1982.</P>
    <P>The article states that the figure of £123.6 million imports quoted by many commentators includes £29 million for exotic fruit and vegetable preparations &mdash; for example, fruit juices.  It says that more than half &mdash; £50 million &mdash; of our total fruit and vegetable imports is produce which cannot be grown in this country, due to our climate.  The remaining £44 million is made up of £14 million for frozen and fresh potatoes, £13 million for apples, £13 million for fresh vegetables excluding potatoes and £4 million for small quantities of other produce.  It concludes by saying that all categories of imports have increased in the first six months of 1982.</P>
    <P>That is proof enough that our imports of vegetables, soft fruits and potatoes are on the increase.  The time has come for us to examine our approach to these matters. We must also take a look at the vast amount spent on the importation of frozen potatoes in the form of frozen chips by the big supermarkets.  I understand that some of our potato varieties are not suitable for the frozen chip industry. Surely there must be a vigorous campaign to have the right varieties grown.  With incentive, this can be done.  The industry should be promoted through the existing chip producers, or by the setting up of a new structure.</P>
    <P>We must examine the whole aspect of the food processing industry.  We must substitute home produce for imported vegetables and so on, by giving incentives to provide these substitutes locally.  As a people and a nation, we should be more loyal in buying our own country's produce. Other countries take a pride in their produce.  The French are proud of their lamb and their wine.  The Danes are proud of their home-brewed beer, their bacon and vegetables.  Many of us are inclined to put more value on imported produce.  Perhaps something could be <Col N="215" /> done in our educational system to combat this.  Our people must be educated to take more pride in their own industries. This can be brought about by better presentation and more aggresive marketing, not alone on the foreign markets but at home.</P>
    <P>Most important, we must ensure that our products are presented in a manner which is attractive to the housewife.  We must take heed of the changing trends in presentation.  If we present our produce attractively we can encourage the housewives to buy their own native produce. The Government should provide the incentives and ensure that the existing industries are encouraged to expand rather than, as at present, to close down.</P>
    <P>By doing this we would be saving something in the region of £50 million on imported produce.  Now is the time for action, tomorrow may be too late. Example must be given by the Government and, particularly, by the Minister for Agriculture.  I look forward to hearing what he has to say on this motion.  I hope that his approach will not be as negative as the Government's amendment to this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute</P>
      <P>&ldquo;supports the efforts of the Government to increase the production of raw material for the food processing industry and to promote the development of the industry along the most efficient lines&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main aim of the Government in relation to agriculture is to create conditions that will generate increased output at individual farm level.  They seek to achieve this, first of all, by tackling the basic problem of inflation which has been exercising such a severe price-cost squeeze on the agricultural sector and, secondly, by securing the best possible deal for Irish farmers from the EEC price negotiations in Brussels and Luxembourg. <Col N="216" /> The Government have already set about easing the inflation level in a determined way and some improvement in this regard is already discernible.  It is regrettable that, in spite of all my endeavours the price negotiations in Brussels and Luxembourg have not yet been finalised, but I am confident that the eventual package will be a worthwhile one and will show a considerable improvement over the level of the increase that had been anticipated earlier this year.  I might point out that one of my main priorities in those talks in Brussels and Luxembourg was for an early settlement of those price talks.  But, unfortunately &mdash; due to some differences of opinion between other member states &mdash; such a speedy conclusion has not been possible.  However, I am hopeful that there will be a settlement in the weeks beginning May 16, which is the date scheduled for the next meeting of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Government's second aim for the agricultural sector is to encourage increased efficiency at all levels, not least on the farm itself.  An abundant supply of raw material efficiently produced is essential to the welfare of any processing industry.  This is certainly the case with our own food processing sector, which constitutes a major part of the Irish manufacturing industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>Total employment in agricultural processing in 1981 was 40,000, or nearly one quarter of all jobs in our manufacturing industry.  The numbers have remained largely unchanged over the past decade, the extra jobs created in producing more sophisticated value-added products being offset by the effects of rationalisation geared towards more efficient production and greater productivity in many of the longer established sectors.  In 1980 agricultural processing contributed some £670 million in value-added, or the equivalent of 7 per cent of our gross national product.  As was stated by Deputy Noonan, it accounted also for 25 per cent of the total value added in Irish manufacturing industry as a whole.  It is important also to bear in mind that in the food sector home-based inputs account for 94 per cent of the output whereas for the remainder of manufacturing industry <Col N="217" /> they account for only 16 per cent of the output.  Export performance by the food sector has been a significant part of the improvement in our export performance as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Government are conscious of the great potential which the food industry holds for further development both in terms of processing a larger volume of raw material and of using that material to produce more sophisticated products. The IDA have estimated that the successful development of this sector will require new capital investment of £800 million &mdash; at 1981 price levels &mdash; up to the end of this decade.  In addition to helping our balance of payments, greater output should generate more jobs here.</P>
    <P>I am keenly aware of the problems which confront us in the food sector. More particularly, I have drawn attention to the importation of food products which we could grow ourselves.  The trend of these imports has been rising and total imports of food and feeding stuffs now cost us about £750 million a year.  As a member state of the European Communities and as a major exporter of agricultural products we cannot support a policy of deliberate barriers to trade in food, nor indeed can we be seen to support such a policy.  It would be to our disadvantage were such an approach to be adopted generally as its repercussions would have very serious implications for this country seeing that we are by far a larger exporter than importer.  It is estimated that about 45 per cent of the present imports of food are in processed form and that about £200 million of the total would represent products capable of being produced at home.  Looming large amounts these imports are apples, tomatoes and potatoes, in the fruit and vegetable line, together with poultry and eggs. I might point out that the latest figures available to us are in respect of the year 1982.  They show a very disturbing trend. I might point out also that I was not Minister for very long in 1982 &mdash; 17 days in all, about 12 if one omits public holidays, so I can hardly be blamed for being the cause of that magnitude of imports. It is a long-standing problem; these imports have been increasing steadily <Col N="218" /> over the years.  It would be my aim to extend further the trend towards greater food exports.  That is why I set up a committee to monitor these food imports, to distinguish exactly what is being imported, the quantity and type of produce being imported and to ascertain if we can offset those imports by producing good quality produce at home and marketing them to maximum advantage. These imports figures are approximate only.  More detailed information is required before we can effectively set about restoring a proper balance in the import situation.  To this end I have recently set up a committee to monitor food imports in greater detail than has been the case previously, to identify more precisely what is being imported, or what could be produced here and, most important and perhaps most difficult, to assess why this is happening.  As well as my Department, the Departments of Industry and Energy and Trade, Commerce and Tourism are represented on the committee and the whole range of food imports will be examined.</P>
    <P>Of course we shall always have some imports of food, even of types which we can grow here.  There will always be the need to provide for seasonal factors. There is also the need to meet an expanding range in food tastes brought about by increasing international travel.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise, however, that the setting up of the committee is not a solution to the problem and I would not like anybody to get the impression that I believe it is the solution to the problem. It is intended rather as an aid towards achieving that goal.  The real solution lies in the expansion of our own agricultural production and in updating and improving our production and marketing techniques to a level at least as good as, if not better than, those of our competitors abroad, so that finished products of top-class quality can be presented to Irish consumers as attractively and as cheaply as imported products.</P>
    <P>The problems we are encountering with imports serve also to highlight some of the basic difficulties which confront our food processing sector and to which we must address ourselves if the industry <Col N="219" /> is to realise its full potential.  In some sectors of the industry there is an uncoordinated or fragmented approach between the three stages of production, processing and marketing.  In particular a greater integration as between the production and processing sectors is required.  We must also tackle the problems of suitability, volume and seasonality of raw material supplies.  On the processing side itself it is clear that investment in research and development is far from adequate.  In so far as marketing is concerned there is too much emphasis on a commodity rather than a consumerorientated approach.  I might mention in this connection also that undue emphasis is being placed on sales into intervention rather than commercial sales on export markets.  In this connection I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Noonan that we must generally co-ordinate our efforts in this regard, not just in production but in marketing and in selling. We are amateurish in comparison with some of our European partners. Because of their very professional and skilled approach to selling they can often succeed in selling inferior goods at a higher price than their Irish counterparts. That is something we should be able to overcome.  I hope, as a result of the efforts of the monitoring committee to which I have referred, we will be able to pinpoint such deficiencies in our system.</P>
    <P>Turning to some individual sectors of the food processing industry, I should like to say something about State enterprise. Most Deputies will be aware of the central role which the Sugar Company has played in Irish agriculture over the past 50 years.  In its early years it stood out as an example of the kind of enterprise that could be built on our natural resources and that could succeed brilliantly. The Sugar Company became an example of what could be achieved and was an inspiration to our national agricultural effort.</P>
    <P>The First Programme for Economic Development pointed the Sugar Company in the direction of food processing and led to the foundation of Erin Foods. I do not wish to deliberate on whether <Col N="220" /> that was a wise decision, beyond saying that with hindsight it is always easy to be wise.</P>
    <P>However, the record, regrettably, speaks for itself.  The food division of CSET has consistently incurred losses since it was set up in 1963.  A report of the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies which was finalised in December 1980, gives an excellent summary of the fortunes of the food division.  The committee, of which I was then a member, drew attention to the cumulative trading losses of the ten years to 1980, quoting them at £5 million.  It made it clear, however, that real losses were much higher than that as sugar had been bearing the very considerable overheads of the food division.  What had happened in effect was that by the late seventies the dehydrated vegetables branch of the processing industry in which the company had invested heavily, was being operated at international level on the basis of extremely low profit margins.  An industry with high-cost inputs in raw materials and low margins on final sales could not fail to be in trouble.  The joint committee commented also on other unfavourable aspects of the food processing operations of the Sugar Company.  There was, for instance, a number of small scattered plants, which involved high overheads per unit of output and considerable under-utilisation of capacity.</P>
    <P>With the publication of the company's accounts for 1979-80, it was apparent that the time for action could not be postponed any longer.  These accounts revealed a loss of £11 million and the Government were now faced with the task of securing the very survival of the sugar industry itself.</P>
    <P>I should not like anyone to think that the future of the sugar industry is secure just because the company have been in existence almost since the foundation of the State.  We are operating in a free trading situation.  Vast amounts of sugar are being produced within the Community and we must compete in an openmarket situation as any other member must do also.</P>
    <P>In July 1981, the Government committed themselves to a large-scale rescue <Col N="221" /> operation for the Sugar Company.  Financial consultants were appointed to examine and report on the company's affairs. Their conclusions did not differ substantially from those of the joint committee. Severe pruning of unprofitable activities, and considerable financial effort from the State, were called for if Ireland was to have any sugar industry in a few years' time.  Irish sugar must be able to compete with the sugar from our EEC partners. Otherwise imports are inevitable and our sugar industry could be wiped out.</P>
    <P>What we are seeing today in the sugar industry has a parallel in the flour business whereby imports from member states are causing severe difficulties for the native milling industry.  Legally we must allow those imports.  Fortunately, sugar is imported on a relatively small scale but even if it were to be imported on a large scale we would not be entitled to take action to stop such imports.  The only answer is to complete with the imports and luckily, up to now the Sugar Company have been able to do that. However, there is no certainty that that situation will continue indefinitely.  It is vital that the Sugar Company be viable and be based on a sound financial footing.</P>
    <P>In June 1982, the company's affairs again came to the notice of the House, when it debated the Sugar Manufacture (Amendment) Act.  It authorised the issue of an additional £65 million of capital and taken with the unissued portion of the company's previously authorised capital &mdash; it meant that the Government could provide new capital amounting to £68.5 million.</P>
    <P>A provision of £30 million for 1982 was made available to the company in October last.  However, as my predecessor, Deputy Lenihan, emphasised during the debate on the Bill, every effort had to be made to see that this money was not swallowed up in unprofitable associated activities.  Rationalisation was clearly essential to ensure that any additional funds to be made available to CSET were put to positive and constructive use.</P>
    <P>The company had, of course, been chipping away at the unprofitable aspects of their business.  The decision to close the Carlow food factory in November <Col N="222" /> 1980, and the simultaneous decision to withdraw financial support from the Fastnet Co-operative Society's operation at Skibbereen, were evidence of this.  That date is significant.  We might well ask who were in Government then.  That the Government then in office permitted these plants to close and yet criticise the present Government when they allow similar action to be taken in relation to other plants raises doubts in my mind as to the sincerity of the proposers of the motion we are now debating.</P>
    <P>The losses in Midleton came to £1 million in 1981 and to £1.4 million in 1982. The company saw no prospects of any improvement for the future.  For Mattersons canning operation also, the company saw no future.  This is an operation, as the House knows, based largely on imported raw materials and imported cans, mainly the canning of imported beans.  In 1981, the loss on canning came to nearly £1 million and this was repeated in 1982.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan stated that I was discourteous to two deputations who came to visit me at Agriculture House.  I reject that allegation totally.  I told those people the truth and I cannot think of any reason for their being aggrieved at being told the facts.  Perhaps honesty in such matters is a factor that is all too often missing in Irish political life.  Surely the Deputy would not have wished me to tell lies, to say that I was recommending that a plant be kept open when that was not the position.  The decision in that regard was taken originally by the company who recommended that both plants in question be closed.  The Government accepted that recommendation.  I have never treated any deputation with discourtesy and there was no indication on the part of the two deputations in question as to their being unhappy about the way I treated them.  I find it extraordinary that later assertions such as those made by Deputy Noonan could be made.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the board with full knowledge of all the circumstances decided on both courses of action, no doubt reluctantly.  All of us are reluctant that any business should close but the financial losses were intolerable.  With <Col N="223" /> reluctance, the Government, too, agreed to the inevitability of the closures.  In considering the company's plan for their return to viability the Government had to consider the overall picture which had emerged.  In the most recent three years of operations the company had reported losses of £11 million, £12 million and £22 million, the latter including provision for redundancy.  This year there is provision for redundancy payments.  Those figures speak for themselves.  They represent staggering losses and it should be remembered that we are dealing with taxpayers' money.  Erin Foods alone had incurred losses of £13 million in 1982, and over the three years their overall losses had amounted to £29 million, again including the redundancy provision.  It is against this background that the company's decision to cease activities at Midleton and Mattersons has to be considered.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the decisions taken by the company, and in which the Government concurred, were the correct ones in all the circumstances just as the Government in November 1982 acquiesced in the closure of the Carlow and Skibbereen food plants.  I fail to see how one can separate one decision from the other.  If any Member believes there is a distinction I would be glad to hear it. For its part the company could not see the operations now in question ever becoming profitable.  In so far as the Government were concerned they had to bear in mind the taxpayers' interest.  Further public funds to meet continuing losses could only be provided through the imposition of extra taxes.  God help us, but we have had enough of that in recent times.  We want to alleviate the burden on taxpayers.  Is this the way to do it?  By letting unprofitable public concerns remain open the trend would be the reverse, we would be adding a burden and not relieving one.  In present circumstances, or at any time, the public do not welcome extra taxes.</P>
    <P>A condition attached to the capital provided last October is that a further rationalisation plan must be furnished by the company.  This was stipulated by the last <Col N="224" /> Government as well as by the present one.  We still have quite a distance to go before the company are on a sound financial basis.  I expect to have, within the next month or so, the company's proposals for further rationalisation.  In the light of these the Government will be able to take the financial restructuring a step further. However, we can be very sure of one thing: there will be no scope for keeping unprofitable operations going if the Sugar Company are to survive.  The fundamental choice facing us is, do we or do we not want a sugar industry which will hold its own in the intensively competitive international environment in which the company have to operate? There is a constant threat from imported sugar, which we will ignore at our peril. I am confident that the Sugar Company are acting in a responsible manner.  They are doing an excellent job and are most anxious to put the company back on a profit-making basis and I support them in that objective.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the beef industry which is entirely private enterprise, we have the capacity to carry much greater cattle numbers than at present.  I hope that with the range of aids now available &mdash; including the calf premium, the suckler cow premium, the calved heifer scheme and the headage payments &mdash; farmers will take positive action to increase their herds and build up the supply of raw material for future years.</P>
    <P>My Department have over the years concerned themselves with the elimination of anomalies in the EEC export refund and MCA systems which operated either to favour the live cattle trade over the beef trade or to favour carcase beef exports over boneless beef.  By and large the efforts have been successful and indeed if anything boneless beef exports now receive the most favourable treatment. The previous Coalition Government were largely responsible for that in that they gave an incentive to employment in the beef industry rather than to live exports.  That incentive was badly needed and has created a balance which was desirable.</P>
    <P>In connection with exporting generally I must put in a cautionary word about <Col N="225" /> intervention, which has been a matter of concern to Ministers for Agriculture ever since we joined the Community.  Intervention is a valuable and indeed essential mechanism for supporting producer prices.  However, some factories tend to take the lazy way out and sell into intervention everything that the Department are prepared to accept &mdash; which at the moment is 50 per cent of the steer kill &mdash; and only then seek commercial outlets for the balance.  In good times or bad, when market prices are high or low, intervention has become a market outlet in itself for some factories.  This is not really its proper functions.  Intervention ties up a lot of public funds in capital and substantial Exchequer costs are incurred. Even in difficult times like the present, this would be acceptable, if it were inevitable, but it is by no means inevitable.  I can understand that at some times of the year intervention is the most rewarding outlet and that it gives essential support to producers' incomes.  But there are also times when factories should be looking elsewhere for commercial outlets for all of their production.  In fact over the last ten years or so this has never once happened. Recently one or two exporters have shown a more enterprising approach and have successfully developed new markets.  I would like to see this become more widespread.</P>
    <P>Perhaps at times we devote too much attention to third country markets to the detriment of the markets within the Community. That is unfortunate because the markets within the Community are generally more lucrative.</P>
    <P>The milk processing industry too, is a private enterprise sector, as the co-ops are in fact privately owned concerns. Here, of course, the basic raw material has to receive a certain amount of processing but we tend to keep this to the minimum in as much as the vast bulk of the milk output is used for butter and skim milk powder.  In this sector we have had one of the more spectacular developments of recent years&mdash;that is the development of cream liqueurs.  These have been an outstanding success and are now being copied world wide.  We need more developments of this sort.  Indeed <Col N="226" /> we need quite a large number of such new developments to make any significant impact on the disposal of our milk output.  Eminently successful though they have been, the cream liqueurs accounted in total for some 30 million gallons of milk last year but this was less than half of the annual increase in our milk supply. It will, therefore, be clear why I said that we need many such new developments if we are to diversify our milk output away from the traditional links.  Of course, cheese production, is a worthwhile outlet also.  The main brand of cheese we produce is cheddar but, unfortunately, there is an over-supply of it on the UK market. With regard to new initiatives I should like to commend the enterprise shown by my local Waterford Co-op in launching their very successful Yoplait yoghurt on the British market.  This is the type of approach that others could usefully imitate. One of the major problems when launching a new product is the cost of promotion which runs into millions of pounds.  For that reason I can understand why many firms are not capable of diversifying to the degree they would like.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to reiterate that the course being followed by the Government is aimed firstly at expanding the output of raw material for processing &mdash; in other words, expanding the level of production on our farms.  Then it is aimed at encouraging and assisting the processing of that output to the maximum extent possible, thereby providing much needed employment.  Aid towards the provision of processing facilities is available from the IDA and FEOGA.  The common agricultural policy provides the support and conditions for the expansion of agricultural production.  For their part the Government are working to provide the economic and financial environment in which co-operative, private and public enterprise can succesfully process what our farmers produce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion, proposed by our spokesman on Agriculture, Deputy Noonan, which calls on the Government to review their decision in regard to the proposed closures of many agricultural-based industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> I should like to refer to the Minister's comments regarding inflation rates and the price negotiations.  I am glad that inflation which was falling last year may fall this year because this is a problem that concerns all farmers.  It is imperative that the Minister should have the price negotiations concluded during the week beginning 16 May.  These negotiations were originally to have been finalised on 1 April and the Minister is aware of the large amounts of money being lost to farmers and the country generally because of the delay.</P>
    <P>Our motion has been put down because we believe we can create jobs in agriculture and in agriculture-based industries.  The Minister has responded in some way in his speech.  We are concerned that our produce should be well packaged and presented and that storage facilities should be improved.  We know that the consumer will purchase goods which are well presented and we must improve our marketing.  Not only should we be self-sufficient in potatoes, vegetables and fruit but we should be looking for export markets.  There seems to be a problem with storage of produce.  I am told that other EEC countries have good storage facilities and we are at a disadvantage. We rely too much on imports. Deputy Noonan referred to the setting up of a produce marketing board and I strongly support that proposal.</P>
    <P>Ireland has traditionally been a country where vast amounts of potatoes have been produced.  I was amazed to find that from January to October 1982 total imports of potatoes amounted to 82,000 tonnes.  That was more than twice the amount imported in 1981, which was 39,000 tonnes.  In 1980 potato imports amounted to only 20,000 tonnes.  The figures show a vast increase in potato imports during the past two years and many people have commented on this. Potato imports in 1980 came mostly from Cyprus but the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, made an order to prevent imports from Cyprus except with special permission.  The Dutch, however, were allowed to send potatoes here and 16,600 tonnes were <Col N="228" /> imported in 1981.  The very high figure for imports in 1982 was due to a shortage of potatoes here.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given must be considered in the light of closures of food processing industries such as Mattersons, East Cork Foods and various potato cooperatives. The closure of these industries and the threatened closure of others are undermining this industry.  Any closure will create unemployment but there is a further blow when it is an agriculture-based industry.</P>
    <P>The only encouraging point is that we have apparently found a market for seed potatoes in Egypt, the Canaries and Great Britain.  The Department and other agencies should ascertain whether there is further potential for such exports.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan mentioned frozen chipped potatoes.  The Minister might investigate the possibilities here.  We imported 20,000 tonnes of chipped potatoes in 1981 and a similar figure last year. Also in 1981, 4,000 tonnes of frozen vegetables such as peas and beans were imported and a similar amount in 1982. This matter should be examined and the IDA could investigate the employment potential of frozen food industries.  The figures show the need to develop a food processing industry and we should be looking for further outlets rather than contemplating closures of well-established industries.</P>
    <P>There are obviously certain types of fruit which must be imported but it is amazing that in 1981 apples to the value of £13 million were imported.  Competition is keen but it is a challenge to Government and to the producers, particularly within the EEC where the French are so proud of the apples they produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister devoted part of his speech to the Sugar Company, for whom I have great admiration.  They had profits at the end of the year, apart from recent years when they have had losses.  It is very interesting to note the incomes they have provided for all the people involved in the sugar industry, the farmers who grow the product, the people who work on the campaigns and there is also the value of farm feed manufactured by the <Col N="229" /> company.  It is worth saying that, indirectly, the Sugar Company have provided employment for hauliers.  In my county the company cut turf.  There are also sales of machinery, fertilisers and chemical products.</P>
    <P>I hoped the Minister would have a definite commitment to give in relation to the future of the Tuam Sugar Factory because he is well aware that over the last few years there has been uncertainty about the factory.  It is very difficult to exhort farmers to grow more beet, as they have done in the Tuam catchment area, and every six months there is an announcement that possibly this factory will close.  The first announcement I heard about this was in 1981 when the Minister for Agriculture, who is now Minister for Finance, announced that the factory would close.  After a deputation to the Taoiseach the factory was given a years reprieve.  That was the situation towards the end of 1981 but after Fianna Fáil returned to power a long-term commitment was given to the future of the factory by the Leader of our Party.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not give a definite commitment about the future of this factory.  The chairman of the Sugar Company in March stated in the annual report of the Sugar Company that the Tuam factory was a cost penalty on the company.  He then made an amazing statement:</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, asking western growers to increase their acreage for the factory for this year by 20 per cent over the 1982 figure. </P>
    <P>The 1982 figure was 7,000 acres of beet and the chairman of the Sugar Company asked the western growers to grow 8,500 acres.  In fact, those growers had arrangements made to grow 10,000 acres.  The Tuam factory looked for a 50 per cent increase in the acreage but only 8,500 acres were allowed by the Sugar Company. This has discriminated against Tuam.  Even though I have great admiration for the work done by the Sugar Company I am very critical of them for not giving the acreage sought by the Tuam company.</P>
    <P>I understand that the rationalisation <Col N="230" /> plan which the Minister spoke about is to be presented to him before 31 May.  I take it, from what the Minister said tonight, that this plan has not reached him yet.  I hope when he receives it that he will be able to give a commitment to keep the sugar factory open.  I know my colleague in the constituency, the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, will use his influence also.  The farmers in the western catchment area have increased the acreage; the output has increased in the factory through the hard work of the workers and the people on the campaigns. The campaign last year was the finest one we ever had in Tuam.  This was acknowledged by the chairman of the Sugar Company, Mr. Fitzpatrick, who said it was an exceptionally good campaign with an increase of 1,000 acres in the amount of beet grown.  It was also a good campaign by the campaign workers.</P>
    <P>There is another statement made by Mr. Fitzpatrick I would like to take up, when he said that the case of the Tuam sugar factory is well known.  He said that the company cannot say other than that it is a serious cost factor on the overall cost operation and this fact was recognised by the Oireachtas Joint Committee. I have read the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee and what Mr. Fitzpatrick said is quite true about the commitee's findings.  The committee made a very important point that the Tuam factory would not be allowed to close until alternative employment was found in the town of Tuam.  Alternative employment has not been found.  Quite recently, we were told, in relation to an IDA promotion, that they had got the agreement of an American company to take over an advance factory in Tuam but the negotiations fell through and the expected 200 jobs have not come to Tuam.</P>
    <P>There is serious unemployment in the greater Tuam area.  The Minister is well aware that, when the beet campaign is on in Tuam, between the campaign workers and the beet workers we are talking about over 600 jobs.  The number of permanent workers in the factory was 376 but, because of redundancies there and the rationalisation programme by the factory, <Col N="231" /> this work force has now been cut to 380.  That has saved the company money also.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  The closure of Paul and Vincent Ltd. will take place at the end of this month with substantial job losses.  There have been a number of redundancies in the town recently.  Just over 1,500 people are registered as unemployed at the exchange in Tullamore.  This is very serious.</P>

So far they have only received an acknowledgment from the Minister that he is looking into it.  It is not good enough for the premier body in the county to be treated like this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an old established company which has given good employment over the years.  Its closure will have a disastrous effect on the community. The closure may be only temporary but when closures of this kind take place very few companies reopen unless they are taken over by some other concern. Tullamore Yarns closed at the end of the year.  There has been redundancy in the Williams bottling plant.  Redundancy is planned for Roadstone Concrete and Spollen Concrete in Tullamore. These have given major employment over the years.  This area needs special <Col N="232" /> attention from the IDA.  It is not good enough for them to quote statistics.  Some of their information is out of date.  Tullamore should be a designated area.  I say that in view of the high unemployment in the town which is the capital of the county.  At the end of June when pupils leave school the unemployed figure will probably be close to 2,000.</P>
      <P>Paul and Vincent gave good employment over the years.  It was mostly male employment.  I should be glad if the Minister would see what could be done to rectify the position and see if the company could postpone their closure for a couple of months.  I do not wish to make political play out of this.  It is too serious for that.  People are worried about the spate of redundancies and unemployment hitting them.  Tullamore has a young population and is one of the most rapidly expanding towns in the midlands. There is no doubt about that.  In the urban area of Tullamore there are approximately 7,000 voters on the register who are over the age of 18 years.  One can imagine the large population in that area.</P>
      <P>Employment in the area has deteriorated. I regret to say that the outlook is not good.  I would be grateful if the Minister would investigate this company and request them to postpone the closure. The markets should be fully investigated. I ask him to convey to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Energy, the need to make immediate arrangements, if at all possible, to meet a deputation from Offaly County Council and to meet constituency representatives at Leinster House to discuss the industrial position in Tullamore.  I accept the Minister's assurance that he will convey that to his colleague as a matter of urgency.  I hope something will be done to rectify the position.  Closure of this factory will take place at the end of the month but perhaps negotiations could be put in train with the company to see what can be done in the meantime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indeed aware that Paul and Vincent have decided to close their Tullamore animal feeding plant at the end of the <Col N="233" /> present month.  The closure of any undertaking is a matter of great concern to all of us especially when our unemployment figures are already at such a high level.</P>
      <P>This firm is one of the largest producers of animal feed in the country.  In addition to the feed mill at Tullamore they also have mills at Edgeworthstown and Kilmallock.</P>
      <P>During the seventies the animal feed industry experienced considerable growth, in particular following our joining the European Economic Community. A peak in production was reached in 1979 when the industry produced about 2.1 million tonnes of feed.  This expansion encouraged a number of existing firms to modernise and expand their production capacity and some new firms entered the industry for the first time.  Paul and Vincent were among the firms which decided to expand by setting up a new mill in Edgeworthstown which commenced production in 1981.  However, since 1979 the demand for compound feeding stuffs has levelled off and, as new capacity continued to come on stream, some excess capacity developed in the industry.</P>
      <P>What Paul and Vincent are now doing is rationalising their operation by confining production to only two mills &mdash; those of Kilmallock and Edgeworthstown &mdash; instead of three.  The mill in Tullamore is not up for sale and, in fact, in the event of a more favourable climate developing in the industry, I could well imagine that the question of re-opening the plant would not be ruled out.  I regret very much that, because of the company's decision, taken on commercial grounds after careful consideration of all the relevant facts, about 40 employees of the company will be made redundant.  This was a decision which the Board of Paul and Vincent themselves took and I very much regret that there are no measures open to me which would enable the proposed closure to be averted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the general employment situation in Tullamore. However I have been assured by the Minister for Industry and Energy that the IDA have been successful in attracting new industry to the town in recent <Col N="234" /> years.  A number of prominent companies have set up in the area and employment is already being provided by these companies for several hundred people. These companies are expected to provide substantial job opportunities in the years ahead.  In addition, a number of small industries have also been established in Tullamore with IDA assistance during the past few years.  In the four years from 1979-1983 manufacturing employment in the area has increased by over 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>The IDA are promoting Tullamore on a priority basis for new industry.  As part of their efforts, they have committed considerable resources to the provision of land and factories in the town.  At present, the IDA have a 27,000 sq. ft. advance factory and two small units each of 3,000 sq. ft. available for industrial development.  Two units are at present occupied by one firm on a temporary basis until they relocate to their new factory. In addition, four units each of 3,000 sq. ft. have been provided by private finance and these are either occupied or reserved for small industrial projects. The IDA also have a total of 59 acres available for future development.</P>
    <P>The IDA are also seeking to identify a suitable project to take over the Tullamore Yarns factory.  A full specification of the factory has been circulated to the IDA's overseas offices.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I regret the closure of the Paul and Vincent mill in Tullamore.  The house can be assured that the Government are very concerned at such closures and, as I have indicated, the IDA are actively pursuing the establishment of industry in the town and locality.</P>
    <P>During the course of his contribution Deputy Connolly requested that I convey his views to the Minister for Industry and Energy and I will gladly do that.  I will also let the Minister know that the Deputy is anxious that he should receive a deputation from the Deputies in the constituency of Laois-Offaly, together with representatives of the county council.  I will also convey that request to the Minister who has, I believe, communicated in writing today to the Deputy <Col N="235" /> about the general unemployment problems affecting the Tullamore district.  I hope we can be of some assistance.</P>

The person concerned first claimed unemployment <Col N="49" /> benefit in August 1981 shortly after her marriage.  She stated in connection with her claim that she was not looking for work but she considered that she was entitled to benefit on the basis of earlier contributions paid.  The claim was disallowed on the basis that she was not available for work.  She appealed against the decision and the appeals officer held an oral hearing of her case at which she attended and gave evidence on her own behalf.  The appeals officer however disallowed the claim.  She continued to sign as unemployed but her claim was again disallowed on the ground that she was not available for work from 28 October 1981 to 17 August 1982 after which date she ceased to sign as unemployed.  A delay occurred in advising her of the decision due to the papers being mislaid at the local office dealing with her claim.

      <P>The plans for the scheme were approved on the basis that Kerry County Council would make a water supply available to the group from Castleisland regional scheme.

Under the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, the county council have additional powers to require works to be undertaken by the owners of derelict sites and, in certain situations, to carry out the works themselves or to acquire a site.

      <P>The sports complex is being provided under the National Programme for the provision of Community and Recreational Facilities operated by the Department of Education.  Under this programme the Department of Education offered grants to particular local authorities of two-thirds of the estimated cost of certain sports centres on sites which the local authorities would provide for this purpose.  To enable the local authority to contribute to the cost, approval to borrowing of £84,000 was given to Dublin Corporation in 1981.  In April 1982, the local authority applied to my predecessor for sanction for additional borrowing of £190,000 in respect of the project.  At that stage, because of the necessity to conserve available resources for priority services such as housing, roads, and sanitary services, there were no further funds available to enable my predecessor to sanction the additional borrowing and the local authority were so informed in September 1982.  Since then, the position has remained unchanged; resources must continue to be reserved for priority services and accordingly there are no funds at my disposal which would enable me to sanction the additional borrowing.</P>

These proposals will receive urgent attention when received in my Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will indicate in relation to the £1,739 million to be raised this year in income tax, the amount that will come from the PAYE sector and the amount that will be contributed by workers earning in excess of £10,000 per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The yield of income tax in 1983 from the PAYE sector is estimated at £1,472 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the amount that will be contributed by workers earning in excess of £10,000 per annum the statistics available at the present time are provisional figures for the year 1980-81 which show that £240 million in tax out of a total of £810 million was payable by PAYE income earners with total income in excess of £10,000 per annum.  Total income is gross income less superannuation <Col N="92" /> contributions, interest relief, medical insurance relief and allowable expenses.</P>
    <P>The figure of £1,472 million refers to all tax collected under the PAYE system and, therefore, refers to more than ordinary wage and salary earners.  For example, it includes the tax payable by directors of close companies and tax on investment income, and so on, collected under PAYE by restricting tax-free allowances.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that refunds in the amounts of £13.34 and £3.60 were made to the taxpayer on 18 May 1982 and 17 January 1983, respectively, on the basis of reviews of pre-marriage liability for the year 1981-82.  As the marriage took place near the end of the income tax year virtually all the tax-free allowances due had already been taken into consideration in determining the PAYE deductions. This accounts for the small overall sum repayable.  There is no further refund due in the case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While the efforts of the local fundraisers would cover part of the cost of establishing the unit at the hospital the balance would have to be borne by the health board and ultimately by the Exchequer. Very substantial revenue costs would also <Col N="97" /> be incurred in running the unit and these, of course, would be recurring.</P>
    <P>A hospital based dialysis unit requires specialised staff including specially trained medical and nursing staff and it was for this reason that dialysis units were provided only in a small number of the larger hospitals.  There is also the fact that the current budgetary situation imposes constraints on health agencies which impede the development of services which might otherwise merit consideration.  However, my Department have recently decided to re-examine the policy in relation to the provision of chronic maintenance of hospital dialysis and a survey of the areas which do not have such services is currently being undertaken.  The proposal to establish a unit in Limerick Regional Hospital is being examined in this context.</P>

      <P>Disability benefit in payment equalled 80% of the claimant's reckonable weekly earnings and he therefore ceased to be entitled to pay-related benefit from 4 April 1983.  He continues, however, to receive flat-rate disability benefit of £59.65 weekly which is the maximum rate for a married couple with one dependent child.</P>

      <P>The entitlement to pay-related benefit of the person concerned is governed by her reckonable earnings during the income tax period 6 April 1981 to 5 April 1982.  She was not, however, fully employed during the period as she was absent through illness from 2 April 1981 to 12 August 1981.  The amount of her reckonable earnings was for this reason less than those of her sister and consequently the amount of pay-related benefit to which she was entitled was also less than that of her sister whose reckonable earnings were greater because she had been fully employed during the period 6 April 1981 to April 1982.</P>

He appealed against the disallowance and before submitting his case to an appeals officer for determination his case was referred again to a social welfare oficer for further inquiries about his means.  These inquiries were only recently completed and arrangements are being made to refer the matter to an appeals officer.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.</P>
