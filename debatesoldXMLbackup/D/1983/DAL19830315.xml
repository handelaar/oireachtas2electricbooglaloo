    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will clarify his statement in the Dáil on Tuesday 14 December 1982 that where good things are being done which need to be done in deprived areas of our cities, they will not be halted because of the change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I wish to assure the Deputy that our Government are firmly committed to all worthwhile improvements in the deprived areas of all our cities.  Within the limits of the financial constraints imposed by the state of our <Col N="2" /> public finances we will allocate the necessary funds to achieve these improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he considers that the recent withdrawal of funding from the North Centre City Community Action Programme in Dublin's inner city, and the termination of that programme which co-ordinates and administers youth employment and training schemes in the inner city in co-operation with AnCO, the Department of Education, the Government's inner city group and the active support of the ITGWU, <Col N="3" /> CERT, the FAI and other bodies, is a clear contradiction of his position which he has restated in the House today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: No.  As the Deputy has pointed out, funds are available to his organisation from AnCO to run training courses and from the Department of Education for youth employment schemes.  The secretary of his organisation is funded by the Eastern Health Board.  On the question of direct funding, that was continued exceptionally after the Combat Poverty Agency was terminated by another Government.  The Deputy was notified in October by the previous Government that funding would not be continuing but our Government provided temporary funding in the early weeks of this year, contrary to what was said to the Deputy in October by the last Government.  The whole question of funding is something which will be considered further when we will re-establish the poverty agency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not wish to engage in an argument with the Taoiseach and I accept that the Chair would rule me out of order if I tried, but something useful may come out of the question.  It seems to me that there is confusion behind the Taoiseach's reply which is based on inaccurate information. The Taoiseach stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: The Deputy cannot make a speech.  He must put a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am leading into a question.  The Taoiseach has said that there is funding available from AnCO and other agencies for this project and I should like to ask him if he would examine that information further given, as I am aware, that the funding available from AnCO and the Department of Education is devoted entirely to running&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am leading to a question.  The funding available to the project goes entirely to the training and youth employment schemes. The funding that was available from the Department of Social Welfare is essential to keep that project in operation so that it will be possible to carry out the other schemes in co-operation with AnCO and the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: A final supplementary from Deputy Gregory.  The Deputy has made two speeches already on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>: Will the Taoiseach instruct an official in his Department to investigate my statement and to meet representatives of the project to establish the accuracy of what I have said and the accuracy of his reply?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if he is aware that aerial photographic sources used by the Irish Geological Survey in relation to our coasts originate from the Royal Air Force and the United States Air Force; and if permission was granted by the Government for any reconnaissance flights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am advised that the Geological Survey of Ireland do not use aerial photography from the sources indicated by the Deputy.  The second part of his question does not arise, therefore.</P>
      <P>Between 1973 and 1977 the Geological Survey organised an aerial photographic survey of the Republic of Ireland.  This survey was carried out under contract by the Institute Geographique National of France.  Almost all the survey's aerial photographic work is now based on this comprehensive coverage.  The coastal zone of the Republic of Ireland was photographed from the air by the Air Corps in 1956 and these photographs are still in occasional use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: The information available to me is that the sources suggested by the Deputy are not used by the Geological Survey of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy the number of current exploration licences in existence in counties Cavan and Monaghan; the number of licences being actively used; and if he will make a statement on the current position in regard to gas discovery in west Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: At present only one onshore petroleum exploration licence issued by my Department is in force.  This licence extends over an area in counties Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Donegal as well as over an area of 252 square miles in County Cavan.  In the course of work carried out under this licence, the Dowra well, which is on the Cavan-Leitrim border and in which gas had previously been discovered in non-commercial quantities, was re-entered and the gas-flow was improved.  While the improvement was substantial, it did not establish the commercial <Col N="7" /> viability of the find.  A considerable amount of further work, including drilling, will be necessary before the extent of the reserves can be proven. There is provision under the terms of the licence for the drilling of exploration of two wells in 1983.</P>
      <P>No petroleum exploration licences are in force in respect of any area of County Monaghan.  There are 13 mineral prospecting licences over areas in counties Cavan and Monaghan currently valid and in active use.  The holder of a minerals prospecting licence is required to carry out a satisfactory work programme, to submit periodic reports to me and to surrender the licence if he ceases to explore the area actively.</P>
      <P>There are a further six minerals prospecting licences over areas in these counties, being processed towards issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: Since exploration resulted in the discovery of gas in west Cavan and over the Border in Fermanagh, would the Minister explore the possibility of getting EEC funding for a more extensive and thorough search for gas in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy will be aware that we issue licences in this regard.  Further work is necessary to establish the extent of the reserves.  Over the past two years extensive geological field mapping and the shooting of 400 kilometres of seismic has been carried out and this should add substantially to the information available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: Since the Minister is aware that a non-quota fund has been available for some time for the Border areas but that the expenditure was confined to the tourist and craft industries, would the Minister explore with the EEC the possibility of the extension of funds, either quota or non-quota, for this purpose? Two drillings per annum are not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: My Department would be very anxious to have the most comprehensive surveys carried out and I will <Col N="8" /> have this matter raised in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister mentioned in the latter part of his reply that those who have licences for mineral exploration must report to his Department. Could he give me some idea of the up-to-date position in the counties mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have not available to me the information required by the Deputy but I am pleased to note that they are looking for gold, lead and zinc in the area.  The Deputy might be lucky enough to have a gold strike in his constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: We have lead and zinc in Navan but I should like the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: While I am very reluctant to stop the Deputy on this question, I must be impartial and move to the next question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I thank the Chair for his indulgence.  Would it be possible for the Minister to supply me privately with up-to-date information about the reports on mineral exploration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk  Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Kirk</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if he will take immediate steps to preserve the 130 skilled jobs which have been lost because of the closure of a firm (details supplied) in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I very much regret the closure of this company due to adverse trading conditions and considerable over-capacity in the world market for the products made by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial losses had been incurred by the company in recent years because of the big decline in its markets.  In this period, a considerable amount of State aid was made available to the company in an effort to help it overcome its difficulties <Col N="9" /> and to diversify.  When, however, a recent consultancy study commissioned jointly by the IDA and Fóir Teoranta concluded that the company were not capable of again becoming viable, the appointment of a receiver was requested by the directors.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority, in close co-operation with the receiver, are making and will continue to make every effort possible to secure an alternative industry for the factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister agree that the decision of the receiver not to continue the operations of Thomas McArdle Limited was unusual?  Would he agree that every effort should have been made by the receiver to keep this industry operating until such time as he had the opportunity of selling it as a going concern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am satisfied that every effort has been made by the receiver to find a replacement industry.  It would be factual to say that it is very doubtful if a container type industry could be sited there because of over-capacity in the industry on a European basis.  I would add that the company have received substantial State aid through the years.  They received IDA grants totalling £1.72 million, Fóir Teoranta loan assistance of £550,000 and employment guarantee fund assistance of £412,900 approximately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would regard the Minister's viewpoint as being far too pessimistic. Is the Minister aware that a number of industries in my constituency which were continued in operation by the receiver are now thriving as a result? Would he agree that the loss of 130 highly skilled workmen from the work force is a very serious matter and will he do everything in his power to overcome the problems facing that company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister would consider the loss of one job, whether skilled or semi-skilled, a very serious matter.  The Deputy will appreciate that the company was not lightly put into <Col N="10" /> receivership and it was done only after a consultancy study had been commissioned and the report received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if he is aware that Group Textiles Ltd., Edenderry, County Offaly have let almost their entire workforce go and that there is imminent danger of the factory ceasing production <Col N="11" /> completely; if he is further aware of the serious repercussions this will have on the town of Edenderry where there is already high unemployment; the action his Department have taken to date to help this company; and the plans they have to help the factory to reopen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am aware that Group Textiles Limited, Edenderry, have recently laid off all their workers.</P>
      <P>I am deeply conscious of the impact which the closure of this factory would have on the town of Edenderry but I can assure the Deputy that the IDA, in conjunction with the company, are making every effort to have the factory taken over as a going concern.  The company's difficulties have arisen because of the collapse of their main export market but I can also inform the Deputy that Córas Trachtála are in touch with the company and will be prepared to provide them with appropriate assistance where possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware that this company were in touch with the IDA and asked them to purchase or to lease back a portion of the factory from them as the floor space they had was too large to maintain their work force?  Would the IDA have a look at this suggestion to see if they could be given some capital to proceed further?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: The IDA are fully aware of the situation of the company.  I suggest that the main problem in the company relates to design and markets rather than anything else.  I pointed out this quite clearly in my reply.  Córas Tráchtála are fully involved at this stage in the company's affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware that quite a sizeable proportion of the materials manufactured by this firm are for export?  Can the Minister outline what positive line the IDA and Córas Tráchtála are pursuing in relation to having this factory re-opened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: The IDA are doing <Col N="12" /> everything possible to have the company taken over as a going concern.  As I pointed out in my answer, the reason is that the factory's main export market collapsed and this was beyond the remit of the IDA.  The IDA and Córas Tráchtála are attempting to remedy the situation.  The IDA are actively pursuing the possibility of having the company taken over as a going concern.</P>

      <P>In this context, and indeed in relation to available IDA factory premises generally, this promotional effort involved:</P>

It is worth knowing that in 1982 the IDA organised 500 first time itineraries and the authority's plans for this year provide for a further large number.  It must also be appreciated that the world economy is going through a very difficult period and the internationally mobile funds available for investment are limited.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy the plans the IDA have for the industrial development of County Mayo in 1983; the number and location of existing unoccupied factories; the proposals for advance factory building this year in the county; and the prospects of attracting much needed employment opportunities to the county.</P>

      <P>: In their Industrial Plan 1978-1982, the Industrial Development Authority set a target for the creation of 3,250 jobs in County Mayo.  The IDA succeeded in creating 1,772 first time jobs or 55 per cent of the target.  Some jobs arising from industrial projects approved by the IDA for the county in recent years have yet to come on stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to circulate details of the IDA's vacant factory space and land holdings in the county in the form of a tabular statement.  Due to the amount of factory space available for industrial development, the IDA have no plans to construct additional advance factories in <Col N="23" /> County Mayo at present.  The IDA propose, however, to begin construction of a 4 × 1,000 sq. ft. craft centre at Knock later in the year subject to completion of the acquisition of a site.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>: It was a case of force of habit.</P>
      <P>In the latter months of 1982 expenditure commitments relating to the Employment Incentive Scheme were in the order of £2 million per month.  This pattern, if carried into this year, could have required a budget for the scheme of £24 million in 1983.  The amount provided by the Fianna Fáil Government in their Estimates published in November last year was £4.88 million &mdash; a potential shortfall of more than £19 million.  Had the scheme been continued on the same basis, that estimate would be exhausted for all economic sectors covered before the end of this month.  On my arrival in the Department of Labour I was advised of the massive under-estimate and immediately took steps to salvage the scheme to the optimum extent.  An additional £4 million has now been provided so that the amount available for the Employment Incentive Scheme in 1983 is £8.8 million, almost double that provided by the last Government.</P>
      <P>In reshaping the scheme, as a consequence of the under-estimate to which I have referred, it was necessary to exclude the services and construction sectors and to concentrate the available resources on the economic sectors most exposed to external influences.  Accordingly, manufacturing industry and agriculture will continue to benefit under the Employment Incentive Scheme in 1983.  In addition, I am considering what arrangements could be made to encourage increased employment in the hotel and catering industry, in view of its potential for having a positive effect on the balance of payments through generating revenues from tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much that it was necessary to curtail the Employment Incentive <Col N="30" /> Scheme in 1983 but I would draw attention of all interested parties, and particularly the Construction Industry Federation, to the level of under-estimate involved and to the impossibility of meeting commitments for even a fraction of this year had the scheme's provisions been retained on the basis that had previously applied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have a number of questions I wish to ask.  First, will the Minister state specifically what amount of money has been paid by way of the Employment Incentive Scheme to date? Secondly, will he tell the House why he decided to penalise two industries that seem to be the target of Coalition attack, namely, the building industry and the hotel industry?  Will he tell the House what steps he intends to take and when he intends to take them with regard to assisting the hotel and tourist industry? We are now in mid-March and by normal standards that industry should be about to take off very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have not the information requested in the first question.  The second question asked why the scheme was curtailed and I have given my reply to that.  The answer is simply that money was not available.  The scheme had to be added to considerably in the resources made available in this year's budget, even to continue in the areas I have outlined. Thirdly, I have asked the Youth Employment Agency of the possibility of their continuing a scheme to aid the hotel and catering sectors and a decision from them is awaited.</P>

      <P>: There was a provision of £4.88 million in the Estimates in November 1982 and a further £4 million was added in the present Estimates in order to keep the scheme going on the basis I have outlined.  Until the board of the Youth Employment Agency meet and give a decision I cannot say if they intend to adopt the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>: As regards the impact on unemployment in 1983 of the curtailment of the Employment Incentive Scheme, it should be pointed out that the scheme applies only to incremental employment by an individual employer. Therefore, there is no question of job losses.  With regard to increased employment, of course this depends on factors other than wage subsidies.  For example, in the building and construction industry the major determinant of employment is the volume of contracts available and this situation would apply to other industries also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>: I wish to ask the Minister a question in relation to the nonsensical aspect of the reply.  Is he aware that the Employment Incentive Scheme and every pound spent on it is helping to create a new job?  His reply in relation to the amount allocated in the Estimates in November as against what he has done now is nonsense when we see that, at the same time, he could find £31 million for increased unemployment benefits.  The Employment Incentive Scheme was introduced as an incentive to employ people on the dole.  Every pounds spent helped to create a job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We assumed certain procedures had been adopted and it is that which is creating the present dilemma.  I regret I am not in a position to give the wording of the amendment today.  I had hoped to be able <Col N="114" /> to do so but the Deputy will appreciate that, in view of what happened to the wording on the last occasion, it is of great importance to ensure that we get a wording which will stand up to scrutiny and achieve the objectives which both sides of the House are anxious to achieve.

    <Title>Land Bond Bill, 1983: Second Stage (Resumed) .</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>: I had just begun to speak on this Land Bond Bill on 2 March 1983 when the debate was moved for adjournment. To recap briefly, I said that what was introduced as a land bond enabling Bill came to be discussed very widely as dealing with all aspects of land redistribution, making land available and so on. The whole area of land use was discussed. In many of our built-up areas some of our best land is being used for building purposes and also being exploited by the various interests associated therewith.</P>
      <P>The value of land as a natural resource can never be over-estimated either here or elsewhere.  In our country we recognise that agriculture is of fundamental importance to the economy, a fact readily recognised and accepted by all shades of opinion, rural or urban.  The Bill we are now discussing requests this House to make available a major increase in money for the purchase and redistribution of land.  In other words we are asking that the existing amount of £105 million be increased to £130 million.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have been much criticised not only in this House in the course of the debate so far but equally criticised and maligned by many people who have at times attempted to get land. Nonetheless, one must say in favour of the Land Commission that they have been highly successful in abolishing the historical form of landlordism and in attempting to vest the land so acquired in many tenants who have very usefully exploited and worked it to date in the interests of the economy at large.  That is borne out very much by the fact that there has been no serious agrarian disturbance in this country, a testimony to the achievement of the Land Commission in this respect in meeting the aspirations of many smallholders to acquire additional land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about making more land available and finding ways of <Col N="120" /> regulating the marketing of land in order to improve the competitiveness of the smallholder and at the same time ensuring that those who acquire the land will use it effectively in the interests of the economy.  I am anxious to support this Bill because that is the reason for making this money available.  On the surface, £25 million would appear to be a significant amount but one must take into account the competitive nature of land deals and the number who subscribe to attaining further land even though it is claimed that there is not the level of profit that one would wish for.  When one farmer tries to compete against another, the price of land is driven almost sky high.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission, in existence now for over 100 years, continue to operate within a legal and procedural framework essentially designed to safeguard the rights of individual landowners. A land policy seeking to achieve the highest possible level of productivity and more efficient use of our important natural resource has been the subject of debate for many years.  A land policy interim report was introduced in this House in 1977, a final report was brought forward in 1978 and a land policy report was presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas in December 1980.  That is evidence of the great level of concern shared by everybody with regard to the existing land structures and ways in which they might be improved.  In spite of all the worthwhile effort and time devoted to land policy, very little has been done. Successive Governments have failed totally in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have achieved much and I would be the last person to deny this, although I have certain criticisms of the commission.  They deserve a certain measure of commendation for the manner in which they have operated within the legal constraints over the years.  The Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, has aired his views on land structure and what he would like to see happening.  The belief that there is a need for restructuring is shared by all farming organisations, and not only those but people outside farming as well.  They recognise the importance of land and its <Col N="121" /> full use in our economy.  At no time in our history has that been more evident than at present.</P>
    <P>Any land reform policy must take account of the existing owner-occupant system of land tenure, which is an historical legacy of the land struggle dating back almost to Famine times.  The difficulties over land need not be further exemplified here but, due to the constitutional protection afforded to all property owners, it will be extremely difficult to formulate an acceptable and workable policy on land no matter how desirable that is.  The rigid attitudes which attach unwarranted status to land ownership are deep-rooted and ingrained into our minds.  There is obvious justification for this, when one examines the long and more often than not bitter struggle in the history of the land, going back to the times of Parnell and of Michael Davitt. Michael Davitt was a great protagonist of land ownership, not for the landless but for those who already had land, by trying to ensure a greater degree of fixity of tenure.  The Land Acts of the 1870s, which is not today or yesterday, came in under a different administration, but, nonetheless, some of them achieved a worthwhile purpose.  The 1881 Act, which gave rise to the &ldquo;Three Fs&rdquo;, embodies the first consolidation of land ownership in the minds of the Irish tenant farmers.  Parnell fought for that and it was the most significant among his many public achievements in his fight for a measure of freedom in this State.  By the time of the 1923 Land Act, 300,000 tenants had been assisted in obtaining land, a significant achievement for which the Land Commission may take credit.</P>
    <P>In giving support to this Bill, one must examine the various developments of the Land Acts and the subsequent power assigned to the Land Commission.  The Congested Districts Board, which is still in existence, came into being under the Land Act of 1881.  This board was merged with the Land Commission in 1923.  More or less the same land structure has existed over the last 400 years.  A previous speaker pointed out that land bonds were a dirty word in land dealings in rural Ireland.  The land bond system was established <Col N="122" /> in 1923, was amended at various stages and in the more recent Act of 1965 assumed its present form.</P>
    <P>Land bonds are the most important element in today's debate.  In this Bill we are making more money available to the Land Commission to purchase land through the land bond system.  The use of land bonds enables the State to finance the land resettlement programme without recourse to public borrowing.  That may or may not be an advantage to the State but it has been of no considerable advantage to the landowners who are trying to get rid of land.  Today it may not be of great value to the land owners who are trying to acquire land.  There is no fixed redemption rate and by far the most hostile aspect of bonds is that they are a form of loan with no guaranteed repayment date.  Therein lies the really degrading aspect of land bonds.  One can never cash them in at the price one should get for them.  They have at times sold at as low as half their market value.  The interest rate may have remained reasonably static &mdash; 16½ per cent is a reasonable interest rate &mdash; and because of that the amount of income derived from land bonds is reasonable.  However, people do not want land bonds, they want cash in their hands and that is what I would like to see happening.  It may cost the State more money but it would be a worthwhile investment.  It is only part of an overall land structuring policy, giving strength and licence to the operating authorities to do the job well.</P>
    <P>The amount of land required to fund the existing resettlement programme would be a small percentage of the public capital budget for the current year.  Any future land policy, if it is to be at all successful, must take account of buying land for cash.  Every Deputy on the far side of the House would agree with that.</P>
    <P>It might be unwise to find too much fault with the Land Commission as they have had considerable achievements in land redistribution, in spite of many difficulties.  Well over one million hectares of land have been held by the Land Commission at different stages and redistributed by them.  The aim in redistributing <Col N="123" /> land should not be economic only.  It may have been the case over the years that we looked too much at the economics of land holdings and set our limits at a certain figure.  That may bring serious social unrest to the minds of landowners. For that reason many farmers will not offer land to the Land Commission.  The family farm is still the basic unit of land use in Ireland and any policy which does not recognise that will be a failure from the word go.</P>
    <P>State expenditure on agriculture is a very constructive investment provided it ensures the greatest use of that resource. The Land Commission are not faultless in this respect because often the most deserving applicants &mdash; sometimes landless farmers who have worked all their lives on the land and know no other way of life &mdash; have been deprived through the framework of the Land Commission from benefiting under land division.  I know from experience that land has been taken from under the noses of good farmers, people who have rented land under the conacre system.  If they want to bid for a farm they are not allowed to do so because the Land Commission may have given it to people who are not entitled to it because their productivity from the land they already have has not been what it should.  Over the years we have seen political and even outside influence being brought to bear when small farms were being divided so that certain people who are not entitled to the land would get it. Whether the land is taken over by the Land Commission or the land agency, the stigma is the same.</P>
    <P>The Government have a serious obligation to ensure that any farmer who benefits under the Land Commission's redistribution programme must use the land effectively and to the best advantage. If this does not happen the Land Commission are not doing the job for which they were originally set up.</P>
    <P>Another problem with the Land Commission is the length of time they keep the land, sometimes six or ten years. Many people who wish to acquire this land are amazed at these delays but nobody seems to pay too much attention <Col N="124" /> to this situation.  To keep land for pasture over a ten year period is not a productive use of the resource, irrespective of the difficulties that might exist &mdash; dividing it, registration and so on.  It has been said that land is held by the Land Commission until a certain party are in office and the land can be divided among their friends.</P>
    <P>Let us take as an example a 100 acre farm at £2,500 per acre, and paid for by 16½ per cent land bonds.  The amount required to service that annually would be £41,250.  The farmer gets his 16½ per cent land bonds and the Land Commission pick up the tab.  The commission persist in parcelling out that land on a yearly basis to the detriment of the economy and to the coffers of the Land Commission.  The most they will get for that 100 acres would be £100 an acre &mdash; and very few farmers will pay more than that because if they did they would not make a profit.  That means the commission take in £10,000, losing £31,250 on the operation.  If that land is sold it will cost the farmers between £350 and £400 an acre.  That is not a viable operation.  I suggest that the Minister make money available to the Land Commission to eliminate that type of wasteful land use and give the land at a greatly reduced annuity to farmers who will make effective use of it or allow them the opportunity to buy it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's views on this subject are laudable, but how effective he will be remains to be seen.  If the commission wish to divide a farm they might help the farmers.  If a 100 acre farm came on the market it could cost £2,000 or £1,500 an acre.  If the price is higher the farmers could find themselves in difficulties, as happened in the seventies.  In many cases those farmers are now unable to meet their interest repayments.  Perhaps the commission might make land available at a fixed rate so that the farmer would know exactly how much interest he would have to pay each year.  I am sure there is an EEC scheme which could help in this area.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the farm retirement scheme which has been disastrous so far as making land available for redistribution is concerned.  At various <Col N="125" /> times I have attempted to explain the value of this scheme to individual farmers, but to no avail.  Those who opted for the scheme are now very annoyed. Eighty per cent of all land ownership transfers occur through inheritance or succession.  First we had estate duties. Where a succession took place and the transfer was dealt with a number of years before the death of the property holder, there was no duty; but that changed under the Coalition programme in the middle seventies.  The taxation to be paid now in such cases is more severe.  That situation should be looked at very critically to ensure that there will be a greater flow of land and that farmers will not be prevented from passing land to their sons, nephews or nieces.  I know nephews and nieces who lived with their uncles for 20 or 30 years, with no fixity of tenure, but because of their interest and commitment to the land, they stayed on, only to find that when the eventual transfer was put through they would have been better off if they did not get the land.  This puts a millstone around their necks while at the same time the Revenue Commissioners are prosecuting them for estate duty.  This is an area that must be looked at seriously.  We must make the distinction between the man who is committed to the land, who knows no other way of life, and the person who is left a legacy of land.  We must make use of the legislation to protect, assist and help in every way possible the person who is using the land to the benefit of the economy.</P>
    <P>The farm retirement scheme came into being under the terms of a 1974 EEC Directive but since then fewer than 600 farmers have availed of the scheme and the amount of land released in this way has been only of the order of about 22,000 acres.  It is possible that even without the retirement scheme that quantity of land would have been released anyway.  We must make it easier for farmers who have toiled all their lives to transfer land that will be put to better use.  Too much of our land is under-utilised.  After all the years that these people put into farming the least we might do is give them the non-contributory old age pension.  Some of these people would have lived on a <Col N="126" /> mere pittance although making a major contribution to the economy.  They would not have drawn any social welfare or received handouts of any kind during their farming years.  In some cases there are difficulties about ownership and so on but we must strive to eliminate whatever anomalies exist in this area so as to facilitate the transfer of land and in that way improve considerably land mobility.</P>
    <P>A great number of Irish farmers are more than 65 years old.  That is a situation that we must do everything possible to change.  Farmers regard land ownership as bestowing a significant status.  They do not wish to pass on land to sons, daughters, nieces or nephews for fear of losing that status.  One can hardly blame them for this after they have spent all their lives on the land.  We must not turn them out as paupers or put them on the unemployment heap after they have contributed so much to our economy.</P>
    <P>The voluntary retirement scheme, too, has been unsuccessful.  Indeed, one might regard it as a total failure.  Of the 37 who opted for this scheme in 1980, 30 sold their farms while seven opted for the 12-year leasing scheme.</P>
    <P>In a statement to the <i>Farmers Journal</i> of 26 February last, the Minister expressed concern about the low rate of land mobility.  Open market transfers account for as little as 15 per cent in this regard and associated with that, though perhaps more important, is the fact that 57 per cent of those buying land on the open market are not full-time farmers.  I have no objection to non-farmers buying land.  We must not be too restrictive in this matter because there may be people who have tried other ways of life, who may be once or twice removed from the land, and who now wish to take up farming. It is likely that to prevent them from buying land would be unconstitutional. Therefore, that is a matter that must be taken into account in the formation of any land policy.  There is nothing wrong with the property market when it is open and free.  The way to make progress in this regard is to allow the Land Commission to buy land for cash and then to distribute it to people who are prepared to use it effectively and to the overall <Col N="127" /> benefit of the economy.  We all know that a greater level of productivity is necessary even from the land.</P>
    <P>I agree with many aspects of the Minister of State's proposals.  he tells us that the purpose of the land agency is to promote the more effective use of land. Whether we have a land agency or a Land Commission there will not be any great difference.  I would be concerned that people wishing to sell their property would have to make overtures initially to the land agency.  This would seem to me to be an infringement on a person's right within the terms of the Constitution.  A farmer wishing to sell land should be allowed to put his property on the open market.  We should not be afraid of allowing that to happen.  I am confident that the policy that the Minister has outlined will be successful but we must be prepared to pay for the land.  The same is true of any market.  If people have something to sell they are entitled to a reward for it.  The same goes for the urban Land Bill.  Both pieces of legislation are equally contentious.  What is so different between urban land, whether for use in the industrial or the housing scene, and land that becomes available for use in the agricultural sense?</P>
    <P>For a number of reasons, the long-term leasing scheme deserves consideration.  I would not wish to think that we were returning to the days of the landlord when people with money could acquire large amounts of land and let it out.  However, the land agency will have a significant role to play in the acquisition of land and in its distribution to young farmers who are better educated, better trained and who have a much deeper interest in learning the skills of farming than the older type of farmer had but these young people are not in a position to pay £1,500 or £2,000 per acre even in the event of land being available freely.  The interest rates would prohibit them from getting a worthwhile return for their investment and their effort.  Therefore, there is an obligation on the State to acquire the land in the first instance and the State must also make sufficiently attractive and worth while the farm retirement scheme. <Col N="128" /> The land agency must do whatever ground work is necessary in order to ensure that land falls into the hands of the right people.</P>
    <P>For a number of years past I have been concerned with the question of the taxation of profits on farming.  To some extent the PAYE sector are guaranteed an income.  The same can be said for business people but the position is different for many farmers.  None of us is too concerned about the farmer who is doing well and who is able to pay his taxes but over-taxation would lead only to a disincentive situation.  That fear is being expressed already.  We may have got over the initial problems of farm taxation but in this respect we must take into account a number of factors, apart from the vagaries attached to the growing of a crop from one year to another.  A crop may not be successful and there is an element of risk attached to investment in farming. In fact, that risk is greater in farming than in industry although industrialists may disagree with that notion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not.  I am questioning the point of view put forward by the Opposition.  They should learn to confine themselves to the terms of the Bill.  I will do so from now on.  The Land Commission is in need of a radical shake-up and any attempt by the Government to change its structure should be concerned with toning down its influence.  The Government should ensure that land shortly after it is purchased by the Land Commission is made available to farmers who have the capacity to use it to the full advantage.  Representations with regard to Land Commission problems have occupied a lot of my time and that has convinced me that the Government should have a serious look at the operation of that body.</P>
      <P>Late inheritance, which has been discussed, must be discouraged because it leads to a low level of resources.  It is because the social status we attach to land is so deep rooted that we find it difficult to change that.  We must be careful about it because it is highly emotive and sensitive. However, legislation must take account of the inherent problems which any movement in the ownership of land gives rise to.  We should give incentives to old people to get them to dispose of their land.  I support the Bill and I hope it will achieve what the Minister wishes. I hope that the land in the possession of the Land Commission will be distributed speedily to people who will make the most effective use of it.</P>

      <P>: I was surprised to read that the statutory limit has been increased from £105 million to £130 million for the creation of additional land bonds because the Land Commission <Col N="130" /> have purchased a small amount of land in recent years, especially in County Kerry.  I approached officials of the Land Commission recently and suggested that they purchase estates in County Kerry but I was informed that they were not purchasing any more land.  That surprised me and it is one of the reasons why I could not understand the decision to introduce this Bill.  I should like an assurance from the Minister of State that when the Bill is passed he will give permission to the Land Commission to purchase more land, particularly in County Kerry where there are many estates suitable for allotment available.  It takes the Land Commission a long time, following acquisition of an estate, to allot the land but that has been speeded up recently.  In County Kerry the Land Commission took over a number of estates six or seven years ago but they have not yet obtained vacant possession.  I have made inquiries about this matter and the Land Commission put up a number of excuses such as that they were getting legal advice but the Minister should take an interest in this and ensure that the Land Commission get vacant possession as soon as possible and allot the land to adjoining farmers.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have cut back considerably on the amount of land being acquired.  In the course of his speech the Minister said that fewer big estates were becoming available and of those that were many were not suitable for division. The most suitable estates for division consist of between 60 and 100 acres.  I do not agree with the Land Commission purchasing large estates and dividing them up between farmers from different counties. It is wrong to move farmers from their own environment.  It would be better policy for the Land Commission to purchase small estates and divide them up among farmers adjoining them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of viable holdings.  The Land Commission were one of the first bodies established and since that time a viable holding has been regarded as 47 acres.  Many people in rural Ireland would laugh at that.  The number of acres constituting a viable holding should be increased substantially <Col N="131" /> to 67 or 70 acres.  There are several reasons for this.  When an estate is being divided a farmer who has 47 acres adjoining that estate does not qualify for an allotment from the Land Commission. The failure to increase the acreage of a viable holding has denied many small farmers land to which they should have been entitled.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of the Land Commission, both in this House and elsewhere, but I feel they have done a fair job.  In my county they have given many farmers viable holdings and enabled them to improve their land. There were several years during which the Land Commission should not have purchased land.  This was the time when land was making between £3,000 and £4,000 an acre, while we were told by the Agricultural Institute that agricultural land was worth about £1,800 an acre. Many farmers and business people paid inflated prices and these are some of the farmers who are in financial difficulty today.  The Land Commission would have great difficulty in getting small farmers to let the land they purchased at that time.  Land is now being offered for sale at between £1,000 and £1,500 an acre and it is an opportune time for the Land Commission to purchase estates.  They should be encouraged to purchase as much land as possible while prices are reasonable.</P>
    <P>New legislation should be introduced to give the Land Commission additional power.  I suggest that they be enabled to make subsidised loans available to farmers to assist them to purchase small parcels of land adjoining their holdings.  This would enable many small farmers to improve their holdings substantially without waiting for the Land Commission to purchase the holding and divide it.  They should have two policies running side by side so that they can purchase land themselves as well as giving farmers the opportunity to make use of loans over, perhaps, a 30-year period.</P>
    <P>We should encourage farmers to transfer their holdings to their sons at a younger age.  In the past no duty was payable if a farmer transferred land to his son but this practice was discontinued in <Col N="132" /> the recent budget, thus removing the incentive for farmers to transfer their holdings.  Perhaps the Minister would encourage the Minister for Finance to withdraw the budget provision.</P>
    <P>I support a policy of long-term leasing. A person who has a short-term lease is not encouraged to fertilise the land but if he had a long-term lease he could plan for perhaps ten or 15 years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have done a good job in my county in dividing up commonage.  In Kerry we often have six or seven farmers grazing perhaps 100 or 200 acres of land in common.  All their cattle or sheep might be running together.  The Land Commission brought all the farmers and land owners together and agreed with them to provide the land. This afforded an opportunity to those people to improve their holdings.  The Minister should encourage the Land Commission to engage further in this activity and ensure that common land is allotted to people who have grazing right there.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission dealt in the past with much turbary land.  They allotted plots of bog to local farmers with adjoining lands.  Fuel, especially oil, has now become very expensive and in my county they are cutting as much turf now as during the war.  The Land Commission should be encouraged to buy turbary land and allot it both to small farmers and to people living in towns who also have a great interest in turbary.</P>
    <P>There is a great connection between the Land Commission and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  The Department of Forestry deal with land for planting.  It might be more suitable if the Land Commission were linked with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry rather than being linked with the Department of Agriculture.  The Land Commission and the Department of Forestry acquire land and take over land.  I believe those Departments were merged in the past.  Will the Minister of State make the money available to the local Land Commission offices in the different counties to enable them to acquire as much land as they possibly can particularly as land <Col N="133" /> is so cheap at the moment.  It can be purchased for £1,000 or £1,500 an acre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I support the Second Reading of this Bill.  I will be reasonably brief because I see little merit in repeating <i>ad nauseum</i> a lot of what my colleagues have said, particularly as I agree with what they have said.  Further, I find myself agreeing with a lot of what the Opposition have said with regard to this Bill.  Deputy McEllistrim should take a closer look at the Minister's speech.  He started off his comments by asking why did the Land Commission need £25 million more of land bonds when in his county and elsewhere they were not purchasing land at the moment and had not been for a while.  If the Deputy looks closely at what the Minister said he will see that this Bill is purely an enabling measure and if £25 million worth of bonds are not needed they will not be created. The Minister thinks this will be the top limit of what is needed in the next two years.  It is in that spirit we are discussing the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill as being necessary at this time when the Department of Agriculture and the Minister of State responsible for the Land Commission have a chance to look at the entire functioning of the Land Commission.  I am not happy and have not been for some time about what I consider to be the general impression given by the Land Commission to the people on the ground, particularly small farmers who may not be interested in their activities.  The Land Commission for some time have been surrounded with too much secrecy, too much cloak and dagger activity.  It has been too hard for the ordinary person to know exactly what is going on, to know who is actually entitled to land from the Land Commission, who qualifies, where and why.  I would like to see a much more open structure here with it laid down quite clearly and publicly who might qualify for what and where.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would be of tremendous advantage to all sides and it would put a lot more confidence back into the operations of the Land Commission.  The Land Commission have done great work over <Col N="134" /> the years but because of the furtive nature of the way they have carried this out they have been their own greatest enemy.</P>
    <P>There is one particular area where I would like to see immediate activity.  A scheme was brought in some years ago under which elderly farmers could retire if they allowed the Land Commission to take over their holdings.  This was not a success.  There are a lot of farmers, particularly in County Wexford, in small holdings which are now uneconomic.  They would gladly retire if by accepting a pension from the State they could ensure their land was taken over by one of their sons or some other member of their families. I would prefer to see the State give a pension to a man who has worked hard all his life rather than give unemployment assistance to a farmer's son on an uneconomic holding.  There needs to be a lot of investigation into this area.  Many farmers would retire immediately and young people would be put into active jobs on the land.  This would increase productivity and increase the social structure of our society whereby young people are not just automatically put on unemployment assistance in rural areas because they have nowhere else to turn.</P>
    <P>I accept that the greatest problem here is the under-use of our lands.  It occurs in some areas more than others.  It is not a major problem in County Wexford, but we have small and uneconomic holdings. I agree with the last speaker that we should raise the limit in respect of land which is considered a viable holding.  In this day 40 to 50 acres cannot be considered viable particularly in some parts of the country where it depends on the type and fertility of the land.</P>
    <P>We must immediately look at the problem of short-term leasing whereby farmers rape the land for short-term gain but at little long-term benefit to the land they are using.  You cannot blame farmers, considering the price of fertilisers and the general price of farm inputs.  It is very hard to fertilise and look after land if you are not sure how long you will have it, whether it is for 11 months, two years or some longer period.  If there were a long-term leasing system, a minimum of <Col N="135" /> three years, there would be some encouragement to the farmer leasing that land to look after it and put some input into it in return for what he might get from it. In that way when he leases land or leases again after three years or some other period, it would be in much better condition and would be fit ot produce far more than under the short-term grab and take attitude which has to prevail at the moment under our existing system.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Land Commission &mdash; I agree with speakers on both sides of the House here &mdash; getting involved in supporting groups of small farmers who are in the market for buying holdings adjoining their land.  I would like to see us move towards the system where land bonds are abolished altogether. I do not like them.  Many people in rural Ireland are afraid of them and they do not like the connotations of them. They served a purpose and were good in their day, but we are rapidly getting to the end of the road with regard to the land bond being of any use in rural Ireland.  If the Land Commission, by subsidised loans or directing farmers how they go about their operations, giving them legal advice, helping them with transfers of property, could act as an agency for small farmers trying to increase their holdings and make them a viable, that would be far more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Land Commission being completely open in how they operate.  That is the first essential.  I know the various officials and the people working for the Land Commission in rural Ireland have worked hard over the years. One wonders now, with the decline in the amount of land bought by the Land Commission over the last few years, how they can justify having the same number of people in employment in this area.  I am sure it can be justified, but because of the secret nature of the operations of the Land Commission the people on the ground cannot see what is being done and what return for money there is in the service being given.</P>
    <P>In County Wexford there is far too much land in Land Commission ownership <Col N="136" /> which has not been handed out.  I do not believe we are any different in County Wexford in this regard than other counties.  There should be a minimum time in which the Land Commission can hold on to holdings, particularly when there is an immediate need for them and there is a large number of small holdings in the area which need increased acreage to become viable.  We must watch the way the holdings are given out.  I have great confidence in the Minister and his Department in the way they will handle this.  Over the years this system has been open to criticism.  Things have been done and people have got holdings and one wonders why and how.  The question must be asked: was political allegiance held in certain quarters?  It is not good enough, when we are talking about our prime national asset, our land, if everything is not straight, open and clear-cut when it comes to distributing land.  I cannot accept that as a system which should be continued.</P>
    <P>I have covered the main points I feel particularly strongly about.  I will not repeat, for the sake of repeating, the points my colleagues on both sides of the House have made.  I support the Second Stage of the Bill in the hope that it will not be too long before we will have a complete revision of the structure of the Land Commission and before land bonds will have reached the end of their day.</P>
    <P>I urge the Land Commission and those responsible for the operation of their policies to be more sensitive in their dealings with smallholders.  I will give one example.  A family were put at risk and a marriage broken in the last year or so in County Wexford because of compulsory acquisition of 35 acres.  The man who owned the 35 acres married into another small property, a 45 to 50-acre farm.  He married and went to live in his wife's home place and he was 20 miles from his own 35 acres.  That out-farm, his original farm holding, is being acquired by the Land Commission compulsorily.  He is beng forced to accept land bonds.  They are people who are not well off, who have a very small holding.  Land bonds are absolutely useless to them for the future. He would gladly accede to the Land <Col N="137" /> Commission's wishes if they would pay him money at reasonable market value for his property.</P>
    <P>I accept that cannot be done under the present structure.  Because he married into his wife's place he is almost blaming her, in a paranoid way, because of worry about the future, having to sell up his own place.  That is but one example of the lack of sensitivity in the dealings of the Land Commission with people on the ground.  I urge the Minister to consider opening the books of the Land Commission so that there would be an open structure and everybody would know what is happening and why it is happening.  If we can move to such a situation in the next few years we will have done a good day's work in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome the provisions of the Bill which propose to provide for an increase in the number of bonds to be made available by the Government and the Land Commission.  However, we should be moving away from the bond system.  Even though the return from bonds is very good, farmers who sell their land have a fear of land bonds because of uncertainty about future markets.  Naturally they would prefer cash.  They would opt for it in preference to bonds at any time, no matter what the land bond market prospects are.</P>
      <P>Tied up with all this is the decision not to provide as much money as heretofore for the Land Commission to enable them to acquire land in areas of serious congestion. Also tied up with it is the decision of the Government to abolish the EEC Farm Retirement Scheme this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we know, that was a very successful scheme in many parts of the country, particularly in South Kerry.  It was only in recent times, as its importance and significance and its value became known, that it was availed of by farmers of more than 55 years of age who wished to sell land.  I know quite a number of cases in which such farmers sold land to the Land Commission for market value.  They were paid in cash under the EEC scheme and they got gratuities and pensions for life. It was becoming a very popular scheme and I am disappointed the Government <Col N="138" /> decided not to continue it.  I should be obliged if the Minister would state in his reply what percentage of the purchase price of these holdings was coming from the EEC.</P>
    <P>Now that the Land Commission's operations are grinding to a halt as a result of the reduction in the amount of cash being made available to them and the fact that the EEC scheme has been abolished, the Land Commission should become involved in many other activities pending the provision of a proper financial structure in relation to land purchase and division.  I should like to see them involved in the acquisition, division and allotment of turbary.  In many counties, particularly Kerry, there is a great demand for turf.  There are large turbaries in certain areas which the Land Commission should be and are quite capable of moving into, acquiring them and dividing and allotting them to householders. This should be undertaken at an early date so that the bogs could be allotted before the coming summer.</P>
    <P>Deputy McEllistrim referred to the division of commonages.  I am particularly interested in this because there are many commonages in south Kerry which should be divided.  I know of a number of applications before the Land Commission for some time.  It appears to me that one objector can hold up division of a commonage no matter how justified the case for division may be.  Is this right, and what is the legal position?  It appears to be most unfair if one person can hold up the division of a commonage, no matter how small or large it is.  Particularly in relation to sheep farming, commonages must be divided and fenced off properly to enable sheep farmers to provide for the proper management and care of their flocks.</P>
    <P>I suggest that more details should be revealed regarding the Land Commission's system of adjusted acres in connection with the activities in land division and assessing farmer applicants for land.  I am anxious that such details should be revealed because I believe the system of adjusted acres could be taken into account and substituted for the PLV system which was thrown out the window <Col N="139" /> following the High Court case of the Wexford farmers and which will have a very serious impact this year and next year on smallholders in the western counties, particularly the south-west.  I think the Land Commission's adjusted acres system, if the details were revealed and we got to know how it operated, could be used as an instrument to substitute for PLV.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Land Commission should provide some scheme which would enable them to act for and on behalf of groups of farmers in the purchase of substantial holdings when they come on the market.  I visualise such a scheme for smallholders who decide to put up the capital, but to get the Land Commission to buy the land as agents.  Before committing the Land Commission to buying the holding, the smallholders would have committed themselves to a division of the holding so that there would not be any misunderstanding after the purchase. This would be a worth-while scheme. Smallholders living in the vicinity of a farm which is for sale may be in a position to buy it as a group, but they have not got the proper procedure or machinery to make the purchase.  The Land Commission should examine this proposal.</P>
    <P>They should compile and maintain in each county a register of smallholders who are interested in and qualify for additional land.  With a shortage of cash and financial resources, the Land Commission staff could be usefully employed in compiling such a register.  It would be of tremendous assistance to them when a substantial farm comes up for sale.  It would be easy to keep the register updated.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Land Commission must be clearly associated with the development of agriculture.  That is why I am surprised at the decision taken by the Government to drop the EEC farm retirement scheme.  Congestion is as serious a problem as ever despite the Land Acts and all the activities of the Land Commission.  Congestion is as serious as ever in the west and the south-west including county Kerry.  It is not good <Col N="140" /> enough to bring in Bills from time to time permitting the Government to increase the amount of money available in bonds for land acquisition.  Far-reaching imaginative and radical plans and policies should be prepared to relieve congestion in the west and south west.</P>
    <P>Smallholders have achieved peak production but their units are too small to allow sufficient net profit to be made to enable the landowners to rear and educate their families without taking off-farm employment, which is not desirable from many points of view.  It is not desirable because the smallholder occupies a position which could be taken up by a landless person.  It is not desirable that a landowner should spend his day away from his holding.  So long as we have congestion and so long as we have smallholders who have reached peak production and must get off-farm employment, it will be necessary to provide more and more finance for the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Special aid should be made available to small farmers who acquired Land Commission land at a very high uneconomic rent.  These lands were purchased by the Land Commission when land was making over £3,000 an acre.  Repayments to the Land Commission impose a severe hardship on farmers who were allotted land.  Special financial aid should be made available to them to bring the rents back to an economic level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling referred to political influence in the decision-making process of the Land Commission with regard to acquisition and distribution of land.  I have never come across this in my experience in public life over the past 16 years.  Cases are being made daily on behalf of people who are seeking land and I am not so naive that I do not know such representations are taken into consideration in competition with other applications.  I have always found the Land Commission officials at all levels impartial and courteous in carrying out their duties.</P>
    <P>More money should be made available to the Land Commission as a matter of urgency.  There is growing despondency among smallholders as they see larger farmers going from strength to strength <Col N="141" /> while they have reached a peak which does not enable them to rear and educate their families.  There should be a sense of urgency about providing more money for the Land Commission.  I am surprised and disappointed that the EEC farm retirement scheme was abolished by the Government.  I ask the Minister of State to use his influence with the Minister and the Government to have this scheme reintroduced.  It was working well and it was just taking off when it was abolished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>: My first duty is to welcome the Minister of State.  I know his heart is in the land and with the small farmers.  I am sure his efforts will continue until the Land Commission has been improved.  To say that a change in the operations of the Land Commission is needed is the under-statement of the day.  For a good number of years the Irish Land Commission has been redundant, so to speak.  I often wonder whether there is a misunderstanding between the Land Commission and the land owners.  The vast majority of land owners would prefer to see anybody approaching their homes rather than a land inspector or anybody associated with the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since land was first divided farmers have felt that when the inspector from the Land Commission was near their farm the land would be taken from them. I should like to see the day when the inspector could approach the home of a farmer knowing he would receive the same welcome as would be given to a cattle buyer.  Until we have that situation there will always be a certain reserve and doubt about the system.  When a farmer wants to sell his property he does so quietly.  It has often happened that people who buy land are not in the same category as a number of people in the area who could use it.  Much of the situation that exists at the moment is due to land bonds.  Despite the fact that recently interest on bonds has held, there is the fear in some people when they receive land bonds that they receive only paper with no guarantee that they will be paid for their land.  This can be a severe disadvantage to a man with a family and it <Col N="142" /> is hard to blame people who have certain doubts about land bonds.</P>
    <P>There is too much delay in the division of land and I do not understand the reason.  It will be said that the Land Commission will have to get some of their money back before they divide land but the farmers concerned suffer much anxiety and frustration because of delay in the division of land.  Deputy O'Leary or some other speaker spoke about political pressure.  There is no doubt that much anxiety is caused to people who wish to get extra acreage.  When land is set for grazing, farmers outbid one another because they believe if they have some of the land for 11 months they will get priority in the event of land division and very often they pay out large sums of money for grazing.  They buy and keep stock because they want to give the impression to the inspector that they are good farmers. When a farm is taken over it should be divided as soon as possible.  A delay of nine or ten years will mean that many of the people who qualified initially are now too old and have not the same incentive to work the extra land.</P>
    <P>I am not too happy about the one-mile limit.  That might have been all right 25 years ago when it would take a man three hours to travel a few miles by horse and cart.  Nowadays a farmer will use his jeep or car and will arrive at his destination in a very short time.  It would be much better to extend the limit to four or five miles at least.  The landless man should also be considered in the event of land division. I have in mind a person living in a cottage who is anxious to keep five or six cows. Such a person will probably have taken grazing but he will not be considered by the Land Commission because he is a landless man.  There is what is known as an accommodation holding comprising five or six acres but that is of no use today.  The landless man should be given priority and if he is given the opportunity he will probably prove to be a very efficient farmer.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is the amount of acreage necessary so far as viability is concerned.  If one makes representations to the Land Commission on behalf of somebody one may be told he already <Col N="143" /> has 45 acres.  However, according to the EEC view 45 acres can no longer be regarded as a viable holding.  That figure should be doubled and then we would have fewer sales and transfers.  There would be a greater incentive for sons to remain on the farm rather than going to, say, Alcan or some other industry at Shannon or throughout the country.  The position at the moment is that the farm income is not sufficient to keep sons on the farm.  Naturally when they get a taste of the bigger money outside and when they follow the city lights they are not inclined to return to the farm.  There should be an incentive to keep sons on the farm to work with their father.  At a time of high unemployment, we must do everything possible to ensure that boys and girls can remain on the family farm until they marry and go to another farm.</P>
    <P>When land is divided and the rent is assessed, for the first few years that rent may be far in excess of a farmer's means. There should be some scheme, something on the lines of the Housing Finance Agency, to assist people in the first five years.  The period could be extended at the other end and this would be helpful. We should have some scheme to help young farmers, by way of subsidy, for the first five years.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to providing a pension for farmers.  I was glad, therefore, to read in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> that the Minister of State referred to the fact that social welfare should be extended in that field.  They should be encouraged to hand their land over to their sons when they are still young.  No progress has been made in this regard over the past ten years and I hope, within the next five years, that the Land Commission, in their new form, will give the service to the farmers which was originally intended.</P>

      <P>: I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the many Deputies who have contributed to this debate.  We had a very wide-ranging discussion on all aspects of land commission activity and future land policy and I have taken very careful note of <Col N="144" /> everything that has been said.  I would like to congratulate Deputy Noonan on his appointment as spokesman for agriculture. They could hardly have picked a better or more suitable person.  He and I have long associations with the same farming organisation and he has added his own page of history to agriculture over the years.  I am sure he will continue to do so.  I should also like to congratulate Deputy Byrne and Deputy Kitt.</P>
      <P>This is basically an enabling Bill and the fact that we are increasing the amount of land bonds from £105 million to £130 million, does not necessarily mean that there would be an uptake of that kind in any one year.  The amount to be spent in any year is entirely at the discretion of the Minister for Finance.  We have about 7,000 hectares of land in the pipeline at present and a fair proportion of the money we are speaking about will go towards paying for them.</P>
      <P>Many important points have emerged from this debate.  When we speak about the Land Commission we are talking about an agency that has achieved much over the years.  However, what was good for agriculture 30, 40, or 50 years ago might not necessarily have the same effect today.  In the last nine or ten years I would have preferred to see the Land Commission change in line with the problems we have today.  There have been detailed contributions by many of the speakers because most Deputies realise that it is time for the direction of the Land Commission to be changed.  I came into this Department with an open mind and I have been very involved over the years with all aspects of Land Commission policy.  As many speakers have pointed out, it does not make much difference what the new body is called but the time has come for the Land Commission to adopt the role of a development agency.  This is a very important part of agriculture, even more important than the FDS and the advisory service.  They are all correlated in so far as the development of farms is concerned.</P>

    <P>Several speakers mentioned that the old image of the land commissioner will have to be changed because he is now coming for different reasons than heretofore. <Col N="145" /> I hope the Land Commission will have a policy of development, growth and integration with other aspects of agriculture which, in the heel of the hunt, will give farmers a better standard of living.</P>
    <P>One of the first tests I was given when I came to my Department was to look at land policy.  I am delighted to say that many aspects are now being looked at very comprehensively.  This review is well under way and no single element or factor will cure our problems.  That will only be done by a multiplicity of lines of thought. That is why all land policy over the years has been very difficult to articulate and to legislate for.  I firmly believe we have reached a period where there is clamour for change.  There is too much land lying under-utilised and, with scarce native resources, we cannot allow that situation to continue.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to increase the land bond limited by £25 million.  Many Deputies were wondering how that money would be spent.  Rural Deputies will understand that there is a big time-lag between the time a section 40 order is served and the time the land bonds are issued.  It can be a fairly long period so it is very difficult to say exactly how much of that increase in the land bond allocation is required.  However, I said in my opening speech that the acquisition programme must be curtailed.  Despite what some Deputies have said, that the time is now opportune for the Land Commission to buy more land because of the market value, most people will understand that land which is purchased at £1,200 or £1,500 per acre represents a huge loss in its resale to the Exchequer.  If a subsidy was not paid by the Government on land purchased at £1,500 per acre, farmers would be asked to pay £160, £180 or £200 per acre per year annuity.  I do not have to tell the House that no farm could pay that and still make a profit.  Therefore, we have to subsidise the resale of land purchase generally.  When we have problems with our budget, it is unreasonable to assume that any Government can keep on acquiring land under the same acquisition procedure that we had in the past.</P>
    <P>However, the acquisition powers that <Col N="146" /> the Land Commission have are important in the context of some of the ideas that I have for the Land Commission.  As times change attitudes change and now there must be great hope for the concept of a combined purchasing arrangement between local farmers.  One problem over the years has been that when the Land Commission acquired land, for various reasons well known to the House that land was not divided for four, five, or even ten years, and when it was divided, because of the Act it was divided for the relief of congestion and not specifically related to the congest who was best able to use it.  Over the years people have got land from the Land Commission and worked extremely well with it, increased the output and had a better standard of living.  However, many people who got land, because of lack of education, resources and so on were not able to make the mark that was necessary and some of that land remains under-utilised even to this day.</P>
    <P>We should at all costs take note of the special circumstances of small farmers. Being one myself I am not likely to lose that idea.  Group purchase is a scheme whereby a number of farmers in a townland would come together &mdash; as under for instance the group water schemes, a concept that is well known in rural Ireland &mdash; and in close liaison with the Land Commission would decide to purchase on the open market.  I want to ensure that no matter what Land Act is passed we will always have the concept of free sale. It is near and dear to us and is enshrined in the Constitution.  In case anybody might have any anxiety about the whole question of controlled sales I want to go on record in this House this evening as stating that I wish to ensure that we will always have free sale.  However, that does not necessarily mean that there might not have to be curbs on certain types of purchasers.  Group purchase should work on the basis that, first of all, only people who are very interested in getting additional land, and who incidentally might well have to borrow the money, are the people most likely to want to work the land to a plan drawn up by their ACOT adviser and so on.  As well <Col N="147" /> as that, it would overcome the problem of the land bank being created by the Land Commission because on the morning after the sale, all things being equal, the people in this group purchase will be able to go in and start to farm that land. This type of scheme has a great role to play particularly in the small farming areas, and I will be asking my officials around the country to look closely at this and give every facility to any group who apply to them.  Our officials in the Land Commission are a reservoir of knowledge on matters relating to sub-division of holdings and we will be only too delighted to make that knowledge available to small farmers who come together on a joint purchase.</P>
    <P>However, some additional measures must be taken and these are under consideration also at the moment.  I suppose the chief of those measures would be that the Land Commission should have the power to control the sale of land through legal and fiscal means to ensure that small farmers get priority.  It is a well-known fact that certain persons who had fairly large salaries, such as businessmen, professional people or indeed foreigners for that matter, were able to buy land that was badly needed for small farmers in various counties.  We must legislate to ensure that that will be cut to a minimum, and various schemes have been suggested over the years to effect that.  At the moment we are looking very closely at methods by which we could achieve that purpose.  This could be done in a number of ways.  The acquisition powers that we have might be used to some degree or there might be a question of an overall surcharge on certain types of purchasers who in the view of this House should not have top priority as regards that land. Those are the kind of things that we are looking at at the moment and I tell this House that the Government are committed to a land reform policy.</P>
    <P>Another very important aspect of any land reform policy and any policy aimed at getting greater land mobility must be land leasing.  This is a slogan that has been bandied around a great deal since we joined the EEC in the early seventies <Col N="148" /> but for one reason or another it has really not got off the ground.  First of all, we were speaking of the farm retirement pension scheme and the 12-year lease.  I suggest that a 12-year lease might not be the best starting position.  It might well be that to many elderly Irish farmers 12 years would seem quite a long time and they may feel that they would be at the end of their life-span by the time the 12 years would be up.  However, I am encouraged by a number of items I have seen in the past year or 18 months that would lead me to believe that there is a great future for a certain type of land leasing.  I might refer to one or two of them, for instance the land bank at the sugar factory in Tuam where a farm is leased on a three-year basis.  In most counties in Ireland the predominant method of leasing is the 11-months system and for anybody who has any interest in Irish agriculture you could hardly have a worse system.  It has been adequately mentioned on a number of occasions here today that an 11-months land leasing will not increase productivity to any great degree.  The step from 11 months to three years, to five years to seven years is a step in the right direction.  I must pay a compliment at this stage to a number of bodies who have gone to great lengths to prepare a certain type of lease which could be referred to as a master lease. The ICOS are to the fore and together with the IFA, the Incorporated Law Society and others are trying to ensure that we have the type of lease that will stand the test of all courts.  At the moment I am studying a lease that would appear to meet the demands of the day and that at the same time from a constitutional point of view will stand the test. Of course, the acid test is that the person who is renting the land at the end of his seven-year lease would just pull up his plough and get out through the gate, and that the owner would get his land back with no strings attached.  From what I have seen already I am satisfied that this is possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to land leasing, it is important that our Land Commission give an undertaking not to cast their eyes on land which has gone through this process, with <Col N="149" /> a view to its acquisition.  There is a real fear among all farmers that land let for any period of time might be sought by the Land Commission, but this fear is ill-founded.  It is important to ensure that as many acres as possible are got into full production.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have spoken in this debate on the question of the Farm Retirement Scheme.  Deputy O'Leary was the only speaker who considered it a success, most Deputies saying, as everybody knows, that it is not working.  It is only partly correct to say that this scheme has been completely suspended.  Part of this scheme is suspended, but if any retiring farmer wants to take part in the scheme he is entitled to do so and will get a pension and a premium, provided he sells his land to a developing farmer.  I want that explanation put on the record of this House.  However, that is only part of the story.  An imaginative and workable farm retirement pension scheme is vitally necessary.  I have long held the view that elderly folk should be encouraged, with no compulsion whatever, to see where their own best interests lie.  We must devise a retirement scheme which is acceptable, individually and socially. One of our difficulties is the great attachment, particularly on the part of old farmers, to the land as a status symbol, giving them an air of respectability and independence as the actual registered owner of the holding.</P>

      <P>: The farmers might not all be as progressive as those in Wexford. With a little extra imagination and with help from Brussels, an acceptable farm retirement pension scheme can be worked out.  I have noted what many Deputies said about the in-built desire in most rural people to receive the old age pension when they attain the applicable age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>: And a medical card and free travel.  The farm retirement scheme looked very good ten years ago <Col N="150" /> and the Ceann Comhairle was involved with it in 1972 or 1973, but it never succeeded to any great extent and has no future.  Certain guarantees may have to be given which might not cost the State too much &mdash; the small things of life.  This could create an administrative problem, but we would have to solve that.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies mentioned the problem of commonages &mdash; their division or non-division.  This is becoming a huge problem which successive Governments, Ministers and Deputies have discussed for years.  Deputy O'Leary mentioned several cases in County Kerry where five or six farmers were in agreement to a division of the commonage and there was one objector.  Because of this objector the division could not proceed.  One could take legal proceedings, but these are very cumbersome and, because of that, people do not use them.  I have noted the problem and have asked the legal people in my Department to have a serious look at it.  I am not a legal man, but I passionately believe that greater good of the community must have priority. If six people out of seven are in agreement, it would make very good law to allow 75 per cent of all participants to bring about the division of the commonage and we should have an easier system for allowing that to happen.  In the underdeveloped and severely handicapped areas, this is a great obstacle to production. In the not too distant future I hope to find means of strengthening the law with a view to solving this problem once and for all.  Under the western development programme there is great scope for a great emphasis on the division of commonages in the north-west.  For the first time this programme can be accelerated and, with a strengthening of the law, we will be on the right track.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One very important aspect to be considered in future legislation concerning the Land Commission is the extent of land rearrangement.  Nobody is more suitably qualified to help farmers with rearrangement propositions than the local inspector of the Land Commission office.  Many farmers have land in five, six, or seven places and one can imagine the time lost in working between these <Col N="151" /> and the amount of fencing to be done &mdash; and the bad neighbourliness which can result from this fencing.  There is need for a national land rearrangement policy and I shall be taking the matter to Brussels in the next few months to see if the authorities there will look favourably on the financing of such a policy.  Its absence is a barrier to production.  These improvements will bring a new air of optimism to Irish farming, will help to boost production and bring an improved standard of living to more Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>Finally, I found the debate most encouraging from the point of view that the majority of Deputies see the need for change.  Anything connected with land structuring and land reform policy must be well thought out.  The surveys carried out, the papers written and the seminars held over the years have given us sufficient information to put forward a meaningful and imaginative policy.</P>
    <P>I congratulate and thank most sincerely all the Deputies who contributed to this debate and hope that in the future we will have legislation in this House which will do what most Deputies would like the new Land Commission to do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the results of this budget and of its financial and economic strategy will determine the welfare of this small nation and our people for many years to come. We are at a critical time in the history of this country.  We are faced with appalling, frightening and unprecendented problems &mdash; economic, social and financial. We have the frightening spectre of daily <Col N="153" /> mounting unemployment, of factory closures, and of a balance of payments situation which is getting out of hand.  Every penny accruing from the PAYE sector is going to service our foreign debt.</P>
    <P>There is little or no opportunity here for the many thousands of young people leaving our educational institutions.  We have the youngest population in western Europe but because of better educational opportunities over the last two decades we have young people with training skills, expertise and know-how which their counterparts of previous generations did not have.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about this being a harsh budget which has hit certain sectors of the community very severely.  This budget is the price the people have to pay for the appalling mismanagement, squandermania and lack of enterprise and initiative displayed by those in Government since 1977.  The period between 1977 and 1982, by any independent analysis or assessment, will be rated the most disastrous in our history.  We had massive foreign borrowing, doubling and trebling each year and at the same time we had nothing to show for this money. Borrowing by an individual, a company or a Government is justified if the money is invested and put to productive use. This massive borrowing since 1977 has left this country in a dire mess.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Government when formulating this budget gave effect to the truth we spelled out to the electorate last November.  The people knew the country was in a dire financial mess and that some semblance of order had to be restored to the national finances.  We spelled out clearly and unequivocally that unpopular measures would have to be taken and that a harsh budget would have to be introduced.  We said there was no soft option, no magic formula to solve our economic and social problems overnight.</P>
    <P>We have a courageous and determined Government who are not afraid to take unpopular measures and who are committed to cleaning up the mess that they inherited from the previous Administration. This Government have inherited <Col N="154" /> a situation of a magnitude and a gravity that no Government in the history of the State has had to face and the budget is the price that the people must pay for the con job perpetrated on them by Fianna Fáil in their election manifesto of 1977.  At that time Fianna Fáil tried to give the impression that everything would be free, but we know now only too well how high is the price of the promises made then.  Because of that recklessness on the part of Fianna Fáil this country was plunged into massive borrowing for which the taxpayers are now suffering.</P>
    <P>This has been a harsh budget right across the board, but the people appreciate the reasons for it.  They realise that belts must be tightened if we are to see any light at the end of this very dark tunnel.  General reaction to the budget can be summarised by what was said to me a couple of weeks ago by a constituent. This man has four teenage children and he told me that he does not mind a certain amount of belt tightening and of having to pay more tax if it means a future for his children in their own country.</P>
    <P>While it is fundamentally necessary to restore some semblance of order to our chaotic financial position, the Government must bear in mind that a budget must have twin objectives.  Apart from the question of financial strategy, a budget is the major instrument of a Government's economic strategy.  In analysing this budget we must consider it against the background of the mess the Government inherited and then in terms of the economic and social problems facing us.  I am satisfied that the basic fiscal management policies as outlined in the budget are correct.  One hears many arguments about the various measures that have been taken.  It can be said that there are certain areas in which the impact may be too severe, but overall I am satisfied that the Government have started on the right road especially in relation to straightening out our financial situation.</P>
    <P>There is much concern that the Government may have concentrated too much on purely a book-balancing exercise. We must remember that to place too much emphasis on accountancy procedures <Col N="155" /> may be to create further unemployment and economic depression.  This is the criticism that has been levelled against this budget by many commentators. However, I am satisfied that in formulating the budget the Government had in mind to a great extent the whole employment situation.  They realise that the introduction of the necessary national financial discipline will make possible a new dynamic economic recovery which will enable us to have a sound employment-creation strategy.  It is very important, not only for the youth of our country but for our whole economic survival, that the galloping rate of unemployment be halted.  Our efforts in this direction are affected by factors outside our control &mdash; for instance, the world economic recession and the various increases in energy costs.  Our farmers, manufacturers and exporters have had to contend with these very difficult circumstances but this major problem of unemployment must be the concern, not only of every Deputy here but of every individual in the country.</P>
    <P>From discussions I have had with a wide section of people, people of different political persuasions and so on, I realise how frightened people are because of the unemployment situation. In the past many of our young people left school on the completion of first-level education but we now have coming on to the labour market people who are well educated and in many instances highly skilled but for whom there are no job opportunities.  I have noticed a frightening change in the situation in the past decade.  In normal circumstances the education, the skills and the expertise that is coming on-stream would be of the utmost value to the development of our country but there are not the opportunities in present circumstances for the utilisation of this knowledge and of these skills.</P>
    <P>We must tackle this problem.  It is the most vital problem facing us today.  Most other countries, too, have unemployment problems.  The European Parliament has discussed the situation but very little progress has been made in formulating <Col N="156" /> new policies and strategies.  It had been suggested that short-term measures might be adopted to help resolve the problem.  At a time of recession there is a great temptation for any Government to concentrate on the short-term in seeking a solution to unemployment.  Many suggestions have been put forward to deal with this matter including the introduction of a shorter working week, controls on overtime, early retirement and job-sharing.  The introduction of any of those measures will have an impact on employment creation in the short-term.</P>
    <P>We must spell out clearly that material living standards and employment prospects depend entirely on the quantity and value of the goods we export or sell on the home market.  We must develop our economy and produce the goods which will obtain for us the wealth necessary to create employment.  That is our real formula for development.  There is no shortcut solution to our unemployment problem. We must carefully assess our resources and their potential, particularly our land, fisheries and tourism.  Another short-term solution has been propounded by a colleague of mine, Deputy Kelly, and I regret that I must differ from him in public.  Deputy Kelly suggested that emigration might be the answer to our unemployment problem.  Emigration has been our greatest scourge prior to and since the foundation of the State.  It was easy for people to emigrate to the United States and the UK before because there was no language barrier and jobs were available.  For that reason successive Governments did not have to tackle the problem of creating full employment for a growing population.  The so-called safety valve of emigration was the easy way out.  Although we are in difficult recessionary times it is unrealistic and strategically wrong to suggest that the only future for our young people is the emigrant ship.  I reject that.  I have fought all my life to prevent emigration and I will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>While short-term measures such as job-sharing and a shorter working week may prove helpful, we should plan for the elimination of the problem in the long-term.  I accept that some successful <Col N="157" /> experiments were carried out in Aer Rianta in job-sharing and staggered working hours, but we must plan for the future.  I hope that the strategy behind the budget is to create new thinking to pave the way for a new national economic development programme and a job creation programme.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that the State agencies which in the past made a notable contribution to job creation &mdash; I am thinking of the IDA and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company &mdash; are not succeeding in their strategy to attract foreign industrialists.  The real problem we face in relation to job creation is that the flow of foreign industrial investment has slowed to a trickle.  The countries from which those industrialists came, such as the US, West Germany and Holland, are all experiencing economic difficulties. Those countries have to deal with unemployment, redundancies and massive upheavals in traditional industries such as steel and textiles.  In the immediate future we cannot look forward to a resumption of a flow of new industries from those countries.</P>
    <P>We also have the appalling problem for an agricultural country that our indigenous industries, particularly our food processing industry, which have existed for more than 100 years are folding up. In my constituency we have lost Ranks flour mills and the Erin Foods subsidiary company, Matterson's, is facing closure. Golden Vale Engineering, a company catering for the finest agricultural region in Europe, the Golden Vale, is also in difficulty and 157 jobs were lost there ten days ago.  Fastnet Foods in west Cork has gone and the Erin Foods subsidiary in Midleton and the sugar factory in Tuam are in difficulty.</P>
    <P>The latest information I have from a reliable source is that there are 300 factories in trouble at present, only marginally surviving.  In 1980 a total of 89 factories closed and that figure rose to 94 in 1981.  I understand that the figure for 1982 will be between 90 and 100.  Where do we go from here?  There has been a slow-down in the amount of foreign investment and the IDA are facing enormous competition in their efforts to <Col N="158" /> attract foreign industrialists from the UK, European countries and Third World countries.  What are the prospects? How will the budget help to deal with the problem?  Will it save the remaining indigenous food processing industries?  When the history of the State is written one thing that will be highlighted will be that as a country with the finest agricultural land in Western Europe and blessed with climatic conditions conducive to agricultural production we have permitted our food processing industry to fail.  We are importing food products to the tune of £800 million per annum and I understand that we even import such ordinary vegetables as carrots and peas to the tune of £40 million. I have been informed that potatoes produced in Norway are being sold here.  We must face those blunt and harsh facts. Since I was elected to this House I have referred to those problems in the course of each budget debate.  Our greatest failure is that we have not realised the potential of our greatest resource, our land. The proof of that is that in the Shannon Industrial Estate, of which I am very proud and where many thousands of my constituents earn their living, there is not an industry processing the produce of the rich hinterland.</P>
    <P>We must tackle the unemployment problem.  During the past 20 years we concentrated on encouraging foreign investment and the IDA did a great job. When I was appointed Minister for the Gaeltacht in 1973 I was told it was impossible to bring industry to the Aran Islands, Connemara, west Mayo or Donegal because nothing was conducive to the development of industry there.  However, when we examined the problem we realised the huge resources of the sea coast.  We discovered that fish was not being canned anywhere and that all canned fish was imported.  Some enterprising people in Burtonport had the idea of establishing a cannery there in 1975.  I was responsible for sanctioning the investment for almost £0.75 million of State funds in that enterprise and it has been enormously successful.  It resulted in import substitution, of which we now <Col N="159" /> hear so much, and also generated new exports.</P>
    <P>This country is cursed with theorists and we find many economists putting forward ideas and engaging in academic discussions on radio and television.  Most of them never created a single job and would not know how to do so.  We must examine the areas of potential.  We must develop a dynamic national policy for agriculture which could create 100,000 new jobs over the next five years in both food processing and agriculture.  We must ensure the maximum added value before our products are exported.</P>
    <P>The failure to develop our fishing industry is the greatest national scandal since we got our freedom in this part of Ireland.  The fishing industry is producing only a fraction of 1 per cent of its potential. One sees in continental ports truck loads of finished products with the maximum added value being taken to markets in Paris and other large centres.</P>
    <P>Our tourist industry also has great potential but we need a completely new policy.  The amount of money expended annually by Irish tourists going abroad is now equivalent to earnings from tourists coming here.  The question of cost competitiveness is crucial.</P>
    <P>We need a dynamic new policy to encourage the development of indigenous industry, with agriculture offering the greatest number of possibilities.  We have enormous resources in agriculture, as well as great expertise and first-class advisory service.  We have farmers who will respond if given the opportunity of working in the framework of a long-term development policy.  Unfortunately, when they responded in the past there was usually some change in policy.  We must now restore the confidence of farmers.</P>
    <P>We should make the maximum investment in research and development of food technology.  There are many internationally recognised scientists in our food technology sector.  We must also utilise the potential of the co-operative movement which has been so successful in the dairy sector.  I see no hope of generating the necessary degree of new <Col N="160" /> employment except through the development of our resources.  Our cost competitiveness has been eroded to a frightening degree.  This is shown very clearly in the most recent OECD and EEC publications, as well as documents produced by the NBST and the CII.</P>
    <P>There is scope for the expansion of exports.  It has become fashionable to say that because of the international recession the possibility of generating exports is very limited.  I reject that.  In 1982 Ireland's share of foreign trade was 0.492 per cent of world trade.  To increase that by a fraction of a percentage point would make an enormous difference and it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned with the effects on the hotel and tourist industry of the increase in VAT.  Some way will have to be found to ensure that the tourist industry is enabled to ride out present difficulties.</P>
    <P>As well as cost competitiveness, which is related to unit costs and wage costs, there is scope for improvement in the design, packaging and marketing of products.  There is also scope for the development of identifiably  Irish products which will be associated with this country in the same way as watchmaking is associated with Switzerland. There is need for brand image development particularly in the food processing area.</P>
    <P>There must be much closer contact between our academic institutions, particularly our third level institutions, universities and colleges of technology. There must be much closer inter-relationship between scientists, technologists, engineers, pharmacists and so forth in those universities and manufacturing industry and with research and development. It is worth recalling that very often when some person invents something new he is laughed at.  I recall Professor Timoney, who came to me in 1974 and said he had designed a new armoured carrier, was laughed at.  However, he decided to locate a factory in the Meath Gaeltacht and he was assisted.  I understand this has been a highly successful industry and some of those vehicles have <Col N="161" /> been exported to European countries. There is need for research and development and the encouragement of entrepreneurship. In the National Institute for Higher Education there is a great example of what can be done by a much better inter-relationship between the academic institutions, the practical manufacturing, research and development.  The close relationship between the National Institute for Higher Education at Limerick and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company has led to the creation of a considerable number of small industries in that region.  Because of the availability of the faculties and the expertise of the NIHE, particularly in the field of electronics, the mid-west region has been able to attract major international firms to locate there.</P>
    <P>All the resources available to us must be directed towards tackling the enormous problem of unemployment and job creation.  This must be the basic objective of national policy.  We must face up to the challenge of creating employment for the youngest labour force and the youngest population in western Europe.  Let us not talk about the safety valves, the soft options and other things like that.  We must tackle this problem.  If the resources and the expertise of the IDA, the Shannon Development Company, the Agricultural Institute, ACOT and the universities can be channelled into a coherent development policy directed to agriculture, food processing, fishery development, fish processing with the ultimate aim of having the maximum value put to the basic raw materials in the country, we can develop exports.</P>
    <P>There is enormous goodwill for this country, particularly in Europe.  That is the one thing all my colleagues, irrespective of party, have found.  There is potential for penetrating the markets particularly for good quality food products, fish products, and there is enormous potential for developing tourism in Europe.  I believe Europe offers the best possibility for tourist development.  I believe the Telesis Report, an examination and analysis of the Industrial Development Authority, clearly highlighted the areas I have been referring to, such as food <Col N="162" /> processing, agriculture and fishing.  There is need for a reorientation of the whole economic strategy into those areas to develop our natural resources.  I am convinced the IDA can do it.</P>
    <P>If we continue with the present strategy I believe we will not have any results.  I hope the financial strategy which has formed the basis of the budget will succeed in laying the foundation for a new radical, enlightened, innovative and enterprising national economic development policy directed to the real resources of the country where the potential for job creation is greatest.  If the budget can achieve the twin objectives of securing financial rectitude and job creation it will have succeeded.  The acid test of success or failure of any budget is its success or failure in generating new economic activity and job creation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>: The budget debate will soon draw to a conclusion.  Thousands of words have been spoken in this Chamber over the past few weeks for or against the budget.  I am not one to criticise if I think what is being done is fair and right.  I do not criticise just for the sake of criticising. I try to see the other person's point of view, I try to put myself in that person's situation and if I think that person is making a fair, right and good decision I am the first to agree with that person.</P>
      <P>When I look at the end result of this budget I can only see it causing more unemployment, higher prices, and destroying the construction industry. Two of the main things the Minister in his budget speech suggested he was trying to do were to minimise the effects of recession and of the necessary adjustment policies on the low-paid and on those on low incomes generally and to achieve the necessary moderation in pay policy so that we can reverse the decline in competitiveness which so endangers our employment levels.  I cannot understand how he can possibly think the budget will achieve those two objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the most savage and stupid budget I have ever witnessed.  It is only in the next few weeks that the people whom it will affect will begin to realise how badly it will affect them.  It will create <Col N="163" /> a vicious circle we will not be able to get out of.  It will create more unemployment, increased prices and will cause people who are unemployed at the moment to have less money.  Everyone will have less income and therefore will be buying fewer goods.  That in turn means job losses.  Sales of all commodities will drop.  Where do we go from there?</P>
    <P>There are many problems, the biggest of which is the plight of the unemployed, but not one word was uttered in the Minister's budget statement about the unemployed. In my opinion unemployment is soul destroying and demoralising, whether the person is aged 16 or 60. There are young people leaving school, well-educated or at the inter-certificate level, without a hope of employment. Young people are leaving at 18 years of age with good leaving certificate results and then at 21, having done a course in AnCO, will find that their prospects are getting worse, not better.</P>
    <P>Yet the Government do not seem to be making the slightest effort to try to make the situation better.  As Deputy O'Donnell said, factories are being closed daily.  Young married men with mortgages, threatened with redundancy, are terrified.  Older men of between 45 and 50 years of age are becoming redundant without hope of ever being re-employed, no matter how hard they try. It is correct to say that at 40 years or 45 they are too old to be re-employed.</P>
    <P>Our young population is growing at a rate four times greater than in Europe and our labour force is growing at twice the European average.  Therefore it should be the first priority of the Government to create jobs and not to be moaning, blaming everyone else, blaming every Government but themselves instead of getting on with the job they were elected to do, to stop the decline, to create jobs.</P>
    <P>I am amazed they have not paid the slightest heed to the construction industry, the greatest single labour creating industry.  The Government have brought about a situation in the budget which forced the Construction Industry Federation <Col N="164" /> to state that the effect would be to induce the loss of 12,000 jobs in that industry alone, and of course that will have a spin-off which will mean a decline in purchasing power, and the Government cannot see any way out of it.  They have given £31 million extra towards greater employment but they are not doing the obvious thing which is in some way to halt unemployment.</P>
    <P>This budget will prove counter-productive. It will impose increased burdens on the declining labour force.  Soon we will have more unemployed than employed and this will create a situation in which the whole fabric of our society will begin to break under the strain.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to take the human factor into account.  Do they appreciate what they are doing to family life, to widows, old-age pensioners and other groups who find it difficult to keep their heads above water?  This budget will bring them to the brink because they will not be able to cope.  I have had young couples coming to me who have reached the stage when they are behind with their mortgage repayments.  This will get worse still next week when husbands, if fortunate enough to work, will come home with £20 or £30 less, although they will have to pay higher electricity, oil and general fuel bills.  Will the Government not take these basic human factors into consideration?</P>
    <P>The woman in the home, already struggling to feed her children, will be unable to cope.  She got no increase in children's allowances, which is a disgrace.  What happened to the promises about giving her free dental and optical treatment? This Government are obsessed with trying to balance the books.  They are spending all their time adding up their sums and do not think beyond that.  They are giving our people an overdose of hard times which could prove fatal because the people will not be able to bear that burden imposed in the budget.</P>
    <P>The building industry, as I have said, is going through a hard time and I should like to know if the Minister for Finance is contemplating eliminating the incentive given in the 1981 budget which gave relief to people offering moderate-cost <Col N="165" /> accommodation &mdash; I am not thinking of those buying apartments and re-letting them as investments.  I am worried about the jobs that could be lost if that incentive is done away with.  It could reach 7,000.</P>
    <P>Finance for construction has been cut by 15 per cent and therefore house prices will go up by about £700 because VAT is going up.  Money for the Housing Finance Agency has been reduced by £10 million. This will cause the loss of more jobs in the construction industry and it will make it very difficult for the average couple even to contemplate buying their own home.  At the moment they find it difficult enough with practically no increase in wages and prices rising, how on earth can they even think of buying a house in the coming year or two?  It may be that the houses will not be built because the construction industry think people will not be able to buy them.  Because of Government action fewer houses will be built in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I am very fond of Deputy John Kelly. He is one of my favourite people on the Fine Gael benches.  He is a very good politician.  He speaks his mind and he is very sincere.  What he suggested about emigration for our young people was a dreadful thing to say.  We suffered from emigration in the thirties, forties and fifties. We do not want our young people to have to leave.  During the fifties I saw mothers crying because their sons had to emigrate to look for work.  I do not want to see that situation ever again.  I want us to be able to create employment for our young people to keep the family together in our own country where they should be. At the moment the idea of our young people emigrating is being aided and abetted by the Government as a solution to the unemployment problem.  I do not want to see that happening and I am quite concerned about it.</P>
    <P>In the budget £5 million was allocated to the family income supplement scheme. The previous Coalition Government had a Minister for Poverty.  Under a Coalition Government poverty always increases, although they talk forever about how concerned they are about poverty and about people on low incomes.  I wonder how this £5 million will be distributed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> Will the family have to go to a social assistance officer and almost beg for an allowance out of that £5 million?  It was stated that it will cater for 20,000 families. I am not particularly good at mathematics but I calculate that works out at approximately £5 per week per family.  With wages as they are at the moment and with increasing prices, £5 will not go very far in a family with a couple of children.  I wonder what families will get this money. They will probably have to be below the breadline to inveigle it out of whatever social assistance officer will be employed to dole it out.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill was debated last week and the week before.  For the first time for as long as I can remember there is now a decrease in social welfare. With inflation rising the implications of the budget will be far harsher than anyone has imagined.  The increase of 10 per cent in short-term benefit and 12 per cent in long-term benefit will not compensate for rising prices, and so on.  The incomes of old age pensioners, widows and the unemployed will be cut.  The money they will receive will be of less value to them this year than the same amount would have been last year.  They will all be worse off.</P>
    <P>There is no move in this budget to eliminate the sex discrimination in the social welfare code.  I suppose the Government are waiting until this becomes compulsory at the end of 1984 under the EEC regulations.  Because things are so bad for the housewife the single unemployed woman and the widow the Government should have tried to update the social welfare code to alleviate the hardship encountered by those people.</P>
    <P>I suppose there is no possibility that they would give the married woman at home some sort of social assistance.  I do not suppose that will happen for a long time.  This is one of the discriminations against women which should be removed now instead of waiting until the end of 1984.</P>
    <P>The children's allowances for apprentices from 16 to 18 years of age has been stopped.  I read in the newspapers &mdash; and I hope it is true &mdash; that the £7 to £10 fee <Col N="167" /> for making an application for a job in the civil service is not to be imposed.  Two or three young people in a family might be applying for jobs.  Imagine the cost of two or three children in one family applying for one or two jobs.  It is totally wrong.  I hope there is to be a change because that is an absolute disgrace.  I never heard anything worse in all my life than that young people who are finding it so difficult to get jobs should be asked to pay an application fee.</P>
    <P>This is a deflationary budget.  It will cause more unemployment.  I am told that next winter the unemployment figure could be well over 200,000.  Youth unemployment will increase rapidly.  I could relate a catalogue of catastrophies which this budget will cause.  The social and economic consequences are frightening particularly for the family.  Everybody will be worse off and nobody will be able to do anything to help.</P>
    <P>I go to the supermarket once a week to do my shopping.  Recently I made it my business to look very carefully at what is on the shelves.  I brought my notebook with me and I wrote down details of the various items, including where they were manufactured.  It has horrified me to see the amount of imported goods on the shelves of supermarkets.  What is wrong with us?  Can we not grow vegetables, make hamburgers, or make pies?  A person should not have to hunt through the shelves looking for an Irish product.  We import carrots and tomatoes from the Canary Islands, celery from Israel, potatoes from Cyprus and other products from Italy.  We spend millions of pounds in keeping other people working in their own countries.</P>
    <P>There is now an influx of packets of frozen foods, commodities which people did not buy ten years ago.  We did not know about such commodities.  These foods are expensive, but it seems that people forget this until they come to the checkout when they have to pay an enormous amount.  The majority of packeted foodstuffs are imported.  We are spending a fortune on imported foods and vegetables and it is about time we stopped <Col N="168" /> this.  We should make an effort to build up our food and vegetable industry.  The housewife has to purchase vegetables practically every day.  Deputy O'Donnell said we are importing vegetables worth approximately £40 million.  Imagine what that would do for our farmers.  Why do they not try to get a portion of that money?</P>
    <P>The tax on property will cause grave hardship across the board, from the person living in the small house to the person living in the large house.  An average size house will cost approximately £45,000 or even £50,000.  At the moment the local authority in Dublin are building houses in the centre of the city that will cost nearly £50,000 each.  The corporation do not build luxury houses.  They build average ordinary houses for average people. The £65,000 house is a little above the average but not too much.  In many cases the owner of such a property may have worked very hard to buy the house; he may have sold a smaller house and eventually got to the stage where he could afford a more expensive one.  If the owners are two professional people earning £10,000 each or a little more, they will be caught by the property tax.  That will cause much hardship to ordinary people with a little over the average wage and I do not see why they should be penalised.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have been told they must find £65 million, but we have not been told where the money is to come from. Nobody seems to know how it will be collected.  Will people be charged for getting their dustbins emptied? One householder may have only one small plastic bag of refuse while his neighbour may have ten bags of refuse. Are we going to regulate the price according to the amount of refuse?  Are we going to charge water rates?  There will be much discontent among average people if there is any indication that domestic rates will be brought in by the back door.  People put up with paying domestic rates for long enough.  It was a most unjust rate because it did not take into account a person's ability to pay.  If this is another form of rates there will be much hassle and many will refuse to pay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> Will people be charged for street lighting or for sweeping the streets?  It will be very difficult to impose that type of tax and people will not agree to it.</P>
    <P>One of the most worrying aspects is the cutbacks in education.  In my constituency people have come to me with pages of names and addresses of those complaining about such cutbacks.  I am not talking about parents whose children have free transport, as is the case in some parts of the country: I am talking about Dublin people who are worried about educational facilities for their children.  It is only since free education was introduced by the late Donagh O'Malley that people were able to give their children the opportunity to go to secondary school.  There have been many improvements in the educational system &mdash; for instance, with regard to the pupil-teacher ratio, career guidance and remedial teaching.  All of these improvements were welcomed by the average person because it was an indication that the Government were trying to do something in that area.  Parents are very interested in education.  I always find at a public meeting that the hall is packed if the matter under discussion has anything to do with education.  The cutbacks initiated by the Minister for Education will damage our educational system and set us back ten years.</P>
    <P>The budget does not do anything for the tourist or motor industries.  What are we trying to do to our industries?  Are we trying to abolish all jobs and start from scratch with everybody unemployed? Sales of new cars are down by 32 per cent and the retail sales of petrol have also dropped since the recent price increases. A large number of people were employed in this industry but now it is expected that thousands of them will lose their jobs in the coming year and a half.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry was our most important industry after agriculture. VAT has been increased to 23 per cent. If any Government, including my own, had any sense they would reduce VAT in this area to 10 per cent.  This would give an opportunity for competitive prices and people would come to the country.  I <Col N="170" /> thought that was what it was all about &mdash; encouraging people to come here.</P>
    <P>Petrol costs £2.80 but the amount of revenue collected has decreased.  What is the point of increasing the price of petrol when last year the revenue dropped to £160 million?  It was £180 million the year before and I am sure this year it will be down to £130 million.  What is the point of all this?</P>
    <P>How much thought was given to the budget?  Did those with an input into it sit down with two columns of figures and say: &ldquo;This is the way we want it, let us do whatever has to be done regardless of how it affects the country&rdquo;?  Sets of figures are all very fine but people must be able to look after families, pay a mortgage, buy groceries, educate and clothe their children.</P>
    <P>As regards the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, I had a look at some goods in the shops to see how easy or difficult it is to buy Irish.  I found it extremely difficult because much of the clothing on sale does not have any label stating where it was made.  Perhaps it is snobbish but there are some Irish manufacturers guilty of putting a name inside a coat or dress which sounds very nice.  But is does not state where the garment was made.  I made an inquiry about a garment and found that it was Irish made but this was not stated on it.  Are manufacturers afraid to put &ldquo;Made in Ireland&rdquo; on garments because people might not regard them as being as good as those made in France or Italy?  I have often gone into a shop and asked for a blouse or a dress.  The assistant would tell me delightedly that such and such a blouse was made in Italy or France as if that was great.  Irish manufacturers should be encouraged to label their clothes &ldquo;Made in Ireland&rdquo;.  It would then be easy to distinguish clothes which are not made here.</P>
    <P>I have often asked women, who are the people who buy clothes, shoes, household goods and so on, to buy Irish made as far as possible.  They are beginning to realise that when they buy Irish it helps to keep their husband at work or get their child a job.  If we only bought what we manufactured or ate the food we produced we would have no problems.  However, <Col N="171" /> we spend a lot of money on imported food and clothes from such places as Hong Kong, Taiwan and so on. Our industries are dying and people cannot get work.  Much of it is our own fault. We are not making much of an effort to help our country at present.  Everyone should make a real effort to buy as many Irish goods as possible.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the budget.  It does not do anything to help the unemployed. There is very little real hope for anyone.  I hope it is not an overdose of hardship to make things worse instead of better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>: I did not intend to speak on such a complex subject as the budget in my first year but I am driven to speak by parochial needs and considerations. Like most rational people I accept the need for this hard budget, the harshest which has been brought in in this State.  It must be seen against the worsening economic situation which we face. We in the Coalition must take a bow for having a Government who have the guts to face the unpleasant and enormous problems which confront us as a direct result of the notorious 1977 manifesto and its atrocious policies.  As a liberal, I pay homage to Fianna Fáil.  They have made a very big contribution to the history of the State but I believe that the 1977 manifesto will rank as the most notorious document ever produced and will be spoken of for many years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a national emergency at present and that is why I endorse the necessity for this harsh budget.  As a newcomer to politics it is very hard to listen to various Deputies from the other side of the House adopting a dog-in-the-manger attitude to the very rational steps that the Government are taking in order to secure the future for the next generation.  They troop in, they nit-pick and find fault with various policies which the Government are trying to implement.  Where were their solutions last year when they were so out of touch with reality and the economic state of the country that they actually thought there was a period of boom and bloom?  They were totally out <Col N="172" /> of step with the nation.  Where were their magic remedies during the crisis years from 1977 to 1981?  Despite the fact that they had a majority of 20 seats in this House, they produced sterile policies, the situation gradually worsened and finally was totally out of control as a result of the policies of &ldquo;Doctor Disaster&rdquo;, alias the then Deputy Martin O'Donoghue. His policy sowed the seed, we are now reaping the whirlwind and will continue to do so for many years.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly this budget is hard and next year's budget will also be hard.  It is necessary to have hard budgets so that the country will survive.  We are in the midst of the greatest crisis that has ever confronted us.  We must acknowledge that and face up to it.</P>
    <P>Various Fianna Fáil speakers have criticised the Government for attempting to balance the books.  The majority of us do not understand high finance but a fundamental principle for even a corner shop is the necessity to balance the books.  I fail to understand the derision which Fianna Fáil speakers are casting on our efforts to do so.  The necessity for this budget can be clearly seen from the fact that in 1977 the national debt stood at £4,000 million.  Today the national debt stands at £12,000 million, an awful indictment of the ineffectiveness of Fianna Fáil policies.  It took us 32 years to reach a national debt in 1977 of £4,000 million. In five years we have trebled that debt. So much for Fianna Fáil and their policies.</P>
    <P>In 1977 the unemployment figure was 100,000.  In early 1983 the unemployment register stands at 188,000.  In the last year that Fianna Fáil were in Government 701 factories collapsed.  Business is haemor-haging to death.  How long can this go on?  Eventually the bleeding will stop and this nation may also stop unless corrective and remedial measures taken by the Government are allowed a period of time to bear fruit.  Fianna Fáil should stay quiet for one or two years in order to give the Government's policies a chance to benefit the country.  Surely the object of the exercise should be to allow the country to benefit from governmental policies?  Fianna Fáil had no policies and <Col N="173" /> they are now adopting a negative attitude which must be deplored.</P>
    <P>I would like to shed a tear for my native town, Dundalk, and the Border region generally.  I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, as a Cavan man to shed a tear with me.  Dundalk is not a village, it is the largest town in Ireland but it has suffered greviously as a result of the continued problems and troubles in the North. There has been no major investment in Dundalk since 1969 and 14 years is a long time for a town to be starved of investment. We have also suffered from the irresponsible labelling of Dundalk as &ldquo;El Paso&rdquo; by a British journalist in order to achieve a cheap by-line and to have a laugh at our expense.  That tag, which we refute, has prevented investment in Dundalk. The town's situation has been exacerbated by the measures taken by the Government.  While I know and accept that the Government cannot parochialise the budget, nevertheless I would be failing in my duty to the people of County Louth, who elected me to represent them, if I did not present the case for my native county and I do so unreservedly.</P>
    <P>The recent measures taken by the Government have resulted in Dundalk becoming a ghost town and have created an El Dorado out of Newry.  It is cold comfort to people in my town of 27,000 inhabitants to tell them to grin and bear these increases and offer them up for mother Ireland.  A bank manager whose client has a commitment on a monthly basis will not accept that, and the position in Dundalk and many Border towns is now one of devastation and deprivation. We are an economic wasteland, economically deprived, with very little hope for the future.</P>
    <P>Last night in Dundalk I attended a meeting of self-employed small traders and businessmen.  The hall was filled to overflowing and very angry words were directed at me as the representative of the Government.  I understand these people's frustration, anger and fear for the future.  These are self-employed who get very little help of any description from Government, and they are faced with the most frightening aspect of their business life.  Every weekend they watch <Col N="174" /> busloads of people going through their town to the El Dorado of Newry.  They watch those buses hopefully for a sign that they may stop, but the only reason they stop is for some of the occupants to go to the toilet.  They are going right through Dundalk and they are leaving untold money in Newry and other Border towns.  By the end of this year we may have exported millions of pounds to the British Exchequer and those millions will be lost to the Irish economy.  My query is, what type of high finance can allow millions of pounds to escape, to be drained from the Irish Exchequer and handed over to the British Exchequer? The scene on the road to Newry every weekend is indescribable.  It is like a pilgrimage on the road to Mecca with hundreds of cars converging on Newry from every hamlet in this country.  Cars from every county can be seen on the road to Newry, some even from County Clare.  On Saturday week last I heard that a mini-bus containing nine people left Dingle in County Kerry and those people spent £1,500 in Newry.  On Saturday morning last a television dealer sold 44 colour TV sets and by the end of that week his aggregate sales totalled 148 colour TV sets.  The trend to Newry and Northern areas has become a stampede and, like a rolling stone, it will gather momentum and by the end of the year we will have lost millions of pounds.  The attractions of business in the North are not lost on the Northern authorities.  Belfast City Council are advertising in an effort to entice and seduce Southern people to go and spend money in their area.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of all this is that the Government have given the green light to smuggling on a massive scale.  Such are the very lucrative rewards at present that very undesirable people could be drawn into massive, large-scale smuggling and we could have the spectacle of guns appearing on the Border with resultant danger to the unfortunate customs men who are trying to stem the flow of smuggled goods into this country.  The Government should assist legitimate business people in the Border counties by employing more customs officials in <Col N="175" /> an effort to stem the vast amount of smuggling that is going on there.  Basically the difference in the price of petrol is bringing people to the North.  People are driving from nearly as far away as Dublin, filling their tanks with petrol and carrying more petrol back in storage cans in their boots.  We now enjoy here the highest petrol prices in Europe, and that is not much incentive to any few tourists who might be around.</P>
    <P>What can be done?  I do not know.  I accept the board thrust of the budget and the necessity for it.  This budget had to come to prevent haemorrhaging to an economic death but I ask the Government to look seriously at measures to alleviate the hardship that is evident in not alone Dundalk but in all Border areas.  I ask them, as a means of alleviating the economic hardships, to consider increasing spending capital in the Border region by providing more money to build roads, houses and schools.  This could help the building industry which is in sad disarray.  I ask the Government also to ensure that the gas pipeline will be brought to Dundalk on its way to Belfast. I have heard suggestions that it will be by-passing Dundalk.  I fail to see how such a measure could be even contemplated, and I ask again that the pipeline become a reality in Dundalk.  I also ask the Government to consider transferring a Department to Dundalk.  The decentralisation of various Departments should be done in any case and Dundalk has a very valid case for a Department to be located there or in the county.</P>
    <P>Finally, I suggest to the Government that at the height of the troubles in the North of Ireland when business was virtually at a standstill in Belfast, the Government in the North created an enterprise zone that was a means of enabling normal business to continue trading.  They provided various subsidies for the very hard-pressed traders in those areas and they removed rates.  I ask the Government to consider something along these lines as a means of alleviating the worsening business situation in Dundalk and in all Border towns and to maintain the present level of subsidies for labour-intensive <Col N="176" /> industries such as the shoe and textile industries.  These subsidies are vital to a town whose largest employers are those in the shoe industry, employing 1,100 people.  This industry has recently seen hard times and the existing small subsidy is vital for its continuance.  There is no possibility, sad to say, of creating employment in the worsening economic situation, so the fight must be to maintain the present levels of employment.  These subsidies are vital in every region, but I speak for the Border region in asking that they be continued.  I make no apologies for being so parochial.  The scene in my area is one of devastation and many TDs are not fully aware of the seriousness of the situation.  The position in Dundalk is catastrophic and remedial measures are urgently needed.</P>
    <P>I accept the necessity of this budget. The Fine Gael and Labour alliance are to be congratulated on facing the present problems and producing a budget which was to the benefit not of their respective parties but the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>: This budget is concerned mainly with book-keeping and not with managing the affairs of the country for the benefit of the people.  The budget has no attraction for employees, workers, business people, pupils and students. There is no incentive for business expansion or job creation, particularly jobs for young people, the reverse being the case. There are cutbacks in the educational system and in agriculture, there is no incentive for tourism and there are proposals for charges in respect of environmental and local government services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No additional money has been provided for afforestation for the purchase of additional land for planting.  The Government decentralisation proposal has been postponed.  No effort has been made to provide for regional policies within the context of the EEC regional fund and no great incentive for industrial employment.  There are also cutbacks in social welfare benefits.  The take-home pay of employees and workers will not be satisfactory when PRSI and PAYE are deducted and when the fact that the PAYE thresholds have not been <Col N="177" /> increased is taken into account.  There is a serious deterioration in the health services, with no provision to improve or expand them, at a time when so many young unemployed people are unable to provide the necessary funds for their health needs.</P>
    <P>I want to go on public record as openly opposing the cuts in education.  I am completely opposed to the restrictions on school transport and the reduction in the number of teachers for post-primary schools.  As a result of the school transport cutbacks and the implementation of charges fewer will avail of post-primary education.  The school transport service is an integral part of free post-primary education, without which service, outside the cities, the educational scheme would not be a success as pupils living in remote rural areas could not reach their schools.</P>
    <P>As a result of proposed teacher-pupil ratio cuts and other measures it is estimated that 36 secondary teachers in Kerry are likely to become redundant within the next two years.  This is a very serious consequence of the Government's decision in one county alone.  Our educational system is being set aside in order to pander to the architects of fiscal rectitude.  The worsening of the teacher-pupil ratio will inhibit totally any progress in the educational field and the pupils will suffer&mdash;junior, senior and post-primary.</P>
    <P>It appears there are plans for a serious cutback in the school building programme for 1983 and 1984.  There is no movement towards the provision of much-needed accommodation in primary and post primary schools where there is serious overcrowding.  In many cases additional teachers have not been employed because the necessary accommodation is not being, and will not be provided.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that this budget is a disaster for tourism.  We in Kerry are in a good position to judge this.  The increase in VAT from 18 per cent to 23 per cent which hotels have to pay &mdash; and have to charge their customers, the tourists &mdash; will play havoc with the industry. This is a clearly established fact.  There are no concrete proposals in this budget to expand the tourist industry and to provide <Col N="178" /> incentives to grant-aid marketing facilities.  Any investment in this area would be money well spent because there is a very high level of employment in the tourist trade; it is far higher than the ordinary person would imagine.</P>
    <P>The Government should provide a scheme of petrol vouchers for tourists and grants for intensive advertising in Britain, Europe and North America.  It is obvious that the tourist counties like Kerry and tourist towns like Killarney will be very badly hit by this substantial increase in VAT.  In my view every Government should provide more tax reliefs for those engaged in the tourist industry, although it could be argued that that will not be necessary for some time to come because no tax will be payable as hoteliers will make a loss rather than a profit.</P>
    <P>The increase in VAT from 18 per cent to 23 per cent will have a serious effect on the soft drinks industry.  It should not be necessary to increase VAT on soft drinks and mixers because this industry gives very good employment which could be affected if there is a drop in sales.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the effects this budget will have on the national park in Killarney.  This park should be developed to its full potential as soon as possible. There are thousands of undeveloped acres in this park and any moneys spent on it would be a sound investment.  Killarney requires special attention from the tourism promotion point of view because Killarney and Irish tourism are synonymous throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the future for agriculture and horticulture.  It is a pity that the cutbacks in agricultural grants should come at a time when agriculture could provide much-needed employment.  I am very disappointed that the Government found it necessary to abandon the payment of grants for farm buildings under the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  This grant scheme, which is EEC aided, was dropped without notice. I know a number of farmers who borrowed substantial sums from their local banks for cow byres and farm buildings. They now find they cannot get a certificate of approval to cover the work which <Col N="179" /> is being done with the result that in a number of cases work has come to a standstill.</P>
    <P>I thought money would be provided in the budget to help farmers avail of a very good EEC scheme in respect of disadvantaged areas, that is, the payment of headage grants.  There is grave concern in certain parts of the south-west, and particularly parts of Kerry, that they were not included in the severely handicapped areas for grant purposes within the disadvantaged areas scheme.  This is particularly so since it has come to light that these areas could have been included when the proposals were submitted for approval to Brussels in 1975.  The Government should put forward proposals to include the 12 western counties in the disadvantaged area scheme so that headage grants could be paid for sheep and cattle.</P>
    <P>I agree with a previous speaker's remarks about the great employment potential in the agricultural and horticultural areas.  When one takes into account the enormous sums being paid on imported agricultural and horticultural products one realises that the sensible approach would be to set up a series of food processing industries throughout the country.  There is great potential for this in Munster particularly, which is a great dairying area.  There is great potential also for horticulture in certain parts of the south west and there is good reason for believing that there is much scope for the provision of jobs in this field.  However, such schemes would have to be carried out either by way of private enterprise with IDA assistance or by way of co-operative societies assisted by the IDA.  I would not be too happy about leaving the matter in the hands of some semi-State organisation.</P>
    <P>The Government should commission an in-depth study of this whole area bearing in mind the huge cost of the items that are imported. With the proper initiative a viable industry could be set up in many counties giving much-needed employment in the agricultural sector.  The cooperatives may be the best means of <Col N="180" /> operating such industries.  I am confident that there is a great future also for the horticultural industry but there is need for more serious study in this area.  We should explore, too, the advantages economically of using turf to heat glass-houses apart from the possibility of providing more employment in this way in the area of turf harvesting.</P>
    <P>Side by side with agriculture and horticulture there is great potential for the provision of employment in the fishing industry.  A great opportunity is being lost by the failure to set up small industries particularly at the points of landing. If we had fish processing industries in these places the landings would be greater because there would be the incentive for fishermen to land greater catches. We must consider the fishing industry from the employment point of view apart altogether from the point of view of exports.  It is not desirable that fish be exported to the Continent without first being processed here.  As a result of discussions I have had with people in the fishing business I am convinced that the Government must consider seriously the potential for employment in fish processing. I realise that to become involved in fish processing in this way would necessitate expenditure in respect of the improvement and the development of harbours and piers along the coastline but this would be money well spent in terms of return.</P>
    <P>On the question of the taxation of farming profits I doubt very much that small farmers will complete their income tax forms as envisaged in the budget.  Up to recently farmers whose valuations were less than £40 were exempt from the payment of tax but it appears that since the Wexford farmers won their case in the High Court the notional system as we knew it and as it related to farm incomes, is gone.  But for small farmers anyway the Government should concentrate on having some notional system instead of asking these people to fill up tax forms which in many cases they are not capable of doing and also because there is no necessity for them to do so as a result of their holdings being so small.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider seriously <Col N="181" /> the production unit accounting system as explained by the ICMSA.  This appears to be a soundly based system.  I was very impressed by the explanation of it as given by the chairman and the secretary of the ICMSA at a recent farmers' meeting in Tralee.  Another system which might be used as a notional system is the one used by the Land Commission and known as the adjusted-acreage system. This system works fairly well for Land Commission purposes.</P>
    <P>I speak for the small farmers of the south and the south-west and particularly of Kerry when I say that the Government should proceed with the appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the High Court that the PLV system be abandoned.  That was a system which gave a fair indication of the value of a farm and of its potential income.  I know this from my close association with the land and from meeting with smallholders in Kerry, particularly those in the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>The motor industry, too, is hit very hard by this budget.  There is a drop in sales as a result of the increases in VAT and in petrol prices.  This industry is being priced out of all proportion.  I am afraid that the impact of VAT on services and charges for repairs will create a situation whereby car and vehicle owners will not bring their vehicles for regular servicing. That could lead to many more defective vehicles using our roads and may well result in an increase in serious traffic accidents.  The Government should have second thoughts about the VAT imposition on the motor industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the environment and local government services.  Local authorities will have great difficulty in collecting the charges which the Minister proposes to introduce for services to local communities.  It is understood that charges will be imposed for the collection of refuse and the provision of water to houses.  Householders in urban districts will be asked for the first time to pay a water charge at a time when the value of money is diminishing.  For that reason local authorities will have difficulty in collecting the money.  If the Minister decides to introduce those charges <Col N="182" />&mdash; I am opposed to them and will express my opposition at the appropriate time &mdash; I hope they will not be severe.</P>
    <P>Refuse is collected from households in the cities, towns and villages for amenity reasons.  Those who cannot afford to pay the charge for refuse collection will have to find an alternative way to dispose of it and that could create a health hazard. More grants should be channelled from EEC funds to local authorities who are in a position to make great use of such money and create a great deal of employment. A proportion of the EEC Social Fund should be given to local authorities to be spent on employing young people to improve local amenities and services.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear that it is not the intention of the Government to proceed with the programme of decentralisation proposed by the outgoing Fianna Fáil administration.  Fianna Fáil were deeply committed to a programme of decentralisation of Government offices to provincial towns.  We are all aware of the necessity for such a move if we are to have proper planning and development. Dublin, and its environment, is top heavy with Government offices and people. Thousands of young people from the country who are working in Dublin would welcome an opportunity to return to work in their native counties if suitable employment was available.  The Government should give the lead in regard to decentralisation.  Dublin is overcrowded and as a result has many traffic and housing problems.  The answer to the serious problems of the city is to decentralise.</P>
    <P>The last Fianna Fáil administration had a proposal for the decentralisation of a section of the Department of Justice to Killarney.  Land was purchased in 1981 and tenders were invited for the erection of offices.  I should like to know if it is the intention of the Government to proceed with that proposal.  The Government should enter into negotiations with local builders with a view to erecting an office complex in Killarney.  Such a move would create much needed employment.  Towns like Kenmare and Killorglin would also benefit from that programme of decentralisation.</P>
    <P>The Government should introduce a <Col N="183" /> regional policy.  The whole country is a region for the purpose of funding from the EEC Social Fund.  Despite the fact that our population represents only 1.3 per cent of the population of the EEC we still get a good share of money from this fund, but it is spent throughout the country as a whole regardless of the special problems in different areas.  I should like to see the development of regional policies.  Certain areas should be identified as having social and economic problems and as requiring infrastructural work.</P>
    <P>There are two such areas in County Kerry.  One is the Iveragh Peninsula and the other is the area aound Sneem.  In the former area the local development organisation are making a case for a special grant from the EEC fund.  The Government might examine the possibility of a pilot scheme and designate the area so that substantial grants could be obtained. These two areas are experiencing a decline in population while in the rest of the country the population is increasing. These are the kinds of places which should receive special recongnition in any regional development policy.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the high level of unemployment, particularly the unacceptable level of youth unemployment, is our greatest problem.  I am surpised that the Government did not provide more money in the budget for the IDA and I was amazed that their allocation was reduced by £6 million.  This represents bad management by the Government. More money should be given to the IDA to assist potential industrialists to provide machinery and equipment for advance factories and for incentive schemes to attract industrialists to these factories.</P>
    <P>The areas which have an unacceptable level of youth unemployment should receive special attention.  I am very concerned about this problem and I am afraid that unless something is done to provide employment for young people there could be a revolution within a few years.</P>
    <P>The Government should compile a list of imports and examine the possibilities <Col N="184" /> of producing some of these goods at home.  An incentive programme should be implemented to substitute imports with home-produced goods.  Such a programme is vital.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the changes taking place in social welfare payments, particularly the changes affecting sickness benefit and unemployment benefit.  I am also surprised at the decision of the Government that all smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance should be means tested.  I will not elaborate on this matter because I intend to raise it on the Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the very high level of PRSI and PAYE payments by workers and employees.  The decision of the Government to impose a further 1 per cent levy on incomes makes the position more serious and there is no improvement in the PAYE tax bands. Time will prove that employees and workers are doing very badly in this budget.  The small business man is also suffering.  He is expected to be a tax collector and must keep records and accounts, as well as a detailed account of VAT collected and paid to the Revenue Commissioners.  Many small traders are being squeezed out by supermarkets.  The Government must do something to assist these people.  In many towns and villages, particularly in the west and south-west, people who have been involved in small business enterprises all their lives are now seeking outside employment.  This is not satisfactory.</P>

      <P>: Deputy Faulkner has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the redundancies at Platin, Drogheda announced by Irish Cement Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>: Irish Cement Limited <Col N="185" /> announced recently that they were laying off 104 of their Platin work force.  The news was a cruel blow, not only to those directly affected by the decision but to the town of Drogheda as a whole and to the district surrounding it.  Rising unemployment is a matter of serious concern in Drogheda and this further addition to the numbers of unemployed in the town is frightening.  The announcement that 104 workers in Irish Cement Limited are being laid off is especially disturbing, not only because the number of people losing their employment is large, not only because there is already a serious unemployment problem in Drogheda, but because it is happening to Irish Cement Limited.</P>
      <P>Irish Cement Limited was established in Drogheda well over 40 years ago by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Since then it has always been regarded as Drogheda's major industry, an industry strong and stable as a rock, giving constant and permanent employment.  Industries were established in the town since then, many of them giving very good employment, but whatever their merits, Irish Cement Limited stood out as the industry which was, as it were, synonymous with Drogheda, and it was felt that though other industries might succumb to the difficulties facing them, Irish Cement Limited was capable of weathering any storm, as indeed it did in the past.  For these reasons the impact of the announcement of the redundancies at Irish Cement Limited was much greater than would have been the case in respect of most other industries, and the feeling of despair which these new redundancies engender runs very deep indeed.  The two main reasons given for the company's decision was the recession in the Irish construction industry and the threat of foreign imports.  Both are serious matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with the lesser problem first, that of the threat of foreign imports.  I met the management of Irish Cement quite some time ago for a briefing on the importation of cement and its effects on sales of Irish cement and on the employment situation in our cement factories and I have been in regular communication <Col N="186" /> with them on the matter since then. I immediately set to work to do what I could to assist the company in this matter so as to counteract the damaging effect of these imports on employment in Drogheda.  I made contact with a number of Ministers in the then Fianna Fáil Government and impressed on them the need to protect this vital industry, which not only gave good employment here but which used home based raw materials to produce cement.  I must acknowledge that I got full co-operation from the Ministers concerned and particularly from the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Burke.</P>
    <P>As I said in my budget speech, I followed up reports I got about the importation of cement through our ports: mostly smaller ports were involved and I requested my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party to co-operate with me in my endeavours to preserve one of our most important home based industries.  I must say I got full co-operation from my colleagues when they realised the damage to employment in our cement factories which would result from wholesale importation of foreign cement.  I am grateful to my colleagues for that co-operation because it is not easy for any Deputy, especially in times of recession, to concern himself about an industry in another constituency when an offer is made of a half dozen jobs near a minor port in his own constituency by a prospective importer.</P>
    <P>My colleagues recognised that a large Irish industry was being endangered by the importation of foreign cement and that the end result would be severely damaging not only to employment in Drogheda but to the economic fabric of the country.  I am convinced that the efforts made by me and my colleagues, allied to the strenuous efforts made by Irish Cement Limited, went a long way towards containing the imports of cement to about one third of the total it was thought at one time would be imported.</P>
    <P>Eternal vigilance is necessary.  We cannot afford to relax for one moment, because we will always have with us those who are only too anxious to make a quick profit at the expense of a home based <Col N="187" /> industry and of employment in that industry.  As I said in my budget speech, such individuals will pull out of any area in which they base themselves as soon as it is no longer highly profitable for them to remain, but in the meantime severe damage will be done to a worthwhile industry.  I call on the Government to continue to exercise vigilance in relation to this matter as the previous Government did.</P>
    <P>Question have been raised why Irish Cement Limited appeared to have difficulty in competing with imported cement.  In fairness and justice it must be pointed out that Irish Cement Limited invested enormous sums of money to bring the industry here up to a very high standard and indeed part of their problem arises from the cost of that investment. Of course the workers in Irish Cement Limited are highly skilled and very competent workers and this leads me to question continental costings and whether they are in conformity with the rules laid down by the EEC.  This is one area which might bear some investigation.</P>
    <P>I now turn to what is, of course, the major reason for the redundancies.  It is the state of the Irish construction industry. The dismal condition of the construction industry today is a direct result of decisions by the Coalition Government. The moment I heard of the enormous cutback of £220 million in the Public Capital Programme by the Coalition Government of Fine Gael and Labour I knew that Irish Cement Limited would be in serious trouble.  While I am not privy to the factors which were discussed, considered and debated by the management of Irish Cement Limited before they took the decision to lay off 104 workers at Drogheda, I have no doubt whatsoever that the major consideration was the exceptionally severe cutback of £220 million, which the Fianna Fáil Government had included in their Estimates for the Public Capital Programme for this year. I equally have no doubt that when the management of Irish Cement Limited were made aware of these huge cutbacks they knew the writing was on the wall <Col N="188" /> and that this great industry would be shaken to its foundations for the first time in its history.</P>
    <P>So it has turned out, and what would have been regarded as impossible only a short time ago, the laying off of a quarter of the work force in Irish Cement Limited in Platin, Drogheda, has now come to pass.  Some of the details of the public capital expenditure cuts by the Coalition Government are as follows: telecommunications buildings cut by £18 million; roads and sanitary services cut by £18 million; farm modernisation scheme buildings cut by £10.3 million; housing cut by £13 million; school buildings cut by £5 million; Government construction cut by £12 million and so on.</P>
    <P>The cutback in the need for cement is very apparent when we note these cutbacks in money intended for the construction industry by a Fianna Fáil Government but now slashed by the Coalition, in spite, as I said earlier, of the rosy prospects outlined by the Labour Party during the course of the election.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, another very important factor to be taken into consideration as well as the cuts I have already mentioned.  Included in the total public capital expenditure outlined by Fianna Fáil, when in Government, was a global contingency provision of £120 million. The Joint Programme for Government announced by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties after the election when they were endeavouring to form a Coalition Government stated that areas of defective infrastructure, the tackling of which would provide productive employment, would be identified, and I am now about to quote from the joint programme:</P>
    <P>As an immediate measure, a sum of £100 million from the contingency fund in the recently published public capital programme will be set aside to finance works of this kind during 1983.</P>
    <P>The recently published Public Capital Programme referred to in that statement is the Fianna Fáil Government's public capital programme.  This statement in the Joint Programme for Government was a major selling point at the Labour delegate conference in Limerick, where <Col N="189" /> Labour delegates met to decide on whether they should enter a coalition or not.  It is particularly noteworthy, too, that the matter was discussed in Limerick, where there is a cement factory, and I have no doubt that the cement workers in that city were very pleased to note that this £100 million would immediately be made available for the building industry by a Coalition Government, plus the further money in that same Fianna Fáil public capital programme which they must have assumed would also go to the building industry. What must the feelings of those workers be today, what must be the feelings of Labour delegates who voted for Coalition on the strength of the statement in the Joint Programme for Government when they find that not only has the money directly intended for the construction industry been cut, but that the promise of the £100 million from the contingency fund has also been reneged upon.</P>
    <P>The recent Coalition budget reduced the capital budget by £220 million, and I quote from the budget statement.</P>
    <P>This reduction includes the deferment for this year, 1983, of the global contingency provision, pending the emergence of projects which would meet the necessary investment criteria.</P>
    <P>So much for the joint Coalition programme statement which indicated that as an immediate &mdash; note the word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo;&mdash; measure a sum of £100 million would be made available from the contingency fund.  The Coalition Government now state that they are deferring any action for this year until they can find projects which would meet the necessary investment criteria.  Evidently the loss of employment by 104 workers in Cement Ltd. in Drogheda not to mention thousands more in the building industry, counts for very little in the economic thinking of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I took particular note of a Labour Party statement in my constituency after the announcement of the 104 redundancies, and that statement said that the layoffs were inevitable because of the lack of activity in the building industry.  The £220 million cut in the Public Capital Programme <Col N="190" /> was made by the Fine Gael Labour Coalition agreement and I want to go on record as saying that had that cut not been made it would be by no means inevitable that the layoffs would take place.  The one thing necessary to ensure that Irish Cement Ltd. continue to provide stable employment is to provide sufficient money for the building and construction industry, and that is exactly what we in Fianna Fáil were doing in the Public Capital Programme, £220 million of which has now been cut off the Public Capital Programme by the present Labour-Fine Gael Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>How different is the position the cement workers find themselves in today compared with the rosy picture painted for them by the Leader of the Labour Party and the promises of support made to them, when the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, visited the cement factory at Platin prior to the recent election?  At that time Deputy Spring, according to a report of his visit in the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> of 19 November 1982, visited Platin:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Spring in Drogheda.  Visited Cement Ltd., Platin.&rdquo;  He said that nobody could claim that Cement Ltd. was not a competitive industry &mdash; its technology and plan and its workforce were equal to any in the world.</P>
    <P>The Labour leader pledged the full support of the Labour Party in any future Government to assist in any way possible in safeguarding the many thousands of jobs, both directly and indirectly dependent on the industry.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would be a serious loss to Drogheda, Louth and Meath and to the country generally if this most valuable industry was placed in jeopardy,&rdquo; Mr. Spring said.</P>
    <P>The Labour leader fulfilled that promise, by cutting £13 million off housing, £18 million off roads and sanitary services, £18 million off telecommunications buildings, £10.3 million off farm modernisation scheme buildings, and by not making available the £100 million from the contingency fund which had been promised. <Col N="191" /> I must say that I never found it necessary to visit the cement factory during election campaigns in the past.  It had always been accepted by those working in the building and construction industry that the interests of that industry and of its workers were always safeguarded by Fianna Fáil Governments and it had been recognised that building and construction had never been a strong point with Coalition Governments.</P>
    <P>When the building and construction industry is in a healthy condition, the employment of workers in Irish Cement Ltd. is secure.  It may have been that in the last election some workers thought that this time a Coalition Government might act differently from how Coalitions acted in the past, or maybe they were prevailed on to vote for the Labour Party because of the belief, promoted and propagated by the Labour Party, that where a candidate lived was more important than his party's policy and his party's past record.  I will not comment on this. The answer is self-evident.</P>
    <P>I will simply repeat that Fianna Fáil stood solidly by the building and construction industry down through the years, and as proof of its attitude Fianna Fáil were providing £220 million more in the public capital budget for this year than the Coalition are now providing. That is what counts.  That is what ensures employment in the building industry.</P>
    <P>I now demand that the cuts in the public capital programme be restored and the promise made in relation to the £100 million at the Limerick Labour convention be honoured for the sake of those being laid off at Cement Limited in Plattin, for the sake of thousands of jobs dependent on the industry throughout the country and now in jeopardy, and for the sake of the economy of the country generally, and to give an opportunity to Irish Cement to reconsider the position regarding the redundancies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am grateful to have the opportunity to discuss this important matter.  I share the concern of Deputy Faulkner about the <Col N="192" /> lay-off of 104 workers at the Platin plant of Irish Cement Limited.  These lay-offs were brought about by the relatively serious drop in the demand for cement as a result of the recession.  The company carefully considered all options before taking this action.  While I am hopeful that the lay-offs will be temporary, I must stress that what is needed is significant growth in the demand for cement to enable the company to increase employment.</P>
      <P>Irish Cement Limited are a subsidiary of Cement Roadstone Holdings Limited. They are the only manufacturers of cement in Ireland and they hold the only licence to manufacture cement under the Cement Acts, 1933 and 1962.  The capacity of the two cement plants, one in Plattin and the other in Limerick, is 2,000,000 tons per annum and about 930 workers are employed.  In March 1981 the Government sanctioned assistance of £12 million towards the cost of £130 million for the modernisation of the Limerick plant.  When this plant comes on stream the capacity of the plant will be increased and the overall capacity of the company will be 2,600,000 tons per annum.  I mention this because it is important in the context of the capacity of the Irish market to absorb cement products.</P>
      <P>In 1981 the market for cement in Ireland was £1.81 million.  In 1982 the market fell to £1.49 million and the expected market in 1983 will be in the region of £1.3 million.  This means there is an over-capacity for the manufacture of cement in the company.  This did not develop overnight with the coming of power of the Coalition Government.  It has been developing over the past three or four years.  At Platin the company are closing one of their kilns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The high cost of energy is a factor in production costs at Platin and in Limerick.  Energy cost comes to about 50 per cent of the total production cost of cement.  The high cost of oil has been exacerbated by the imposition of hydrocarbon tax on the product.  There was an imposition of 2p per gallon in 1974.  This was raised &mdash; and I am sure the Deputy will take note of this &mdash; to 7p per gallon <Col N="193" /> in 1980.  The date is important.  It was reduced by the previous Coalition Government to 4½ in December 1981.  I accept that it is a burden on the company.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that, even though they have more or less a monopoly, the company intend to convert the Platin plant from oil to coal burning.  Recently the Government approved grant assistance of £1.8 million for this conversion. This will result in a saving of about £700,000 per annum in energy costs at the Platin plant.  This is a significant move by the company and a welcome one.  It will go quite some way towards restoring the viability of the plant in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned imports as being a problem.  I accept that imports are a problem, but not necessarily a major problem.  Importation of cement began in 1979 and in that year amounted to about 20,000 tons and built up to about 80,000 tons in 1982.  That represents a market penetration of approximately 5 per cent.  It is a problem, and it arose mainly because of the international recession which resulted in an increased capacity in European cement-making plants. Imports come mainly from the Netherlands, Germany and Spain.  Recently the company approached the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism in the hope that some form of restriction could be imposed on imports.  I accept that it is a difficult situation but we must look at the market in a total context.</P>
    <P>I listened with some interest to the economic prognostications of Deputy Faulkner with regard to the present Government.  He forgot a central element in economic policy, that is, the insane borrowings of the Fianna Fáil Government from 1977 to 1981.  These borrowings did untold damage to our economic fabric.  One would have thought that the Government from March to December last year would have <Col N="194" /> had some sanity, but they had no such thing in the economic sense.  It is very sad to not that all the income tax collected by the State goes towards paying interest on the national debt.  The capricious spending spree by Fianna Fáil has meant that the environment for investment has been seriously damaged.  The large amount of vacant factory space now in the hands of the IDA is a direct reflection of the insane inflationary policies of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>There is no point in trying to blame this Government who have been in office for about three months for the economic recession.  The Deputy knows full well that the Fianna Fáil Government did tremendous structural damage to the environment for industrial investment. Government programmes or Government expenditure will not determine the level of employment or the level of the production of cement.  There are other major indicators.  One is the environment for agriculture and an other is the environment for industry.  Both of those were damaged severely by the Fianna Fáil Government in recent years.  It is now the task of this Government to re-establish a healthy environment for industrial investment and agricultural investment.  This is a difficult task.  The measures taken in the budget have been described as harsh, but they are realistic in the long term.  I hope we will be able to control our budget, which the Fianna Fáil Government failed to do.  This cannot be discussed flippantly in the House in an adjournment debate.  If Deputy Faulkner is looking for a reason for the redundancies in Platin, he should examine the budgetary policy of his own party in Government since 1977.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 16 March 1983.</P>

      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 455, 456 and 457 together.</P>
      <P>The number of local authority houses completed in County Donegal in each of the last five years was:&mdash; 1978, 200; 1979, 324; 1980, 181; 1981, 190; 1982, 159.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate completions in County Donegal in 1983, but over 350 houses were in progress throughout the county at the end of 1982.</P>
      <P>The question of advertising for tenders for houses is primarily a matter for each local authority, having regard to the amount of capital available for their housing programme and the need for compliance with the normal procedures governing the provision of local authority houses.</P>
      <P>I am not yet in a position to say what any particular housing authority's allocation for local authority housing will be in 1983.  Detailed claims to finance ongoing commitments on their housing programmes for 1983 have been received from all housing authorities, including the authorities in Donegal, and are at present being examined in my Department.  I hope to be in a position shortly to notify authorities of their initial capital allocations for 1983.</P>

      <P>: Private site subsidy is not payable directly to individuals, but under section 9 of the Housing (Miscellaneous <Col N="42" /> Provisions) Act, 1979, a subsidy is paid by my Department to housing authorities towards the annual loan charges incurred in respect of the provision by them of sites for private houses.  The subsidy is one-third of the loan charges incurred on borrowings, up to a maximum for such borrowings of £1,500 per site.</P>
      <P>The payment of the subsidy is dependent on the fulfilment of certain conditions relating to the eligibility of the purchaser, floor area of house, density and sale price of site.  The value of any subsidy payable is generally passed on to the purchaser in the sale price of the site.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1977, agricultural development of less than 400 square metres floor area is exempt from planning control in most circumstances and does not need planning permission.  Hence the question of payment of a fee will not arise for most agricultural development.  Where permission is required, the fees payable under the Local Government (Planning and Development) (Fees and Amendment) Regulations, 1983 are as follows:</P>
      <P>Buildings of less than 400 square metres gross floor space, £40; Buildings of more than 400 square metres gross floor space, £40 or £1.75 per square metre in excess of 400 square metres, whichever is the greater; Any other agricultural structure, £40.</P>
      <P>The development mentioned by the Deputy would not normally need planning permission in which case payment of a fee would not arise.  Where permission is required, a fee of £40 would apply.</P>
      <P>From the foregoing it will be apparent that in designing the fees system I have paid particular attention to the needs of the agricultural sector and that the level of fee applying could not be considered an undue burden.</P>

      <P>An application for an extension for one year of the work permit in question was received in January 1983.  A permit was issued for one month to allow continuation of employment while the application was examined.  It became apparent that a number of Irish nationals who might be suitable for the post were registered with the National Manpower Service.  Following an exchange of correspondence, Dublin Corporation were notified that upon receipt of the £50 fee, a permit for the period to end May 1983 would issue.

      <P>: There is no vacant postman post at Inistioge to which an appointment can be made.  In accordance with longstanding policy to motorise rural deliveries, a part-time post at Inistioge sub-post office, which became vacant on 31 May 1982 was amalgamated with a full-time cycle post at Graiguenamanagh to form a motorised delivery post based at Graiguenamanagh.  This arrangement has reduced the cost of delivery and, overall, scheduled delivery times in the Inistioge area have been improved</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) 2,374 agreements were terminated in 1980, 3,155 in 1981 and 3,965 in 1982; (b) information not available; quite an amount of revenue due when agreements are terminated is subsequently collected; (c) and (d) about 5,000 cases were <Col N="60" /> brought to Court where the amount was £250 or more in the period 1977 to 1982. Virtually all of the cases were successful; (e) the total amount of telephone revenue not collected at end 1982 amounted to about £25 million.  Most of this has either been collected in the meantime or will be collected.  The total amount of telephone revenue written off in the period 1973 to 1982 amounted to £1.456 million.</P>

      <P>It has since been established that he has an additional six credited contributions for 1980-81, giving him a total of 42 contributions for that year and entitling him to a weekly disability benefit rate of £58.50.  His total weekly benefit entitlement is thus £65.00.</P>

I am also considering alternatives to imprisonment and hope to introduce very soon the community service scheme and to extend and improve the intensive supervision scheme.  Extra accommodation will shortly be available in Cork Prison and Loughan House, which will relieve the pressure for some time.</P>
      <P>Offenders may benefit from the present system of temporary release if they are unlikely to re-offend; they are not considered a serious danger to the public and they take part in programmes aimed at preparing them for release &mdash; they are the majority.  A significant number are released at the half-way stage in their sentence or even earlier.  Accordingly, the case for an increase in the amount of remission for which an offender qualifies merely on the basis of his industry and good conduct while in custody is not as strong as in some other jurisdictions which do not operate as liberal a temporary release system as we do.  Moreover, I have no doubt that many people would be opposed to the release of dangerous offenders after they had served only half of the sentences imposed by the Courts.</P>

      <P>Exemption on the basis of parents-legal guardians holding a medical card applies only in the case of pupils attending their appropriate centre.</P>
