      <P>I have no intention of repeating anything I said on a former occasion but I am anxious to ask the Minister of State a few questions since the House has been asked to appoint a Joint Committee and we have an item of business before us which, as far as I know, is an ordinary item of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the second instalment of an item of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the <Col N="1679" /> Minister of State if he will inform the House now or at some time more convenient to himself about the following matters.  Firstly, what will it cost to service this Joint Committee, because the setting up of any Committee involves certain expenditure of public money in the provision of public servants who are taken away from their ordinary work? Those officials are not junior public servants but people who must know and understand something about the substance of the matter under the Committee's attention.  What will the Joint Committee cost the public?  I would like that sum to include what may be anticipated to be the cost of printing and publishing the ultimate report of the Joint Committee.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to know whether it is the intention of the Joint Committee &mdash; the House has been asked to give the Joint Committee the requisite powers &mdash; to call witnesses, ask for documents and, in general, invite representations in regard to the subject matter of the Joint Committee.  If that is the case I should like to know which witnesses the Minister of State has in mind, which documents will be available to him which were not available to his predecessor in 1973 and which evidence in general is likely to be available to him, via this Joint Committee, which can be got in no cheaper way and was not available to the committee which sat under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kenny a decade ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know whether it is proposed that the report of this inter-party Committee, the object of which in general I take to be to spread evenly the odium of any disagreeable recommendation it may ultimately make, will be regarded by the Government as binding upon them, or whether it will again be something that will sit around for ten years being looked at and examined.  I should like to know what is the point of going through this pantomime of setting up a Joint Committee when, as far as I know, nothing new has emerged which will be of any material importance to it, except for a small number of decisions in the High Court and Supreme Court <Col N="1680" /> which are public documents, available in the Attorney General's office for his advice on the legal dimensions of this question, which, I admit, are considerable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a brief comment.  We were not aware that there would be any opposition to this motion.  We support the establishment of the Joint Committee because there is fairly unanimous agreement that the Kenny Report as such was defective in many ways.  It was the opinion of legal and constitutional lawyers, and others who know about these matters, that that report was inoperable in many of its recommendations. The problem still remains, the problem of the price of building land.  I would put the case made by Deputy Kelly the other way round: rather than anything having changed in the situation, it is still the same and the problem is still there.  The cost of building land is still a major factor inhibiting the housing of our people.  Therefore, we fully support the establishment of this Joint Committee and we hope it can finally and in the ultimate give us some conclusions, some way of tackling this major social problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly previously raised some points in regard to this important matter.  The House is aware that in effect this is a carryover from a commitment made to the House by Fianna Fáil when in Government.  They were attempting to find a detailed solution to a problem on which there appeared to be all-party agreement in principle but not all-party agreement on what form the solution should take.  For that reason it was felt that an all-party committee would be the best way to tease out the legislative solution. One of the reasons for that was because, in the absence of all-party agreement, opposition from one side of the House or another was a signal from within to outside the land market; and clearly that would make a bad situation &mdash; we are all agreed it is bad &mdash; worse, as has been the unfortunate and extensively <Col N="1681" /> documented experience in the British land market since 1947.  Deputy Kelly on numerous occasions has advised us to learn from mistakes that have been made across the water and in this instance I do not think we should make the mistake that was made there.  About seven separate legislative attempts were made in Britain to deal with what is a complex matter.</P>
      <P>I hesitate to give constitutional or legal advice to a Member as eminent as Deputy Kelly, but in relation to the Kenny Report one of the principal pillars upon which the majority opinion of the Kenny report rested was the fact that in 1973 the controlled tenant legislation was deemed to be constitutional.  Therefore if that legislation was deemed to be constitutional, it was considered that Kenny's majority report would also meet the test of constitutionality.  That manifestly is no longer the case, since we have been through the courts in relation to that matter.  In fact, the House in the last 18 months put through two pieces of legislation because the Supreme Court rejected the first one.  On the same point there have been a number of Supreme Court judgments since 1973 which give rise to some doubts in relation to the interpretation of property rights under the Constitution and, for that matter, it is no longer sufficient in legal terms to rest one's case on Kenny alone.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Kenny Report addressed itself exclusively to the problem of agricultural land becoming urban or development land for the first time and did not address itself at any stage to the question of existing built-up land, inner city land or derelict land which was already developed.  It is clear from a matter raised on the Order of Business by Deputy Gregory that in most of our towns and cities there is a pressing need to come to terms with the redevelopment of land which has become derelict or passed through its first commercial or economic use.  It is for those reasons that the House should conduct its business through this Joint Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of the cost I should like to tell Deputy Kelly that there will not be any extra cost to the taxpayer <Col N="1682" /> for the servicing of the Joint Committee. The people who will service it will be full-time employees of the public service and therefore no additional costs will arise.</P>
    <P>In relation to submissions and so on, all local authorities have already been requested &mdash; this committee was set up before the dissolution of the last Dáil &mdash; to send in submissions and to the best of my knowledge about 15 to 20 of them at present have already done so.  The major institutions who would have a direct interest in this, such as the institutes of engineers and architects, the ICTU and so forth, have all been requested to submit their considered views on this matter.</P>
    <P>I think that I have answered all the questions that Deputy Kelly raised.  In view of the debate that has taken place here, perhaps unexpectedly, I urge that the political parties on all sides of the House would move as fast as possible to nominate Members to participate in the work of this committee.  As the Leader of the Opposition has said, this problem has got worse and not eased since 1973 when the committee's report was submitted to the then Government.</P>

A difficult situation exists on the Cork scene at present where Aer Lingus are cutting services and Cork Airport, we are told in leaked documents, have staff redundancies.  I have asked the Minister that there would be an inquiry into how these leaks took place.  It is important that we know if there are redundancies and, if there are, how the very confidential documents were leaked to a Member of this House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday last I was in the process of conveying to the House the major problems which exist in the Border area and in particular in County Louth in relation to the substantial price differential which exists between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  I referred particularly to the growing industry of smuggling on the Border which is the only developing industry that we seem to have around County Louth at the moment. This has been highlighted substantially since last week when substantial quantities of spirits were apprehended in various areas on the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could accept that throughout the history of the State this has been a practice and many jokes have been made about it, but it is no longer a joke as far as the publicans, hoteliers and people in commerce along the Border are concerned. This in effect is depriving the Exchequer of millions of pounds.  Not alone that, the taxes and excise duties being paid on those spirits and smuggled goods are going to the UK Exchequer.  I made the point that we cannot blame the people of Northern Ireland nor to some degree can we blame the smugglers because the incentive is so high that it is very difficult for even honest people to resist the temptation.  Some of my colleagues will know that in the constituency of Louth the incentive is so great that it pays people to go to Northern Ireland to do their shopping.  The only good thing is that at least our brothers and sisters in <Col N="1686" /> Northern Ireland will gain some benefit from this.  However, the people who carry on the smuggling business are depriving the Exchequer and the business is being carried out largely at the expense of the taxpayer who in the end will have to pay for the situation here.</P>
    <P>Even if the whole Irish Army were placed on the Border it would not have any serious effect in relation to this situation. Even the customs and excise people cannot possibly be fully effective, as you, a Cheann Comhairle, coming from the area can testify to fully, and it would not be possible to police this situation.  Therefore, one must come to the conclusion that the reason for this is not a military one, a customs and excise one, or a police one because all three would be virtually powerless to do anything about it.  The price differential has been caused by the level of taxation which exists today in the Republic as against that in the UK.  It should also be mentioned that this would be added to to a substantial degree by the very high level of inflation here in the Republic as against the level of inflation in the UK which is heading towards only 25 per cent of our figure.  Unless this situation is redressed those of us who live and do our business in County Louth and other Border areas will be faced not alone with an escalating unemployment problem but also with the problem created by the abnormal price differential which now exists.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of serving on the North Eastern Regional Development Organisation when you, A Cheann Comhairle, were chairman.  The organisation represents the counties of Louth, Monaghan and Cavan and we had many discussions about the building industry in those areas which has been seriously affected by the price differential which exists between the Republic and the North.  The problem has been fuelled by the fact that there is large scale fraud in the building industry in Border areas and it is spreading south to Dublin as well. Our builders can no longer compete with builders from Northern Ireland because a large proportion of the people <Col N="1687" /> employed are signing for the dole in the North and working in the South and not paying tax, PRSI or PAYE, on either side of the Border.  Many of these people are subcontractors.  Those of us involved in local authorities in these areas will know that more and more local authority contracts are going to builders who are resident outside the Republic.  The reason is unfair competition.  The Labour Party nationally and in County Louth welcome people who wish to work in County Louth or Cavan, Monaghan or Donegal, but we welcome them provided that at all times they pay their fair share of PAYE and PRSI and provided that builders who secure local authority contracts do so on a fair basis.  There is adequate evidence that this is not always the case.</P>
    <P>During the week ended 18 February this year <i>Drogheda Independent</i> published details of a major case where a large proportion of people employed on a local authority site were signing for the dole in Northern Ireland.  This was ascertained in conjunction with the authorities in Northern Ireland.  The Cabinet must take a serious look at this matter.  We are coping with a problem which is approaching disaster proportions because of the price differential which is affecting hotels, shops and pubs and because of the inability of the building industry to compete.  I am sure our neighbours in Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal are experiencing similar problems.  At a time when people are signing for the dole in Northern Ireland and paying no taxes in the South, 600 building workers are signing on at the Labour Exchange in Drogheda and about 800 are signing in Dundalk.  Everything in the garden was reasonably rosy when people were in receipt of full PRSI because the level of income was somewhat in keeping with their previous level.  This is no longer the case because 85 per cent of men and women who were receiving unemployment benefit are now receiving employment assistance and their level of income has dropped substantially.  This is a double blow to those who are trying to make a living in small businesses such as shops, <Col N="1688" /> pubs, restaurants and essential services. I am not sure what the future will hold in Border counties as income levels drop and jobs are stolen by unfair competition.</P>
    <P>I made a strong plea last Tuesday which I now repeat.  It is absolutely essential that the Minister for Industry and Energy, with the full support of the Cabinet and, I would hope, the support of the Opposition, approve the extension of the natural gas pipeline through County Louth and into the Border areas.  I make this plea as a member of a Party in Government because it is crucial that we have some redress for the damage which has been done to employment in these areas.  I understand the pipeline could be extended quite simply from Swords.  Cost would not be a major factor when taking into consideration the benefit which would accrue to industries such as Cement Limited, Premier Periclase Limited, McDonnells, Becton and Dickinson, Carrolls of Dundalk, Harp Lager and the breweries, all major users of energy.</P>
    <P>In some heavy industries in County Louth the cost of energy has now become a very important factor in overall production costs.  If any further increases in energy costs take place we could have a further serious loss of employment. Heavy industry in County Louth is paying more for its energy than the same type of industry in any other country in Europe. This is a crazy situation when we have natural gas on our doorstep and alternative sources of energy.  I ask the Minister to give us some support in County Louth and in the Border areas, get that gas pipe line flowing through County Louth and up into Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal to give us some hope for the future.  If that is not done it will simply mean that heavy industry likely to set up here will not do so in an area where natural gas is not available.  Obviously they will go for the cheaper form of energy and natural gas is a cheaper form of energy.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for the Environment that the idea of accepting the lowest tender, which is an antiquated system and a very unfair system in many ways, for local authority house building projects and civil engineering projects <Col N="1689" /> should be reviewed urgently.  The county managers should be allowed more flexibility. This would enable them to give contracts, where there were reasonable and fair quotations, to local builders in the various towns around the country to create jobs within local communities.  Far too many of the jobs in local authorities are going outside the areas.  While we are transporting people in from north, south and everywhere else local craftsmen are left sitting around watching the jobs being taken from under their noses. Many of the people who come in on the lowest tender basis are fly-by-night builders who leave unfinished housing estates, badly finished houses and massive problems behind them and then fold up overnight. This has happened in many cases in the Border areas over the last few years.</P>
    <P>I may sound a bit parochial but I came here to represent the people of my constituency of Louth who are very angry with many aspects of the budget and of the possible damage to employment.  I pointed out on the last day that there are many aspects of the budget hidden in the massive publicity that followed it and many of the harsh measures taken in it. We failed to get the message across that 40 per cent of what ordinary consumers buy is completely exempt from VAT.  I am particularly pleased about that aspect of it because we are talking about VAT on food, clothing and footwear.  We are also talking about the massive subsidies on food.  I am not advocating that those subsidies should be removed.  The subsidies are on essential items of food, clothing and footwear which represent a very large proportion of the income of the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>There has been very little mention of the fact that the £5 fee for hospital visits was abolished.  This was a great source of complaint by people in my constituency, I am pleased that this charge was abolished. I appeal to the Minister for Health to have an urgent look at many other items which are still not available to old people on medical cards.  Quite a number of items are essential to old people and when you consider they now have to pay for those items out of the very small old <Col N="1690" /> age pension or widows' pension you realise this will create great hardship for them.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased that the Minister for Education had another look at the education cutbacks, some of which were necessary. In future, before we make changes, we should have the maximum consultation with all the parties concerned and think out carefully what we propose to revise or cut back.  I know the Government had a problem in relation to that subject because they were thrown in at the deep end.  I am not for one moment understimating the power of civil servants at senior level and their influence on senior Ministers and also that many Ministers are restricted for a variety of reasons which they cannot very easily tell backbenchers in advance.  Nevertheless, we should be very careful before making any further major cutbacks.  I say this, with respect to my colleagues in Government, because I believe people have reached the level where they would find it very difficult to take any more.  I suggest to my colleagues in the Cabinet that they must give some consideration to price stabilisation over the next few years. Taxes such as PAYE, excise duty and VAT will have to be held at least at the levels now in operation.  I am convinced that we cannot take much more.  I am satisfied that many of the measures taken were necessary.  I am also satisfied that there are alternatives which could have been considered in relation to many of the decisions taken in the budget.</P>
    <P>The basic objective of the budget is to reduce the current budget deficit to £897 million or 6.8 per cent of GNP compared with last year's total of 8.4 per cent of GNP.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement, therefore, is reduced to £1,722 million or 13 per cent of GNP.  The corresponding figure last year was 16.5 per cent of GNP so it would appear that at least on paper the policy in this regard is going in the right direction.  The public sector borrowing requirement is forecast at £2,445 million or 18.5 per cent of GNP. Last year the percentage figure in this regard was 21.5.  Inflation in the current year is expected to average 12.5 per cent. That includes the approximate 4 per cent <Col N="1691" /> increase effect of budgetary policy. Therefore, the balance-of-payments deficit should decrease to £766 million or 5.8 per cent of GNP.  The indications are, therefore, that the budget targets will be achieved.  This is a welcome start in correcting the imbalances in public finances but the anticipated increase in inflation could be larger than the 3.5 per cent for many of the reasons that I have given. This is a cause for concern.  The increase will come about largely as a result of the level of indirect taxation, the overall burden of which could cause additional troubles in an already depressed economy, making it difficult for us to achieve our targets.</P>
    <P>This morning we have heard of a further imposition of charges.  I have always wondered whether we should not be thinking of the public service in different terms.  For instance, I question the necessity for the Department of the Public Service.  I question why it was established and what is its purpose.  Perhaps this Department in terms of manpower and expertise could be utilised more effectively in some of the less efficient areas of the public service.  I doubt if the <i>raison d'etre</i> of that Department justifies the cost of running it.  I have always regarded this Department as merely another layer of bureaucracy of the Department of Finance.  Undoubtedly, the deployment in other areas of the skilled personnel of the Department of the Public Service would result in increased efficiency and reduced costs.  This suggestion may not prove popular in all quarters but I should not be surprised if many of my colleagues would agree with me privately.</P>
    <P>The longer I continue to talk about the budget the more mad I become because I keep returning to the employment situation. I wish to make a few points in relation to Government policy generally in the area of employment.  For many years the textile, clothing and footwear industries enjoyed a £5 employment subsidy but unfortunately that has been withdrawn. In addition, many other cost factors have put these high labour-intensive industries into extreme difficulty and they are industries that employ in equal proportions <Col N="1692" /> boys and girls, men and women. The 5 per cent subsidy was a lifesaver.  It helped to give these industries the incentive to continue rather than to close or, as many other companies have done, become import organisations, not only importing but competing directly against the colleagues with whom they had worked and in many respects competing unfairly.  This has resulted from the situation in which the incentive to close has become greater in many cases than the incentive to remain in operation.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that it would be much better to subsidise a worker even to the tune of £50 per week or more and have him working 40 hours a week rather than to pay him as much or even more for being idle or to sit around like a corner boy and to lose his self respect.  That is what is happening to men particularly, but to women also, in my county.  One need only go to the employment exchanges in Drogheda or Dundalk to see the numbers of men and women queueing along the road, four and five deep to sign on for money that could be used to put them to work.  We find local authorities laying off up to 20 men in many cases and not replacing those who retire or who leave for any other reason. The result of this is that the level of employment in local authorities is gradually being reduced while at the same time we pay people to remain idle.</P>
    <P>It hardly needs mathematical genius either within the public service or within the Government to think of a way of transferring the money paid in social welfare into productive work projects.  Some county councils put workers on a three-day week.  This means that they sign on for three days for unemployment benefit. In other words, we are taking money out of local authorities and putting it into the Department of Social Welfare.  There is no justification for that sort of thinking. It is crazy but it is an indication of the level to which the administration of this country has sunk.  It is an indication of the type of leadership that we have been getting from successive Governments.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to offend anyone but as a trade union official I have been very much aware of the situation for some <Col N="1693" /> years past.  Matters are becoming progressively worse so that I am unable to resist the temptation to say that the country has lacked real leadership on the economic front and that we have lacked real policies in relation to putting our people back to work.  We are reaching the stage when there will be more people unemployed than there are working.  That is a dreadful thought.  It is reminiscent of what happened in Germany before the rise of Hitler and of what is happening in all of the other depressed countries where there is civil war and war among nations. A high level of unemployment gives rise to all sorts of social unrest.  Unless our people are put back to work that is the sort of situation that we will be faced with.  The Members of this House as well as the senior officials in whichever Department are involved in the area of employment will have to carry the can for whatever unrest there may be.  Of course, as an elected representative of the Dáil I will be included among those who will have to share that responsibility.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the House to forget about party differences.  Let us forget who should be leader of what.  Let us concentrate on making use of our expertise, on forgetting about disputes and stupid party-political sniping.  Let us talk intelligently about getting our people back to work.  I hope that at the end of this Dáil, be it short or long, I can be thankful that there are five more people working then than when I came into this House.  I am sorry to end on a pessimistic note.  I do not see anything in this budget. I did not see anything in the last budget, or the budget before that.  I do not see any policies of Government designed to getting our young people back to work, with the exception of the environmental schemes where young people do nothing for eight weeks, most not being properly supervised, which is throwing money down the drain.  Surely it would be better to subsidies those at work and retain their jobs?  We could then put the money which we are paying out in social benefits to productive work in getting our people in off the streets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest <Col N="1694" /> to Deputy Bell and noted how he finished his contribution.  The main problem facing the economy and politicians from every side of the House is getting the people back to work.  It is against that background that I must view this budget and it is against that background that I will be analysing the budget.  I must agree with a number of comments made by Deputy Bell.  He sees nothing in the budget to help employment, neither do I.  I see a disincentive to employment, but I will go into that in more detail later.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell called for the extension of the natural gas pipeline from Dublin to Belfast, and here I would agree wholeheartedly with him.  Last May I visited Stormont Castle and had extensive discussions with Minister Adam Butler.  We agreed terms in principle for the extention of the natural gas pipeline and the sale of a certain quantity of natural gas to Northern Ireland.  We announced that agreement on the evening concerned.  At that stage all that remained to be done was to refer the matter back to our respective Governments for approval. Our Government approved the contract last August, but to my knowledge to this day we have not had confirmation of approval from the other side.  The Minister must take up the matter urgently. All the terms were agreed and there was no reason why the contract was not completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate Deputy Bell's comments on what this extension would do for the area he represents and, indeed, for the many industries which may not survive if natural gas is not extended to that area.  I can think of a few that natural gas would certainly make more competitive&mdash;in the area of cement, Roadstone. If Premier Periclase of Drogheda do not get natural gas and some financial relief, they may not even last the year.  Their costs are 90 per cent energy-related and they will not survive without cheaper energy.  I made a submission to the Minister for Industry and Energy and the then Minister for Finance to consider the aspects a particular industries such as Premier Periclase in this year's budget, but unfortunately, we were not in Government long enough to see this <Col N="1695" /> through.  With this Cabinet, it fell on deaf ears, and worse &mdash; they increased the tax on hydrocarbons, which puts greater pressure on industries heavily dependent on energy, which accounts for a high proportion of their overall costs.  I can see more industries getting into trouble as the year goes on.  I ask the Minister for Industry and Energy to put pressure on the British Government and the Northern Ireland authorities as quickly as possible to have this contract completed. Natural gas could be brought to that area in a short period of time.  In Dublin, the outer ring in the natural gas development is being planned and, when completed the extension to Dundalk and Drogheda and on to Belfast could be taken from that outer ring.  This is a worthwhile project which would provide more jobs, safeguard jobs in this area and help our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>To come back to the analysis of the budget, if, as Deputy Bell hopes, the inflation rate this year comes to about 12.8 per cent, including a 4 per cent increase from indirect taxation, I will be very grateful.  However, I cannot really accept that that is possible.  Inflation once again will be fuelled by more than 4 per cent when we experience the knock-on effects of all the indirect taxes in the budget &mdash; the massive increases in the price of oil, petrol and diesel.  These will probably add nearer to 5 per cent, and I hope it will stop there.  If inflation were to be around 12.8 per cent, that would be a bonus in disguise.</P>
    <P>The budget has been described as many things &mdash; a bookkeeper's budget, a disastrous, harsh budget.  It certainly is a budget which has drawn more adverse comment from every section of society than any budget I can recall in recent times.  I would describe it in a different way, by calling it a technocrat's budget. It is an arithmetrical exercise of technocrats. In the present Taoiseach we have a first class technocrat &mdash; I would not fault him in that arena &mdash; and in the present Minister for Finance we have a first class technocrat, whom I would not fault in that area also.  In the Department of Finance, from the little knowledge I <Col N="1696" /> have of them, there are first class technocrats also.  This budget has a combination of all the technocratic expertise, but there it stops.  To every sector of society examining it, it is quite clear that this is true.  However, it takes a little more than technocrats to run a country, or to run a business.  There is not very much difference between running a country's economy and running a business.  Many of the same principles apply.  If you leave a business to technocrats to run, you will not be long in business.  The Coalition Government are running into the same problems as they experienced when they were in Government last time and they relied on technocrats during that Dáil, too.  That is why the ill-fated budget of January 1982 fell.  This budget is not going to fall, because there is enough support on the far side between the two parties to see that that does not happen. It is not running so close to the wind as the last budget.  It will see its way through, against the wishes of the vast majority in our society.</P>
    <P>I do not come in here to make cheap criticism.  Anybody could do that.  A different approach was available and I will make a few suggestions, although I am not saying that I have all the answers. When I look at the occupants of the benches on the far side and on the combination of the Cabinet, I see only one businessman and he is placed in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  He is a good man at his job, who knows his business; but I wonder what input he had into that budget.  On the Labour Party side, I wonder what input they had into the budget.  They must not have realised the implications of the decisions taken, otherwise they might have had different things to say.</P>
    <P>Has there been a strategy behind this budget?  A budget is supposed, not alone to reflect the problems of the economy of the day, but to chart a course forward for the 12 months ahead.  I fail to find any strategy behind this budget.  There may well be a political strategy behind the budget but I can see none behind it, good, bad or indifferent.  Any budget introduced here, year in year out, that failed to take account of the major problems of <Col N="1697" /> the economy of the time in my view failed in its first priority, that is to have an economic strategy.  This budget has failed dismally &mdash; and that is not politically speaking, every commentator sees it &mdash; failed to take any account whatsoever of the unemployment problem, 187,000 unemployed today, rushing headlong towards 200,000 and it will go to 250,000. Does anybody stop to think at what point there will not be enough people working to sustain the number of people on the unemployment list?  I do not know where is the breaking point &mdash; I do not see any of the technocrats here to answer that question &mdash; but I know that they have it worked out; somewhere along the line and perhaps not that far away either, perhaps somewhere between 200,000 and 250,000.  If one looks at the figures for those people working in the manufacturing sector today, something like 217,000, one sees clearly that we are not far away from that point &mdash; on the unemployment figures &mdash; when we would have a one-for-one situation.</P>
    <P>That is where Deputy Bell was right when he pointed to the serious factors ahead for politicians, politics and democracy here if we arrive at the stage when we do not have enough people working to sustain the existing social services, to sustain the people on the unemployment list.  What happens then?  This House may well become irrelevant.  That is why I say that while it is laudable to set out with a budget with no economic strategy that I can see apart from the reduction of foreign borrowing &mdash; that is a laudable exercise and one to which I subscribe totally &mdash; to do so and not get the right balance into a budget at this very critical time in a very fragile economy in my view is treading with danger.</P>
    <P>An initial glance at the figures would pose questions in my mind.  I know that it is very easy to stand on an Opposition bench, lacerate budgets and so on but this is a view that I expressed last year and the year before on the budgets, that for the expenditure of £6½ billion, and that is roughly what it is, to come in with a sheet of paper like this, with that amount of information, is not good enough.  There is a short analysis also. <Col N="1698" /> Anybody running a business with a turnover of £6½ billion would not accept that sort of bookkeeping.  That is what the public representatives in this House accept year after year.  There is no backup information to allow us know what are the various charges, how they are made up, what are the background figures.  We have no way of checking, we have to take them for granted.  As Deputy Bell rightly said, on paper they look all right.  Of course they do, they look all right every year on paper.  I remember that last year they looked all right on paper but, when we came to the end of the year, they did not look right.</P>
    <P>Last year when Deputy J. Bruton was introducing his budget I said that Deputies needed more information than that given so that we could check the figures in advance, so that we could have some idea of whether or not the figures would work out.  All we are doing now is accepting figures placed before us.  We accepted the figures last year in the budget.  Half way through that year expenditure was running wild and we took action to put it in order.  Indeed for the first time in many years the expenditure side of the budget worked out and we thought we were sailing along happily.  We felt that if we kept the expenditure side right everything else would be right but it did not work out that way because revenue dropped seriously. Yet three-quarter way through the year nobody was saying that revenue would be down a couple of hundred million pounds.  We found out at the last minute that revenue was down.</P>
    <P>Maybe the figures this year will work out, I hope they do for the sake of everybody concerned, but I have very grave doubts that they will.  I shall be asking a few questions about them in a moment having examined them closely.  But, from an overall look at the budget, any serious-minded business person endeavouring to look at the state of this country and how it should be run, would be bound to ask some questions.  I might mention a few figures, for example, service of the public debt costs 26 per cent of the total current expenditure.  Social services, such as social welfare, education and health cost 40.5 per cent.  Two-thirds of our current <Col N="1699" /> expenditure goes on those two items alone.  Now we come to the economic services, on which we are spending 9.3 per cent of our total current expenditure. That includes 4.2 per cent for agriculture, 2.5 per cent for industry and energy, 2.1 per cent for tourism and transport and 0.5 per cent for forestry and fisheries.  If the balance is not way out of line in relation to where we are going, by examining those few small figures, then I do not know what anybody should think. The smallest amount of money is being spent in the areas in which we need to be spending money, areas in which we must get productive investment going, where we need to get the bottlenecks removed from infrastructure, in those areas that can earn the keep, so to speak, of our social services.  Therefore, is it any wonder that we are getting out of line and balance and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>There is no point in fooling ourselves because we are going to get seriously out of balance.  The overheads of running this country, the overheads of keeping our services going, have gone way out of line in relation to what we can afford and the sooner we realise that the better.  We shall have to realise it and do something about it.  It is fine to look across the water and say, &ldquo;Yes, there was a social welfare state built up in the United Kingdom&rdquo;; yes, there was, but it took North Sea oil to provide the revenue for it, but without that North Sea oil today, I wonder where that economy would be.  I fully subscribe to the provision of the best social services we can afford in this country but there is no point in fooling ourselves in thinking we can expand those services without having the productive sector to finance them.  The productive elements of our economy are getting browned off with load after load being placed on their shoulders &mdash; it is take, take all the time and they are getting fed up with it.  The sooner we realise that the people who earn our bread and butter are those on the productive side of our economy the better.</P>
    <P>We must realise also that we cannot keep hammering them over the head with a sledge hammer.  There is no fairy godmother <Col N="1700" /> to come in and look after our economy for us.  We must earn our living and our keep.  The sooner we respect the people who do that for us the better. They are getting fed up with the way they are being treated by successive bureaucracies here.  They are being loaded with taxation, more bureaucratic documentation being piled on top of them daily, new form after new form, new return after new return with no incentive.  The sooner we get back on the road to running an incentive economy the better.  We must have an incentive economy.  It is part of the characteristic of every Irishman and woman &mdash; they are all entrepreneurs in their own right but without incentive they do not move.  We must get incentive back into every element of our economy.  We must get it back in the case of the worker because does he carry on when he sees himself paying too much tax, working overtime and having little for it?  Does he carry on?  No, he does not unless it is absolutely necessary.  He needs incentive; his management need incentive.  If there is no incentive for them then in turn they will go home at 5 o'clock in the evening, or perhaps an hour earlier and play golf, as do many managements today.</P>
    <P>Is there any incentive to the public sector either?  No, there is not.  The system is so geared that it does not matter whether they break their backs working eight or ten hours a day or whether they take it easy for the same eight or ten hours because they get the same return at the end of the day.  Therefore there is no incentive there either.  It is the same thing you get at the end of the day &mdash; there is no incentive there either.</P>
    <P>Until we get it into our heads that we have got to get a sense of reason into our economy we will not get anywhere.  I am advocating incentives in the public sector because there are many sections there in which you will get a response to incentives. If somebody in a section is administering grants and handling them he can do it for 20 per cent cheaper if the incentive is there.  I do not blame the civil service because under successive Governments a system was operated in the public service which did not contain <Col N="1701" /> incentives.  It is purely a matter of accountability.  It is not a question of value for money.  The civil servants are there to do their jobs and they do them excellently in the system they are expected to work.</P>
    <P>The time has come when we can no longer afford that system.  It was imposed on us when we got our independence. We did not need such a cumbersome system for the operation of an economy involving three-and-a-half million people. That is one of the reasons we are finding it very hard to carry the heavy burden of servicing the public sector.  The sooner we get back into the system the spirit in which effort and initiative will be recognised, the better.  It is part of our character that we love incentives, whether it is the farmer, the worker or the manager. Basically we are entrepreneurs but that spirit will not be brought out if we try to kill initiatives and incentives, as successive Governments have done.  If we continue along that road we will need a fairy godmother if we are to carry on the social services.  We should be proud of our social services so long as we are able to keep them going.</P>
    <P>I do not know where this budget will take us.  It is without innovation or imagination. I expected such things from Deputy Dukes.  instead of being christened, as he has been christened in recent weeks, &ldquo;The Dukes of Hazard&rdquo;, I thought we would get from him imagination and innovation in the budget.  We did not get it, but worse still, by his actions he has totally and absolutely depressed the economy.  There is no question about it.  We will not know until the end of the year the amount of damage that will be done to the economy.  The Minister does not know and I do not know.  I wonder when I look at VAT, £131.4 million; then when I look further down to Item No.4 and see £75 million, I am still wondering.  He has put an imposition of £131.4 million and later taking off £75 million.  When I turn to the other side I find an addition of £31 million for additional social welfare.  The last figure shows that the Minister recognises that the imposition earlier in the budget <Col N="1702" /> will cause so much additional unemployment that it will cost £31 million more.</P>
    <P>Let us do the total calculation.  He puts on £131 million, he takes off £75 million and he adds on £31 million.  We have £106 million taken off and an imposition of £131 million.  For the sake of a net £26 million he intends totally and absolutely to depress the economy.  He will totally depress demand in the economy.  He has admitted in his figures that the revenue will not be forthcoming.  Why put it on in the first place?  He cannot think of a better way to get a net £26 million than by depressing the economy, creating unemployment, sticking up prices, destroying the confidence of anybody who will try to do anything.  I cannot understand it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to know where he could have got that money I can tell him it is quite simple.  It is an expenditure budget of £6.5 billion.  The net figure of £26 million is only 0.4 per cent.  Of course 0.4 per cent is hard got in certain areas. He could have left out the whole of the extra taxation if he could find a 2 per cent saving in expenditure.  That represents a total of £135 million.  Is a 2 per cent saving hard got?  There are Departments who will tell you that it is, and there are Ministers who would object if they are told to take off 2 per cent.  Running a country and running a business is not all that different.  In depressed times if you are running a business at £6½ billion and if 2 per cent cannot be taken off overheads, you would be looking for different management. I do not accept that it is not possible.</P>
    <P>I ran a Department for eight months, a difficult one with a heavy workload. Halfway through the year I was able to make adjustments in expenditure.  The Estimate for the Department of Industry and Energy was prepared by me for 1983. It is here, with practically no change. That Estimate can be compared with the outturn for 1982.  Not alone was there a saving but there was a reduction of 21 per cent in the Estimate for 1983.  I am not being narrowminded about it but I cannot accept that there was not a better way and a better economic approach to the budget this year.  I am not being political <Col N="1703" /> about it.  The approach to this budget has been totally technocratic.  There has not been any recognition or analysis of what the repercussions to this approach will be.  There will be repercussions in every sector of the economy.  We are beginning to find out already.  We see bitter reactions from some sectors of the economy. In my memory it is the first time the Irish construction industry has had to take half page advertisements in the Irish newspapers to draw attention to the problems in the industry and to what the effects of the budget would be.  The Minister's reaction to that ill became him.  The parties on the other side sought power in the general election to run the economy. They were no sooner in Government than they started to lecture everybody. They lectured the construction industry. I heard the Taoiseach trying to lecture the economists.  When he was in Opposition the economists agreed absolutely with him, but they have disagreed with him on this budget.  He did not like it. Does he like to be the popular Taoiseach all the time?  Is he not prepared to take criticism?</P>
    <P>It was grossly unfair for the Minister for Finance to rebuke well-known and renowned economists in the ESRI for disagreeing with the figures in the budget. This was wrong because he did not give the full picture.  He said those economists attended a meeting in the Department of Finance and checked the figures.  He knows as well as I do that they checked the servicing of the debt, but they did not check the revenue projections.  They checked half of what he said.  There is no point in trying to mislead people.  There is no point in smarting under criticism. The present Government sought power to govern the country.  They had the Book of Estimates.  They knew what the problems were.  There is no point in trying to lecture everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Gaeltacht (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no provision in it for increased unemployment.  Fianna Fáil said the deficit would be reduced to £750 million.  The Deputy should tell us what <Col N="1704" /> they propose to do get it down to that. Tell us the other side of the coin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt anybody who spoke.  Now that the Minister has rasied the point, I will tell him something. I do not accept that the budget deficit the Government are going for is £896 million.  The Minister for Finance said he was going for a deficit of £750 million.  His knuckles were rapped by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste who said that had not yet been decided.  The officials in the Department know as well as I know that he did not get the figure of £750 million off the top of his head.  They know they are going for a deficit of £750 million. They allowed for over-runs.  I have another question.  I tried to pull these figures apart as best I could with the limited knowledge I have and I have great suspicions that there is provision for an increase in the public service debt to cover what I believe may well be forced on the Government in the next couple of months, that is, devaluation.  If I am not a Dutchman, 7 per cent is locked into those figures and the budget deficit they started out for was £750 million and not the figure we are talking about today.</P>
      <P>That is why I complain about the inadequate supply of material to Members of this House to enable them to make a decent analysis.  I have done one already for the Minister.  I have shown him that there was no need for this imposition and that there was a different way of getting it.  If the Minister shakes his head and does not understand what I am saying, that is fine.  There are people over there who should understand what I am saying. They will know at the end of the year the damage done to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I worked in the Department of Industry and Energy and I know what the problems of unemployment are, and I know what the problems of industry are. I know at what rate jobs are being lost. Ministers and the Taoiseach should come out of their hibernation.  We often heard the Taoiseach blowing a fanfare of trumpets, but we did not hear very much from him in the past couple of months.  We have not heard very much from Ministers either.  What is happening?  Why are so <Col N="1705" /> many jobs being lost?  Because nobody over there wants to put in the time and the effort to ensure that the little factories stay in business.</P>
    <P>In the past four weeks 13 small industrialists came to me with their problems because there was no response from that side of the House.  I can name these industrialists.  They came to me in desperation looking for help.  The system was not responding because Ministers go home at 5 o'clock and little do they care whether people wind up on the unemployment list or whether small businessmen go out of business.  Last Monday night a person came to me from 150 miles from where I live.  He provides 21 jobs in a small factory in a small town.  He is going out of business because he cannot get £15,000 for working capital and his order book is full for 12 months.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister trying to tell me they are doing their business as the Government? Of course these are difficult times, but they cannot tell me they are doing their business as the Government properly if a woman and her son have to come to me at 11.30 at night to try to get help for her little industry because the system has not responded.  That is what the Government are there for, and that is the job they are in.  The Government should get to the core of these problems and solve them, instead of going home at 5 o'clock or 5.30 p.m. in a black Mercedes car.  That is not the way to solve the problems, and the Minister knows it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not happen, as the Deputy knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew the problems and I was prepared to work and do something about them.  From what I hear from small industries around the country, I know what the Government are doing.  If they keep going like that, we will have 200,000 unemployed in a very short time and then we will arive at the figure of 250,000 unemployed.  Again the Labour Party will wrestle with their conscience. When the Labour Party wrestle with their conscience, the Labour Party always win. We hear the slogan from Fine Gael that they always put the country first.  This <Col N="1706" /> time Fine Gael put Fine Gael first.  The country will see that.</P>
      <P>We heard the pious platitudes from the Taoiseach that no Minister of State would have a Mercedes car, or a black car, or whatever colour.  Two-and-half-months later, is there any Minister of State who has not got a ministerial car?  I am not saying I agree with the Taoiseach.  I would not expect the Minister to operate without a ministerial car having regard to where he lives.  It was utter nonsense to talk about that.  It was unrealistic.  These are the pious platitudes they tried to put across to the public.  If I were offered the Minister's job today and I was asked to do without a ministerial car, I would not take the job, and I do not think the Minister would either.  I have many people working for me with less responsibility than a Minister or a Minister of State and they have company cars.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael adopt the cheap approach of trying to be the goodie to everybody. They cannot be all things to all men.  They try to convince the public that the Taoiseach is the greatest, that he has a halo over his head, that he is the sole custodian of political honesty and rectitude when, in fact, the opposite is the case.  Why talk about taking cars from junior Ministers when he did not do it?  It is now ten weeks later and there is not a word about it. They talked about Government for the people, and open and honest Government. They said they were people who would not bend under pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were not a week in power &mdash; and this is the kernel of their problem &mdash; before they bent under pressure and paid £1 million of taxpayers' money to miners in Avoca, a private company remember. Why?  Because the Minister for Labour, Deputy Kavanagh, gave an undertaking during the general election, the Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey, gave an undertaking during the general election, and the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, gave an undertaking that in Government they would pay.  That is where their problems started.  Within one week they had bent.  They threw away the qualities which were supposed to be inherent in this man, this Cabinet and Fine Gael. <Col N="1707" /> They threw them out the window.  They bought their way in with £1 million.</P>
    <P>I know there were pickets outside my office for three weeks.  I know what I told them and I believe I was genuinely telling them what was right: that the Government could not afford to establish a precedent like that of paying out £1 million of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister has mentioned it, I will.  How much did Talbot cost the Irish taxpayer?  The Minister does not know.  The amount was £378,000 nett.  Avoca cost two-and-a-half times that amount but you were the people in Government who renewed the money for the Talbot workers in 1982. The Minister's Government provided £475,000 in the Estimates.  If they believed in their convictions and in what they said they would have taken action to rectify the situation, but they had not the courage or the backbone to do so.  The Taoiseach of the day loves to be popular. He likes to be the &ldquo;nice guy&rdquo; with everyone. What does he do in Government? He provides £475,000 for Talbot.  He transferred the responsibility to the Department of which I became Minister subsequently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he waits for his time to answer these points.  His Government transferred responsibility for the Talbot workers to my Department.  A month after I took up office there I said I did not consider the arrangement in question to be of an indefinite nature, that I would work to resolve it, and this I did.  The Coalition Government had not the moral courage to take any action. They came to this House and said that deal would cost £30 million, that it was sacrosanct, that it was legally binding and that nothing could be done about it.  They did that for a political purpose.  They were not concerned with saving the money for the taxpayers and they were not prepared to tackle the problem.  The Minister can take back to his colleagues the information that of the jobs that were available and were ready to be taken up in the public service very few have been given.  However, that is the business of the parties opposite because they are in Government.  However, it is costing the State more money in PRSI and social benefits than if they were in the jobs they had accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is: do the Government realise it?  If so, they should do something about putting the people concerned to work because it is costing much more at the moment.  It is typical action of the Coalition.  I should love to hear the justification for paying £1 million to the workers in Avoca.  What happened when they got that money?  The Clondalkin workers came along.  Some members of the Government did not want to buy the Clondalkin factory and others did want to buy it.  It is well known that the Minister for Industry and Energy did not want to buy it and it is equally well known that as budget time approached the cracks began to appear.  Why did it take an all-night session in a city establishment for officials to wrap up the purchase of the Clondalkin factory?  It was because the Labour Party would not support the budget the next day if the factory <Col N="1709" /> was not purchased.  These are facts and let the Government deny them if they can.  That is the kind of Government we have.  Then they wonder why the people are criticising their actions.  To carry through a tough budget it is necessary to get the confidence of the people.  The people see what is going on, they are not fools.  It is true that while you can fool some of the people some of the time you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.  The Government should remember that.  We will be here to watch every step&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will stand over that. We had a National Development Corporation which was supposed to be the answer with regard to jobs.  Yesterday in this House I asked the Minister responsible when he would set up the corporation and he said he would have to get legislation through the House with regard to the framework of the corporation.  If the Government are serious about tackling <Col N="1710" /> the problem of unemployment they could put the corporation to work next week.  However, I know they are not serious about the matter.  Fine Gael do not believe in the project; it is merely a sop to the Labour Party.  Fine Gael know, as well as I know, there are no projects it could undertake at the moment.  There is no point in talking about fancy names, committees, a task force or a national planning board.  All those layers of bureaucracy will not take one person off the dole or create one job, and the Government know this quite well.  There is no point in uttering pious platitudes. What is needed is action on the ground, but the Government have not the guts, the courage or the necessary co-ordination of effort.</P>
      <P>Unemployment and inflation will get worse.  After the election Deputy Keating said that Fine Gael in Government would have the answers to the unemployment problem.  Have they, and when are we going to see them?  The Government took on the job and it is up to them to do it. They have not even started on the task and it is my belief they do not know where to start.  One of the problems arose before they came into office.  The Labour Party did not want Deputy Bruton as Minister for Finance because they knew they could not put many things over on him that they might be able to put over on a technocrat who might not have a commonsense approach.

    <P>There is no economic strategy in this budget.  However, it has a political strategy: hit everyone hard the first year, try to hit them again the second year and hope to stay in business long enough for things to improve before they are forced to go to the country.  The budget will create more unemployment and will increase inflation.  Since this Government came to power there has been an increase of 30p in the price of a gallon of petrol and diesel has increased by 21p per gallon. When I was a Minister not so long ago I remember when the price of petrol increased by 4.8p per gallon &mdash; 2p more than was anticipated at the time.  This was in relation to the Whitegate refinery.  All hell broke loose; the whole world nearly <Col N="1711" /> collapsed.  The people were furious but now this Government have increased petrol prices by 30p per gallon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if this Government believe in Whitegate. Some of them appear to, but others do not believe in it.  I stand over any decision I made.  Unlike some people on the other benches, I do not want an each-way bet. When Whitegate opened I said it would be operating on the dearest oil for the first quarter up to 31 December 1982.  We were under contract to Saudi Arabia, who have the most expensive oil. Government-to-Government contracts are not broken too easily, but that contract expired on 31 December 1982.  I said that this year Whitegate would be seen in its true light.  What has happened?  We were only six weeks into the new year when the INPC announced that because of the new purchasing situation they could reduce the price of petrol by 15p, not the 2.8p the Government are talking about.  However, the reaction of the Government was that they would take the 15p, that they would build up a &ldquo;slush fund&rdquo; and that they would not pass it on to the consumer.  These were the people who shouted from high heaven about the imposition of an extra 2.8p but three months later, when the situation arose <Col N="1712" /> that 15p could be given back to the consumer, they did not want to know.</P>
      <P>It is similar to the hysteria which they created during the election that old people were dying because they could not afford to pay the charge of £5 for a hospital bed and because certain drugs were removed from the list.  There will be problems in any scheme which is brought in but if the vested interests which created that hysteria wanted to adopt a Christian and humane attitude nobody would suffer. What happened to the people?  Did they die?  We did not hear anything about that.  I do not think the Government returned the 900 items to the medical list. It is difficult to analyse the standards of politicians and the way things are represented or misrepresented.</P>
      <P>The Government, who get tight around the neck when they are criticised, have to take the rap now.  They are the Government and they have to govern.  It is the last chance they will get for a long time.  We know what they did to small farmers.  They are bringing them into the tax net.  Small farmers will now have to fill in forms and so on.  What will be the result?  Do we introduce taxation systems to collect revenue or to annoy people? Time and again we have brought in tax systems which collect nothing but cost a fortune to administer.  At the end of the day they are thrown out.  The taxation of small farmers is one such system.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that agriculture needs all the help it can get but what did the Government do for it?  They suspended the farm modernisation scheme and increased inflation.  The Coalition Government will hold the record for inflation.  When they last went out of office it was 23 per cent.  Mr. Richie Ryan held the record during the mid-seventies and if you are in for long enough yourselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am constructive when I am left alone but when I am interrupted I can be destructive.  When I am interrupted I give as good as I get.  This budget is the wrong one for our economy.  It will do nothing for employment or inflation. It is the wrong economic strategy.  I am aware that we are in a world recession and I know there are problems which have to be solved.  I know there are problems which the Government cannot solve, no matter which Government are in power, but they must cut their cloth according to their measure.  It is the duty of the Government to get the right balance and to chart the proper course for the economy.  This budget does not do that.  It is the wrong balance and will totally depress the economy and consumer demand.  It will play havoc with the construction industry in which at the end of the year one in every two people will be out of a job.</P>
      <P>There is no incentive for employment. Incentives in relation to work experience in the service industry and the hotel industry have been taken away.  The VAT increases will play havoc with the tourist industry.  When one pays a bill in a hotel today one pays 40 per cent before paying anything on the bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the budget £9.1 million is being spent on the Stationery Office on paper and pens.  There is no employment incentive scheme on which £9.1 million is being spent.  We have a Youth Employment Agency but the money is being spent in the wrong direction.  It should be put at the disposal of young people in industry, regional colleges and universities who have brains and ideas but have not the wherewithal to get a small business going. The funds would be better spent than they are at present.  To date the money has been spent on small environmental schemes such as pulling nettles in a graveyard and cleaning out shores which have become blocked.  That is not the way to <Col N="1715" /> spend hard-earned taxpayers' money. We are not getting value for money.</P>
    <P>I expected some innovation from the Taoiseach who projected the image that he had all the answers and new ideas.  I expected it from the Minister for Finance.  Perhaps we will see it next year if they last long enough to bring in a budget. If they do it will be the last one they will ever bring in.

In 1983 the philosophy and thinking in Fine Gael <Col N="1716" /> has not changed.  You have the same answer as you had in 1954: send them all out on the emigrant ship.

      <P>Ba maith liom ar dtús cúpla focal a ráth faoin cháinaisnéis maidir le Roinn na Gaeltachta. Faoi mar is eol dúinn uile tá fadhbanna troma airgeadais againn i láthair na huaire, fadhbanna a dhéanfaidh dochar mór dúinn uile mura dtabharfar go díocasach faoina réiteach anois.  Tá a fhios ag gach duine freisin nach i mbliana ná anuraidh a thosaigh cúrsaí airgeadais na tíre leo ag dul le fán.  Le fírinne cuireadh síolta na cáinaisnéise seo deich mbliana siar nuair a méadaíodh chomh mór sin ar phraghsanna íle.  Rinneadh iarrachtaí i lár na seachtóidí, ach go háirithe, chun réiteach a fháil ar na fadhbanna sin ach, faraor, éiríodh astu agus chuathas i muinín iasachtaí airgid leis an gcaighdeán maireachtála a bhí againn a choimeád ag an leibhéal ag a raibh sé agus go deimhin, b'é páirtí Fhianna Fáil an páirtí atá freagrach as sin.  Chuir na méaduithe ollmhóra i bpraghas íle sa tréimhse 1979-80 go mór lenár ndeacrachtaí ach arís níor glacadh ar deis chun cúrsaí a chur ina gceart.  Tuilleadh iasachtaí fós chun éalú ón ngátar a bhí ag brú orainn an leigheas a tharraingeamar chugainn féin.  Ach bíonn ús agus ús trom le híoc ar iasachtaí agus ní féidir uair na ciniúna a chur siar go deo.  Ní raibh de rogha ag an Rialtas seo i mbliana ach an tír a ligint le fán a thuilleadh nó dúshlán na faidhbe a thabhairt agus iarracht mhacánta a dhéanamh lena réiteach.  Is iarracht mhacánta atá sa cháinaisnéis seo chun <Col N="1718" /> cúrsaí airgeadais na tíre a chur ar chosán a réitithe.</P>
      <P>Is í an phríomhaidhm atá leis an gcáinaisnéis seo ná bonn buan a chur faoi eacnamaíocht na tíre agus na toscaí a sholáthar a chuirfidh poist nua ar fáil de réir mar a fheadhsóidh cúrsaí, go háirithe do na daoine óga.  Cuimhnímis freisin d'ainneoin a dhéine atá an cháinaisnéis go mbeidh orainn fós corradh le £1,700 milliún a fháil ar iasacht i mbliana.  Cé gur lú de £200 milliún é sin ná méid na n-iasachtaí sa bhliain 1982 is suim ollmhór fós é agus is ualach an-trom é don todhchaí.  Is léir nach sárófar fadhbanna na tíre seo mura dtuigfidh an pobal i gcoitinne géarchéim na faidhbe agus mura mebeidh siad sásta comhoibriú leis an Rialtas leis na fadhbanna seo a réiteach.</P>
      <P>Bhí dhá rogha ann dá bhrí sin: caiteachas an Rialtais a laghdú nó cánacha a mhéadú.  Dá gclóifí le méadú cánacha amháin ní fada go sroichfí leibhéal cánach a bheadh as alt ar fad.  Ní raibh dul as dá bhrí sin ach tarraingt ar an dá rogha agus tá de thoradh leis sin ar ndóigh go mb'éigean an t-airgead atá ar fáil do na Ranna éagsúla a laghdú go mór.</P>
      <P>D'ainneoin na bhfadhbanna sin bhí áthas orm gur éirigh liom thart ar £19.5 milliún a fháil ón Rialtas i mbliana lena chaitheamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeilge.  Den £19.5 milliún sin tá suas le dhá-thrian de á chur ar fáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Cinnte tá laghdú san airgead a bheidh le caitheamh ag an Roinn agus ag an Údarás i mbliana i gcomparáid leis an méid a caitheadh anuraidh ach ní beag an tsuim airgid é £19.5 milliún ag féachaint do ghéarchéim airgeadais an Stát-Chiste.  Cé go gcaithfear a adhmháil go mbeidh airgead gann i mbliana, táim sásta go mbeifear in ann dul chun cinn maith a dhéanamh leis an soláthar atá curtha ar fáil ach úsáid choigilteach, stuama a bhaint as.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beidh suas le £13 milliún le fáil ag Údarás na Gaeltachta i mbliana.  Leis an teacht isteach a bhíonn ag an údarás féin ó fhoinsí éagsúla, i.e., ó chíosanna agus ó Chiste Sóisialta na hEorpa, beidh breis agus £1 milliún in aghaidh na míosa ar fáil ag an eagraíocht le caitheamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht.  Ní beag an <Col N="1719" /> méid airgid é sin táim ag súil go mbeidh ar chumas an Údaráis dul chun cinn maith a dhéanamh leis.  Bhéinn ag súil leis ach go háirithe go ndéanfaí gach dícheall chun acmhainní nádúrtha na Gaeltachta e.g., iascaireacht, foraoiseacht, móin, feamainn, turasóireacht etc. a fhorbairt oiread is féidir.  Sna laethanta seo tá sé níos tábhachtaí ná riamh luach a fháil ar an airgead a chaitear.</P>
    <P>Is é sin a bhí i gceist agam anuraidh nuair a mhínigh mé sa Dáil go raibh sé beartaithe breathnú isteach i gcúrsaí an Údaráis chun a fháil amach cén chaoi a d'fhéadfadh an Rialtas cabhrú leis an eagraíocht sin ina gcuid oibre.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol don Teach bíonn constaicí móra le sárú ag an Údarás d'fhonn tionscnaimh fhiúntacha a mhealladh chun na Gaeltachta.  Is é atá i gceist agam go príomha ná an iargúltacht ó mhargaí deacrachtaí cumarsáide le custaiméirí agus le soláthraitheóirí, agus easpa áiseanna ó thaobh an bhunstruchtúir de. Anuas air sin níl aon mhaolú mórán tag-tha ar an gcúlú eacnamaíochta domhanda. D'ainneoin sin, d'éirigh leis an Údarás cur leis an bhfostaíocht lánaimsire sna tionscail faoina scáth, i.e., ó thart ar 4,000 duine ag deireadh 1981 go dtí breis is 4,100 duine ag deireadh 1982.  Is dul chun cinn maith é sin sna cúinsí agus tréaslaím leis an Údarás dá bharr.</P>
    <P>Tá feidhmeanna eile ag an Údarás seachas poist a chruthú do mhuintir na Gaeltachta: tá dualgas reachtúil orthu i leith na Gaeilge mar shampla.  Chuige sin, bíonn iarrachtaí leanúnacha ar siúl chun úsáid na Gaeilge a leathnú sna tionscail a fhaigheann cúnamh ón Údarás, oiltear cainteoirí dúchais Ghaeilge do phoist mar bhainisteóirí i dtionscnaimh Ghaeltacha agus tugtar cúnamh agus tacaíocht d'ógchlubanna agus do naíonraí sa Ghaeltacht agus, ar ndóigh, reachtáiltear an Comórtas Forbartha Pobail.  Tá brú ar an nGaeilge ó gach aon taobh na laethanta seo agus fáiltím roimh na hiarrachtaí seo a bhfuil sé mar aidhm acu an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú agus a leathadh mar ghnáthmheán cumarsáide sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag súil go mbeadh plean cuimsitheach don Ghaeltacht ar fáil ón <Col N="1720" /> Údarás.  Tuigim go bhfuil siad ag obair ar phlean agus go mbeidh sé agam sar i bhfad.  Leis an ngéarchéim airgeadais atá ann níor mhaith liom go sílfeadh aon duine go bhféadfaí plean mór costasach a chur i bhfeidhm láithreach ach dá mbeadh plean ciallmhar ar fáil d'fhéadfaí díriú ar na gnéithe is tábhachtaí agus iad a chur i gcrích de réir a chéile.</P>
    <P>Tá obair thábhachtach ar siúl ag mo Roinnse chun leas cultúrtha, sóisialach agus eacnamaíoch na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn tríd an gcabhair a thugtar ar mhaithe le cúrsaí tithíochta, scéimeanna feabhsúcháin, agus na scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialacha a reachtáiltear d'fhonn muintir na Gaeltachta a ghríosadh chun an Ghaeilge a choimeád beo bríomhar mar theanga theaghlaigh agus mar theanga phobail ina gceantair.</P>
    <P>Ceapadh na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin chun feabhas a chur ar shaoráidí éagsúla ar fud na Gaeltachta.  I measc na saoráidí a gcuirtear cabhair ar fáil dóibh tá bóithre áise agus bóithre portaigh, scéimeanna uisce agus séarachais, muiroibreacha, hallaí agus coláistí Gaeilge, áiseanna chaitheamh aimsire, cabhair do chomharchumainn etc.  Faraor tá an ciste a bhíodh ar fáil do bhóithre laghdaithe go mór i mbliana i gcaoi nach mbeifear in ann ach freastal ar bhóithre a bhí ceadaithe ach nach raibh críochnaithe anuraidh. Is trua gur mar sin áta ach b'éigean laghduithe a dhéanamh i ngeall ar an drochstaid airgeadais.</P>
    <P>Ó tharla go bhfuil an soláthar do chúrsaí tithíochta laghdaithe go dtí £1 milliún i mbliana ní bheidh dul as ach deontais áirithe a chur ar fionraí.  Ní chuirfear ar fionraí, áfach, ach na deontais is lú a chuirfidh as do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Is é an deontas don dara teach agus an deontas do sheallaí saoire atá i gceist agam.  Féachfar chuige, áfach, go leanfar de na deontais eile i gcaoi go mbeidh ar chumas mhuintir na Gaeltachta tithe compórdacha a bheith acu.</P>
    <P>Tá £1,383,000 á chur ar fáil i mbliana do na scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialacha a bhíonn á reachtáil ag Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is é an ceann is tábhachtaí agus is costasaí de na scéimeanna seo ná scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge faoina n-íocann <Col N="1721" /> mo Roinnse deontais díreach le mná tí cáilithe sa Ghaeltacht a mbíonn foghlaimeoirí aitheanta ar iostas acu.  Bhí ar mo chumas anuraidh an deontas sin a mhéadú go dtí £2.25 in aghaidh an lae do gach dalta ach le cúrsaí airgeadais mar atá bhí orm cloí leis an socrú a bhí déanta sular ceapadh mé i.e., nach bhféadfaí méadú a thabhairt i mbliana.  Ar ndóigh, níl sa deontas sin ach cuid den teacht isteach a bhíonn ag dukl do na mná tí i leith na bhfoghlaimeoirí; bíonn an chuid eile le fáil ó lucht na gcoláistruí gaeilge a fhaigheann táillí cuí ó na tuismitheoirí.  Is mian liomsa go mbeidh luach saothair maith ag na mná tí a chuireann cóiríocht mhaith ar fáil do na daltaí agus is gnó do na coláistí táillí cuí a ghearradh ar na tuismitheoirí.</P>
    <P>Caitear cuid mhaith airgid freisin ar an dá nuachtán sheachtainiúla <i>Inniu</i> agus <i>Amárach.</i> Níl éileamh mór ar cheachtar díobh sin agus níl ar mo chumas, agus cúrsaí airgeadais mar atá, an cúnamh a bheadh ag teastáil ón dá nuachtán a chur ar fáil dóibh.</P>
    <P>Faoi láthair is ionann an deontas Stáit agus 55-60 faoin gcéad de theacht isteach iomlán <i>Amárach</i> agus tá an céatadán níos airde fós i gcás <i>Inniu.</i> Beidh mé i gcomhairle go luath leis an dá nuachtán chun an scéal ar fad a phlé leo agus caithfear cinneadh a dhéanamh, gan mhoill, ar céard is fearr a dhéanamh leis an bhfadhb seo a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Chun leas cheantar Ghaeltachta a chur chun cinn is deacair córas níos fearr a cheapadh ná comharchumann áitiúil ach é a bheith ag feidhmiú go héifeachtúil. Cothaíonn comharchumann féinmhuinín sa phobal agus tugann sé deis do na daoine comhoibriú le chéile ar mhaithe lena gceantar féin &mdash; gan a bheith ag brath ar dhaoine ón taobh amuigh nach mbeadh an tuiscint chéanna do na deacrachtaí acu.  Ba chóir go mbeadh tionchar an-mhór ag comharchumann i bhforbairt iomlán a cheantair feidhme &mdash; forbairt eacnamaíoch agus sóisialach chomh maith le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus an chultúir dhúchais.</P>
    <P>Is i ngeall ar na dualgais bhreise sin a shocraigh mé anuraidh go gcuirfí dóthain airgid ar fáil lena chinntiú go méadófaí go suntasach na deontais reachtála a <Col N="1722" /> íoctar leis na comharchumainn sin a bhfuil plean fiúntach leagtha amach agus á chur i bhfeidhm go dúthrachtach acu chun a gcuid gníomhaíochtaí a chur ar bhonn sásúil gnó agus an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ina gceantair.  Tá socraithe agam go mbeidh dóthain airgid ar fáil arís i mbliana chun na deontais sin a choimeád ar an leibheál céanna.</P>
    <P>Ag an am céanna caithfidh comhar-chumainn&mdash;agus dreamanna nach iad &mdash;a aithint go bhfuil teorainn leis an gcúnamh is féidir leis an Stát a thabhairt dóibh: is iad féin a bhíonn i mbun oibre ar an láthair agus is orthu atá an cúram féachaint chuige go mbeidh eagar ceart ar na gníomhaíochtaí a bhíonn idir lámha acu.</P>
    <P>Tá Bord na Gaeilge ag feidhmiú ón mbliain 1975 ar aghaidh agus tá cúram trom leagtha air.  Baineann an cúram sin, ar ndóigh, le mórchuspóir tábhachtach náisiúnta atá chomh fairsing agus chomh hiltaobhach le saol an phobail.  Ní foláir don Bhord comhghuaillíocht fheidhmiúil a bhaint amach on gcóras Stáit uile ar a n-áirítear Ranna Rialtais, eagrais Státtionscanta agus ó iliomad dreamanna eile ar ndóigh: ina measc siúd tá muintir na Gaeltachta féin, na heagrais Ghaeilge, eaglaisí, comhlachtaí gnó, ceard-chumainn, eagrais fheirmeoireachta, institiúidí oideachais, lucht siamsaíochta agus drámaíochta, foilsitheoirí, nuachtóirí, iriseoirí, agus soláthróirí seirbhísí den uile chineá.  Go gairid is féidir a rá go bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar an mBord freastal chomh fada agus is féidir ar an bpobal uile.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol don Teach seo tá plean gníomhaíochta ceithre bliana, a d'ullmhaigh Bord na Gaeilge, á scrúdú i mo Roinnse faoi láthair i gcomhairle leis na Ranna Stáit eile.  Tá dóchas agam go mbeidh an plean sin á chur i láthair an phobail gan mhoill.  Is fíor a rá gur i gcomhar le hinstitiúidí uile na tíre a athshlánófar an teanga agus tá súil agam go mbeidh comhoibriú fial le fáil nuair a bheidh plean Bhord na Gaeilge á chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Tá áit ar leith ag na heagrais Ghaeilge ar ndóigh, san obair atá ar siúl ag an mbord agus tá sé fíor-riachtanach go mbeadh comhoibriú iomlán eatarthu. <Col N="1723" /> Beidh an plean ag iarraidh cur leis na hiarrachtaí uile atá ar siúl cheana féin ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge ar fud na tíre agus iad a chomhordú i dtreo go bhféadfar tarraingt in aon mhóriarracht amháin ar mhaithe le cur chun cinn na teanga.  Tá dóchas agam go mbeidh toradh fiúntach ar a n-iarrachtaí.</P>
    <P>Tá an-áthas ormgur thoiligh an Rialtas soláthar £1,900,000 a chur ar fáil i mbliana i Vóta mo Roinn-se mar chabhair chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ar fud na tíre.  Sin méadú 5.8 faoin gcéad ar sholáthar na bliana anuraidh.  Ioctar cabhair as Chiste na Gaeilge le Bord na Gaeilge agus le heagrais áirithe Ghaeilge. Is iad na heagrais atá i gceist ná Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, Gael-Linn, Conradh na Gaeilge, an tOireachtas, an Comhlachas Náisiúnta Drámaíochta, Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe, Amharclann Ghaoth Dobhair, Cumann na bhFiann agus an Gael-Acadamh.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh na heagrais sin ag treisiú a gcuid iarrachtaí ar mhaithe leis an teanga nuair a fhoilseofar plean Bhord na Gaeilge go luath amach anseo. Cé go bhfuil obair mhaith déanta acu, measaim go bhféadfaí dul chun cinn níos fiúntaí fós a dhéanamh dá mbeidís uile ag obair níos fearr i gcomhar le chéile ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge.  Is mithid teacht ar shlite chun an chomhoirnú sin a chinntiú. Dá bhféadfaí é sin a dhéanamh, chuirfí leis an iarracht an Ghaeilge a chur ar bhonn ceart agus bheadh i bhfad níos mó rath ar a gcuid oibre.</P>
    <P>Turning to fisheries, I should like to point out that approximately £20 million has been provided in the Fisheries Estimate for the current year.  That is a significant sum in any circumstances and particularly in the present financial situation in which we find ourselves.  I have been quoted recently in a newspaper report as saying that the Exchequer did not have any money for fishermen but, as I pointed out, approximately £20 million is already available for the development of the fishing industry this year.  My reported statement was in response to a request for a direct operating subsidy for fishermen, which is a completely different <Col N="1724" /> matter.  By and large State aid to the fishing industry&mdash;both sea and inland &mdash;over the years has been generous in relation to the availability of resources and the size of the industry and the situation in the current year is similar.  Naturally, I would like to be in a position to provide increased funds for the industry but unfortunately this is not possible.</P>
    <P>The EEC recently reached agreement on a Common Fisheries Policy after several years of negotiation.  When I became Minister for Fisheries the negotiations were at an advanced stage and it was too late to obtain any worthwhile concessions for our fishing industry.  Having said that, however, I must say that despite its shortcomings the agreement was the best available to us.  Everybody had to make concessions to enable an agreement to be reached.</P>
    <P>Reaching an agreement at this point was essential because of the expiry of the derogation in relation to access contained in the Treaty of Accession.  It was also important to relieve the industry of the uncertainty which has prevailed for several years.  There is now an opportunity to plan for the years ahead with a clear understanding of the opportunities available and the problems to be faced.  I do not accept that a larger injection of State funds is necessary to enable the fishing industry to develop.  Considerable progress can be made by placing greater emphasis on marketing, improved efficiency and greater co-operation within the industry itself.  It is also important that the available resources are used to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to talk at length about the Common Fisheries Policy &mdash; it would not be appropriate in a budget debate. However, there is one aspect of the agreement to which I feel I should refer in some detail because of various comments which have been made in the media.  I refer to quotas and in particular to the percentage of the total available fish allocated to Ireland.</P>
    <P>A lot of play has been made of the &ldquo;fact&rdquo; that despite having 25 per cent of the total area of water under the fishing jurisdiction of EEC member states, Ireland is being allocated quotas of only <Col N="1725" /> around 4 per cent of the total fish available in the Community under the newly-agreed Common Fisheries Policy. This kind of statement is very misleading however, and does not take account of a number of pertinent factors.  Firstly it makes no allowance for the fact that the bulk of the fish in the Community &ldquo;pond&rdquo; occurs in areas such as the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Skageraak-Kattegat where we have not habitually fished and because of the distances involved are never likely to fish nor for the fact that some of the stocks regarded as Community stocks are off Greenland and North America.  Secondly, it takes no account of the huge differences in stock levels as between the waters adjacent to Ireland and, for example, the North Sea where the fish-bearing capacity of the sea is very much greater.  Thirdly, it takes no account of the fact that in some areas such as the Irish Sea a large part of the present Irish catch is taken in waters outside our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Taking into account only those stocks subject to quota and which are located partly or wholly in Irish waters it has been estimated that the Irish proportionate share of these stocks, based on the total Irish sea area as a proportion of the total sea area inhabited by each stock, comes to 103,817 tonnes expressed in standardised cod equivalent whereas the Irish quotas on those same stocks comprise a total of 89,151 tonnes or 86 per cent.  The total Community stocks of the species in question, that is the main commercial species, cod, haddock, saithe, whiting, plaice, sole, hake, mackerel and herring, comprises 1,708,922 tonnes of cod equivalent so that it can readily be seen that the 103,817 tonnes of those stocks attributable to the Irish 200 mile zone comprises 5 per cent of the total.  This demonstrates that the Irish quota allocations are much more in line with an entitlement on the basis of our total sea area and the fish stocks contained therein than the use of a figure of 25 per cent of total EEC sea area would suggest.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the agreement on a Common Fisheries Policy will help to bring stability to our sea fishing industry. It will, I hope, also bring investment, <Col N="1726" /> especially in secondary processing.  That is an area that offers the best prospect of increased employment and an increased return to the national economy.  Promoters of properly planned and developed secondary fish processing projects can rest assured of the support of my Department, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the IDA or Údarás na Gaeltachta, as appropriate, for such projects.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention to put greater emphasis on market research and market development in the future.  It is unfortunate that rising fuel prices, over which we have no control, and falling fish prices, which have arisen mainly because of EEC marketing policy in the past, have borne heavily on the fishing industry.  With the introduction of the new EEC marketing policy and through the efforts of BIM in association with the trade I am confident that substantial increases can be achieved in fish prices in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I must also refer to the recent increase in interest rates announced by BIM.  This increase was unavoidable in the light of the level of the Grant-in-Aid to BIM contained in the Estimates prepared by the previous Government and accepted by the present Government.  It must be pointed out, however, that the present facilities for boat purchase and modernisation still compare more favourably with those available in other EEC countries.  The new interest rates themselves&mdash;11 per cent loans from BIM and a rate of 2½ per cent below the bank rate in the case of guaranteed bank loans&mdash; are more favourable than those available to most, if not all, other sectors.</P>
    <P>There is a great need to protect and develop our valuable inland fisheries. The Government are very conscious of the value and potential of these fisheries from an anemity and tourist viewpoint. I am examining existing conservation policy in this area and I am also examining ways and means of improving our inland fisheries protection service which involves the regional fisheries boards, the Naval Service and the Garda Sióchána.</P>
    <P>Recent newspaper reports suggest that BIM are unreasonably attempting to resume fishing boats from fishermen who are in arrears with their repayments.  I <Col N="1727" /> have said on a number of occasions, and I repeat now, that I am satisfied that BIM's approach to this problem is that when a fisherman is making genuine efforts to meet his financial commitments he will be treated by the board with sympathy and understanding.  However, I would like to make it quite clear that there can be no blanket concessions on arrears.  Each case much be dealt with on its merits.</P>
    <P>Finally on the question of fisheries, I would like to refer to the prospects for mariculture development.  Some progress has been made but there is a need for greater urgency in this area.  Grants are available from both BIM and the EEC for this purpose and EEC aid is now guaranteed for at least a three year period.  Promoters wishing to develop in this field will be given full support by way of advice and guidance in addition to financial aid by my Department and the State agencies involved.</P>
    <P>In relation to forestry, the percentage of afforested land in Ireland is about 5 per cent, which is low compared with other EEC countries.  Other countries with a higher rate of afforestation include Belgium, 20 per cent; Denmark, 11 per cent; France, 27 per cent; and Luxembourg, 32 per cent.  Of the area afforested in Ireland nearly 86 per cent is owned by the State which is the reverse of the situation in other EEC countries where private forestry is predominant.  As well as continuing the State afforestation programme, expansion of private forestry is being actively encouraged.  The total area of land held by the Forest and Wildlife Service amounts to some 378,000 hectares of which 304,000 hectares is under forest.  While the policy objective continues to be a planting programme of 10,000 hectares per year, the current land reserve position is such that at present and for a few years ahead an annual planting programme of 7,500 hectares, including private forestry and reafforestation, is seen as the most realistic practical proposition.  However, efforts are continuing to build up a land reserve for the Forest and Wildlife Service through <Col N="1728" /> the acquisition process with a view to achieving an annual programme of 10,000 hectares as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Difficulties in regard to the acquisition of land for forestry purposes in recent years have resulted in a very low reserve of plantable land at present.  However there is an imbalance in the distribtion of the area available and this in turn inevitably causes problems in relation to such aspects as advance planning of the planting programme, maintaining employment and so on.  There are now indications that the climate for land acquisition for afforestation has changed substantially for the better and the objective will be to increase the land reserve as quickly as possible through acquisition of new properties.  To this end, notwithstanding current financial restraints, a generous allocation of funds will be made available by the Government from the Exchequer for the current year 1983.</P>
    <P>While progress to date in State afforestation has on the whole been satisfactory, the contribution made by the private sector to the national afforestation programme has been somewhat disappointing. There are, of course, historical reasons for the failure of the private sector to expand the area of private forestry, but there have been some encouraging signs that attitudes are beginning to change and that with the State aids available substantial progress will be made in private forestry in the years to come.  The private forestry sector can be assured of every support in its operations from the Forest and Wildlife Service by way of grants and a free advisory service.  Apart from the ordinary planting grant scheme, every effort will be made to generate wider interest and participation in the forestry element of the western package. This scheme was introduced to encourage any expansion of forestry on lands marginal for agriculture but suitable for forestry in Counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Monaghan, Longford, Cavan, Clare, Roscommon, Kerry and parts of Limerick and Cork.  Grants of up to 85 per cent of the cost are available, subject to a maximum of £800 per hectare.  In addition to the grants, a free advisory service is available for all participants. <Col N="1729" /> Progress of the scheme to date has been slow, but 112 schemes covering some 500 hectares have qualified for grants exceeding £240,000.  Grants of £125 per acre, together with a free technical advisory service, will continue to be available for private planting not qualifying under the western package scheme.</P>
    <P>The capital investment by the State, especially over the last three or four decades, in the expansion of the national forest estate has created a natural resource of considerable potential.  The benefits of this are already emerging and from now on the forest harvest will provide major opportunities not only for national and regional economic development but also for the substitution of imported wood and wood products by native-grown timber.  The State afforestation programme makes an extensive impact on regional development in the more remote areas and direct employment is provided for about 2,700 men in areas where alternative employment might otherwise be hard to find.  When the families of forest workers are taken into account it can be said that between 10,000 and 12,000 people depend for their welfare on the State afforestation programme.  In addition to those directly employed in afforestation a further 1,750 people are engaged in private sector saw-milling and related activities.  As the forests mature and the supply of sawlog timber increases we can look forward to a substantial increase in the number employed in this sector.  About 300 people are engaged in pulpwood processing of forest fillings and small sawlog, and this figure will continue to increase by up to a further 450 people when the medium density fibreboard plant now being constructed at Clonmel comes into operation in the near future.</P>
    <P>The employment potential of forest industry as based on the produce of Irish forests is quite considerable.  Timber output from State forests will double over the present decade and redouble during the nineties to reach 3 million cubic metres by the year 2000.  Two-thirds of the output will be accounted for by sawlog, which is, of course, the most valuable component of forest produce in terms of <Col N="1730" /> revenue generation and employment creation.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive plan in regard to the processing of the ever-increasing supply of timber from the State forest is already being implemented.  This plan, entitled <i>Developing the Timber Industry in the 1980s,</i> was formulated by the IDA and the Forest and Wildlife Service following an intensive survey designed to ensure that the maximum benefits are obtained from future supplies of timber.  The objective is to achieve import substitution to the value of £40 million a year as the national supply of sawlog coming on stream permits.</P>
    <P>To achieve the maximum benefit from import substitution, steps are being taken to up-grade the quality and presentation of Irish timber to ensure that it compares favourably with imported products.  The research services of the Forest Products Division of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards are co-operating with the Forest and Wildlife Service in the promotion of a better image for home grown timber and the establishment of standards for native sawnwood usage. The physical properties and drying characteristics of Irish timber are also being investigated and it is hoped to develop an inexpensive stress grader to encourage mechanical grading of home grown sawnwood.</P>
    <P>The size of the potential market for the substitution of imported timber by home grown timber is very large.  An analysis of imported timber in 1981 shows that, excluding furniture, well over £240 million of the imported wood and wood products could be replaced by species of trees that are being grown successfully in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As I said already, sawlog is the main and most valuable form of wood produced in our forests.  From it sawn softwood is produced by the many sawmills throughout the country.  Much of this is similar to sawn softwood imported in very large quantities, and at not inconsiderable cost to the balance of payments, from Scandinavia, Russia and Canada. The total annual consumption in recent years was roughly 500,000 m³ valued at approximately £50 million.  The amount <Col N="1731" /> of Irish timber sold to the same market amounted to only little more than 100,000 m³ or only 20 per cent of total consumption with an equivalent value of £10 million.  At the same time nearly one-third of the timber produced by the Forest Service remained unsold because of market bias in favour of imported timber. I am quite satisfied that much of this bias is not well founded.  A sizeable proportion of sawnwood produced in Irish sawmills compares favourably in quality and price with imported timber.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that timber is an area which offers increasing scope for import substitution.  It is my intention to explore, in consultation with other Ministers concerned, what can be done to overcome many of the barriers and prejudices which undoubtedly exist at present.  I should stress, however, that there is a limit to what can be achieved at official level.  At best this can succeed only in easing regulatory restrictions or encouraging and exhorting greater use of Irish timber.  In the final analysis success in this field depends on the response from specifiers, buyers and users of timber.  We are living in exceptional times and I would appeal to all concerned to take exceptional measures to do everything they can to secure a larger market share for Irish timber with a view to safeguarding the long-term interests of the entire timber industry.</P>
    <P>While the main objective of the State forestry programme is the growing of sawlog timber, the Forest and Wildlife Service is keeping in touch with developments in the field of biomass or renewable energy resources derived from conventional forestry or the growing of specialised forest energy crops, such as poplars or alders.  However, developments in this sphere are largely experimental and it is still too early to draw firm conclusions from them.</P>
    <P>The functions of State forestry have been expanded in recent years beyond the mere production of timber.  The aims of the Forest and Wildlife Service now include, in addition to timber production, the provision of amenity and recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> There are now nine forest parks throughout the country.  In addition, over 400 forest areas have been developed as part of an &ldquo;open forest&rdquo; policy designed to encourage the use of public amenities and recreation in State forests.  Amenities provided include car parks, picnic areas, viewing points and signposted walks. More than 1.5 million visitors, many from abroad, now avail themselves of the forest amenities in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The provision of a complex of wooden holiday chalets is under way at Killykeen Forest Park, County Cavan.  The development, which will use native timber throughout, is being funded by the European Regional Development Fund. When completed it is expected that it will prove to be a major attraction in the region to visiting anglers wishing to use Lough Oughter and also to family holidaymakers anxious to relax in a pleasant environment of woodland and lake.  This holiday chalet project reflects a further extension of the Department's objective to develop recreation for the public in State forests.</P>
    <P>The work of the Forest and Wildlife Service in the field of nature conservation is continuing satisfactorily, given the present restrictive financial climate.</P>
    <P>Research into wildlife habitats and species is one of the major elements of the programme of work in the area.  I hope to have research initiated on a number of what may be termed &ldquo;problem&rdquo; species &mdash; for example, seals and mink&mdash;and studies will continue on species for which the FWS have a special responsibility, such as the Greenland white-fronted goose and red deer.</P>
    <P>The Forest and Wildlife Service have identified a number of sites of different types of ecosystems around the country, particularly peatland areas, which are worthy of nature reserve status.  However, most of these sites are privately owned and progress on affording them statutory protection will be slow in view of the high cost of acquiring them or of entering into management agreements with the owners.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless I am pleased to say that 12 nature reserves have been established to date.  These are mainly woodland <Col N="1733" /> reserves on State forest property and the number of such reserves will likely be increased during the year.</P>
    <P>Public demand for information on native wildlife is met by distributing educational material and in the coming year this material will be expanded to deal with the increased awareness of, and interest in, the subject.</P>
    <P>The Wildlife Ranger Corps, who continue to enforce the protective provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976, also play a significant role in fostering an enlightened approach to conservation by their efforts at local level.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that wildlife conservation has wide international implications. The Forest and Wildlife Service have continued to participate in various international initiatives in the field of nature conservation, both at EEC level and as a wider front, and every effort is being made to comply with the various directives, regulations and conventions which have emerged in recent years and which are aimed at safeguarding different wildlife aspects relating to species or habitat.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is fashionable in any debate on the budget for the Government side to praise it and for the Opposition side to criticise it.  The House goes through the motions on all occasions and tradition is upheld.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of repetition from both sides of the House particularly when one side are supporting and the other side are opposing it.  There is some good in all budgets and some improvements are made.  It is recognised that this budget is one of the harshest any Government have brought before the House.  I am afraid the improvements will be nil.</P>
      <P>I would like to put forward some of my thoughts on the budget and, hopefully, give some constructive criticism of the budget we are dealing with.  In his introduction to the budget on 9 February last the Minister for Finance emphasised the obvious, that we are in the grip of a severe recession.  We are fully conscious of that and also that the world is going through a severe economic recession.  The Minister then said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The natural reaction to this situation would be to prepare a budget which <Col N="1735" /> would give a fiscal stimulus to the economy.</P>
    <P>Later in the same paragraph he said:</P>
    <P>The Government have concluded that this course is not open to us.</P>
    <P>This natural reaction should not have been so easily dismissed.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Government are far too concerned with fiscal rectitude. We all know that the economy is depressed but if one treats the economy only as a matter of money, figures and statistics, then tight fiscal control is one extreme option or, at the other end, there is the option of the gambler to borrow more and double up.  These are the two options if one is only treating figures, statistics and economic numbers but an economy is much more than that.  Our economy is our land, property and, above all, our people.</P>
    <P>The immediate aim, because of this, of any economic plan or any budget is to provide meaningful employment.  Work is the obvious immediate need for the vast majority of our under-25 population. This is so true that it rings out like a cliché but it is a fact.  The main priority of any bookkeeping exercise, any fiscal policy of any budget, must be to get meaningful productive employment for the growing number of unemployed.  The main priority of the Government should have been to ensure that the thousands of young people who, unfortunately, are unemployed obtain employment as soon as possible.  There should have been some initiative in the budget to ensure that all the people who are unemployed could see some future for them.</P>
    <P>When young people leave school and do not find any job opportunities available to them they are left in dire straits. If those people after leaving secondary school or vocational school at the age of 17 years or 18 years see no future for them I wonder what those people will think after being left two or three years without a job?  I would like to emphasise that studies on the unemployed in Britain by sociologists have startlingly pointed out that after three years the people who <Col N="1736" /> have never worked become unemployable. Those potential workers are weakened as people and will never fully develop as people.  They will never be in a position to fulfill their God-given right to contribute by their talents to society. Those people then become broken people in care.  It does not matter how hard up our economy is, how much we owe abroad, our bookkeepers and bankers have a duty to provide secure employment for those at work and, more importantly, to provide work for those who have not yet worked.  If our unemployed and our unemployable grow by 17,000 people per year there will be no repayment of any loan, national or international. We will not even have a stagnant economy.  I cannot see anything but a stangnant economy for the next 12 months because of the budget proposals of 9 February.  Our economy and our potential will be dead.</P>
    <P>The Government have got to get the EEC member states to face this and they have got to get the money bags of the internationals to accept this.  It is clear to me from many phrases and sentences in the budget speech that the Government have not clearly realised the urgency of job creation for the people.  The main thrust of the Government policy reflected in the budget is not towards making the unemployed employable.  It is an exercise in bookkeeping and a stubborn effort at fiscal rectitude.  The attitude of the Minister is revealed in many passages of his budget speech especially where he blames the impact of the recession.  In one place he implies that the recession is the biggest factor causing unemployment unmatched since the early thirties.  We must face our problems and try to solve them ourselves.</P>
    <P>We differ from nearly all other countries in having the fastest growing work force in Europe.  It is even more imperative for us to concentrate immediately on making employment available.  Naturally we are experiencing our slice of the international recession but the answers to our problems do not lie only in severe fiscal rectitude measures, in more stringent taxation or in shunning entirely the notion of borrowing.  This Government <Col N="1737" /> could have adopted a balanced approach in this budget.  At the outset of his statement the Minister admitted that he was not giving a fiscal stimulus to the economy.  Does this attitude not involve the risk of the budget having the opposite effect from what it should be designed for&mdash;to indicate that we have the will to make the necessary adjustments and to live within our means in order to tackle imediately what is our greatest national problem, the problem of employment?</P>
    <P>My analysis of Government policy as revealed in ministerial pronouncements and particularly in this budget is that the Coalition regard book balancing as an entity in itself and regard job creation and employment as distinct entities, too. The Government then proceed to tackle the book-keeping exercises in the hope that when this has been done the problem of job creation might be tackled.  In other words, the Government are thinking in terms of employment being created from thin air.  They regard unemployment as a necessary feature of our present economic situation and are of the opinion that a solution can only come about as a result of a bookbalancing exercise.  There is no immediacy about their efforts to tackle the unemployment problem at a time when almost 200,000 people, most of them young people, are out of work. Fiscal rectitude and book balancing do not constitute a healthy economy especially when we are faced with the possibility of having up to 100,000 young people unemployed in about three years time.  I am talking of people who will never have been able to obtain employment and those who may become unemployed.</P>
    <P>In many ways this budget is an indication that the Coalition are putting us on the road to slow but sure economic suicide. Unemployment in itself kills the will to work instead of bringing forth young people as commercial leaders.  Unemployment breeds selfish marketeers and gombeenmen.  If the Government and the economic leaders were to make it clear that they would not tolerate unemployment at today's level, that they wished to cut down immediately on the numbers out of work and that they would <Col N="1738" /> start working from now on towards the creation of employment, they would be doing a good day's work.  I do not like to speak of full employment because irrespective of what changes may occur in our economy, we are not likely ever to have a full employment situation.  But there is the possibility of having most of our work force in employment.  Each year, well educated young people are leaving school in large numbers but we are not able to offer them any hope of work.  In these circumstances it is all the more disappointing that the budget contains no framework for initiative in the employment area.</P>
    <P>In introducing the budget the Minister referred to domestic confidence but how can our young work force have any confidence concerning the future in the face of the type of budget that the Coalition have produced and when our employment level is at its highest ever?  The only type of economic policy that is good is one that makes the economy work and this means that Ireland today needs a Government who will not tolerate unemployment and who will budget primarily to put people back to work.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Minister's statement, too, to the loss of foreign confidence. In order for outsiders to have confidence in us we must first have confidence in ourselves.  If the people are given the right type of encouragement they will have confidence in our ability to solve our own economic problems and this in turn will engender foreign confidence on the part of investors looking towards Ireland.  Then, if the recession begins to ease within a few years prospective foreign investors will be more impressed by genuine practical efforts on our part to deal with unemployment than with any success we might have at balancing our books.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred, too, to excessive borrowing and said that this encouraged excessive pay claims.  If those thousands of people who are unemployed could see evidence that the Government were tackling the unemployment problem seriously, there might be a common understanding on the need to abandon excessive pay claims.  The major factors <Col N="1739" /> in excessive pay claims are the out-of-date and inadequate labour relations laws and regulations, inadequate management and too many trade unions.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the budget to certain positive figures relating to 1982 during the term of office of Fianna Fáil. These include the easing of inflation, falling interest rates, a worthwhile increase in industrial exports and the recovery in agricultural output but then the Minister went on to indicate that these improvements will be weakened in the year ahead.  This budget will ensure that that will be the case.  It contains no initiative regarding the agricultural sector. Instead, the Minister knocks that sector but that is a matter that I shall deal with later in my speech.  Instead of ensuring an improvement on any upturn effected by the previous administration, the Coalition are negativing these advances by their pursuit of such a conservative, financial penny pinching policy.  Where there were unmistakable signs of hope under Fianna Fáil there is now financial fear and imprudent pruning.  This means that initiative will die.  I am convinced that as a result of this budget there will be no initiative left in any sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>A Government's policy must be judged on those aspects of services in respect of which pruning is carried out, that is, if any such pruning is deemed to be necessary. In the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo; we read that expenditure reductions in education will be £10.21 million.  There should be no reduction in expenditure on education because of our exceptional proportion of young people. If we cannot increase investment in education during a recession we should not contemplate reducing what is an investment in our future.  In a recession education takes on even more importance. We must continue to educate people to benefit from employment following the recession, then we must educate the many young people for the eventuality of delayed opportunities of employment and then again, with many thousands awaiting employment, which is their right, there is a danger of a spreading <Col N="1740" /> dejection which runs with idleness.  Idleness, in most cases, leads to lawlessness. If you pennypinch and save on education, you must allot more and more to law enforcement.</P>
    <P>The Government would be wise to consider the implications concerning unemployment. In the city of Dublin and in the larger towns throughout the country, there is lawlessness of a type never witnessed before.  The main and basic reason for most of that lawlessness, which is coming from our younger generation, is that they see no hope and no job opportunities for themselves even over a period of years.  What else is there for them to do?  I am not saying that there is not anything else for them to do, there is plenty, but is it not wide open to them to become involved in unlawful activities? We wonder why lawlessness is on the increase.  We should not wonder, we should know that it is because of our serious unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>If we pennypinch on our educational system, is this not a false economy?  Must we not give thorough consideration to the implications before implementing the cutbacks included in this budget?  In 12 months or two years time, more pupils will be leaving school at an earlier age. With regard to vocational schools, I have evidence that those in the lower income group are not in a position to pay for school transport.  I know of one case, a man on social welfare disability benefit, who has been genuinely sick for the last two years, drawing £98 per week, with seven children, two attending the national school and three attending the vocational school and all dependent on school transport.  How can he be requested to make a payment towards school transport?  It is ridiculous.  The Minister for Education in a statement yesterday promised to do something about it, but unfortunately the correction which she has made will not help the man about whom I am speaking.  He will not be in a position to make a payment of any kind to help his children to attend school.  His three children attending vocational school will no longer attend because they are four miles from the school and he cannot make any payment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1741" /> Previous Fianna Fáil Ministers for Education have resisted the attempts of the Department of Finance to cut spending on education, and rightly so.  The present Minister has yielded to her Minister for Finance in Cabinet and the children of the less well-off are punished in the matter of school transport, particularly in rural areas and, more particularly, with regard to vocational schools. Vocational schools are the places where our manpower is trained with a view to job growth.  This shows the Government's resignation to massive unemployment. They think counting figures is more important than young people's education and preparation for work.  Irrespective of cover-up phrases used by the Minister for Education for Cabinet financial policies, most people see through the brutal beginning of the end of career guidance in schools.</P>
    <P>The budget and the policies of the Coalition Government will mean that in a few years there will be two career guidance teachers in vocational schools in the whole of Connacht.  Offaly, more fortunately, will have three and the other county in my constituency, Laois, will also have three.  The same thin spread is there throughout the land.  Is this good enough?  Career guidance and counselling are concerned with the education of the whole person.  Are not rural areas again going to be more and more deprived?  Is this prudent pruning&mdash;to cut educational costs to the extent being done in this budget?  Where is the economic wisdom in any cut in education, particularly cuts affecting vocational schools where our younger generation can get proper training for skilled employment after leaving school?</P>
    <P>Regarding the cuts in remedial teaching, thousands of young people can be brought to the full fruition of talent only through remedial teaching.  The dire consequences of these cuts should wipe the self-satisfied smirk from the face of any bookkeeper performing a book-balancing act.</P>
    <P>Another dangerous development is apparent from this budget.  The Minister mentions special features and the first of <Col N="1742" /> his seemingly proud features is that youth employment and related services in the Department of Education have been transferred to the Minister for Labour who, with his Minister of State, is now responsible for matters affecting youth. I do not share the enthusiasm of the Minister for Finance for this move.  I am sure that the Minister for Labour is happy at the fattening of his portfolio.  Apparently the Minister for Education has acquiesced.  But what of educators, what of our professional school-teaching staff? The whole area of education should be the jealous preserve of those who are solely professional educators.  The captains of industry, those who command the boardroom or who marshal the shop floor, must be kept out of the professional educators field.  The Departments of Labour, Industry and Finance, of necessity, have only a utilitarian interest in education.  Hence their philosophy of education, if they have a philosophy, must of necessity be utilitarian.  This feature of the budget of which the Minister and Government are so proud is a calamity.</P>
    <P>Cannot the Minister for Education and her Departmental officials see what is being accomplished in this budget?  For instance, career guidance and counselling are being effectively choked-off.  Thus the schools active task of preparation of pupils for the world of work will be taken from the educators.  More funds, perhaps some of what is being saved by axing careers teachers, are now available to the Department of Labour, thus giving industry and labour direct influence on education.  Industry and labour will have one interest only: to get cogs for the machines of industry.  Educators will be ousted from their profession of preparing people for industry, of preparing young people for the transition from the world of school life to that of work.  I say to all who are not professional educators: stay out of our schools, stay out of our educational system &mdash; I must emphasise that &mdash; hands off our educational system.</P>
    <P>We are all proud of the fact that we have what I would describe as the best teachers in Western Europe and we are proud of them.  If there is to be a tendency <Col N="1743" /> for any of those professional teachers to lose out as a result of this budget&mdash;I am concerned with a transfer of work training from the Department of Education to that of Labour&mdash;in effect that means that teachers in our vocational schools will be out of a job.  God knows, many of them, qualified people, have been walking the streets seeking jobs for many years.  Indeed, we on all sides of the House are to blame for that; I am not pinpointing or blaming any particular Government for it.  That is the case and applies across the board in so far as third-level education is concerned.  We have many highly-qualified people unable to obtain employment in their own country.</P>
    <P>This budget reveals to me that the Fine Gael/Labour Government are self-hypnotised by the desire for financial stringency. I am sure they are sincere in their obsession with putting what they would call order on the State's finances, but they are simple-minded in their strategy.  Alas, for our economy, for our commercial life, for the person in the street and in the fields, they are simplistic-minded.  More is needed than financial stringency. Somewhere, somehow, in a harsh budget, there must be seen to be immediate improvements; all improvements cannot be in the middle or long term. There must be immediate injections to bring about instant buoyancy in some areas.  From the point of view of the economy and, socially, from the point of view of our young work force and population, this immediate stimulus must be in job creation and in education for jobs. It is here the Minister for Finance's financial plan is so negative, so depressing. Savings are effected by increased taxes, inflation and labour costs.  This kills initiative, rules out increased production, consigns competitiveness to the scrap heap.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said also in the course of his budget speech that the extra taxation imposed in the budget makes it imperative that progress be made in improving taxation equity and that the Government will later produce a fairer system.  How do the specific taxation <Col N="1744" /> measures of this budget indicate that the Government will produce a fairer system?  From listening to constituents of mine of all ages and income brackets I feel the real outcome of this budget will be that more people will be squeezed for more and more, with the Government putting back into the economy less and less.  During the general election campaign in November last I met many low-income constituents who told me that over the years under a Fianna Fáil Government they always had more spending power, more money in their pockets than when a Coalition Government were budgeting.  I see the truth of this plainly from this latest budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also to public expenditure in the course of his budget speech when he said it was imperative for the Government to reduce total public expenditure below the level decided by the Fianna Fáil Government in their plan, <i>The Way Forward.</i> We are told also that legislation is to be introduced under which local authorities will raise about £65 million extra revenue themselves by way of increased existing charges and new local charges.  That is very vague, to say the least.  I have been a member of Offaly County Council since 1966.  Anybody in this House who has been a member of a local authority over the years knows their functioning.  Anybody who has been a member of a local authority down the years is fully conscious of the fact that, following the abolition of rates some years ago, local authorities were left in an awkward financial situation. Naturally those moneys had to be raised in some other way.  An awful lot of the income for the services of local authorities came from the Exchequer.  We find now that the policy of the present Government is to refer back to those local authorities, that it is for them to raise extra revenue.</P>
    <P>Being a member of a local authority and knowing the implications of this budget, I am well aware that the people in my county are not in a position to meet any further charges, even to maintain the existing services.  The people of the country at large will not be able to meet extra <Col N="1745" /> charges.  I do not know how any local authority will be able to raise this type of money because following this budget there will be much less money in the pockets of the people and naturally there will not be any money available for extra local authority charges.</P>
    <P>The vague figure of £65 million represents a sizeable sum.  I do not know offhand how many local authorities there are, but this sum will be a sizeable impost on each of them.  The Minister for the Environment is in the House and I hope he will tell us how the local authorities will be able to meet this amount.  I doubt if they will be.  As I have said, it is a very vague statement to say that local authority will be able to raise the sum of £65 million in extra charges.</P>
    <P>We have been promised more corporations and agencies.  Do we not have enough of them?  In another part of the budget statement the Minister spoke of eliminating schemes and programmes. Are the Coalition not contradicting themselves?  The monetarist policy of Fine Gael can be detected throughout this budget.  A reduction of £43 million is budgeted for in the capital restructuring of commercial semi-State bodies but I presume the Labour Party will seek more and more nationalisation.</P>
    <P>Referring back to the programme for more corporations and agencies, I note the budget provides for steering committees in each Department to examine the feasibility of eliminating schemes and programmes.  Here we are to have a new set of committees and schemes to eliminate other schemes and committees.  This will only add to bureaucracy because these new committees of civil servants will find it very hard to be objective.  By their nature, civil servants, as a rule, do not cut civil servants.  Coalition Ministers would do well to study the underlying truth of the TV programme &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo;, or to renew their acquaintance with Parkinson's Law.  Their economic policies and financial strategy are aimed at emphasising reductions in expenditure.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's <i>The Way Forward</i> is positive because its emphasis for the public sector is to urge an increase in efficiency <Col N="1746" /> and production as against the stand the Coalition have taken on this subject.  Although speakers from the Government side have tried to portray a budget which emphasises curbs on public expenditure the overall thrust of the budget is towards increased taxation.  If it can be proved that the use of State funds by Departments, State agencies and commercial State bodies has not yielded expected adequate performance what will happen?  Will the Fine Gael wing of the Coalition want private enterprise to take over, or will Labour continue in their efforts to nationalise even more?</P>
    <P>Everyone agrees that the taxation system needs overhauling.  This Government are not approaching this matter urgently.  All they do is to promise.  More than a year ago we had many speeches by Fine Gael and Labour Deputies prior to the formation of the last Coalition Government, promising tax reform.  Now that we again have a Coalition Government we do not see anything about tax reform in the budget&mdash;again we have only more promises.  By putting off what is urgent and necessary, now more than ever before, the Government are lessening the chance of tax reform ever being achieved effectively.  The taxpayer needs to see this problem tackled now.  It would be a much needed psychological boost to those excessively and unfairly burdened with tax, and further burdened in this budget.</P>
    <P>The increases in taxation in this budget are bound to deepen national despondency and in hundreds of thousands of workers to kill the one thing that is necessary for economic recovery, that is, initiative.  There will be no initiative left following this budget in any section of the Irish people.  The more work one takes on, the more one should benefit, but that will not be so for countless workers in 1983 or for years to come if the Government are Fine Gael-dominated and remain in power.</P>
    <P>This budget is designed to impose further taxation on incomes.  It is my guess that if there are further Fine Gael-Labour budgets a similar sentence will be imposed on the workers.  To achieve <Col N="1747" /> equity there is a vital, urgent need for tax reform but that will never come under a Coalition Government.  Throughout the years the Coalition parties have talked much about tax reform, and taxpayers thought that in this budget that reform would be introduced.  All they got were more promises.  Rather than instilling confidence in the people, the best that can be expected from the budget is to hold the line, which means that we will remain stagnant.  In economics we cannot remain static &mdash; we either grow and go forward or decline and go backwards. Fianna Fáil produced <i>The Way Forward</i> but this Coalition have given us only the way backwards by putting employment creation in a secondary place.  Balancing the books is their main concern, an obsession with the Minister and the Government.  The Coalition are ensuring that we cannot go forward.  The State will expand expenditure on unemployment. In his budget speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am therefore adding £31 million to finance the additional costs of potentially higher unemployment, bringing total expenditure to £1,802 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister saw fit in this budget to add a further £31 million to finance the additional cost of potentially higher unemployment. Those words prove that the Government have taken no initiative to deal with unemployment.  They just accept that the numbers will be higher and higher.  Ministers have stated openly what the unemployment figures will be in mid-June, October and November.  I read them in the papers.  Is that the type of Government the people need, at a time when every effort should be made to ensure that the serious and deplorable unemployment figure is reduced?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil published <i>The Way Forward</i> and put it before the Dáil.  It went before the electorate in November of last year.  Unfortunately, a sufficient number of people did not accept <i>The Way Forward.</i> In that document we had a four-year economic plan to ensure that something would be done about unemployment. This Government have introduced a budget with no plan for this year, never <Col N="1748" /> mind a four-year plan.  Their only forecast is that the unemployment figures will increase.  Having looked at <i>The Way Forward</i>, and having seen the budget introduced by this Coalition Government, if the people got a chance to cast their votes now I feel very confident about where their votes would go.  Under a Fianna Fáil Government with a four-year forward looking economic plan, and doing something about the desperate and deplorable unemployment figure, there would be some hope and some future particularly for the younger generation.  A very large percentage of the population is under 25 years of age.  That plan must be contrasted with this harshest of harsh budgets with no economic plan to solve our problems.</P>
    <P>Initiative and practical patriotism are not encouraged or even envisaged in this budget.  I should like to draw attention to progressive agencies like the Irish Sports Council and campaigns like the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  Not enough emphasis has been laid on the potential of a large expansion in the home market.  An instance of the kind of initiative I have in mind is that of a Dublin secondary school teacher, Denis Craven who, on his own, is starting a youth crusade among our 860,000 pupils.  He seeks to turn them into &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; ambassadors.</P>
    <P>These young people will be motivated by the fact that it £1,500 million worth of our imports were replaced by goods produced and manufactured at home approximately 60,000 new jobs would be created directly, plus many more, perhaps, in spin-off employment.  This movement, if encouraged, could alter public awareness radically.  This kind of initiative should be followed up by the Government and all Government Departments, and particularly the Department of Education and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong with the economy of a country which fails to utilise its natural resources to produce goods for export, especially when it comes to the question of food and particularly vegetables, for which there will always be a foreign market.  There is something radically wrong with the economy of a country <Col N="1749" /> which has to import food for the production of which it has all the God-given natural resources.  That we do not export enough and have to import so much is nothing short of a scandal.  If I had time I would deal with this problem at length. Perhaps on the Vote for the Department of Agriculture I will have an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>There has to be a way to eliminate this scandal.  The 1983 budget should be specific in initiating such an elimination process.  I come from a rural constituency. I was a junior Minister in the Department of Agriculture for eight or nine months.  This budget ensures that there is no initiative left within the farming community.  I have not time to go into this matter in detail.  Our agricultural sector is the strong arm of the economy. Initiatives need to be taken to solve the problems in agriculture and unemployment. In this budget there are cutbacks in all directions for the farming sector.</P>
    <P>There are many deficiencies in this budget and they all spring from a mistaken budgetary strategy which is to put the cart before the horse, to be obsessive about bookkeeping, and remiss about the immediacy of the grave problem of rampant growth in the numbers out or work, and worse, the numbers not yet started in employment.  This budget leads the way backwards.  It certainly is not the way forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish first of all to refer to some general features of the budget, before going on to deal with matters relating to the Department of the Environment. There is no doubt that this has been a tough budget, involving adjustment and sacrifice right across the community. Solutions offered by the Opposition for the critical state of the national finances, or on the other hand the lack of any corrective action would, however, be far worse, more long lasting and damaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party are not responsible for the state of the economy or the growth in foreign debt which we as a nation must pay for.  We are, however, responsible for facing up as a partner in Government <Col N="1750" /> to minimising the damaging consequences of Fianna Fáil policies.</P>
    <P>The economic crisis still persists throughout the western world.  Ireland as a trading economy suffers severely from this recession.  However, our room for action in the short term is severely restricted as a result of the reckless policies of both the old and recent Fianna Fáil Governments since 1977.</P>
    <P>No solutions would be easy, given our balance of payments deficit and the level of our foreign debt reflected in the £500 million which we had to pay abroad in interest last year.  In 1982, total debt service accounted for 36 per cent of total tax revenue.  If the rate of increase of foreign borrowing in recent years were to be maintained, eventually either funds would not be available from lenders, the interest payments impossible to service, or solutions would be imposed by outside banks or agencies which would have a totally devastating effect on growth and living standards.  That is the legacy of five years of Fianna Fáil mismanagement of our country.</P>

      <P>It speaks for itself.  Now, it is evident that a heavy burden will fall on consumers and PAYE taxpayers this year.  However, some progress is being made in widening the scope of other taxes aimed at those who can afford to pay, in strengthening measures against tax evaders and penalising offenders.  We must remember that, by contrast with the major scandal of tax evasion and the unremitting efforts of the rich in conceiving tax avoidance schemes, abuses of the social welfare system are minor in the extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the vital necessity to obtain a greater share of revenue from capital taxation.  The abolition of the wealth tax in 1978 by Fianna Fáil, the abolition of rates and the earlier removal of estate duties were not replaced by <Col N="1751" /> comparable schemes for capital taxation. For the future, it is essential for any serious approach to tax equity that practical, workable schemes for increasing the yield from capital taxation be devised and implemented.  This will involve the setting in place of the required administrative structures for effective implementation. Protests from vested interests will not be a barrier to the pursuit of equity in our taxation structure.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to limitations imposed on action in the budget this year brought about by past policies and the need to contain the rate of growth in borrowing.  These realities provide the framework for pay negotiations this year, set harsh limits on the public expenditure options, make increased taxation inevitable and limit what can be done in the public capital programme.  The Fianna Fáil Party have been relentlessly advocating a planned deficit of £750 million. Given their continued rejection in office of capital taxation, this could only mean heavier taxation on consumers and PAYE taxpayers, accompanied by more expenditure cuts.</P>
    <P>Many difficult choices faced the Government in the limited time available for framing the budget.  It is important to note, however, some of the options rejected.  Food items, clothing, footwear, school books, ESB bills are entirely exempt from value added tax.  The new high rates on many items should be seen in the light of the fact that a significant proportion of what ordinary consumers buy is completely exempt from VAT.  In addition, subsidies on bread, milk and butter which are costly to maintain but which are particularly important for low-income households will be continued.</P>
    <P>The Government have, of course, made increased allocations for expenditure in key areas, for example, for local authorities, and provisions for social welfare increases in June which, while they are less than we would have wished, are significant given the overall constraints of the budget.  In addition, a family income supplement scheme to benefit workers on low incomes will be instituted, the Combat <Col N="1752" /> Poverty Agency reactivated, special provisions made for housing the elderly and an additional £3 million provided for official development aid.</P>
    <P>Unemployment remains the central issue in the lives of many of our citizens. On account of the consequences of reckless past policies, the main emphasis in this budget has been to stop the drain of resources &mdash; resources vitally necessary for the creation of productive, sustainable jobs.</P>
    <P>A special task force of Ministers has been established to tackle the problems of growth and employment and a national planning board will be instituted.  These will be aided by sectoral committees in each area of economic activity which will bring together Government, workers, management and farming interests in a joint employment planning exercise aimed to maximise output and employment. The National Development Corporation will be funded adequately to fulfil their role as a major vehicle for job creation in Ireland through direct State investment in profitable commercial projects. We have to get the structures, the sense of direction and the legislation right in order to establish the corporation properly and provide for the effective performance of existing State commercial firms.</P>
    <P>Funding will not be a problem, when suitable new projects are identified and the appropriate operating framework established.</P>
    <P>Funding will not be a problem, when suitable new projects are identified and the appropriate operating framework established.</P>
    <P>I now turn to issues relating to my own Department.  I will deal, first of all, with local finance.  Since taking office, I have been conscious of the difficulties which local authorities have been experiencing in trying to maintain employment and keep their day-to-day services functioning. The income which local authorities derive from rates and rates-related grants such as the domestic rates relief grant and the agricultural grant, is what dictates their capacity to provide the normal day-to-day services which the community expect from their local authorities.  It is essential that this income be kept at a reasonable level.  These services include the operation of water and sewerage systems, the fire service, public lighting, <Col N="1753" /> refuse collection, maintenance of local authority houses and repair and maintenance of county roads.  These services are vital to the life and well-being of the local communities.</P>
    <P>The picture I found when I assumed office did not inspire confidence for the future of those local services and employment. The previous administration had identified a shortfall of £97 million between what local authorities were expected to spend in 1983 and their revenue resources.  They ignored £20 million of this shortfall altogether and put a further £19 million on the long finger to be considered in the context of the budget.</P>
    <P>I regarded this situation as most unsatisfactory and potentially disastrous for the whole structure of local finances.  In particular, the previous administration failed to come up with specific proposals to bridge £39 million of the overall shortfall of £97 million.  I am particularly pleased that despite the severe constraints under which we were working, we were able in this budget to show a positive resolve to tackle the real problems which local authorities are experiencing in maintaining their services and employment.  In particular, I draw attention to the substantial increase in the provisions for payments to local authorities in lieu of domestic and agricultural rates.</P>
    <P>The total amount which will be paid to local authorities in 1983 by way of the rates support grants will be £277.5 million, which represents an increase of £31.5 million over what had been provided in the Estimates prepared by the previous Government and an increase of over £50 million, or over 22 per cent, on the amount paid in 1982.  I should say that this additional £31.5 million will be disbursed in a manner which confers the maximum discretion on local authorities. The grants will be made available as a general support for their day-to-day services, to be spent as local authorities see fit, in accordance with their own spending programmes and priorities.</P>
    <P>Apart from money provided through the rates relief grants, local authorities collect revenue from such sources as rates on industrial and commercial property, <Col N="1754" /> charges for services provided, development levies and fees.  It is our aim to create the conditions where local authorities will be able to raise an additional sum totalling about £65 million in 1983 from these sources..</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that this £65 million is a target set by the Government so as to determine the limits of the Exchequer contribution to local services.  It is not my intention to impose blanket charges on local authorities.  The circumstances, financial and otherwise, of each local authority vary significantly throughout the country.  My approach, therefore, will be to allow local authorities the maximum discretion and flexibility to determine their own spending and revenue patterns and to restore some of the freedom they have lost in recent years in this regard.  This will mean varying charges and rates of charges in different local authority areas, depending on the local circumstances.  However, to give Deputies an indication of the Government's thinking in the matter, I propose to spell out how the Government saw the £65 million being raised.</P>
    <P>In the first place, local authorities continue to levy rates on commercial and industrial ratepayers and increases in those rates would normally be expected to arise.  It was estimated that rate increases would yield about £13 million in 1983.  However, in line with my policy of conferring maximum discretion on local authorities, I propose to depart from the practice of recent years by not issuing directives to local authorities regarding the level of these rates.</P>
    <P>Secondly, local authorities have sources of income other than rates which were estimated to have netted them about £166 million in 1982.  These sources of income include charges for services, rents of houses, house loan repayments, superannuation contributions, and so on. It was estimated that local authorities might be expected to increase these sources by about £43 million in 1983. Some increases are automatic.  For example, repayments of new house loans advanced should increase in line with loans issued.  Similar automatic increases will apply in relation to house sales, and <Col N="1755" /> superannuation contributions.  However the target of £43 million will require some new charges.  An example is water supplied for domestic purposes in urban areas.  The position at present is that local authorities in rural areas commonly charge for the supply of water to householders but there are no charges for domestic water in urban areas.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to introduce legislation as a matter of urgency to confer a wide general discretionary power on local authorities to charge for services where they lack the power at present.  This would enable those local authorities who wish to do so, to extend the range of charges they make, including a charge for domestic water in urban areas.  I should mention that the previous Government in their publication last October, <i>The Way Forward,</i> and elsewhere, had indicated their intention to charge the cost of services directly to developers and to the users of those services in the form of charges.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious of the need to have a greater proportion of the cost of development borne by those involved directly in development.  I have recently made regulations under the 1982 Planning Act providing for a scale of fees to be charged for processing planning applications which is expected to yield £5.5 million this year.  I also propose to examine the question of enabling the planning authorities to increase the yield from development levies fixed by them when granting permission for development.  It is estimated that development levies would yield an additional £4 million to local authorities in 1983.</P>
    <P>The package we have put together will have a significant effect on the budgets of local authorities.  It will be a matter for the local authorities themselves to work out the detailed arrangements in the light of their own financial circumstances. Deputies will, no doubt, agree that at the present very difficult time these measures represent a positive and effective contribution to local services and employment. It will, nevertheless, be essential for local authorities to monitor and control <Col N="1756" /> expenditure carefully, and to attain the maximum efficiency possible in their operations.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the building industry which will be a priority concern of mine in the years ahead.  The building industry is of central importance to the economy, first, because of the size of its output and the employment it gives and, secondly, because of its central role in providing the necessary physical infrastructure for economic and social development. Unfortunately, the general trend in the industry over the past few years has been downward with falling output and reduced employment.  There are a number of reasons for this state of affairs.  The worldwide recession has been a major cause, but this has been compounded by the erosion of confidence, resulting from the economic difficulties facing the country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that the terms under which the site at Lower Gardiner Street/Sean McDermott Street would be acquired by the Authority are the subject of current negotiations between the <Col N="1757" /> Authority and Dublin Corporation.  No work on the development of the cluster can take place until agreement has been reached between the parties and the current open space zoning has been amended to allow for industrial development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply indicates the crux of the matter which is that the negotiations have been going on for some time.  Does the Minister accept that a project of this nature which has all-party agreement in the constituency should not be held up by red tape and wrangling between the IDA and Dublin Corporation?  Will the Minister use his good offices to ensure that the matter is expedited immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will but the IDA were established as a body having a considerable measure of independence in making decisions and judgments as to what they should pay for a particular site, as were Dublin Corporation.  Both have a job to do and it happens that they do not agree on the terms in this instance.  I do not want to become involved in the details of the discussions because I am not as familiar with them as are the IDA.  The disagreements which exist are genuine and are not to obstruct progress.  The Deputy asked me to use my good offices with the IDA and I will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some time ago Dublin Corporation offered to the IDA two alternative sites for this cluster to which Dublin Corporation could not make title?  Is he aware that there was considerable opposition at official level within Dublin Corporation to the provision of the site which is the subject of these two questions?  Will the Minister take account of this in instructing the IDA to have regard to the attitude they may be confronted with in their negotiations with Dublin Corporation and to have regard to the fact that in this area the level of unemployment is considerably higher than in any other part of the country, urban or rural?  The urgent necessity of providing assistance of this kind by way of an industrial cluster is <Col N="1758" /> such that I ask the Minister to ask the IDA to take a very special view of the problems here.  If necessary, if agreement cannot be reached between the two bodies will the Minister take the initiative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They might be able to use their good offices in this regard.  As far as the IDA are concerned they cannot take account of this.  I have indicated that I will use my good offices with them to have any needless delay on their part removed.  As I said in response to the first suplementary, the IDA have statutory responsibility to exercise independently in this kind of matter.  It would not be good precedent for me, as I am sure Deputy Colley will appreciate from his own experience, to interfere with their judgment without very good cause.</P>

Is it a question of money with the IDA?  If it is, the Minister would have a certain influence with the IDA.  There is all-party agreement about the need for industry in this area and I am sure the Minister agrees with that.  There is a 54 per cent unemployment rate in the area. It is the highest in the country and I know the Minister will use his best efforts to expedite this matter.</P>

Both of these are substantial matters and they are not something which can be swept aside just like that.  I appreciate what the Deputy said and I am sure other Deputies share his sentiment about the serious unemployment in the area.  I repeat for the third time that I will use my good offices with the IDA to ensure that they do, so far as they can, a speeding up job on this matter.

      <P>They instructed the Government of the day to instruct the IDA to carry out certain things in relation to Fieldcrest in Kilkenny.  In view of that, the very high unemployment in the area and the goodwill expressed on all sides, would the Minister consider calling into his office the officials of Dublin Corporation and the IDA and have the matter resolved within the four walls of his office?  I am certain he is quite capable of doing that.  It would give an opportunity <Col N="1760" /> to small industrialists to avail of the new tax incentive of 60 per cent in Dublin's inner city.  Would he be prepared to do that?</P>

The measures I have indicated that I am prepared to take initially are more appropriate at this stage, Every time there is a disagreement between two statutory bodies we cannot have a ministerial arbitrator appointed who calls them all into his office.  If that was the practice no agreement would ever be reached with anybody.  Deputy Reynolds, from his wide experience as a hard-working Minister, knows that the burdens that would result for Ministers would be intolerable and decisions would not be taken.

I had intended asking the Minister, if this continues to be the case and there is no speedy resolution of the problem, if he would act as mediator, and he has answered that question but would he agree to meet a deputation from all parties and the local community to report progress to them over the next couple of weeks?</P>

      <P>Perhaps the most appropriate step to be taken by the Deputies concerned would be for them to invite the IDA and Dublin Corporation to meet with them to discuss the matter.  I have said already in response to Deputy Reynolds that, in the final analysis, if none of these measures, including my own good offices, succeed I am prepared to consider even the extreme step of acting as a mediator, although I would be reluctant to do so.  I have gone as far as possible in response to what I recognise as a genuine concern on all sides.</P>

      <P>I do not have any further information on individual projects which may be in the pipeline.  The Deputy will appreciate that these are not announced until they are finalised and I would not be in a position to give him information on anything that may be under negotiation at this stage.  However, the list I have read out is a not insignificant one.  Not surprisingly in view of the increased population in that area, manufacturing employment has been growing since 1980 at a modest rate whereas in County Dublin as a whole it has fallen. The situation in unemployment terms is <Col N="1763" /> one of concern, but there has been an increase in employment in manufacturing in that area.</P>

In relation to the Tallaght area, is the Minister aware that there is a very large young population there and the majority of those currently unemployed are young people, and as each school year ends those figures will be added to unless this Government can furnish details of plans to locate major industries, not just warehouses, in the Tallaght area?</P>

If the Deputy takes a number of years together he will see that since 1980 the IDA have approved 160 projects involving a projected investment of over £32 million to County Kerry, of which the IDA are committed to subscribing over £17 million.

Despite the efforts of the IDA, no interest has yet been shown in the advance factory at Moville. The IDA are continuing to promote these factories and the former Gerritsen Cooper factory in Carndonagh for suitable industries.</P>
      <P>I would add that in four years 1978-1981 the IDA created over 300 new grant-aided jobs in the towns Buncrana, Carndonagh and Moville.  Moreover, manufacturing employment in each of these towns increased in 1982 by an average of 10.5 per cent over 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if he is aware of the recent closure of a company (details supplied) in County Clare; and the efforts, if any, made by him to find alternative employment for those made redundant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of, and regret, the recent closure of this long-established company.  This, I understand, was due mainly to the severe competition being encountered by the company for its products over the past few years.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made and will continue to be made by SFADCo to secure a replacement industry that would provide alternative employment for the workers made redundant by the closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House if any effort was made to find alternative markets for the products <Col N="1772" /> manufactured by the company concerned? Is the Minister aware that there is a highly-skilled and experienced work force in that industry?  It should be possible as a result to find alternative outlets to enable the company stay in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is a highly-skilled work force in the area. Unfortunately, SFADCo did not know of the liquidation until two days before it took place, although they were aware of the general marketing difficulties being encountered by the firm.  As the Deputy is aware, the problem is that Japanese technology in this area has enabled them to under-cut not just this project but other European manufacturers of the product.  It appears to be a Europeanwide problem that has to be faced. SFADCo's view now is that it would not be sensible to try to attract a similar industry to take over this location in view of the fact that the technology is not competitive.  They are therefore trying to find some other type of industry to take it over which would use the skilled labour force to which Deputy Daly referred but which would not have the same problems as were associated with the present project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned that an increasing number of small companies, similar to the one in question which employed about 40 people, are experiencing difficulties?  What steps, if any, is the Minister taking to alleviate that situation for small companies, firms that do not hit the headlines like the Ranks closure or the Kingdom Tubes closure?  The closure of small firms is equally important and as distressing for the work force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, the survival rate of small firms has been slightly better than large firms.  It would be unwise to generalise in this case because, as I have indicated, there were special technological considerations which related not to the size of the industry but to the type of product they were engaged in.</P>

      <P>At the time Deputy Reynolds, as Minister, made that announcement the project was active, but difficulties have arisen since then.  It is true to say that the unemployment problem in the Sligo area is of concern. There has not been any increase in manufacturing employment levels in Sligo from January 1981 to November 1982.  In fact, there has been a slight decline.  That is a matter of some concern.  The IDA are doing their best to get this project back on the road again.  The problems exist outside the country, in the market for the product to be produced, and associated with that is the obtaining of loan finance for the project.  However, if a market was there there would not be any problem about getting loan finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14 and 15 together.  The meeting held in London from 14 to 18 February 1983 was the Seventh Consultative Meeting of Contracting Parties to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972.  Fifty-two countries had ratified or acceded to the convention by 1 January 1983, and of these, 32 sent delegations to this meeting.  The Irish delegation consisted of a representative from the Department, a representative from the Department of Transport and two representatives from the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Four countries which are not contracting parties to the convention sent observers. In addition, observers attended from some United Nations organisations and from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Commission of the European Communities. Non-governmental organisations such as the International Association of Ports and Harbours, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and Greenpeace International, which have been granted observer status were also represented at the meeting.</P>
      <P>The items which gave rise to most interest at the meeting were those relating to the dumping of radioactive waste at sea and I will confine my remarks to those items since the other items were mainly of a routine nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals were submitted by the delegations of Kiribati and Nauru to amend Annexes I and II of the Convention <Col N="1776" /> which, if adopted, would have the effect of prohibiting the dumping of all types of radioactive waste at sea, immediately, for each country accepting the amendment. The five Nordic countries &mdash; Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden &mdash; submitted a draft amendment to the Kiribati-Nauru proposal, the effect of which would be to prohibit the dumping of all types of radioactive waste at sea with effect from 1 January 1990.  In the meantime the level of dumping would be restricted and would be subject to very strict controls.  The Spanish delegation submitted a draft resolution calling for the suspension of dumping at sea pending the completion of research to ascertain all its implications.</P>
    <P>The proposals gave rise to lengthy debates which it would not be practicable to deal with in detail in a reply to a parliamentary question.  The Irish delegation stated that they were opposed in principle to the dumping of radioactive waste and indicated their support for the Nordic proposals.  Following some informal negotiations it was agreed that the scientific basis for the Kiribati-Nauru proposal should be reviewed by an expert group.  The Nordic countries, in these circumstances, withdrew their proposals.</P>
    <P>The Spanish delegation then introduced a revised draft resolution which in effect stated that, as the meeting had decided to refer the Kiribati-Nauru proposals to an expert group, all dumping at sea of radioactive materials should be suspended pending the presentation to the contracting parties of the final report of the expert group.  This resolution was adopted by 19 countries in favour, six against, with five abstentions.  The countries which voted in favour were: Argentina, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Kiribati, Mexico, Morocco, Nauru, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Sweden.  The countries which voted against were: Japan, Netherlands, South Africa, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States.  The five countries which abstained were: Brazil, France, Republic of Germany, Greece and USSR.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the resolution <Col N="1777" /> does not have binding effect.  The purpose of the resolution is to bring pressure on those countries which are at present dumping to discontinue the practice pending the report of the expert group on the scientific implications of the dumping. It is anticipated that the expert group will take about two years to complete their report.</P>
    <P>As regards Government policy, it will be clear from the foregoing that the Government are opposed in principle to dumping of radioactive materials at sea and desires an end to this practice as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to take in as much as I could of the Minister's reply.  Has the Minister any guarantee from Britain that they will comply with the Spanish resolution? Also, has he made any objection to Britain and the fact that they have ignored the guidelines of the previous convention in that they continue to dump without proper monitoring and did not investigate the possibility of dumping on land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I have no such assurance from Britain that they will not carry out such dumping.  They are obliged under existing practice to inform us of any plans that they have in this regard.  These, of course, will be examined and we will make whatever representations we can, but, as I said, the resolution passed at this convention was not binding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that Britain are continuing a very selfish line of action at present and are ignoring the views of this country?  Are we compromised in that we cannot decide policies ourselves in relation to toxic dumping and that Britain are taking care of our problems in that respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is part of the problem, although toxic dumping relates to a much wider matter than radioactive dumping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Ireland probably the one country at greatest risk as far as this <Col N="1778" /> Atlantic dumping is concerned?  Also, is it a fact that dumping of any significance is being carried out solely by Great Britain in contravention of any previous understandings?  What are our Government doing about this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Britain is one of the countries engaged most extensively in dumping.  It must be said that some activities in this country purchase radioactive materials from Britain as part of their normal commercial operation, and return them to Britain when used.  Presumably they are dumped then by the British authorities and some jobs are involved in this type of activity.  However, we would all wish to eliminate this ocean-based dumping which, as the Deputy has rightly said, poses a special threat to a country like Ireland which is exposed not only by the nature of its location but also by Atlantic currents, to a threat from such activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at any length, as indicated by the length of the reply the Minister had to give?  I ask the Minister to consider seriously giving us three hours of Government time some day to explore every aspect of this matter.  In the meantime I ask him why we voted for an amendment which in effect would mean that no action would be taken about this matter until 1990?  Did I get that correctly from the Minister's reply, that we voted in favour of a Nordic amendment which would ensure that dumping would continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand how the <Col N="1779" /> Deputy would not have got the exact nuances of my reply in view of its length.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I will make one point to the Deputy to explain why all of this discussion goes on.  For a resolution to be binding at this convention it must get a two-thirds majority which means that you do not always vote for what would be your ideal.  You may find yourself voting for something which is less than ideal in order to get the requisite majority.  It is a question of trying to balance the ideal against&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be very straightforward and definite about this whole matter.  This dumping takes place 370 miles off the south-west coast of Ireland.  Therefore, we are probably more likely to be directly affected by any fall-out than anybody else would.  Was the question of monitoring the existing dumping adverted to in any way at this conference?  Would I be correct in suggesting that there is no effective monitoring and that we have no idea of the effect of this dumping on either the sea bed or marine life at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is monitoring by the Nuclear Energy Agency and also by our Nuclear Energy Board, the Nuclear Energy Agency being an international body.  They are informed of any proposal by member nations to engage in dumping <Col N="1780" /> of radioactive material.  In the likely event that there is a proposal on the part of the United Kingdom to dump material in the Atlantic this year, they will be informed, as we will be, and we will have the opportunity of making our views known.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the published scientific evidence which indicates that dumping is a potential hazard to health and since Britain has refused to monitor its operations, will the Minister make approaches to the British Government in the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In preparing my recommendations to the Government as to the position they should adopt in this matter, I looked at the scientific evidence which had been adduced by the delegations from Kiribati and Nauru.  While it did prove the possibility of escape of the waste concerned, it was rather weak on any quantitive evaluation of how real the danger was.  I imagine, although I am not certain, that this matter is now being examined by the expert group which was established when delegates to the conference detected that there was some gap in the technical data adduced by Kiribati and Nauru.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we could all agree that this is a matter with which we cannot really get to grips at Question Time.  I should like to ask once again about monitoring because I think the Minister misunderstood the nature of my question.  Would he agree that it is one thing for these international agencies or our own Nuclear Energy Board to monitor who is dumping, when and where, but that it is a completely different matter to monitor the effects of the dumping? Deputies who are interested in this matter are concerned as to whether there is any effective measuring or monitoring of dumping and its effects on the sea bed, <Col N="1781" /> on the tides and on marine life.  Am I correct in thinking that this aspect is not being measured or monitored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the type of matter which will be the subject of study by the review group.  However, I will ask my Department to prepare a report on the general question raised by the Deputy as to the adequacy of the monitoring arrangements, independent of the work being done by the expert group.  It may be rather indefinite in its conclusions due to lack of data but at least I will set the ball rolling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to include in any investigations the dangers of Windscale.  Is it not established and accepted that the sealed containers and concrete encased containers are suspect as regards their long-term life on the sea bed?  Is it not also accepted that the currents and tides miles off the south-west coast are such as to bring very grave danger to us if these containers break up, as it is predicted will happen in a relatively short time?</P>

Regarding the second part of his question, that matter is being investigated by the expert group and I have indicated to Deputy Haughey that I will be looking for an independent report on the subject from my own Department.  As to Windscale, there have been reports in the paper recently about dangers to health arising from an accident which occurred there in 1967.  I have requisitioned copies of this report and I will examine them.  Since I have not yet received them I could not be drawn into comment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Andrews is being disorderly and he will resume his seat.  Before moving to the next question I would draw the attention of both sides of the House &mdash; and this goes for Minister too &mdash; to Standing Order 35 (2) which states:</P>
      <P>Where a question put down for oral answer is of such a nature as to require a lengthy reply or a reply in the form of a tabular statement, the Ceann Comhairle shall, at the request of the member of the Government to whom the Question is addressed, direct that the answer be furnished in the Official Report of the Debates.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, proposals on this matter were withdrawn from the Government meeting held on 8 December 1982 &mdash; the intention being, I understand, <Col N="1784" /> to afford the incoming Government an opportunity to consider the matter.

      <P>On the basis of the known reserves of the field, policy on allocation of gas will be such as to ensure supplies to the premium market for the periods for which contracts are entered into.  All major potential premium markets have been identified and can be catered for.  In general, supplies of gas from the Kinsale field are not expected to be depleted before the turn of the century.  By timely revision of depletion policy the production life of the field could be significantly extended if another source of gas did not become available.</P>

I want to say that, as the Opposition, we cannot agree to this process because of the precedent it will create.  It may not be of any significance in relation to this particular information.  We do not know.  I do not think you can ask us as an Oposition to subject ourselves to a process wherby a Minister can come in here at literally a moments notice and make a statement.  Another Minister another time may wish to make a statement on something of pretty fudamental and far-reaching importance.  If we are to accept the precedent which the Minister for Finance is now setting, then we will have no control over such a situation.  I ask you to take that into consideration.

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition asked this morning, and I repeated for his benefit, where the information had come from which was published this morning in a certain newspaper about the public capital programme, to which I replied that as far as I was aware the revised public capital programme had been published yesterday.  I find that it was published, not yesterday but the previous day and that between 2.45 p.m. and 3 o'clock on Tuesday a copy of this document <Col N="1815" /> which contains the revised public capital programme, beginning on page 135, was left in the cubbyhole of every Member of this House.  Therefore, the document is available and has been available to every Member of the House since last Tuesday.  That was the statement that I wished to make for the information of the House and to cover the point of the fear which one or two Members seemed to have that information had been made available to the press before it was made available to Members of the House.  That is not the case.  It has been available to Members of this House since last Tuesday.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach would do everyone a great favour if he would keep the low profile he has been keeping for the last while.  He really does not add to <Col N="1818" /> the proceedings of this House in any way. I want to confirm my protest about the behaviour of the Government and the Minister for Finance in regard to this matter.  I want to confirm that they have behaved in an unprecedented fashion first of all in, not giving the Opposition notice of their intention to make a statement and, furthermore, by making a statement as an oral statement and not doing the traditional courtesy to the House of preparing a written statement which could be read by the Minister and at the same time presented to Deputies on all sides of the House, so that they would be in a position to study the statement and reply to it.  He has permitted a very unhappy and unsatisfactory precedent to be created this afternoon and I want to protest about it in the strongest possible terms.  I ask the Chair, as custodian of order in this House and as protector of the rights of Deputies on all sides, to curb this Government because, either through incapacity or inability to conduct their affairs properly, or else through some latent wish to override the wishes of this House, they are walking from one <i>contretemps</i> to another.</P>
      <P>I want to suggest to you, Sir, that if we are going to have good, orderly conduct of business in this House, and if the Government want the co-operation of the Opposition in getting through business, they will have to mend their hand because we are not going to put up with or tolerate this sort of treatment.</P>
      <P>I want to say, finally, that whatever way the Minister for Finance seeks to wriggle out of this matter, the simple facts are that he has treated this House with less than dignity in this matter.  At the very least, in my office as Leader of the Opposition I have always been given the courtesy of receiving documents personally in my office, documents of any significance, from Ministers, from the Taoiseach's Office or from the Government Chief Whip.  That practice is not being adhered to consistently these days.  This is a particular example of it, because this is the first time I have received a copy of this document from any Government source of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1819" /> We have a lot of business to do in this House.  We have a lot of problems to deal with.  I do not think any of us really wants to be wasting our time over procedural wrangles of this sort.  We can avoid them if this Government, Ministers, and the Taoiseach in particular, would understand the role the Opposition has to discharge, recognise that the Opposition has that role to discharge, give us the facilities we need to discharge that role and not be seeking to treat this House with contempt and ride roughshod over everybody who is not on the Government benches.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to delay this House much longer on this matter. Certainly the content of the Minister's statement was not worth the time it took to get it through.  But I am concerned that small parties, The Workers' Party and presumably also Deputy Gregory, <Col N="1820" /> were not informed of the fact that the Minister was to make a statement.  The first we heard of it was on the intercom when the Minister stood up to make the statement.  No doubt Deputies and the Chief Whip of the Government parties are aware of the disadvantages from which small groups in this House suffer already.  It would be worthwhile if every effort were made to ensure that all Deputies on the Opposition benches were informed of what was taking place in order to avoid the wastage of time which has taken place over the last half hour or so.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the adjournment and the circus we have just witnessed, I was dealing with the problems facing the building industry.  I was outlining the central importance to the economy of the building industry, firstly because of the size of its output and the employment it gives and, secondly, because of its central <Col N="1821" /> role in providing the necessary, physical infrastructure for economic and social development.  Unfortunately, the general trend in the industry over the past few years has been downward, with falling output and reduced employment.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons for this state of affairs.  The worldwide recession has been the major cause but this has been compounded by the erosion of confidence, resulting from the economic difficulties facing the country.</P>
      <P>One of my goals over the years ahead will be to restore that confidence, thereby increasing private sector investment leading to a resumption in growth in output and employment.  The level of public capital support for the industry provided in the Public Capital Programme, while it may not be as high as I would like, is the highest level of support that our economy can bear at this time.  It is also a fact that public capital support for the building industry cannot, of itself, solve the industry's problems.  The decline in private sector investment is the principal underlying reason for the industry's present state.</P>
      <P>The various problems confronting the industry were put forward by the industry's representatives at a meeting I had with them recently.  I am considering the setting up of a broadly based council which would be representative of the different interests involved in the building industry and would provide a forum for ventilating matters affecting the industry. At the meeting the representatives of the industry were invited to submit to me their views on the form the council should take.  I see the council operating within the context of the overall planning framework envisaged in the Joint Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all of this my principal concern will be employment.  One source of potential extra employment is in building materials manufacture.  In 1981 &mdash; the last full year for which figures are available &mdash; imports of building materials had a value of about £350 million.  About half of these imports could have been produced at home, creating direct employment of between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs.  Relatively speaking, our adverse trade balance in this <Col N="1822" /> sector is among the highest in Europe. Between 1977 and 1981 the value of our imports of building materials doubled, whereas the value of exports increased by less than one-third.  As Minister for the Environment, I would be very anxious to see a reversal of this trend.  I would remind all concerned in the building industry &mdash; especially specifiers and contractors &mdash; to bear in mind the benefits they can confer on the national economy and the additional employment they can generate by opting for building products and materials that are made in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Timber is by far the single building material with the greatest potential for import substitution.  It has been quantified in excess of £30 million a year at current prices.  Over recent years, there has been a considerable advance in the processing and the finished quality of Irish timber.  This improved quality together with the increased quantity of timber maturing in Irish forests combine to create, for the first time, the opportunity to make real progress in substituting native for imported softwood timber.</P>
    <P>From my viewpoint, as Minister for the Environment, it is vitally important that the individuals and bodies concerned should take all possible steps to exploit to the full the more widespread use of quality Irish timber in construction.</P>
    <P>Finally as regards the building industry, I hope to be in a position, following receipt of a consultant's report on the industry, which is expected soon, to promote longer term planning for the industry, thereby creating a better investment climate and initiating a period of balanced development.  The report in question was commissioned to identify the opportunity and to detail an action programme for development and expansion, particularly in relation to employment.</P>
    <P>Housing is the biggest single component of the construction industry, accounting for over 40 per cent of output and about one third of employment.  The importance of the housing sector is not solely because of its output and employment implications but also its capacity to satisfy a basic social need.  It is the Government's policy to ensure that as far <Col N="1823" /> as it is within our resources every household is reasonably housed.  In the interests of equity, the State must concentrate on housing those who otherwise would not be in a position to house themselves. Over the past decade and a half, housing output has been rising in response to the increase in population over this period.</P>
    <P>The need for a high level of housing output will continue, a fact we recognise in our Joint Programme for Government which includes an aim to raise output towards 30,000 units per year.  While the programme did not lay down any specific timescale I am concerned that there should be no avoidable delay in making progress towards the achievement of this target.</P>
    <P>The capital commitment to housing which has been made in the budget is a gererous one especially in view of the constraints necessarily imposed by the very difficult budgetary situation.  It is not enough, however, to make sure that there will be sufficient capital available for housing, it is equally important to ensure that these resources are directed to where they will be most effective and that they will assist those who are most in need.  The House can be assured that I will be most vigilant in directing the resources that are available to us to obtain maximum value for the State's outlay.</P>
    <P>One sector where Government intervention is direct and most effective is in the provision of housing by local authorities. A total of £208 million is being made available towards the local authority housing construction programme in 1983. This represents an increase of £22 million or 12 per cent on last year's provision.  I am pleased to be able to say that recently the rate of increase in the tender prices for local authority dwellings has slowed down.  This development should enhance the return, in real terms, that we can get from our 1983 capital allocation.  In addition, it is my intention to have a broad-ranging examination undertaken of the extent to which there may be scope for restraining the unit costs of such dwellings, which have unfortunately increased so substantially in recent years.  The <Col N="1824" /> increased provision for the programme should ensure that the level of construction is maintained throughout 1983. Allowing for the recent more favourable tender prices, it should enable more than 5,700 local authority houses to be completed by the year's end, and result in an average building programme throughout the year of more than 7,000 houses. Employment on the programme should be maintained at the 1982 level.</P>
    <P>Apart from the capital allocated for the construction of houses provided by local authorities for letting, a sum of more than £128 million is being allocated for the subsidisation of local authority housing generally in 1983.  This subsidy meets in full the loan charges which the local authorities pay on the money borrowed by them to provide houses for letting to those in need.  The 1983 provision is an increase of more than £30 million, or 30 per cent over the expenditure in 1982.</P>
    <P>Output in the private housing sector is, of course, affected by the general economic situation and, in particular by the level of demand.  The availability of an adequate supply of mortgage finance is paramount to the welfare of the sector. I am pleased to say that the outlook for mortgage finance is good.  Last year, the building societies advanced £290 million in home loans in respect of 14,000 dwellings. In 1983, the societies are expected to have mortgage finance available for about 15,000 home loans.  The building society mortgage rate is now at its lowest for more than four years and the level of house prices is stable.</P>
    <P>People on lower incomes for whom the building societies do not cater are provided with mortgage finance through the loans schemes operated by the local authorities and by the Housing Finance Agency.  This latter scheme has proved very popular.  By the end of last year nearly £17 million had been advanced by the agency in mortgages.  This year, an allocation of £50 million is being provided to the agency which is expected to be ample for its needs.  Deputies will be aware that the agency's first issue of stock recently was very successful.  The success <Col N="1825" /> of the stock issue is very encouraging as it makes private sector funds available for housing which is, indeed, most welcome.</P>
    <P>Apart from mortgage finances and following on from my meeting with representatives of the building industry to which I have already referred, I am having a special examination carried out with a view to creating an environment conducive to private house building.  I have in mind, for example, the easing of constraints in areas such as bridging finance and planning and by-law controls which may be having a disincentive effect on private sector investment and private house purchase.</P>
    <P>Despite the gravity of our financial situation and the need to look searchingly at every item of public expenditure, the Government are continuing the operation of special schemes to encourage private house purchase.  These measures include the new house grant scheme for first-time purchasers and the mortgage subsidy scheme which applies to much the same category of persons.</P>
    <P>It is my aim to ensure that these schemes coupled with the operation of the Housing Finance Agency and local authority loan schemes, should have the maximum effect in raising housing output and in broadening the categories of persons to which private house purchase is a feasible proposition.  The continued commitment to the scheme of grants for house improvement shows the importance we attach to the preservation of the existing housing stock.</P>
    <P>There is a particular programme of housing aid which, I feel, is important.  It is the programme to improve the living conditions of old people living alone in insanitary or unfit accommodation for which £1 million was provided last year. The range of works undertaken could involve repairs to a chimney or fireplaces to ensure effective heating, the provision of water and sanitary facilities, the provision of food storage facilities, works to facilitate access to a house such as a ramp or handrail, etc.  Application for aid can be made by the occupant of the house requiring improvement, or any person or <Col N="1826" /> body such as a relative, doctor, clergyman, public nurse, voluntary body, etc., could apply on his or her behalf.</P>
    <P>Given the persons involved, formalities are kept to a minimum and in the case of any application approved, the work is carried out at no cost to the applicant.  Generally, the programme is being undertaken with the co-operation of the health boards on a regional basis under the direction of the various community care managers.  There is also close co-operation with certain voluntary organisations such as St. Vincent de Paul and &ldquo;Alone&rdquo;.  Notwithstanding, the need for the closest scrutiny of expenditures I must acknowledge that I was considerably impressed by the nature and administration, etc., of this particular relatively modest programme.  I am glad that, following my initiative in the matter, the Government have decided that a further special provision of £1 million would be made in 1983 for this special programme to improve the housing conditions of the elderly.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of housing, I want to say something about my own approach to this most pressing problem. To a large extent, I see advancement in housing conditions generally as a cornerstone of overall social policy.  If people are not properly housed, it is difficult, if not impossible, for them to advance in other ways; their whole pattern of life may be affected, their opportunities for development may be restricted, their potential for benefiting from education may be regarded, and the employment opportunities otherwise open to them may be prejudiced.  At the present time, I have to face the fact that what can be done in the housing field is constrained by the harsh realities of our present situation; these realities mean, in brutal terms, that the inequalities and inadequacies in housing conditions will be with us for some time to come.  However, it will be my aim to see that policies can be developed in such a way that take account of the available financial resources but will at the same time achieve greater equity for all, help people in accordance with their needs and maintain a consistent trend of activity both in relation to <Col N="1827" /> new building and the maintenance of our existing housing stock.</P>
    <P>Turning now to roads nobody will deny that 1982 was characterised by widespread complaints about the condition of our roads and by a sharp fall in employment on road works.  Employment declined from 11,500 in 1979 to 10,550 in 1981.  Employment fell by a further 450 last year.  Four local authorities had workers on a three-day week for part of the year.  Despite the present difficult economic situation, I am hopeful that our budgetary strategy for 1983 will see an overall net improvement in the condition of our roads and a halt to the falling employment on roads.</P>
    <P>Direct State investment in roads in 1983 will amount to £115.5 million, representing an increase of 14 per cent relative to 1982.  This should more than compensate for increases in costs.  The 1983 provision represents an increase of 51 per cent in real terms compared with 1979. Ninety million pounds is being provided this year for improvements, or £10 million greater than in 1982.  Priority must, of course, be given to the completion of schemes already in progress throughout the country and new works will be chosen with an eye on supplementary finance from EEC sources.  The main schemes in progress during this year will include the by-passes at Naas, Santry, Swords, and Athlone, the Kilkenny ring road, a new Redmond Bridge in Waterford and the Bandon Line Road and Custom House bridges in Cork.</P>
    <P>Regarding maintenance, our aim must be to preserve the existing roads and the capital investment of previous decades by spending more on maintenance.  The £25.5 million under this heading is an 18.6 per cent increase over 1982.  This money will not only allow for a better standard of maintenance on our national roads but it will also allow a modest increase in the block grant for certain works on main and county roads.  Road works are labour-intensive and road maintenance provides more jobs per unit of expenditure than road improvements. There is a wide distribution of direct employment both on site and off site <Col N="1828" /> throughout the country and there is indirect employment in quarrying, plant and other related industries.  Equally important is that by far the greater amount of the materials used comes from entirely native sources.</P>
    <P>Deputies, Senators and local councillors of all political persuasions are now aware of the fact that some county roads are deteriorating because there has been insufficient money to maintain them.  The Exchequer does not contribute directly to the costs of county road maintenance but it influences to a large degree the level of the annual programme of works through the agricultural grant and the domestic rate relief grant.  The extra £31.5 million provided for these grants compared with the provision made by the previous administration as recently as last November will certainly improve the state of local finances and allow them a much wider range of discretionary expenditure.  I am confident they will direct a fair share of this new finance to much needed maintenance work on county roads and in doing so maintain local employment.</P>
    <P>The sanitary services programme is of course a prerequisite for the construction of houses, factories, offices and community buildings.  The programme is also essential for the modernisation and expansion of farming activity and for the prevention and abatement of pollution. It is for these reasons that the Government despite the present financial constraints have provided a capital allocation of close on £110 million for sanitary services in 1983.  This represents an increase of over £16 million or 17 per cent on the outturn capital expenditure of less than £94 million on water and sewerage services in 1982.  Despite economic and fiscal problems, sanitary services investment will grow in real terms in 1983.  The Government's allocations to sanitary services is a recognition of the need for the building up of the infrastructure required to support medium and long term economic growth and job creation and thus is, in effect, a vote of confidence in the future.</P>
    <P>The most important component of the sanitary services programme in terms of <Col N="1829" /> facilitating economic and social development is the provision of major public water and sewerage schemes.  It is my intention to ensure that the capital available is channelled to major public water and sewerage schemes of the highest priority, namely, those designed to cater for new industrial and residential developments, so that these schemes can proceed to construction with the minimum avoidable delay.  The average direct employment on the sanitary services programme is projected to increase to 2,150 jobs in 1983.  This represents a 19 per cent increase on the outturn average employment of 1,810 jobs in 1982.</P>
    <P>The EEC Western Package of FEOGA aid is of vital significance to the development of the less favoured farming areas in the western counties.  The capital allocation for sanitary services includes a provision of £5.3 million for public water schemes designated for grant assistance under the western package and is adequate to meet all grant requirements likely to arise in 1983.  This reflects the Government's commitment to maintaining the momentum of the western package in building up the infrastructure of the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government are also conscious of the need to give all practicable assistance to private group water schemes which play such a vital role in bringing piped water to rural houses and associated farms which lack this basic amenity. Accordingly, a sum of £7.2 million has been allocated to group water scheme grants.  This represents an increase of £900,000 or 14 per cent on the corresponding outturn provision in 1982.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that despite the current economic difficulties the Government are providing substantial funds for employment on environment works in the local government sector this year.  A sum of £8 million is being made available to my Department from the funds of the Youth Employment Agency.  A sum of £6 million will be used for the engagement by local authorities of longer-term young unemployed persons to carry out works of environmental benefit to their areas and to develop appropriate skills through <Col N="1830" /> this work experience programme.  The remaining £2 million will be used to develop new opportunities through local authorities for temporary employment and training.  I am anxious to see greater emphasis placed on training aspects and benefits of the local authority programmes in this area in the current year. My Department, in conjunction with the Youth Employment Agency, have reviewed the scheme to ensure that all participants get the best possible training and work experience and that value for money is achieved on all projects.</P>
    <P>A further £2 million is provided in my Department's vote for the financing of local authority environment schemes bringing to £10 million the total of funds being made available to local authorities in 1983 to promote the twin aims of employment creation &mdash; and especially the creation of employment for young people &mdash; and of cleaning-up and improving the environment all round the country. I have now notified local authorities of the details and their allocations.  I would anticipate that the Youth Employment Programme will enable upwards of 3,000 young people to participate with local authorities in work experience and training schemes throughout 1983.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of job creation, I believe that it is essential now that the planning control system should operate speedily and effectively and that all avoidable delays in decision-making are eliminated.  With this objective in mind, I am continuing with the general review of planning law promised by my predecessor. Pending completion of this review, a great deal can be done by administrative action to ensure that the exercise of development control will not have the effect of impeding worthwhile development.  Each planning authority have been asked to carry out, as a matter of urgency, a review of their general approach to development control.  To assist them in this task a substantial memorandum containing advice and guidelines of a general nature was issued by my Department in October 1982.  In these difficult economic times I expect all authorities to adopt a positive approach and to streamline procedures to the maximum <Col N="1831" /> extent consistent with sound planning principles.</P>
    <P>Recently, concern has been expressed about delays at appeals level.  Some delays are of course inevitable, given the procedures that must be followed by An Bord Pleanála to ensure justice to all concerned.  In addition, there are factors outside the control of the board that add to the length of time taken to determine some appeals.  An Bord Pleanála have adopted new administrative procedures aimed at increasing their capacity to process appeals and additional inspectors are to be appointed.  I am concerned, however, that there appears to have been a considerable increase in the numbers of appeals on hands during 1982 and I have undertaken urgent consideration of the measures that might be taken to arrest and reverse this trend.</P>
    <P>The operation of the planning control system has considerable cost implications for local authorities and it is reasonable that those using the system should make some contribution towards this.  With this in mind, a system of fees for planning applications and appeals is being introduced. It is anticipated that fees for planning applications will yield about £5.5 million in the current year, or about half of the cost of operation of the control system.  In the case of appeals a relatively modest appeal fee of £30 is being introduced. The amount to be raised will represent only a fraction of the cost of operating the appeals system and I think it is not unreasonable under present conditions to ask the people who have recourse to the system to make this contribution and to reduce to that extent the burden on the public at large.</P>
    <P>A key priority for this Government is to reverse the very serious imbalance in our nation's finances.  That was the position 12 months ago and it is equally true to-day.  This is the only road which can be followed if we are to build up the necessary confidence in the economy as a whole, which is vital to creating conditions essential to the maintenance and growth of employment.  An over-riding objective is the creation of additional jobs.  I am afraid there are no easy or soft <Col N="1832" /> options open to us.  We are now, unfortunately, having to face the consequences of the economic policies pursued over a number of years by those on the opposite side of the House.</P>
    <P>Confidence must be restored to the building industry and, as I have already indicated, this will be one of my highest priorities.  A relevant area of activity which is vital to job creation concerns the provision of local authority services.  The package which I have put together for local authorities, including an extra £31.5 million by way of rates support grants, will give a much-needed boost to their discretionary spending to the benefit of both the services they provide and employment.</P>
    <P>We have a long road to travel to get employment creation up to the level where opportunities exist for those now out of work and for the young people coming into the labour force.  I am confident that our people will be prepared to travel that road with us.  They know, as we know, that we cannot go on mortgaging the future.</P>
    <P>The parents of young families &mdash; the parents of children facing a bleak future &mdash; are willing to make whatever sacrifice is necessary if that future can be given back to all our children.  For my part, I will work to ensure that that sacrifice is not in vain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister leaves the House perhaps he could give me an answer to a question.  In his statement he said it is anticipated that about 3,000 young people will be employed on the youth employment scheme this year. Has he any idea how many were employed on the scheme last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that figure to hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the finest schemes and I congratulate the Minister on encouraging and developing it.  I suppose all Members would differ on the emphasis we would put on a budget and would have our own ideas about areas where we would not make any cuts.  I regret very much the cutbacks that have <Col N="1833" /> taken place in education.  To me the priorities in life are food, shelter&mdash;in this I include clothing&mdash;and education.  We have a tremendous responsibility and obligation to educate our young people irrespective of what job opportunities may exist at a particular time in our development.  Recently there was considerable controversy regarding a speech made by Deputy Kelly when he suggested we were educating our people for export. I found it difficult to disagree with some of the things he said, although I would not agree with everything.  If we have a situation where our young people are forced to look further than Ireland to get employment, it is right and necessary that they have a proper education to enable them at least to avail of job opportunities elsewhere.  As a parent I would like to state that if my children had to emigrate I would want them to have had a good education.</P>
      <P>I regret in particular the cutbacks in the area of remedial teaching.  I take a keen interest in matters dealing with mental health, and in organisations that work with young people suffering from Down's Syndrome and those who need special care.  I have an understanding of the slow learner.  Many of these people could not be described as mentally retarded but they are slow learners in the initial stages and normally would be left at the back of the class while the rest of the students progressed.  We have a great responsibility to such people and I am very saddened that once again remedial teaching is being cut back.  This happened before in the period of office of the former National Coalition Government in 1973 but when we resumed office in 1977 we restored remedial teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The philosophy of our party places a higher priority on education than would appear to be the case with the Coalition Government.  This is evidenced by the fact that we restored the entry age for young children in primary schools.  What we did on that occasion was appreciated and I am glad that our good work in this regard has not been undone by the Government. We have a tremendous responsibility with regard to slow learners.  Many of these people improve very considerably <Col N="1834" /> as they develop.  Many people are late developers.  In the years to come we will regret the cutbacks now taking place in the area of remedial teaching.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of cutbacks in career guidance teaching.  Again, this will have a bad effect particularly on the more deprived areas such as the inner city area in Dublin.  We need career guidance teachers because they fulfil a most important function.  The amount of money was small in relation to the good work they were carrying out and it was a tragedy that the Minister for Education imposed cutbacks at this level.  The Government should have another look at this matter. In Dublin city the saving in this area will be in the region of £50,000.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to look sympathetically at the two areas I have mentioned. I know that education eats money at a ferocious rate.  Between them education, health and social welfare use 50 per cent of the money spent in running the State.  They are very large spending Departments.  I am disappointed there has been no apparent movement in relation to the development of a youth policy. I know that there is talk about meeting various organisations but there has not been any allocation of funds to develop youth clubs.  I have often described youth education as a second chance education for many people who leave school at an early date.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are some good aspects to the budget and one is in relation to the youth employment programme. However, one provision in the budget which I considered very mean was the matter of VAT on fuel, particularly on briquettes.  People who use this type of fuel are mainly poor people.  Better-off people tend to use briquettes in their centrally heated homes when they are having visitors, or when they usually light fires in the grate at Christmas time but essentially it is a fuel that is much more used by poorer families particularly in Dublin.  The action of the Government in this area was especially mean.</P>
    <P>The £4 fuel voucher is excellent value because it goes to the people who need it most.  It is one of the best operated schemes.  The Government could have <Col N="1835" /> increased the amount even by 50p or £1. This would mean that those in need would not be worse off because of the imposition of VAT.  The cost of living is high and it will continue to soar especially having regard to increases in petrol and diesel.  All the increases will eventually work their way down to the goods delivered to the shops.  We are now at the stage where people have to look twice at the money in their pocket.  To old people, to those on the lower levels of social welfare who have families and who are to trying to clothe and feed them the old basics of bread, cheese and milk are expensive items now.  Cheese is very expensive and I do not understand why. It was once a staple diet.  Nobody ever went hungry because there was always bread and cheese.  If one looks at the price of a pound of cheese one would not believe one's eyes.  On the continent it is much cheaper.  Large families have to contend with all these things and it is not easy for them.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House always advocated that subsidies should be introduced when there is high unemployment and high inflation.  When the unemployment rate and the rate of inflation begin to reduce one begins to dismantle subsidies. We are all suspicious about subsidies because they benefit the rich as well as the poor.  However, as most families are on a low income it is the lesser of two evils.</P>
    <P>In certain areas there should be means tests.  For example, we might have a look at grants which are available to a first-time purchaser of a house valued at £50,000 or £60,000.  The best way to tax people is by extracting it according to their income.  When one is desperately trying to save money and do so with a sense of social justice &mdash; I do not say the Minister for Finance has any less a social conscience than I &mdash; one can differ on how cuts are made and where the priorities are but we must be very careful not to completely cripple someone who is already up to his neck in taxation, be it young families trying to educate their children or whoever.  Very often families try to pay for music lessons and so on for <Col N="1836" /> children.  If we forget that there is a cultural education we must give our children we will be left with a nation without a soul.  Cultural education is what gives soul to a people.  People who make sacrifices for their children and forego holidays and so on so that they can give their children little extras do so because they want it for their children and the Government should not make it difficult for them.</P>
    <P>The middle income group are hard pressed now.  Included in that group are wage earners with good jobs.  They cannot be drained financially much more than they have been.  If they are forced by economic necessity to stop educating their children outside school whether through music lessons, drama or whatever, we will be in trouble.  The Government Chief Whip is present in the House and I should like him to tell me when the Community Service Bill will be brought before the House.  It is important that it be brought in soon.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned about the malicious damage which is done in our society. We are haemorrhaging from the amount of money which has to be spent in compensation for malicious damage and also from the money which is paid to the garda to police the streets.  There are no deterrents to crime.  I should like to see a situation where people who are caught vandalising property, burning cars, mugging people, robbing handbags and so on should be made to put back into the community what they have taken out of it.  Every time I see a figure of £300 million in compensation for malicious damages I wonder if it is correct.  I am staggered at the cost involved.  The only way we will stop this is to stamp out vandalism.  If the Government did not have to spend such a vast sum then they would not have to introduce any new taxation.  When put in that light one recognises that there is a big task ahead of us.</P>
    <P>I should like to see encouragement of home industries.  Yesterday I was speaking to a priest who runs a group in the Thomas Street area of my constituency about development centres for young people.  I thought if they were to develop <Col N="1837" /> even candle-making as a home industry where six people could come together and be shown how to make candles they could sell them to the traders in Thomas Street who in turn could sell them at Christmas time.  If we have a generation of young people leaving school with no job, their self-confidence and belief in themselves will soon disappear.  When they get married and have children they will have little ambition for them.</P>
    <P>We must encourage local industry. When the Minister is replying to the debate he might give consideration to this point.  Recently visiting my constituency I met Mr. Michael Swords who is a wonderful teacher at Bolton Street.  He teaches young people leaving school how to use computers.  They would not be in competition with people studying computer science at university or technical school level.  A shopkeeper with a turnover of no more than £15,000 or £20,000 a year might be encouraged to get a small computer costing £400 or £500 and set up a filing system.  Young people without a leaving certificate could operate those computers.  They could be employed as office staff.  There are many ways in which we could help local enterprise and this is something in which we should interest ourselves.</P>
    <P>The mineral water industry employ roughly 1,000 people and they are going through a very tough time.  In the budget the Minister said that as he had already imposed increases in the January mini-budget on spirits, tobacco, beer and wine, he allowed for a corresponding reduction in excise duty on these products to offset the increase in VAT from 18 per cent to 23 per cent, but he excluded mineral waters.  The people in this industry feel very aggrieved because of this.  The Minister should have another look at this, even at this late stage.  These people feel that they are being discriminated against and, in my view, they are justified.  They made the point that prior to being elected to Government, Fine Gael had indicated a willingness to reduce the duty on soft drinks because they felt it was unfair to children.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy P. Barry told this to the <Col N="1838" /> soft drinks and beer bottlers association. Perhaps they would make representations to the Minister for Finance, although very often Ministers for Finance are their own bosses.  The Minister for Finance understands this position and he must look at every job and help every industry so that they will not fold up.  It is very important that he stop the slide in which the mineral water industry find themselves because the price of a bottle of orange is unbelievably high.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Tánaiste refer to the speeding up of planning applications and the process by which people get their planning approvals.  He might look at speeding up by-law approvals.  Most people attached to local authorities appreciate that people can be waiting six months for a by-law approval to carry out an extension to a small house.  If the application is put in around April or May the work may not be finished before winter and may have to be deferred for another year when prices will have increased further.  Dublin Corporation are trying to transfer this procedure from their planning department to the applicant's architects who will give the go-ahead, when agreement has been reached between them and the Department of the Environment.  No planning approval would be given if it was not deserved.</P>
    <P>The streamlining and speeding up of planning permissions generally is very important.  We want to keep people at work.  Very often a small builder can be literally hanging on, waiting for the next contract which may be dependent on a planning permission which has been delayed or appealed.  It is no harm to charge a fee if a person is appealing against a planning approval, because there will always be professional objectors. It will be a test of a person's sincerity if he is willing to pay to appeal against a planning approval.  If he wins his appeal, a case could be made for refunding his money.  We should discourage the people who make frivolous objections because they are stopping the creation of employment and this is frustrating.  I would like the Minister for the Environment to tell the local authorities that they should not <Col N="1839" /> allow any plans to go through if they do not conform to good planning, but if they do conform, approval should be given and the job started.</P>
    <P>Many people in business feel that civil servants, who have no fear of redundancies, do not have the same sense of urgency.  I find that very difficult to accept.  Everybody knows it takes four people at work to maintain one civil servant. I do not know how that figure was arrived at, but it has often been quoted. It is very important that the civil service make sure that the people who by their taxes, pay my Dáil allowance and their salary, are encouraged to keep producing. I have no doubt we will come out of this depression but we have to be optimistic. I come from a long line of optimists and believe in the future of this country and the people.  We must set the right example by getting down to hard work and developing the work ethic.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see some money will be spent on our roads which are in a deplorable state.  I travel to this House almost every day and see many potholes which have been filed with tar and about five or six weeks later the roads are as bad as ever.  This is a terrible waste of money. Perhaps the Minister would look at the cost of maintaining certain roads and ask why the maintenance of such and such a road costs so much.  We have to become very cost-conscious in the public service and it is important that every bill is queried, especially accounts that seem unnecessarily high.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise the subject matter of Question No. 63 on today's Order Paper.  I asked at the end of Question Time for a written reply but up to now I have not received it.  As Minister, I always ensured that questions were available immediately <Col N="1840" /> to any Deputy who wanted a written reply and it was discourteous that this reply was not available to me.  Is it another indication of the order breaking down?  Question No. 63 is:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Public Service if and when he will announce the charges being imposed by the budget on candidates applying for employment in the civil service.</P>
      <P>I put this question down on the Order Paper several weeks ago.  It obviously would not have been reached until next week at the earliest.  Therefore, I was justified in seeking a written reply.  Normally the reply is available before the end of Dáil business but this has not happened today.  I wish to protest strongly about the inadequacy of the system which did not make it available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could find no reference to these fees in the budget speech of the Minister for Finance on 9 February but when the now famed pink pages were handed around I saw at the bottom of page 3: &ldquo;Principal policy measures adopted by this Government in settling the revised Estimate&rdquo;. Just under that it says: &ldquo;Fees to be charged by the Civil Service Commission for civil service examinations&rdquo;.  I want to establish what the statement of fees means.  No public statements have been made.  In yesterday's national newspapers there was an advertisement for careers in the public service and, in the smallest print, even wearing glasses it is almost impossible to read it, it says there is an application fee for all competitions announced by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissions after 1 March 1983.  Instructions as to how the fee is to be paid are contained in the documentation issued with application forms.  The way they are to pay the £10 is being kept secret.  Understandably, on reading these advertisements yesterday morning, as a Member of this House who had the question down for several weeks, I was entitled to feel very concerned. Here, for the first time, or perhaps I should say for the second time, we have a tax on employment.  We are saying to young people if they dare to apply for a job in the civil service they will be <Col N="1841" /> charged a fee of £10.  They will give no refunds if applicants are unsuccessful, they will hold it in the interest of administration. How can the Labour Party support that kind of policy which emanates from Deputy Boland, Minister for the Public Service?  He was the Minister who raised the school age and no longer accepted four year olds.  He now sees fit to impose a £10 fine on all new job applicants. No job, no fee refund.</P>
    <P>Parent groups and teaching organisations have severely criticised this measure. It has also been criticised by politicians and the news media and rightly so. This is probably one of the most reactionary decisions which was taken here for many moons.  I said in a radio interview yesterday that the amount of revenue it will bring in is small.  We are told in the famous pink pages that it will bring in an estimated £½ million this year.  Perhaps it will, at a time of such high youth unemployment, when every Member of this House has constituents running to his weekly clinics asking what the prospects for jobs are it is very frustrating, difficult and costly for young people.  It is extremely costly for parents to send their children for interviews and now a further penalty of £10 is added to job application.</P>
    <P>I will read some of the vacancies which were advertised for school leavers in yesterday's newspapers: Executive Officer, Higher Tax Officer, Indoor Officer of Customs and Excise, Social Welfare Officer, Junior Clerk in the Office of the Supreme and High Courts, Higher Officers of Customs and Excise, six posts in all for school leavers.  If a school leaver wants to apply for all those posts is it the Minister's intention to charge £60?  If applicants sit for the examination or are called for interview is that money retained by the Department?  What are the Government coming to if a reactionary Minister, supported by a once proud Labour Party, can impose such a tax?  It was tried by the Western Health Board in 1976 during the term of office of a previous Coalition Government but Deputy Brendan Corish, who was then Minister for Health, to his credit ensured that it was discontinued because of the <Col N="1842" /> representations of the Fianna Fáil members of that health board.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to drop this idea just as quickly because it is discriminatory, reactionary and the last thing that we need at present.  If we impose this it will set a new low for many people to follow.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i> carried an article this morning and obviously checked some of the facts with the Government Information Services.  I will read one paragraph:</P>
    <P>Those applying for the Garda Síochána are not required to pay a fee with their application, however, the GIS spokesman said yesterday that it is believed a compulsory application fee will be introduced in this sector shortly.</P>
    <P>Now we are told all civil service and Local Appointments Commission competitions, and very shortly the Garda competitions, will be subject to fees.  Where do we go from here?  Do we go to local authorities and health boards?  Do we go into the private sector?  Are we now encouraging many of those institutions in the private sector to impose a fine of £10 also?  Before this gathers further momentum this Minister has an obligation to our young people to drop this fee.  I accept the need for financial restraint and for certain cuts in public expenditure.  But my party and I will not accept anything else but an immediate withdrawal of this £10 fee imposition, which brings in such an insignificant amount of revenue but causes such hardship, creates discrimination and taxes employment opportunities. I would not sit at a Cabinet table and accept this measure under any circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are prepared to support this measure.  To what depths have we sunk?  I will oppose it and my party will oppose it.  My party will organise and vote against it at the appropriate time.  I will quote what so many people are saying. I know a career guidance officer in my city, an excellent official, and he is quoted in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> as somebody who has been dealing with young <Col N="1843" /> people so effectively for so long.  That paper stated:</P>
    <P>Yesterday the chairman of the North Cork branch of the ASTI, Mr. Oliver Cullinane, said his union had been inundated with complaints.  And they will take the matter up with the relevant Government department today.</P>
    <P>I hope the ASTI have taken it up with the relevant Government Department and with the Minister and I hope the Minister has already reconsidered what he should do about it.</P>
    <P>I should now like to quote from the <i>Irish Independent,</i> which carried the headline &ldquo;Anger at £10 Application Levy on School Leavers&rdquo;.  I should say that the request for the £10 application fee appeared for the first time in the Government job advertisements in yesterday's papers.  I had this question on the Order Paper for some weeks and when I looked for a written reply this afternoon I could not be accommodated before I came to speak in the House.  I now want to quote what Mrs. Mary O'Carroll, Chairperson of the Congress of Catholic Secondary Schools Parents Association, said last night:</P>
    <P>This is very big blow to parents and their children who are leaving school this year.  The cuts curtailing career guidance in schools already means more students now leave without a clear idea of their careers goals, which results in them applying for several public service jobs as they arise because of dire necessity.  Parents have to come up with £10 for each application, as well as the cost of sending them for interviews.</P>
    <P>That is on top of the examination fees which have been in existence and were increased recently.</P>
    <P>I wonder do Labour Party Ministers attend Government meetings?  Traditionally the Fine Gael Party has been oriented towards the Pale and Dublin.  Their interests have been confined to those areas.  They seem to have forgotten the young people from Mayo, west Cork, Kerry or Donegal, who have to attend at <Col N="1844" /> interviews.  Wherever they have to go it is costly for them because of the price of travelling.  In addition to that cost we have a fine of £10 being imposed because young people dare to apply to the Government for a job.  Before this goes any further the Minister should change the decision.</P>
    <P>We are told it will earn £500,000 this year but I suspect that that figure is too high because the danger is that with the imposition of this charge school-leavers will not submit applications.  If that is the case we are going back to creating an elitist society.  The Minister will be charged in the future with having endeavoured during his term of office to make school leavers of 1983 and beyond elitist.</P>
    <P>What are the children whose parents cannot afford to pay the examination fee to do?  We have had the horrible issue of school transport charges being belted across the floor of the House in recent times and that was followed by messing, and chopping and changing before the Government decided to relieve some people of that charge.  In this case there will not be any relief and the charge will be £10 for all irrespective of the salary structure of the post advertised.  On behalf of Fianna Fáil, I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this charge so that he will not be classified as the person who introduced an elitist society.</P>
    <P>I should like to know where the members of the Labour Party stand in this regard.  Before the election we heard many Labour Party members referring to the dreadful measures Fianna Fáil were taking and what would be done if they were returned to power.  Those people announced what they would do if they went into coalition with Fine Gael, but I know what they have done since they joined with Fine Gael &mdash; they have kept their mouths shut because they do not have any say.  For a while longer Labour backbenchers will walk into the Division Lobbies behind Fine Gael, but I wonder how long that will last.  Actions like the matter under discussion will shorten the life of the Government because parents who are going through a difficult period will be hit hard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1845" /> Many students are involved in mock or preliminary examinations in preparation for the leaving certificate in June and in conjunction with that they must now carry the worry of what employment prospects there are when they leave school.  This is a dreadful and inhuman decision.  Will a young person reading the public service advertisements, if he is qualified for six of the posts, have to pay the fee applicable to each of them?  The Minister should have a copy of an application form in the House and make it available to the press so that people can see what is involved.  Is it necesary for an applicant to pay for six application forms?  If advertisements appear later seeking recruits to the Garda Síochána will those who applied earlier for positions in the Civil Service have to pay a further fee?  I have no doubt that the next move will be to charge future applicants for posts in the prison service and that procedure will be followed by the banks and the private sector in general.  This decision is disgraceful.  On behalf of my party I demand that the Minister withdraw the charge immediately.  Unless he does we will pursue him in this House by whatever means are within the Order of the House.  We will oppose him every inch of the way until such time as he and his Government see common sense and withdraw the charge which has been imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather taken aback at the tone of the contribution by the Deputy in relation to this matter.  In the nicest way possible I venture to suggest that his memory is as faulty as his information is not correct factually.  I would like at the outset to deal with the question which the Deputy raised regarding his request for a written reply to be issued to this question which has been on the Order Paper for some weeks in relation to this matter, and the Deputy was extremely critical, to say the least, both of me and the staff within my Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; who are staff with whom the Minister himself worked until quite recently.  It ill behoves the Deputy to make allegations like that without first having checked on the factual situation. I have done so since he raised the matter 15 minutes ago and my information is that the Deputy at some stage earlier today, probably at the end of Question Time, asked for a written reply to this question.  Due to some administrative difficulties involving the staff of this House as opposed to the staff of my Department or myself personally, that request was not dealt with by the administrative staff within this House.  It is understandable that human error occurs from time to time and whatever human error occurred did not occur either within the staff of my Department or at my level personally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister carries the responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that an insinuation such as was made against the staff of the Department of the Public Service should have been made in that way without the matter first having been investigated.  Equally it is regrettable and unfair that I was first notified to come in here to deal with this matter at 4.35 p.m. today whilst I was, as the Deputy and the House will know, at a well-publicised meeting taking place between the Government and the FUE as a successor to the meeting which took place this morning with the ICTU.  I consider that both unfair and a little discourteous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald seems to think that this is the first time that charges such as this have been imposed on applicants for posts which are under the responsibility of the Civil Service Commission.  He is, of course, totally wrong.  If he thinks that my action or the action of my Government in deciding to reimpose those charges is inhuman, brutal and unfair, I presume he would feel that the same remarks are equally applicable to Deputy Ryan, his colleague, when Minister for Finance in the sixties, Deputy McEntee when he was Minister for Finance previously and those other members of the Fianna Fáil Party who not only imposed <Col N="1847" /> but implemented consistently over a long number of years charges for all positions which were to be filled in the Civil Service Commission.  The Deputy's memory must be faulty indeed when he asks if perhaps this heinous act might be extended into the Local Appointments Commission.  If my memory does not fail me, Deputy Fitzgerald prior to his becoming a Member of this House, was an officer of a local authority.  Had he at the time he was an officer of a local authority chosen to apply for a senior grade which would have involved his application going to the Local Appointment Commission, he would have had to send together with that application form a fee in order for his application to have been considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's recollection is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to think that is incorrect.  Perhaps he did not choose ever to apply for a senior position. I cannot comment on that, but the factual situation is that up to the late sixties a fee was charged by the Civil Service Commission in respect of applications for all jobs which were filled by them and a fee was charged during that period by the Local Appointments Commission in relation to senior positions which were within the local authorities and which were the responsibility of the Local Appointments Commission to fill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way it is incorrect to suggest that this item is some mystery thriller, some deep, dark secret while at the same time the Deputy concedes that on the day the budget was announced in this House the accompanying documentation showed clearly that fees were to be charged in respect of these Civil Service Commission jobs so as to a raise a sum of approximately £400,000.  There is no great secret about this.  It is perfectly incorrect to suggest that this was the first time ever in the same way as it is incorrect to maintain, as the Deputy did consistently during the last 20 minutes, that the fee was one flat fee of £10 based upon his quoting from the advertisement which <Col N="1848" /> appeared in Wednesday's national newspapers. If he had studied that advertisement and given it anything more than a cursory glance he would have seen that another of the positions advertised in that advertisement carried an application fee of £7.  That was published in the national newspaper including the national daily newspaper published in Cork which the Deputy referred to.  Therefore, it cannot be said that it was perhaps only in the Pale newspapers that the advertisement for the position with a fee of £7 appeared.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked whether the six positions of executive officer, higher tax officer, indoor officer of customs and excise, social welfare officer, junior clerk in the offices of the Supreme and High Courts and higher officer of customs and excise would each require a separate fee from an applicant who would apply for all of them.  It ought to be obvious from a cursory study of the advertisement that as these are all in one grouping a single fee would apply in relation to them.  If, however, a person, having applied for that group, decided to apply for a position as an executive solicitor, which is a different type of job with a different job specification, of course a separate fee would be applicable in that case.</P>
    <P>Over the last number of years the number of applications to the Civil Service Commission for jobs allocated by them has been rising very steadily and is now well in excess of 100,000 per annum.  The average cost of servicing and processing those applications is approximately £30 per application.  In certain cases it can be considerably more than that, in other cases somewhat less.  Therefore, a two-tier level fee of £7 and £10, which is what the fees will be, represents only a fraction of the cost of processing those applications.</P>
    <P>It gives neither me nor the Government any great pleasure to reintroduce these fees, but the State must operate on the basis of providing services in two ways, either by raising taxation or by cutting out other services.  It seems fair to me that if a limited group of people want to avail of the right to apply for a civil service job which to the successful applicant guarantees permanency and security, <Col N="1849" /> they should be prepared to pay part of the processing cost of making that application rather than have the entire cost fall on the public at large.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the Deputy who raised this matter on the Adjournment is the Deputy who as Minister prepared the Estimates for the Department of the Public Service and the Civil Service Commission. Deputy Fitzgerald has qualities that some of us in this House might respect and in the main the Estimates that he prepared for the Department that is now mine were genuine Estimates fairly well and carefully prepared, pared to the bone and reduced by him somewhat from the first provisional set of Estimates that he had prepared, as he will remember.  The Government still must find a considerable additional sum of money and I was invited to find an additional £.5 million. I must do it either by raising money or by cutting out certain services.  If Deputy Fitzgerald wants these fees reduced let him stand up in the House and announce which part of the operations of the <Col N="1850" /> Department of the Public Service or the Civil Service Commission should be eliminated, reduced, cut out or cut back by £.5 million.  If he does that he will be admitting that he authorised and was in favour of the publication of a falsified Estimate for the Department to the tune of £.5 million.  He cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I have listened to a great deal of huffing and puffing here and to attacks, such as Deputy Fitzgerald has been known to launch in the last weeks, upon my colleagues in the Labour Party in this knock-about Cork way that he has. Deputy Fitzgerald seemed to be expert and adept in advising how the minority in Government ought to act.  It is unfortunate from his own and his party's point of view that they did not listen to his expert advice in dealing with their own minority rump.  If they had done so he might not be sitting over there today.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 8 March 1983.</P>

      <P>Charges at the rate of £7 or £10, depending on the level of the post concerned, were introduced with effect from 1 March 1983 and were announced in the weekly press advertisements published by the Civil Service Commissioners. Because of the steadily rising number of applications at public service competitions and of the growing costs of processing these candidatures, the Government decided to reintroduce application fees in order to recover at least a proportion of the costs involved.  Having regard to the fall in the value of money, the fees will, <Col N="1787" /> in effect, be much lower, proportionately, than when previously applicable.</P>

      <Col N="1798" /> He had however a total of 736 contributions in the UK arising out of employment there and while he cannot be awarded a pension under Irish legislation the EEC regulations on social security provide that his Irish and UK insurance records since 1953 may be combined to give him a pro-rata pension.  The amount of the pro-rata pension is determined on the basis of the number of his Irish contributions in proportion to the combined total of his Irish and UK contributions and is currently £20.70 per week, including an allowance of £9 in respect of his wife.
