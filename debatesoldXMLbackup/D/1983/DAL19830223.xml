    <Title>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1983: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham) Joseph Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1983, <Col N="804" /> a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on 17 January, 1983.</P>
    <P>The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, lists the investments in which trustees may invest trust funds unless forbidden by the instrument, if any, creating the trust.  The trust deed of course may extend trustees' powers of investment beyond those set out in the Act.  According to section 2 of the 1958 Act, the Minister for Finance may vary the authorised investments by order.  Over the years changes in the list have been put forward when deemed appropriate, the most recent order having been made in 1979.  Before the Minister may make the order a draft must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution of approval must be passed by each House.</P>
    <P>The draft order now before the House proposes to authorise trustees to place trust funds in interest-bearing deposit accounts in three non-associated banks. This will bring to 31 the number of licensed banks in which trust funds may be deposited.  The Central Bank has recommended that trustee status be granted in these three cases.  The criteria on the basis of which the Central Bank made its recommendations are:</P>
    <P>(a) All the banks are, or are owned by, institutions in which the Central Bank has a high level of confidence,</P>
    <P>(b)  All of the banks have gross assets and gross domestic assets in excess of the minimum qualification of £15 million,</P>
    <P>(c) All the banks have satisfactory capital levels,</P>
    <P>(d) Each bank is in compliance with the bank's licensing and supervision standards.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 (3) of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, the Minister for Finance is obliged to consult with the following persons in regard to the terms of any order he proposes to make to vary the list of investments:&mdash;A judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the Public Trustee, the Governor of the Central Bank, the President <Col N="805" /> of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, the Chairman of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee and the President of the Stock Exchange &mdash; Irish Unit.  All the statutory requirements in this respect have been complied with.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the banks named in the draft order are secure and suitable for the investment of trust funds.  The order will further increase the range of investment opportunities open to trustees. I therefore commend the motion for approval by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil support this motion and our understanding of it is that it brings to 31 the number of licensed banks in which trust funds may be deposited. I should like to ask the Minister to tell the House how many of that number will be commercial banks and non-associated banks.  The Minister has told us that one of the recommendations of the Central Bank was to the effect that all the banks have gross assets and gross domestic assets in excess of the minimum qualification of £15 million.  I should like to know if that figure has been updated because in today's terms £15 million is a small amount.  Is that figure being carried forward in the legislation because in terms of assets of any bank that sum is totally insignificant?  It would not indicate if a bank was liquid or not.  The figure is too small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Originally the figure was £10 million.  That figure is updated from time to time by the Central Bank to the amount they feel necessary. I should like to tell the Deputy that in the list of 31 there are four associated banks and 27 non-associated banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the number of people the Minister is obliged to consult in regard to this matter I should like to know why the Department of Finance feel it is necessary to consult so many people.  Is the Department in a position to make some of the decisions involved or, in the final analysis, are the decisions made by the Department and, as a matter of courtesy, checked with the people mentioned by the Minister?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important safeguard that the Department must consult the people mentioned.  I accept that the Department would be capable of making the decisions in their own right, but in order to ensure that mistakes are not made the Department consults a judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the Public Trustee, the Governor of the Central Bank, the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, the Chairman of the Irish Banks Standing Committee and the President of the Stock Exchange, Irish Unit.  What the Deputy has suggested would be in order but as an extra safeguard consultations are held with the people mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>(Limerick East)</i>: I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Winter Time Order, 1982.</P>
      <P>The Order complies with an EEC Second Council Directive on summer time arrangements concerning the harmonisation of the summer time period throughout EEC member states.  This Order is a follow up to the Winter Time Order, 1981 (No. 67 of 1981) which the House approved on 10 March 1981.  The principal effect of the Order is that summer time will begin one week later than prescribed under our primary legislation in this area, the Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971 (No. 17 of 1971), and if approved means that we will have the same period of summer time in 1983, 1984 and 1985 as we have had for the past two years, from the last Sunday in March to the fourth Sunday in October, from 27 March 1983 to 23 October 1983; 25 March 1984 to 28 October 1984; 31 March 1985 to 27 October 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission considers that the harmonisation of the summer time period would help the efficiency of transport, <Col N="807" /> communications, commerce and contacts generally between member states.</P>
    <P>Discussions with a view to standardising the summer time provisions in EEC member states have been in train for several years.  There are various problems of course, including the fact that natural time in this country and in the United Kingdom is substantially different from that of the continental member states.  This fact has been accepted in the Second Council Directive which has prescribed that the summer time period in the continental member states should end one month earlier than in Ireland and the United Kingdom, 25 September 1983; 30 September 1984; 29 September 1985. This is a most favourable arrangement from this country's point of view as we have always favoured as long a summer time period as possible and the public, when consulted about the provisions of the Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971, were in favour of having our summer time period synchronised with that of the United Kingdom.  The arrangement also suits the continental member states who have always favoured a shorter summer time period.</P>
    <P>A minor consequence of the order will be that the time of change from winter time to summer time and <i>vice versa</i> will be 1 a.m. in the morning Greenwich Mean Time rather than 2 a.m.</P>
    <P>I now call on the House to approve the Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been agreed that the Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1982, and the Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1982, will be taken together and the Minister's Second Stage speech will cover both Bills.  The Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism will first move the Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Because this Bill, and the Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, both deal with changes in export promotion legislation, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, for the sake of convenience to cover both of them in my speech.  The purpose of the Bills is to enable Córas Tráchtála to promote, assist and develop, in addition to the exportation of goods, the provision of such service activities as may be designated by order made by the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, and to enable also the provision of export credit insurance facilities in support of such service activities.</P>
      <P>Recent years have seen a significant increase in the growth of trade in international service activities and a commensurate increase in their contribution to domestic economies and to overall economic development.  In the United States invisibles currently represent 33 per cent of total trade receipts while in the case of Britain and France they account for over 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>At around £550 to £600 billion in 1979 international transactions in invisibles were equivalent to more than one-third of world merchandise trade.  While this ratio has remained roughly unchanged since the late sixties, the structure of international trade in services has, however, changed considerably under the impact of the emergence of some oil exporting countries as large importers of labour and know-how.  There are, therefore, increasing export earning opportunities for those countries with the requisite skills and commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our own hopes for economic advancement are still firmly rooted in export growth on as wide a base as possible.  It is clear that in the face of growing international opportunities we should, as a key objective, do all that we can to seek an increasing share of markets abroad, not only for merchandise but also for as great a range of our service activities as we can.  Exports of services have a high value added and employment content; <Col N="809" /> their net contribution to the balance of payments is significantly greater than most manufactured products and they often lead to a substantial spin-off in terms of linked exports of manufactured products.</P>
    <P>The Bills now before the House have been prepared to permit the realisation in the most effective form of this key objective.  They are necessary because I have been advised that existing laws governing the operations of Córas Tráchtála and the provision of export credit insurance &mdash; with the exception of some few service activities recognised by amending Acts of 1969 &mdash; relate only to external trade in goods or merchandise.</P>
    <P>In effect, this limitation, which is inherent in our legal provisions, acts as a very real constraint on the achievement of optimum export performance by the many domestic service activities in which we are strong and for which excellent export potential is known to exist.  It also clearly impedes the quickest possible realisation of our twin national priorities of employment creation and an improvement in our balance of payments situation.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the Bills are both significant and urgent.  In many other countries, with whose firms our own must compete, the relevant administrative machinery is invariably geared for the promotion of exports of both goods and services.  We simply cannot afford any more to be left behind in this regard.  Moreover, a thorough assessment of market prospects abroad has confirmed that there is considerable interest, particularly among developing countries, in the wide range of service activities which have been developed here in the course of our progression from a mainly agricultural-based, to an industrialised, mixed economy.  This interest ranges from our structures and systems for public administration, right through the specialised activities of our semi-State sector, to several of our private-sector service activities.</P>
    <P>Greatest opportunities are likely to arise in the Continent of Africa, the Middle Eastern oil based economies and Latin America, where many factors <Col N="810" /> including our lack of a colonial history, promise a significant degree of acceptability for our services skills.  I would foresee that, resulting from the new forms of encouragement and assistance which these Bills will permit, our traderelated invisible receipts will increase substantially over the next two years given the right kind of commitment and support.  There should also be an &mdash; as of now &mdash; unquantifiable, but significant, increase in purchases of goods from Irish firms where Irish consultants are engaged to undertake, or be sub-contractors in, major projects abroad.</P>
    <P>While facilitating these gains, however, it is absolutely essential, in the present economic climate, that scarce resources be utilised only in the case of those service activities which display greatest export potential in the light of the stage of economic development of likely client countries and their known requirements.  Immediate and substantial prospects are perceived for infrastructural construction, health and education facilities, organisational and technical consultancy, and training.  Others may offer promise in the future, however, and indeed some of those I have mentioned may, in time, diminish in significance as export revenue earners.</P>
    <P>Selectivity and flexibility are both required, therefore, to ensure always that our limited resources are best deployed. Accordingly, each Bill proposes that the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism be empowered to designate, by order, the service activities to be assisted for export purposes.  I am sure that the House will agree that, in the circumstances, this is the best format to adopt.</P>
    <P>My Department have given consideration, in consultation with Córas Tráchtála, to the service activities that should be so designated initially.  They will be: agricultural development and processing; construction related services; medical services; training services covering all activities; technical and general consulting services including commercial laboratory services and research and development services; international financial services; computer software and data processing; public administration <Col N="811" /> and media recording and publishing services.  This list also mirrors closely the service activities which qualify for assistance under the IDA's services programme. The House will appreciate the need for such a close symmetry as between the IDA's investment function and the various State supports in the critical area of exports.</P>
    <P>As regards the operational role envisaged for Córas Tráchtála, I would like to assure the House that there will be no overlapping or duplication with the very valuable services already provided to their members by such organisations as DEVCO, HEDCO and the Associations of Architects, Engineers and Accountants. Instead, Córas Tráchtála are being charged with achieving the most effective national projection and marketing of our export potential in the services area. Their experience to date has shown that their structure and systems are eminently suitable for assisting all exporters whether of goods or services.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála expect to work in tandem with all existing sectoral groups to ensure that: (i) the best advice is made available, (ii) the best form of practical assistance is given, (iii) all possible opportunities are identified &mdash; which will be facilitated by CTT's substantial international network &mdash; and (iv) tendering and proposal documents are properly prepared and presented.</P>
    <P>In addition, Córas Tráchtála will also monitor the overall environment, internal and international, for factors likely to inhibit Irish exports of services and to promote the removal of constraints where these are identified.</P>
    <P>To ensure overall consistency, the service activities which will be designated initially by order under the Insurance (Amendment) Bill &mdash; so that export credit insurance support will also be made available as an effective support &mdash; will be identical to those I have already listed for designation under the Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>Administratively, the new insurance arrangements will form part of the schemes operated by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland acting as my <Col N="812" /> agents.  Suitable policies to cover the kind of activities involved are currently being drawn up by my Department in consultation with the Insurance Corporation.</P>
    <P>Generally, I would like to say that the provision of export credit insurance is an increasingly important support to the activities of Córas Tráchtála in obtaining export orders for Irish business.  This is especially the case in such growing markets as the Middle East and Africa where export credit insurance is seen as an essential business safeguard.  As with the present insurance schemes, the principal aim of the new insurance arrangements will be to assist and encourage Irish exporters to develop existing and new markets and to provide protection for them against non-payment by foreign buyers due to a wide range of potential causes of loss.  The arrangements will represent a valuable security for exporters of services, particularly when trading under conditions of intense competition on international markets and in the face of financial insecurity in some areas of the world.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to support these Bills. They will serve to expand significantly the base of our export potential and to equip our exporters of services, deservedly, with the same range and quality of supports and assistance as are currently available to our exporters of goods and merchandise.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis an Teachta Cluskey as é bheith ceaptha mar Aire Trádala, Tráchtála agus Turasóireachta. Seo é an chead seans a bhí agam é sin a dhéanamh go poiblí.</P>
      <P>Tá súil agam, de bharr an taithíforleathan atá aige maidir le cúrsaí sa bhaile agus thar lear agus é bheith in a bhall den Chomphobal Eorpach, go rachaidh sé sin chun tairbhe dá chuid oibre sa Roinn seo.</P>
      <P>I would like first of all to congratulate Deputy Cluskey on his appointment as Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome these Bills on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They are being taken together by agreement.  They are a very <Col N="813" /> necessary extension of the services required to develop our exports.  The whole basis of the two Bills and their whole thrust is to encourage our exports. That has universal acceptance.  I understand that the purpose of the Insurance (Amendment) Bill is to extend the facilities available to service export activities. This type of insurance is regarded as an essential safeguard in the export business.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that extra support is needed for the activities of CTT in obtaining export orders.  Without these essential safeguards, they would not be able to compete as effectively as their competitors.  The Minister said the main thrust of the activities is towards the Middle East, Africa and the Latin American countries.  I understand that this type of insurance arrangement is also made available by other European countries to their export operators.  We should not be negligent about providing our export drive with the same safeguards as our competitors.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned premiums and said he was having arrangements drawn up to have the contacts made available at an early date.  I hope due note will be taken of the fact that, if at all possible, the premiums should cover the claims. The premiums and the whole operations of the insurance scheme should be self-financing, including departmental costs. Sometimes these contracts are drawn up on behalf of Departments and do not include departmental costs.  This might be borne in mind when the financial contracts are being entered into.  All costs should be recouped to the Exchequer and the whole scheme should be self-financing.</P>
    <P>I understand the Treaty of Rome has a significant bearing on this type of insurance development.  Article 93 is specific in that regard.  I presume the Minister and the Department have taken steps to comply with the regulation in the Treaty of Rome.  We do not want to get into international litigation concerning our non-compliance with various provisions under the Treaty.  I am sure that matter has been attended to.  The Minister did <Col N="814" /> not refer to it, and it might be as well to have it cleared up now.</P>
    <P>I believe that when modifications of existing arrangements are being contemplated, the Commission must be notified. I should like to know whether clearance has been obtained from that source with a view to our being allowed to introduce these modifications into our legislation. All aids granted to exporters must be notified to the Commission.  Despite the fact that the Minister said most of the insurance would have a bearing on export activities outside the EEC countries, there might be cases where this insurance might be applied to exports within the EEC countries as well.  Is there a difference? Have we different types of contracts which have to be made available to comply with that regulation?</P>
    <P>I should have liked the Minister to lay more emphasis on developing new markets. I imagine there is great scope in that area.  It would have been pleasing to hear the Minister refer to two other items so far as insurance is concerned.  This has a bearing on the complement of civil service staff.  I would hope the Department could handle this new insurance scheme with their existing staff.  I am sure that will not gain much favour with the existing staff complement, but I hope there will be no need for an extension of the existing staff.  There was some talk about the costings of various schemes in which the State was involved, particularly schemes like this which could be readily quantified.  Detailed costing might have been a useful addition to the Minister's speech.  He can give us further information about that when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Because both Bills are being taken together there is a certain amount of overlapping.  On the second Bill we are mainly concerned with the question of CTT.  We are happy to be at one with the Minister in wishing to help this organisation to promote, assist and develop exports and in particular the export of service activities.  I understand this will be done generally by the order of the Minister.  As we know, it is a further extension of the activities of CTT.  In these critical times exports are fundamental to our national development and <Col N="815" /> to our hopes with regard to creating job opportunities.  We need maximum export performance from all our industries, not only in manufacturing but also the service sector.  It is possible that export revenue will have doubled by 1984.  I should like to have heard the Minister set out the targets for our exporters which, if achieved, would provide a much needed fillip for all our export activities.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, there are existing legal provisions dealing with these matters and previous amendments permit the promotion of exports.  These amendments already exist in so far as design and planning services, architecture, engineering and related disciplines are concerned under section 3 of the amending Act of 1971.  The insurance side is covered under the 1969 Act.  CTT already provide a full range of services and grants to architects, engineers and people engaged in planning and design activities abroad.  These people have gained quite a reputation for their disciplines and have added considerably to the good reputation of Ireland so far as these types of services are concerned.</P>
    <P>We do not hear enough about these services but they are highly valued abroad and it is not often realised that the activities of CTT in this regard and the other groups mentioned by the Minister have been involved in this kind of work for some years now.  We must do everything we can to encourage them.  It is pleasing to see that the Minister may by order designate other activities as well, but I would like to think it would be done in a co-ordinated fashion.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity, because of the considerable reputations achieved by those involved in the export of services in the past under the pretty limited headings of design and planning, to congratulate these people for their efforts in pioneering those exports.  I am pleased to see that the Minister is considering making orders to increase the areas of service activities that can be exported. He mentioned the construction related services, especially in regard to infrastructure. We have a certain expertise there which has been recognised abroad <Col N="816" /> for a long time.  It could very well be an area to which he will give his first concern. He mentioned medical services and to that I would like to add educational services.  We have expertise in that area which could be marketed to our advantage. As well as helping our balance of payments it could bring distinction and a reputation to the country for what we have achieved and what we can make available to others less fortunate than ourselves.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that our training services have been well developed and I think they could be added to the list and the Minister might consider designating at an early date.  In that regard also we have a public administration, while we sometimes berate it, which is highly regarded as being very efficient.  Perhaps this expertise could also be marketed.</P>
    <P>We are well known for our agricultural development and our processing industry and these are other areas that the Minister will be considering when designating areas for export services.</P>
    <P>One of our newer growth areas which has received not a little notice internationally is computer services and data processing.  There must be less developed countries which would need such services and I hope CTT will be requesting the Minister to designate a wide area of functions and experience that is available here under many headings.  There has been an acceleration of growth in trade among all the OECD countries in services activities over a period.  We must have that necessary correlation between the level of economic development and the receipts from, as the Minister called them invisible exports.  The Minister quite rightly says that invisible exports in the United States are about one-third of the total trade receipts and is probably the fastest growing element in the trade account at present.  About 30 per cent of the trade receipts of Britain and France come from this activity but the figure which was not mentioned and which is probably the most important as far as we are concerned, is what are these invisible exports in Irish terms?  I think they would be about 20 per cent, so it can be readily seen that other developed countries have <Col N="817" /> given considerable recognition to this as being a major winner for foreign and invisible exports.  We will have to take steps to get our percentage up to 30 per cent, which is regarded as average.  That would have a significant impact on our balance of payments and the potential for the development of these services should not be confined solely to the State sector. The private sector has been actively involved in this for some time and we should get the necessary correlation between both to maximise the effort as far as our invisible exports are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is a well worn cliché that export growth is the key to our economic advancement but we must recognise that it is most important to achieve that desired end.  This Bill will give effect to an area of activity that will form part of the overall job creation strategy.  While the Bill may appear at first sight as not having the same importance as other Bills, there can be enormous benefits as far as the balance of payments and job creation are concerned.  We must recognise that we have to create the conditions for a broadly based economic recovery and that we have to take the whole spectrum of activity into consideration.  That is where the Minsiter responsible for trade and export will play an enormous part in achieving our targets.  We have to genente employment and this export grown, even in this select field, is going to help enormously to achieve that aim. There is no other way to get unemployment down to an acceptable level.  We must utilise every avenue in the export arena.  There are many markets abroad and, while many of them have been tapped as far as the construction and general consultancy areas are concerned, we will have to broaden the field and purse them with vigour.  In CTT the Minister has an excellent organisation under his control.  I hope he will be seeking with them new measures and strategies and that under this heading he will give them the necessary power to take whatever steps are necessary to maximise the benefits that can accrue from this kind of operation.  He will have our full support this.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned casually our <Col N="818" /> political acceptability, but it is relevant in so far as the potential that can be gained in this area is concerned.  We very often do not give that the prominence and respect which is rightly due to it.  We are a non-colonial power and we are accepted by certain types of people where others are not.  I am not just talking about Britain, I am talking about Continental countries as well.  These are the countries that are willing to pay for these services. Very often they are not at all happy to deal with ex-colonial powers.  Consequently, we have an advantage in the market as far as this is concerned.  It will have to be maximised and I know the Minister will be pressing that this will be utilised as part of a strategy to seek out those countries that see Ireland as more readily acceptable to them because of their historical situation.  If that is there to be used we should use it.</P>
    <P>We must move away from our dependence on our agricultural base.  I am not running down our agricultural industry. Agricultural development and processing can be marketed and we can sell that expertise abroad but we will have to move away from it a little now and put other developments on the same plane. I am glad to see the Minister is including a whole range of areas where he might designate and I would ask him, not to be slow about giving as much prominence to other areas such as consultancy, administration, medicine and education as has been given over the years to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>The public sector will have a large part to play and I expect the Minister to encourage all the Departments and all the State agencies responsible to the various Departments to develop a coherent long-term approach to the matter of exporting our services.  Departments that do not come up to the Minister's expectations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate Deputy Kelly's kindness but when one has survived making political speeches into the teeth of a force eight wind off the Atlantic at election time the children in the gallery do not put one off.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be as stiff as he likes with Departments and State agencies and press them to maximise their efforts.  It is not just for the Minister and CTT to deliver the goods.  He will have to get the whole-hearted co-operation of all Departments and State agencies and they should be obliged to show reason if they cannot come up to the targets he sets for them.  There will certainly be a slow start in some agencies who do not have experience of marketing but they will build up experience over a period. We must develop a good track record and we will only get that by a co-ordinated effort.  The Minister will be doing a great day's work for our reputation abroad if he takes unto himself whatever powers are necessary to see to it that everybody lives up to his expectations in this regard.  If we get into developing countries on the bottom floor with these services now, with a high level of expertise, we can gain a foothold that will make us very difficult to shift in the future.  We will have a continuing run with them and it will expand into a much bigger area of activity.</P>
      <P>I can see no conflict between the activities of State agencies at home and their overseas activities.  However, let us not get into the situation where they become so involved in marketing these services abroad that they neglect their operation at home.  That would not be much use to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial investment in developing these services for export is high.  The Minister will have my whole-hearted support <Col N="820" /> and my party's support in making this investment.  This is something that in the long term will give a good return and it will be to the Minister's credit if he takes the bold step of seeking the money. The benefits are enormous.  It is not just a matter of employment and building up our expertise.  The foreign earnings alone would warrant the Minister taking the steps to meet this initial investment.</P>
    <P>The private sector have been involved in this field for a considerable time and there has been very considerable growth. I understand the private sector in 1981 employed about 338,000 people in this area, which is 30 per cent of the total employment in the economy.  In 1977 the figure was 302,000 people.  We can see how this is developing.  When I said we might double the figures in a few years I was not joking because the potential is there.  We must look to this market and work effectively to achieve our aims.  We should set a high target because it can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The sections showing the largest increase as far as the private sector is concerned in the past few years are banking, insurance and professional services. The Minister should pay attention to those areas.</P>
    <P>When we speak about exports we think of competitiveness.  I believe competitiveness can be achieved by having greater efficiency in all the areas referred to.  A reduction in inflation will provide a very favourable environment for this type of growth.  While not wishing to sound derogratory the recent budget will affect our competitiveness but we have to live with that now.  It can be overcome by greater efficiency and I believe the Minister will be pressing for that.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate Córas Tráchtála on a recent &ldquo;first&rdquo; for them. They won the largest trade promotion contract ever funded by the EEC.  I understand it was for a programme of technical assistance and training in export promotion for the 12 countries in the Caribbean community.  The contract is worth about one million dollars and is effective for two-and-a-half years.  They deserve to be congratulated for this effort.  Not only will it improve the existing <Col N="821" /> international respect for CCT but it will also have a two-way benefit.  It will bring foreign currency to the Exchequer and, perhaps even more important, CTT might utilise this new contract to identify areas for our exporters.  This new contract will be based mainly on the efforts of Caribbean manufacturers.  CTT will identify and win new exports markets for that community and this will involve market research, export incentives, attendance at trade fairs, exhibitions and so on. Here we have our people with the necessary expertise getting this new area of activity from the Minister.  They already have a contract on behalf of the Caribbean countries and will operate in Latin America.  I should not be at all displeased to see us boost that effort so that we would have a presence there, identifying markets not only for the people who are contracting but also identifying areas for export for our manufacturing and service sides.  The Minister should bring this point to the notice of CTT.</P>
    <P>CTT have had many requests during the years from many countries for assistance in developing their national export policies.  They have done an enormous job and deserve to be congratulated. They will have a considerable impact so far as foreign currency is concerned but they will also have a major opportunity to identify markets for our manufacturers at home that they can penetrate.  I would broaden their base of activity and would allow them a certain amount of freedom. When the Minister is designating the areas of activity he intends to allow, then, he should be more than flexible.  He should take a risk.  After all, this is a risk business and the Minister recognises that fact.</P>
    <P>I understand there will be close association between CTT and the IDA.  They also have a new role in service activities and the Minister should ensure that this is maximised.  There will be a considerable investment by the IDA and we should ensure that we get the best out of our industries.  The IDA will invest considerable sums in building up the services. Let CTT go into these markets with our full backing.  The Minister will have the whole-hearted support of this House if a <Col N="822" /> strategy is adopted that will give job opportunities at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>One of the major advantages of this kind of promotion is the beneficial effect it will have on our balance of payments. We will have export growth but there will not be a reciprocal growth in imports so far as these areas of activity are concerned. That is an enormous advantage. The IDA will operate on one side and CTT will have the necessary powers to play their part and there is no reason why we cannot have great advantages so far as our balance of payments are concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that downstream developments for firms operating at home will be enormous.  While it is not now permissible for the Minister to get involved in the promotion of a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, like all good rules and regulations there must be a way around that.  Here we have that way.  Our people who are selling their services abroad will be in a position to send home reports of areas in which new operators could become involved to supply a demand. This is the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign of the future and I am recommending it to the Minister.  It could be part of the brief given to those people to identify such markets and to send home reports.  I do not mind if the reports are sent to the Minister, the IDA or any other agency. The Minister could monitor the whole operation.  The Irish consultants will not just be offering their expertise for the benefit of our economy and that of the New World country concerned but they will also be identifying the requirements necessary and we can set up production lines here to match them.</P>
    <P>One very important point is the matter of quality.  We must be absolutely critical about this.  Unless we have quality control we will be wasting our time.  People talk about competitiveness and consider that the only important factor is the unit cost of production but this is not so.  The quality of the product can have just as great a bearing on our competitiveness. I urge the Minister to be very firm with people who are providing not only the services but also the downstream activities, to ensure that quality will be one of <Col N="823" /> the primary aims.  This will help us to maintain our share in the markets they will gain for us.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he had a certain amount of selectivity so far as concerns the services to be assisted.  I ask him to be more than flexible in this area.  Of course there will be risks but the Minister will find that we will not be critical if there are some failures.  We ask him to take risks because this will be necessary. However, the risks can be minimised if other criteria are laid down.</P>
    <P>I presume the necessary steps have been taken to gear CTT to take on board these new extensions of their responsibilities. They have already expertise in advising and identifying the appropriate opportunities available.  The Minister also stated that advice would be available on the question of presentation and of tendering documents.  I regard that as an essential element in achieving the aims set out in the Bill.  They would also need to be in a position to monitor the factors inhibiting to trade that would become available to them.  They would need to put all that into a package so that when they are gearing up these people they can gear up their own structure to cover the whole range and leave no loopholes in regard to identification, opportunity, presentation, tendering and so on, so that when we go out there we can do so in a professional manner.  We have missed much here over the years through poor management.  We now have a new beginning in this regard and this Bill gives scope to the Minister to apply that beginning and I think he will take the opportunity afforded to him now.</P>
    <P>I welcome both Bills and would stress once again that, as is commonly believed now, if we are to meet the targets required we must do this finally by improving our exports.  This area of activity has all the advantages &mdash; if it is promoted properly &mdash; and so few disadvantages in so far as we are not stuck with imports on the other side.  Therefore this area is of considerable interest.  In welcoming the Bill I wish the Minister every success in promoting it.</P>
    <Col N="824" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The exporting services which these two Bills are designed to facilitate have already commenced and I am happy to say, as the Minister and Deputy Flynn have said, that we have some notable successes already to show in this area.  I should not single out any notabilities, but those which come to the surface of my mind are successes which have been racked up by, for example, Aer Lingus to balance against the unhappy parts of their operation, and successes in the area of provision of hospitals, training foreign administrators and so on.  These activities have been going on for some time and there is enormous scope for extending them.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that some of these opportunities for extension are suggested by the very thing which Deputy Flynn thought this direction of effort would exclude.  He said a few moments ago that one of the great beauties about the export of services was that it did not imply a two-way traffic.  It would have benign effects on the balance of payments because it did not bring anything in to offset against itself; it did not bring an import of services into the country.  Of course it does not bring it, but this country is being penetrated by imported services very rapidly.  Both the Minister in front of me and Deputy Flynn who was in the office previously, know that in fields such as, for example, insurance, the freedom of establishment which the EEC implies and requires has meant the penetration of the Irish insurance market by foreign insurance companies to a degree which is not yet perhaps a serious threat to the existing companies or the native Irish ones but may increaingly become so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was in the Minister's office I had to open, or certainly attend and smile at the opening of, a few of these foreign offices.  I used to say to the audence which consisted naturally very largely of Irish insurance people that I hoped this would not be one-way trafic, and that it was high time an Irish company or a consortium of Irish companies moved into the insurance markets in the countries which our membership of the EEC throws open to us.  I can see absolutely <Col N="825" /> no reason why, for example, an Italian company.  Assicurazioni Generali should now have about 3 to 4 per cent of the motor market here, while we have none of the Italian market.  Why have we not moved in on the Italian motor market?  I am certain that there are good reasons which would make sense to insurance people, reasons of scale, linguistic reasons, reasons of training, tradition and so on, but some of these reasons existed for the Italian company also.  I, and I am sure everybody, would like to see an aggressive spirit spreading from the relatively small number of areas where it exists in Irish manufacturing business right across the rest of Irish manufacturing business and into the Irish services sector, so that they would not regard their horizon as limited by the shores of this small country, but would take the opportunity which our membership of larger communities offers to us to go abroad and sell their services there. That has commenced in other sectors and these Bills are intended to facilitate a very important dimension of that, namely the provision of services such as insurance.</P>
    <P>Before I say any more about these other possibilities which lie open for us I would like to say a couple of words about the structure of these two Bills.  I listened to the Minister explaining that because his esources were limited, as of course they are, he would himself specify from time to time the areas within which designated services would qualify for support. I believe that these Bills were on the stocks when I was in the Department, and if I had a better memory I would probably remember the reason for this. I confess I have forgotten it, or possibly it has come into the draft since I left.  I cannot see why the Minister should think it important to give himself this power. For example, the Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill provides that, in substitution of the provision of the 1959 Act, it is the duty of the board now to promote etc. &ldquo;the exportation of goods and the provision of services as are specified from time to time by order made by the Minister.&rdquo; What is the reason for the Minister giving himself this responsibility?  Surely <Col N="826" /> business is better able than the Minister to see its own opportunities?  Surely if a business, even of a kind in which the Minister has not much faith, identifies an opportunity abroad and comes galloping up to CTT asking for help, the board will still have discretion to decide for themselves whether this form of service is likely to be profitable.  The same goes, with the necessary change of words, in the Insurance (Amendment) Bill.  Here we are talking about such services as are specified from time to time by order made by the Minister.  Section 1(1) (a) of that Bill says:</P>
    <P>....distribution of goods, the provision of services or any other matter which appears to the Minister conducive to that purpose.</P>
    <P>What is the reason for this ministerial interference?  I do not mean that, of course, in a disparaging sense.  A good rule of business, for as long as this is a country which gives business freedom to operate, is to give it its head, let it find its own opportunities.  Certainly, do not throw money after it; do not throw the State's good money after bad at it and do not be extravagant with the people's resources.  However, I cannot quite see the reason for this restriction of the service areas, even though the Minister outlined a fairly generous spread of the activities which he proposed to designate. I suppose that is really a small Committee Stage point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair was thinking along those lines while the Deputy was developing his point.  The points he is making now might be more appropriate on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what is in the Minister's mind.  Maybe he wants to get all stages of these Bills through today.  If I said anything which really worried him or his advisors in regard to the structure of the Bill he might think twice about seeking Committee Stage in a few minutes time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A passing reference is all I intend to make.  I am not sure if the drafting of section 1 (1) (a) in the Insurance (Amendment) Bill will be 100 per cent satisfactory.  What is being specified here is a person &ldquo;carrying on a business or profession in the State&rdquo;.  I can imagine that there might be an Irish concern operating wholly outside the State, but through which, because of reasons of its own, possibly some parent organisation or sister company within the State, the Irish economy would derive benefits from its operation.  I have not had a chance to study this, but I wonder whether that restriction to businesses or professions in the State is not leaving the Minister too little discretion.  Maybe an Irish owned business outside the State would equally meet the objective which he and I want to secure but which the Bill as now drafted would appear to preclude him from achieving.</P>
      <P>The possibilities which the export of services represents are not all covered in the list which the Minister gave, generous though it is.  Banking facilities represent a sector which is highly developed here, and where there is a great deal of longstanding expertise; I imagine this is an area which the Minister would wish to encourage.  He also mentioned training. I hope this will be interpreted flexibly.</P>
      <P>I imagine that because of the traditions and standards which are upheld in this area, this State would be an appropriate source for training personnel in areas other than those which the Minister mentioned, for example, a new police force or security force for an emerging country, or a country which is long established but which has decided to bring its police standards into a more acceptable condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to observe that some of the countries with which we maintain fairly close trading links, or links via our Development Aid programme, unhappily figured in the list published last week by Amnesty as states in which summary executions take place.  These are countries on which we depend for trade, or which depend on us, and in which murders <Col N="828" /> are carried out by the State.  I hope that in such countries, where there are practices of this kind, it might be possible to hope for an improvement of standards. So far as these bear on police work, this is a country which has a reasonably acceptable face.  We have an unarmed force of very high standards.  It has its ups and downs; but, by and large, it has a 60-year old tradition of unarmed honesty and efficiency.  Most certainly when we look at our nearest neighbour across the Irish Sea we have nothing to apologise for in the standards of our police force. This is an area in which, under the wing of the Garda Síochána or some less formal body, we might have a service of a kind not included in the Minister's list.</P>
    <P>The health services were mentioned and rightly so.  These are being provided on an export basis particularly in the Arab world.  But I do not see any reference, unless it is under &ldquo;training&rdquo; to a field which would offer us possibilities, and that is the general field of higher or quasi-higher education.  There are universities and advanced colleges in foreign countries which are not set up or staffed by the local state or its inhabitants.  For example, there is an American university in Beirut.  I will not give any further instances, as I have not got this prepared, but I imagine it is not too bizare to suggest that a developing country night be able to receive an entire university structure from this country with administrative, academic and teaching staff in at least a certain range of faculties.  It would receive an efficient system of third level university education.  The same goes for training colleges.  I do not like the expression &ldquo;finishing schools&rdquo; because that connotes privileged young ladies in Switzerland.  I do not mean that; but even in the developing world there are middle classes anxious to learn things which we can teach them, notably the Englishlanguage. It may be an unhappy development that history has left us with that capacity, rather than the capacity to speak a language which nobody else would wish to learn.  That is the silver lining to the cloud of our cultural submersion. I do not see, unless the Minister <Col N="829" /> is prepared to interpret the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; widely, that his list includes this.</P>
    <P>I am the least qualified Deputy in the House to speak about the field of sport, but the provision of services would give scope to the kind of entrepreneur who might spot an opening in a foreign country &mdash; these by no means consist entirely of people on or below subsistence level &mdash; where there may be opportunities for sporting complexes, riding schools, establishments to breed and train horses, or for all I know greyhounds, although I think interest in this sport does not stretch beyond these shores.  These are proposals which, since they are new, would strike the observer coming across them for the first time as bizarre.  Nonetheless all the Irish marketing successes would have seemed equally bizarre when first suggested. Who could have predicted in the gloon of 1946 that within 20 years one could not buy an item of Waterford Crystal without waiting for three weeks? Who could have predicted it would be the world leader in this field?  Who could have predicted five years ago that some product like a cream liqueur would outwigh in export value all other Irish drink products put together?  If some Deputy had made these suggestions he would have been regarded as rambling.</P>
    <P>There are smaller-scale operations which the developing world will need in one snape or form, and which the developed world does not provide as well as it could.  In other words, it is not only the developing world which should be our target; the developed world also has area in which we can teach it something. In moments of dejection which I frequently have when I look around Ireland I console myself by trying to focu on the things which we do better than anybody else.  Take landscape gardening, or an achievement such as the Dublin Corporation Parks Department has to its credit or OPW who run St. Stephen's Green.  Personally I prefer open spaces to be left clear, which is why I made a fuss last year about the clutter on Leinster Lawn.  But a formal garden gives pleasure to many people.  It is a highly-skilled operation to design and maintain it.  I have been over most of <Col N="830" /> Europe, and know that we do that better than most other people.  No doubt our climate has something to do with it, but then our climate is not very different from that of Holland.  I was in Amsterdam a few years ago.  I hope I do not offend our Dutch friends whom we respect and admire and have a great deal to learn from when I say that I was amazed at the poor standard of the public parks in Amsterdam, the largest city in a country which is world famous for flowers.  The parks appeared to be unkempt by comparison with what I was accustomed to in Dublin.  As it stands, Dublin Corporation is not geared to exploit this area; they have no statutory function in exporting their services, but it is an area where the Minister and his Department ought to see whether they might be nudged to offer their services, to put out feelers to see what kind of a market there is for such a service.</P>
    <P>The same thing goes for theatre management and actor training.  This country, for reasons for which no one here can claim credit, has an acceptable reputation in this area.  I have no doubt, not just in the developing world, not just in countries that are struggling with poor conditions for a lot of their people, but in the developed world that there might be an opportunity for export of services of that kind. I believe Córas Tráchtála already have such a division.  But if they are going to extend in the light of this legislation the activities of this division, they might explore this area too in which there is something, limited though the quantitative opportunities are, in which we do not stand second or third to any other nation.</P>
    <P>There are things of a much simpler everyday kind which are sometimes overlooked in which this country still has high standards and is able to provide things cheaper than they can be done anywhere else in Western Europe.  Let us take a thing like made-to-measure clothing.  I know that the whole textile and garment business has been going through an extremely bad time and that has included the made-to-measure clothing sector as well because of the recession.  Leaving that aside, it is a fact that a made-to-measure <Col N="831" /> man's suit anywhere in continental Europe is a luxury of a most exotic kind.  In order to get a decent, hand cut man's suit in Frankfurt it would cost about £500 if not more.  It is some years ago since I last heard those figures and I probably am out of touch.  I have no doubt that the same is true of made-to-measure women's garments as well.</P>
    <P>This is an area where our standards are good and our prices are still reasonable. We still have a trained work force who are suffering under the impact of recession and at first flush it would seem to me to be an area in which there must be a business opportunity for us.  Again, this is an area in which Ireland has a certain reputation.  The image, as advertising gentry would say, of the country gent, the slightly tweedy image nonetheless, is one which others aspire to.  The higher up you go the tower blocks of Frankfurt or Milan the more eagerly this image is aspired to.  There is money in it.  If we had recognised that image a bit earlier at the time when Scotch whisky took off and tried to do something about Irish whiskey instead, we might have got further than the Scotch did.</P>
    <P>The area of farm management, farm scientists and agriculturalists generally is envisaged in the Minister's list, so I will not spend time on it.  The final area I would like to mention &mdash; again, it is not original &mdash; is hotel management, hotel keeping.  We have a mixed experience in hotel acquisition.  Aer Lingus have had a mixed experience in relation to owning ready made foreign hotels.  I am not talking about buying foreign hotels with foreign staff.  I am talking about offering a package in a developing country which has a certain tourist potential of hotel construction and management.  Again, we are talking about an area where other countries because of their climate and so on have an enormous future potential, which is already being exploited by some of them &mdash; for example, the Seychelles, where the tourist manager is an Irishman who formerly worked in Bord Fáilte.  This is an area in which many developing countries because of their climate have a huge potential and in which again, in our <Col N="832" /> country there is a recession on for a variety of reasons, for some of which Members of this House must bear responsibility.</P>
    <P>Some of those suggestions many make sense and some of them may not make any sense.  I offer them to the Minister and his Department.  I know from experience of his Department that anything said here will be handled with the utmost conscientiousness and skill.  I am glad to have an opportunity also of complimenting the Minister not only on his appointment but on taking over a Department which I thought it a great privilege to be associated with.  I am sure Deputy Flynn would not dissent from that judgment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are talking about here in regard to the provision of services has an employment dimension too.  The Minister actually mentioned this, but it did not surface in Deputy Flynn's speech. It has an employment dimension.  Of course it is a dimension implying employment abroad &mdash; in other words, not to put too fine a point on it, emigration, temporary or longer term.  Deputy Flynn may be amazed to find he has sincerely endorsed two Bills which will facilitate emigration.  I hope he will admit that none of the activities the Minister mentioned, which he mentioned or the ones I have mentioned can be conducted without emigration.  There is not one of these things which can be conducted without the presence on foreign soil of one of our people.  I am sure Deputy Flynn will admit that you cannot run an Irish banking office in Morocco from Snugboro, that you cannot run a sports complex in Singapore from Breabby, that you cannot run a riding establishment in Zambia from Curriadrish.  You have got to be there in person.  That is something which other nationalities have recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These facts underlie the material success in the world which we are talking about.  We are not assessors to God Almighty on the Day of Judgment.  We can leave the spiritual welfare and what we have earned through our spiritual <Col N="833" /> empire to somebody else to judge.  In regard to material welfare the reason why Western Europe is the most prosperous area in many respects on the face of the earth is not merely because of a colonialist, imperialist tradition; it is because of mercantalist tradition; it is because all these are mother countries.  A mother country means that the people go out and work for themselves in the world outside. I admit it has an ugly imperialist, colonialist face and dimension and that the two things went very much hand in hand. Leaving aside the British, if the French, the Germans, who got on late to the colonial scene, the Portuguese and the Duton mean anything in the world it is very argely because of the links they built up with distant countries in centuries past going back to the era of exploration in the 15th and 16th centuries.  The same goes to a lesser degree for later arrivals on the scene like the Italians and the Belgians.</P>
    <P>It is simply not reasonable for us to have this superstition about emigration, as though in some way the Irish were to be stared the necessities which every other people have had to face for the last half nillennium, as though in some way prosperity could be got here by sitting in some God forsaken townland, hoping that our TD could twist the arm of the IDA to throw up a bit of a factory at the end of your boreen.  That is not the kind of thing Seán Lemass had in mind when he was talking about merchant adventurers 20 years ago.  He did not mean that; he meant the kind of thing we are talking about here today.</P>
    <P>I made a speech, of which this was a commonent, in Dublin last Friday.  The kind of employment I had in mind when I mentioned emigration was precisely the kind of thing we are talking about today. I was not talking about exporting kitchen porters, chambermaids, hewers of wood and trawers of water.  I was talking about making sure we were able to provide these services and sell them abroad.  That means making sure that the necessary personnel are there to provide them.  I was taken up by some of the press; not one of whom printed the few hundred words I had to say on this in their entirety, <Col N="834" /> but all of whom felt able to editorialise on them, to pick out the sensitive bits, leaving out very carefully the context, the introductory remarks, the reservations and so forth.  It seemed to them to be likely material for a swift telephone call to the indignation industry.  Consequently, the leading representatives of the indignation industry &mdash; people who are in the business of giving out about other people, or of finding fault with their neighbours for not doing more for them &mdash; were telephoned by some newspaper people, and told that Deputy Kelly had said one of the cures for our difficulties was emigration.  I was instantly accused of &ldquo;preaching a gospel of despair&rdquo;; but that is the sort of gospel that I have been listening to here since 10.40 this morning from people on all sides of the House.  I would never again like to see the kind of situation that we had in the fifties.</P>
    <P>I lived abroad for seven years, three years as a student and four years earning my living.  I travelled back and forth on the mailboat like many other Irish emigrants though, unlike many of them, I was in a well paid job.  I could see the kind of conditions they had to put up with because of not being able to get work at home.  I do not think that any politician would wish to solve his own problems in that way.  All I was advocating on Friday last was exactly what the Minister advocated this morning in his speech, that is, an expansion of services in the exports area which create much employment. Then, those people who go abroad would learn something worthwhile.  A huge number of Irish families, including my own, have had uncles, aunts, parents and other relations who lived abroad for very long periods during their working life but who never complained about or regretted that situation.  I have never regretted the years I spent abroad.  I would be all the poorer for not having learned some of what I learned while I was away.  The same is true of all those other people who go away with the exception of those who are forced into some humble and useless employment by reason of economic necessity.  We never again wish to see people working at such a miserable level. What we are talking about today is something <Col N="835" /> that the State would be very foolish to turn its back on.  The Minister is very wise in promoting this development.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success and I take this opportunity of thanking his Department for the wonderful example they gave me by their dedication.  I am grateful for the experience I had in the Department.  I should like to say the same also of Córas Tráchtála, the agency who will be charged with carrying this policy into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the general direction of this Bill but I am disappointed that it is not concerned with a very important area of the promotion of service industry and that is why I wished to have my questions answered at the outset.  I am referring to the Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1982, or the promotion by Córas Tráchtála of service industry and its location in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has great potential for service industry such as international insurance, re-insurance operations, international banking and financial services, data processing and computer services, technical and consultative services and administrative headquarters of international companies. The Government and the service industry should seize the opportunities that are available now to attract this kind of industry.  The potential in this area should be developed to the greatest extent possible.  The Bill represents a first small step in that regard.  Such development in isolation would not allow us to explore to the full the potential of the service industry or the potential in the export of our service industry unless further <Col N="836" /> legislative changes are introduced as a matter of urgency.  The main change that I consider necessary so far as this Bill is concerned is the extension to the service industry of the export tax concessions that are available to the manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister is prepared to introduce this important development for the service industry, it will never reach its true potential.  There are other areas, too, with which the Government should concern themselves since these are paramount to the proper development of the service industry.  For instance, there is the area of telecommunications and communications generally.  There is also the area of exchange control though there is some improvement in this regard.  Those are two areas that need to be tickled urgently.  We are losing out in relation to the areas of data processing, computer services and international financial markets. This is because our own satellite and data links will not come into speration until 1984.  We are now using British link which is giving us a very poor service.  That is why the Minister must urge the Government to ensure that our own links are brought into service as quickly as possible.  We are losing potential international clients as a result of our failure to keep pace with other countries in this area.</P>
    <P>An area of the service industry which has not been dealt with today but which I consider to be the most important in the context of this industry and the one in which there is the greatest potential for income is the area of international re-insurance, international insurance and international banking and finance. During my submission on the budget I gave a statistic which should put it perspective the importance of international re-insurance.  I said that Ireland could attract 0.1 of 1 per cent of world wide re-insurance premiums and that this would eliminate our balance of payments deficit.  In addition, it would provide prestigious employment and an inflow of overseas funds as well as a reduction in our need for foreign borrowing.  We have made a start in this regard but we must develop further on those lines.  We have <Col N="837" /> an international re-insurance company who were set up in the past three years, assisted by Córas Tráchtála and the IDA. That company employ 75 people.  It is only a beginning but there is great potential for the development of other such companies.  I should like the Minister to tell us if this Bill is intended to bring about more of this kind of development, development which I consider to be the gravy train for growth.</P>
    <P>Another area to be considered is international banking and finance.  If Ireland could attract some of the major international banking institutions we would greatly enhance our reputation among international financiers.  For instance, if we could attract the European headquarters of one of the main Japanese trading companies we could enhance our business and commercial reputation across Europe.  These are the very important areas this Bill should be trying to attack, but I am not sure if these areas are even included.  If not, the Bill is clearly lacking. As Deputy Kelly said we have never gone out to attract that kind of investment.  If the Is of Man, Bermuda or such places, which are famous for this type of service industry, can attract the degree of investment which they have done over the years, then there is no reason why Ireland cannot do the same.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the Minister now has at his disposal a most important development area.  There is a limit to the amount of manufacturing industry we can hope to attract from abroad, but in my view here is no end to the potential to attract service industry because Ireland has become one of the most attractive locations for service industry.</P>
    <P>The necessary resources must be put at the disposal of the different agencies, such is Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, the IDA and so on, involved in the promotion and exportation of service industries. The IDA have a service promotion industry mit employing very hard working highly motivated people who are trying to develop this area.  The Minister must also involve our educational institutions, particularly universities, in training graduates capable of filling the prestigious employment positions which are now <Col N="838" /> available in service industry.  In this respect there is an important role for agencies such as the Irish Management Institute to play.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to bring together all the expertise at our disposal and to begin to examine the worldwide potential for the development of service industry. I ask him to consider a joint committee of this House to oversee the work in which this organisation would be involved.  We must deal with this area as Seán Lemass dealt with the potential for manufacturing industry in the sixties.  I am convinced the same potential exists for the development of service industries in the eighties.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier Ireland's potential for the location and exportation of service industries.  There is evidence that the traditional centres of commerce, such as London, Paris and Brussels are losing their attraction as a base for international commerce, mainly because of exhorbitant costs there.  The development of our telecommunications system, exchange control regulations and education has made Ireland a very attractive location for major international banking, insurance and other service industry.  The difficulties we had to overcome in the past have turned to our advantage mainly because of telecommunications developments throughout the world.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the first step in the right direction.  I urge the Minister to look very carefully at this area of service industry and to go along the lines I mentioned here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the spirit of this Bill which is long overdue and would like to comment on one aspect of our activities.  In spite of the wonderful work done by the Irish Marketing Institute and Coras Tráchtála there seems to be a notable lack of penetration of foreign markets due to what seems to be a lack of awareness of a greater need for more intensive marketing surveys and research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was appalled recently to read in the Newsletter of the Confederation of Irish Industry the remarkable information that there is a huge resource of public supply <Col N="839" /> contracts available within and outside the Common Market to Irish private industry which seems to have gone unnoticed.  I will quote directly from the journal.  It says:</P>
    <P>Since 1978, Irish firms have had direct access to a European Public Supply contract market which exhibits many of the same attractive features as those of local state contracts.  However, the European market for public contracts differs from the Irish market in one important respect: scale.  A recent guide to <i>Public Supply Contracts in Europe,</i> published by the European Commission, estimated that public purchasers in European Community spend approximately £7 Billion sterling annually on supply contracts awarded through competitive bidding. In this context it is worth nothing that Ireland's gross domestic product in 1981 was IR£10.3 Billion.  The balance of evidence indicates that this vast market remains virtually untapped by Irish business.  This contention is based on the fact that notification of public supply contracts, open to competitive bidding are announced daily in the <i>Supplement to the Official Journal of the European Communities:</i> without this source, companies are unlikely to be aware of the many contracts announced each day&mdash;yet total circulation of the Supplement in the Republic of Ireland is currently only 27 copies per issue</P>
    <P>That is a farcical situation.  Only 27 companies are aware of the huge business resource available to them.  It continues:</P>
    <P>Public Supply contracts in the European Community provides information on the range and value of contracts awarded and outlines the various procedures adopted, information sources available and appeals procedures applicable to rejected tenders.</P>
    <P>Public Contracts are subject to Community rules, the object of which are to liberalise the flow of trade within the Community.  The most significant EEC legislation enforced since 1978 is Directive 77/62/EEC, which co-ordinates <Col N="840" /> procedures for the award of public supply contracts.  This supplements a similar directive on public works contracts enforced since 1972.</P>
    <P>The main requirements of the directive, as subsequently amended, are as follows:</P>
    <P>Public contracts must be published in the <i>Official Journal of the EEC</i> where the estimated value is in excess of either (1) IR£100,000 (reviewed annually), if awarded by Central or Federal Authorities, or (1) IR£139,000 if awarded by other authorities.  In addition to the contracts awarded by public purchasers in the European Community, <i>Public Supply Contracts in the European Community</i> notes that contracts valued at approximately IR£20 Billion sterling annually are open to International competitive bidding from those non-Community Countries which are joint signatories with EEC to an agreement on liberalisation of Government purchases.</P>
    <P>A vast market is open to Irish business, in particular to companies in the electronic and engineering fields.  These have made a particularly high contribution to our balance of payments situation in recent times, due to the industrialisation programme.  There is in Irish private industry an apparent ignorance of or reluctance to become involved in these huge readily available markets.  Much of our research and development, and indeed the marketing thrust of many of our Irish subsidiaries, is carried out by the multi-national parent companies, but that is not so in every case.  There have been notable achievements by Howmedica of Limerick who have made asignificant break through into international markets.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for our private enterprises to call on the Government to make these facilities available to them by way of Córas Tráchtála.  Their own institute is critical of them, implicitly, in saying that the information is there through their own resources at remarkably inexpensive rates and that they should use it. I want to bring home the need of Irish industry to have a much higher awareness of the need for market research and penetration. <Col N="841" /> We are an open economy, not gifted with fossil resources, other than natural gas coming from Cork which will help us in the future.  We must rely on our own indigenous resources and the Danes have shown us the way.  They, like ourselves, have no great wealth of fossil resources, have a population of 5 million in a country half the size of Ireland and yet emerge as the tenth wealthiest nation in terms of gross national product.  This is due to their use of their own resources in education and training in market research.  One of the areas in which they have made a huge penetration on a world scale is public supply contracts for engineering.</P>
    <P>I visited Denmark last May on business for Limerick Corporation, to view Danish developments in incineration.  They are making use of an unending resource. Fossil resources such as coal, oil and iron will be subject, at some stage, to the law of diminishing returns.  They resemble a bank in which one has £1 million on deposit but where, if one keeps using up the money, nothing will be left.</P>
    <P>The Danes realised that rubbish or refuses an unending resource.  Wherever there are people, it will be there.  They developed an incineration process, are now the chief suppliers to the United Nations and have secured very valuable contracts throughout Europe and in places as far distant as Seoul, the capital of Korea.  Four years ago they put a system of incineration into their second largest city, Aarhus which is twice the size of Cork and as a result there is now not enough refuse to feed a rat.  They have completely eliminated their refuse problem, have heated the whole city using every form of refuse, to such a degree that, within four years of installation, last year they made 12 million kronor profit, or approximately £2 million in our currency. This is an example of an area into which we might penetrate.  As a trade union official, I have been very much involved in the mid-west region with the subsidiaries of multi-national companies. I was delighted to learn recently, not having been previously aware of it, that the quality of our engineering graduates is amongest the highest in the world. <Col N="842" /> Multi-national companies who employed our engineering graduates &mdash; people like Analog Devices.  Westinghouse and some of the major multinationals &mdash; were absolutely thrilled with the quality of graduate emerging.  This is where our future lies. Everything depends upon our market penetration.  If we do not maximise the use of our resources, we are like someone living on a mountain top who does not know what is happening in the valley.</P>
    <P>Wonderful work is being done in places like the NIHE on the whole question of graduate training in marketing through the IMI and Córas Tráchtála.  However, that is not enough.  The companies must get into the scene.  There is a saying that you get nothing for nothing in Borrisokane, but you get it in no other place, either.  Nobody owes us a living.  If we do not take these opportunities we will be in serious trouble.  There is a seanfhocal which says: Is cuma nó muc fear gan seift.  This is true of us as a nation as it is of an individual.  Another seanfhocal says: Muna mbíonn ach gabhar agat, bí i lár an anonaigh leis.</P>
    <P>I urge Irish companies to wake themselves up and get into a scene in which we have the capacity of being amongst the foremost.  Ours is the best educated population ever in our history and there is no reason why we should not use that education in the only real way possible for us, getting into the world market place and using our present under-utilised advantages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I unreservedly welcome this Bill.  There will be no difficulty on either side of the House in accepting it, even though I detect a lack of appreciation of its potential among some of the Deputies here.  What we are dealing with here is a different market from that about which some speakers before me have spoken. We are not talking about the old form of trading amongst merchants, of trying to keep up with camel trains.  This is the 1980s when the concentration on world markets is in the area of high technology. In America at present 60 per cent of the working population is employed in the communications and high technology fields.  This is the area about which we <Col N="843" /> are speaking.  Conditions referred to earlier do not really apply any more in the international market place.  I agree with Deputy Prendergast that we are ready to undertake this assault on world markets. We may be a little behind but I am delighted that this recent budget &mdash; as the Chief Executive of the Smurfit Group said at the CII Conference last week &mdash; constitutes a start.  We have now got our house in order.  Coming so soon after the budget the Minister is making a tremendous contribution to Irish business and employment by the introduction of these two Bills which I do not think will experience any difficulty in their passage. It is appropriate that there should be before the House the Insurance (Amendment) Bill because many businesses endeavouring to export their goods and services on the world market are experiencing great difficulty obtaining credit, endeavouring to be paid and indeed to obtain bonding.  Irish companies are going to London to get bonding.  They are being subjected to tremendous strain having to pay out huge sums of money before doing any business in order to get the banks to insure them.  I hope this Bill will help our companies in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not under-estimate world markets, particularly Middle Eastern and African ones which I know have great potential for this country.  I would not under-estimate the difficulty in our companies gaining business there.  It must be remembered that the whole world wants to deal with the oil countries, that the whole world is trying to deal with Saudi Arabia which seems to be favourably disposed to Ireland at present.  Because of the recent fluctuation in oil prices Saudi Arabia's expenditure in relation to all of its projects has dropped 25 per cent. Coupled with that fact there has been a large growth in contractors and businesses on the market.  Nevertheless what we need to bring to those markets are service, quality and price.  However, price is not always a factor.  Our labour is now too expensive for a lot of those markets and much of the labour in those markets is taken from the Philippines. However, there is a lot of goodwill shown <Col N="844" /> Irish businessmen in the Middle East. There are many reasons for this but one is the trading experience of some of our pioneers who went out in recent decades. Another is the friendliness shown us by these countries and also the genuinely high standard of our engineers, technicians and so on and the service we give.</P>
    <P>We receive a great deal of support from Córas Tráchtála.  I wonder how thoroughly do Córas Tráchtála explain themselves to the Irish businessman, to the Irish market, to the Irish company.  They have always seemed to me to be there for the large company or for the exporter. There are two areas in which I think Irish businesses and businessmen can benefit through the services both of Córas Tráchtála and the IDA who always seem to be acting abroad on behalf of the businessman at home.  They carry out the work abroad on his behalf.  Very often the Irish businessman does not get a chance of going out to see for himself what things are like on the ground and, very often, he is placed at the mercy of the performance both of Córas Tráchtála and the IDA.  Some Members of the House may not have had experience of this.  But it is very unsatisfactory to have somebody dealing on behalf of one halfway round the world, hoping that one's case is being put forward properly.</P>
    <P>I think of an example of a company dealing with another in Calfornia through the IDA.  There had been very little happening over a period of six to nine months and, on the Irish businessman investigating, he was informed by the IDA that the American company with which he was dealing was a very small one, that the IDA had not really pushed because they were not recommending that company.  When the Irish company concerned contacted the business with which they were dealing they discovered that the IDA had been contacting them by telephone from Chicago. If a businessman goes out from here he will make sure to establish personal contact and know exactly for himself what is the position on the ground.</P>
    <P>Communications in that respect could be improved.  Perhaps the Minister would consider examining the amount of <Col N="845" /> expenditure of both Córas Tráchtála and the IDA on travel and expenses.  Of course it is necessary to have offices sited around the world.  It is necessary also to have travelling executives.  But that opportunity should be passed on to members of companies here who will then gain experience from travelling abroad and from dealing with their foreign counterpart on the ground.  After all it must be remembered that they are the people who are investing their money, who know best their own products and how best to sell them.  Perhaps more help should be given them in this respect, especially the emergent or small businessman.  We know now that in the high technology areas one does not need to have a very large company to get off the ground. Very often these people do not have the resources available to them to make trips abroad.  This is an area worth investigating.</P>
    <P>I was glad the Minister highlighted the areas he proposed investigating initially. We have a lot to offer in the field of high technology.  There is now a certain &ldquo;payback&rdquo; filtering through to us from the years we spent investing money, giving grants to foreign companies to set up business in Ireland, when all we got initially was the employment content.  Now that investment is beginning to pay off. The Bills are being introduced at the right time.  We have now highly educated technical people ready to take advantage of all the opportunities obtaining.  What should now come into play is the ability and experience of the Irish man who hereofore had been working for everybody else in the world, for foreign companies, and who has had a long and unfortunate tradition of emigration, who is known practically in every country in the world.  Now he has the expertise to back that up and, when he goes into the market place, he does so with a distinct advantage. He is at home in most board rooms in the world and has the ability to communicate well with foreign executives and socialise with them.  Because he has great ability to laugh and to enjoy himself that effectively spreads itself to business people abroad, and he is a better salesman in many cases.</P>

      <Col N="846" /> There are many ingredients involved in this exchange of technology.  Deputy Kelly said he would like to see a faculty or indeed an entire university set up abroad.  We have the ability and the capacity to do that.  Our universities have expanded.  In recent years, as well as the universities, we have had extensions of third level education so that in addition to the academic side people have become very concerned with commercial markets &mdash; everything is geared towards getting into business.  As an example, we have the NIHE in Limerick and in Dublin and we have Shannon Development which has developed innovation centres throughout the country.  That development is helping to explore markets, to do market research, to find outlets for graduates who wish to go into different fields of activity.  It is helping to find businesses for those people wishing to invest.</P>
    <P>In Third World countries in the Middle East and Africa there is enormous potential and I agree with the Minister's selection of those areas.  In the Middle East, in Saudi Arabia and in Africa, there are universities very willing to organise joint ventures with Irish companies or Irish universities in the setting-up of institutions. Take for example the university of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia which wishes to set up a solar energy department for which we would be quite capable of supplying the expertise and the design information.  We would be capable of exchanging the technology with that country in that effort.  We could bring their people here to teach them English and to train their lecturers.  There is great advantage in tying up with these institutions and universities on a consultancy basis.</P>
    <P>In Algeria, a petro-chemical industry was set up by a US university and out of that a relationship developed on consultancy, through which they continue to exchange technology and information with that country.</P>
    <P>We could do that in the same way in the Middle East and in Africa.  In the field of semi-conductor and solar energy we have developed great expertise. Recently I had the pleasure of going to University College Cork to see Professor <Col N="847" /> Eriksson's institute which should be coming into production in March.  One project involves a farm which has been run by solar energy.</P>
    <P>In that matter, there is great opportunity in the Middle East for semi-conductor technology, even in the oil countries like Saudi Arabia where they can have microwave stations to supply all the power to mountain villages and towns. The same applies to Africa where they can use the sun, and therefore microwave stations can be set up throughout that Continent at very little running cost.  We can supply that kind of expertise, and are actually tendering to do it.  Companies are operating from different parts of the country, and great credit is due to them. I hope help will be given to them through these Bills.  A company in Sligo employ 80 engineers who operate entirely from there.  They have spent the last decade doing innumerable projects in Libya and Iraq.  Other companies here have a few hundred engineers who have spent a lot of their time working in different countries in Africa.  Therefore, these Bills are very appropriate.  We will be in a better position to take advantage of those markets, even in the field of construction.</P>
    <P>For instance, the McInerney company have been building in Saudi Arabia for a number of years.  That country use that company because of the high standard of their work, because of the service they give and the keenness of their prices. Once a company become established, those countries continue to use them, but they do not continue to use companies which try to rip them off and take advantage of their lack of knowledge of the market place, as happened in the early years after the oil boom in 1973.  That is one of the reasons why Ireland is considered favourably by those countries.</P>
    <P>Recently I conducted some Middle East people around the country and one of the places we visited was the Dairy Science Institute at UCC.  That institute was built about two or three years ago at a cost of £5 million or £6 million.  One of the foremost experts in this field in the world, an American, said on this tour that it is the finest dairying institute in the <Col N="848" /> world.  That technology is there in the heart of dairying country, and why should we not be able to export that industry, that technology, to emerging countries? I know such a possibility is being considered in regard to one of the Middle East countries.  We have had some small successes with An Bord Bainne in Saudi Arabia.  We have had successes in farm programmes with Masstock.  We are in a great position to take advantage of such markets.</P>
    <P>I would stress again that the man in the small emerging business, which will be the backbone of the country if it is not that already, needs help and I am afraid the IDA and Córas Tráchtála are not geared towards him and he is not being given a look-in.  He needs help because sometimes he cannot afford to take advantage of exploring world markets. An example was given by the Chief Executive of Smurfits at the CII conference last week.  He wished to get a certain product supplied to his company and they went to the US and met the parent company and came back to set up a small company in Templemore which employs 25 people.  Smurfit do not need that, they would have been glad if somebody else had done it, but the small businessman would not have the wherewithal to do that.  Therefore, more help should be given, and better access, to Irish businessmen, and Córas Tráchtála and the IDA should promote services to such businesses.</P>
    <P>In the field of telecommunications and micro-electronics we are very well poised to take advantage of what is available.  I referred to the innovation centres set up by Shannon Development through the IDA. They provide facilities for small businesses. They provide such facilities at reduced costs.  They help to find markets for such business.  They encourage them in every way and as soon as they get on their feet they make place for other emerging businesses.  I should like to see those innovation centres greatly expanded because they give employment everywhere they are set up.  They give opportunity to graduates and people who want to start their own business.  The <Col N="849" /> executives of the IDA and CTT have gained a tremendous amount of experience from travelling abroad and they are in a unique position to help anyone starting a business.  These small businesses, if encouraged, can employ many people, would enable us to become a self-sufficient race and would eat very largely into the unemployment problem without any real extra cost to ourselves.</P>
    <P>Our embassies provide great help to our businessmen and I found this to be the case particularly in Greece and Saudi Arabi.  I was really impressed and humbled by the amount of work the embassies and the consulates are doing.  Many ordinary businessmen do not realise that a huge market is available if they knew how to find it.  This is an area about which I feel very strongly, having spent ten years looking for help in this area and not getting very much of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about invisible earnings and at the recent CII conference it was stated that our invisible earnings are worth seven times more than our export.  We should bring in these Bills as a matter or urgency so that we can take further advantage of the market situation and of the spin-off from technology. Ireland is very well placed in the high technology field and it has known expertise in construction, engineering and engineering design which is in demand in emerging countries and from which huge amounts of money may be derived.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly said that we could not operate successfully from Ireland in markets such as Singapore and Zimbabwe but in my opinion Ireland is uniquely situated to tackle the world market. Shannon Free Airport is the ideal base for dealing with the USA, South America, Europe, the Middle East and the Far East it is very easy to communicate with these areas from Shannon and there is great potential there for the expansion of business and industry.  Some companies are doing so at present.</P>
    <P>CTT could help by planning itineraries for businessmen travelling abroad and paying some of their expenses.  I know they are doing this to an extent and money spent in this way would certainly <Col N="850" /> yield returns.  Nobody can sell a product better than the person who produces it.</P>
    <P>I know of a recent instance where a company submitted a project to the National Board for Science and Technology and they presented the project to the EEC on behalf of the company.  It was the only project in its area in all of Europe to be put before the EEC, and the NBST were of the opinion that they would secure the research and development contract.  However, it was rejected.  The man who developed this project found it extraordinary that he was not allowed to make the presentation and could not even be present.  He had spent 20 years working on it and he is an acclaimed expert.  When I raised the matter with the NBST they told me that this is the way the system works.  The day before the presentation the man who developed the project rang to advise the presenter that he did not have enough information submitted with his proposal, to which the presenter retorted that he had submitted a 40-page booklet describing everything. The NBST went unprepared to the EEC and he did not get the contract.</P>
    <P>We take a lot for granted in the IDA, CTT and the NBST.  I understand the IDA have recently carried out an internal examination but these bodies should be examined by outsiders who can look at them objectively, ask what they are doing, see how they are spending their money and examine their approach. These undertakings cost an enormous amount of money and they enjoy facilities which are far superior to those in this House.  We work in rabbit hutches by comparison.  They have luxurious offices and can discuss their affairs in board rooms.  It is correct that they should have these facilities.  People coming into this House are certainly not impressed by the appalling office conditions.  I wish we could have similar standards to those in semi-State bodies.  I should, however, like to see a report on their effectiveness and efficiency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates mentioned this matter during his speech last week and he said that the IDA have grown so big that they have their own public relations department. The IDA can do a good public <Col N="851" /> relations job in selling itself to the Irish people and explain that it is doing a good job.  In effect the IDA is saying that they are doing a great job.  It is like me standing in the Chamber to announce that I am doing a great job.  Somebody else should be saying that.</P>
    <P>These Bills will reverse an old trend of Elizabethan days.  In those years one shipload of produce from the Far and Middle East was enough to keep the economy going for about ten years.  Inflation did not exist then and labour was cheap.  It may be a good thing that the Industrial Revolution passed us by because in Britain with their enormous population they have great difficulty in trying to turn their economy around whenever it goes into recession.  Yesterday I pointed out that we have a flexible economy, a small population and lots of ability.  We have, as has been stated repeatedly, the youngest population in Europe, and some respected politicians have been describing that as our biggest asset in the last ten years.  However, we sat back and did not make any provision for the emergence of that young population and left them almost in a state of hopelessness.  We did not plan for the emergence of those people with the result that they do not have much opportunity even though they may have third level qualifications.  I do not wish to give the impression that everybody should go to a third level institution but we have a duty to provide an opportunity for our youth.  Members who have teenage children or who have any dealings with children about to leave school will realise that because of their lack of experience of talking to adults or of the outside world they take what they are told to their hearts.  It has been easy to ignore them for years and that is still happening.  We did not make any plans for them although we knew about them.</P>
    <P>We described our young population as our biggest asset but having made that statement we ignored them completely. We now have an opportunity of reversing that, of using that asset, of involving and employing such people in jobs throughout the country.  That can be done <Col N="852" /> through innovation centres in different counties.  I applaud Members who continue to point out that everything happens in Dublin.  In 1983 there is no need to concentrate on Dublin.  I have pointed out how ideal it is to run an international operation from Limerick or surrounding counties and I have given an example of an export company that employs 80 engineers in Sligo.  There is no need for people to have to leave the towns and counties they love to go to Dublin seeking employment.  It is possible to look after Dublin while at the same time catering for counties like Donegal.  We have a small population and a big market.  Our young people are well poised in the areas of high technology and telecommunications. We are now manufacturing computers and Middle East countries are anxious to get technicians, engineers and fitters for ship-building yards.  In fact, they are asking for everything we have available.</P>
    <P>We have an international airline and fully equipped airports.  Ireland could be regarded as an ideal centre to tackle markets in America, Europe and the Far East.  We have not exploited the seas around us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>One word is not much of a transgression.  We did not exploit the seas around us but we are now in position to do that.  With respect, we must go over the seas to export.  I have no mentioned countries like China because it is inaccessible for many business concerns but CTT, the IDA and the Government should make an effort to make it accessible before Americans, German and others take over the markets there.  We seem to arrive late in most cases.  It is <Col N="853" /> more effective if the principals travel to sell their own products.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the structure of international trade in services has changed considerably under the impact of the emergence of some oil exporting countries as large importers of labour and know-how and I agree with that statement. There are greater export earning opportunities for those countries if they acquire the skills.  We need to be prepared to take advantage of that situation. We must produce the quality goods and be competitive.  We must function without protection or behind the cloak of tariff barriers except where there is unfair competition.  The clothing industry is suffering from unfair competition because produce is being imported.  In dealing with that problem the industry must also pay high labour costs.  Unless that industry is helped it will not be able to export. There are, I agree, hopes for economic advancement in export growth.  This is vitally necessary if we are to increase growth above the 2.7 per cent required of us before 1987.  We must take advantage of the markets that are there and so it is definite advance to move as adumbrated in this Bill from the field of goods and merchandise.  There was restriction in the past but now we are going into services.  That is an advance I applaud.</P>
      <P>Hitherto there were restrictions and legal restraints on our export performance. These naturally affected our export earnings.  From that point of view I welcome this advance.  The Minister stated that immediate and substantial prospects are perceived for infrastructural construction, health and education facilities, organisational and technical consultancy, and training.  In addition, I believe there should be a high priority study, the recommendations of which should be published. I am glad he has decided that he can designate by order.  That would certainly be the quickest way of doing things because it will save him coming back to the House.  The Minister can make decisions taking into consideration market trends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not inclined to agree with the Minister when he says that the experience of Córas Tráchtála to date has shown that <Col N="854" /> its structure and systems are eminently suitable for assisting all exporters whether of goods or services.  I would recommend that before launching into this area Córas Tráchtála should be re-examined objectively to see if it is capable and freely available to people.  I am not sure that it is.  For instance, in the area of tendering there does seem to be room for improvement.  Small businesses do not have the resources, the facilities or the personnel to prepare documents and very often documentation is the key to winning projects.  If the documentation is not properly prepared the tenderer is in trouble.  This is an area in which Córas Tráchtála could be of great assistance. There are plenty of experts and the help of these experts would be very valuable if made available to small businesses.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that Córas Tráchtála will monitor the overall environment, internal and international, for factors likely to inhibit Irish exports of services and to promote the removal of constraints where these are identified. The intention in that general statement is excellent.  If businesses are caught out &mdash; this is something that happens when people are exporting &mdash; the body will be there to help them.  Remember, this is a high risk area.  This is probably one of the chief reasons for the introduction of this Bill.  I know businesses which risked practically everything trying to break into these markets.  Some lost everything. Very often they had to invest capital out of proportion to the possible return in order to try to win the contract.  The laws in some countries are not as reliable perhaps as the laws here and in European countries generally.  From that point of view this Bill is very opportune.  It will induce a new confidence in exporters because it will show that the Government and the country in general are behind them.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Browne</b> asked the Minister for Education why VEC scholarships to regional colleges for pupils with less than two honours in the leaving certificate examination were withdrawn while at the same time the pupil-teacher ratio was increased thereby making it more difficult for schools to offer realistic honours options.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the implication in the question from the Deputies that the appropriate standard to be specified for the award of scholarships to students to be admitted to certain third level educational institutions is affected by the <Col N="860" /> adjustments being made in regard to the staffing of second level schools.</P>
      <P>I may also add, for the purpose of avoiding any misunderstanding in relation to the matter, that the relevant circular letter dealing with the conditions for the award of the scholarships to which I have referred will not be issued prior to consultation with representatives of the educational interests concerned.  The conditions to be prescribed are accordingly not yet finalised.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister's reply represents what I would consider a climb down on the original budget announcement.  Do I take it from the Minister's reply that the earlier statement of the two honours requirement for a pupil to receive a VEC scholarship to enter an RTC has been revised? Is the Minister aware that at present, for instance, in my home area, which has an RTC in the locality, over 50 per cent of the students who went to it last year on VEC scholarships did not have the two honours requirement?  Is the Minister aware that this step will lead to a new elitism in third level education as all the other cutbacks have led to the same in other areas of education?</P>

      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, a hatter of detail in relation to her particular area, I am afraid that is a separate question. I would like to say, in answer to the first part of the question, that I can only presume that the Deputy agrees that a process of consultation should always be entered into, as has been done by me since coming into office on every single area of education.  I must stress to her that I feel it is in the best interests of the students and the educational interests concerned that such consultations should be held at every possible opportunity before debates are conducted in the House.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to have a look at the particular difficulties that have been caused in the change of qualifications for scholarships to the regional colleges?  As we know <Col N="861" /> honour certificate courses are two-year courses and many of those children doing their leaving certificate this year have to change to honours stream mid-way and are not perhaps at a fair advantage. Would the Minister consider looking at the particular difficulties that have been caused in view of this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the <Col N="862" /> Deputy that the Department are certainly not dragging their feet in this area and consultations are in process all the time.  In July 1982 County Roscommon Vocational Education Committee proposed to the Department that the vocational school and St. Joseph's secondary school in Castlerea, which is under lay management, should be amalgamated.  In June 1982 the Mercy Convent intimated to the Department that they intended enrolling boys in the future.  The ASTI have been asked for their views in the matter and to date they have not furnished their views.  I would like to stress that it would be in the interest of the town in general that these interests should all be consulted and should be in agreement before any final decisions can be made.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that on the advice of a previous Minister a common subject consultation is taking place between St. Joseph's school and the vocational school prior to the amalgamation taking place?  Would that receive her support as Minister now?  I believe this amalgamation should take place at the earliest possible opportunity because without the amalgamation taking place the schools cannot proceed with their curriculum.</P>

Representations have been received that a departure from the normal conditions in relation to academic requirements and the basis of the means test should be allowed in the case of mature students.  In the present financial circumstances it is not feasible to give favourable consideration to such representations. The adult education commission report which was commissioned by Deputy John Boland when he was Minister for Education will be coming before me shortly and I look forward to their recommendations in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision of the previous Government to introduce a charge in respect of school transport as from January 1983 was confirmed by the present Government subject to the modification that exemption from the charge would be given in the case of eligible <Col N="864" /> senior cycle pupils whose parents or legal guardians are the holders of medical cards.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it the Minister's Government who first made the decision that medical cards would be used as a means of assessing eligibility?  Does the Minister accept that the medical card is issued on the basis of guidelines relating to peoples' need for medical care rather than for their assessment for the use of a school bus?  Is she aware that there are many people whose incomes are just above the guidelines and as a result of having to pay £3 per week, as some of them will have to pay, those people will now be inside the guidelines and will find themselves penalised by £2 per week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government were the Government who introduced the medical card exemption and we are satisfied that this arrangement is the most suitable that could be made under the present circumstances.

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the introduction of charges in school transport causes difficulties for some families just as families in city areas find difficult in meeting payment for bus fares which are at that level also.

      <P>I am amazed to hear such questions coming from that side of the House because, as I reminded Deputies, it was the Fianna Fáil Minister for Education who, on 18 November, made the statement that charges would be imposed.  The only difference is that now concessions have been granted to certain categories in order to reduce the hardship such charges might cause.  I would be concerned if I thought the charges, altered as they are, would in any way hinder or prohibit children from attending school.

      <P>Would the Minister agree that, while one can use the medical card as a criterion, that does not always guarantee that those children are more necessitous than others?  Would he agree that there are certain circumstances in which a family may have a medical card, but that does not guarantee greater poverty than in a house where a medical card does not exist?  Medical cards are granted on medical grounds and not always on grounds of poverty.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I was talking about Córas Tráchtála and how they could be more effective in their operations if they allowed and encouraged the principals of businesses to travel abroad when they need to look for business. I asked if Córas Tráchtála might be able to assist them in the compilation of itineraries and the organising of travel arrangements.  Those involved in business should be enabled to pursue the best methods of exploiting situations that might arise.  So many personnel are involved in Córas Tráchtála and the IDA, and their organisations are so big, that they do not appreciate fully what is needed on the ground.  I suggest Córas Tráchtála could help to meet the costs involved.  Often businessmen are unable to travel abroad because of the high cost of travel.  Therefore they cannot go to America, the Far East, and the Middle East to talk about projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Bills are timely.  Heretofore restraint has been placed on the expansion of Irish exports because consideration has been confined to goods and merchandise. I referred to this yesterday in my budget speech.  I spoke about the ingenuity, the hard work and the ability that are around, but I said we had not opened our doors to receive the benefits. Consequently, other countries have had a head start on us, but we could quickly overtake them.  I am glad the Minister appreciates that we should not be left behind.  Other countries are well geared for the promotion of exports of goods and services.  For example, in the UK there are very favourable conditions.  If businesses want to supply goods to other countries the Government make arrangements to pay the suppliers of the goods <Col N="923" /> immediately on delivery and the Government will wait for payment by the companies supplied.  It might not be a bad thing for the Revenue to look at this because businesses even supplying within the country are constantly collecting taxes for the Government as well as carrying the burden, particularly during recession, of having to wait for their money.  It imposes great hardships on them and it is grossly unfair.</P>
    <P>I have said that we are well supplied with ability; we are well geared to take advantage of and to exploit foreign markets. There is no better situated country than Ireland to do that.  Shannon being on the international flight routes, we can easily go from here to the US, South America, the Middle East, the Far East. We could reduce our very high unemployment in the coming years through the introduction of these Bills.  Irish business people are at home in boardrooms throughout the world.  They are at home in executive selling and they have the charm which enables most Irish people to laugh and to enjoy themselves. Because of their natural hospitality they are able to win over customers.  Our long periods of emigration have helped to establish Ireland throughout the world. Although emigration has been very painful to us, it is well that the red carpet has been rolled out in countries throughout the world for us and it is up to us to take advantage of it.  We are now in a position to benefit, though we were not able to benefit in the last century when the Industrial Revolution passed us by.  Because of our small population, because of the trauma, the pain and agony the country has gone through, it is geared technically, it is very well placed among high technology businesses, it has well-educated engineers and technicians and we are in a position to offer to other countries an exchange of technology which we were not able to do in the past.  We are now able to turn the tables on the large multinationals who set up here in the last two decades almost as acts of charity and exploited our work force.  We knew, of course, that our only return would be employment.  However, we knew we <Col N="924" /> would learn and be enabled to train a highly-skilled work force.  We now have that work force.</P>
    <P>The Government and the semi-State bodies have been working very effectively and successfully in exploiting world markets.  However, it is time for a reappraisal of the role of CTT, the IDA and the NBST.  We must examine the structure and staffing of these organisations. They seem to be closed bodies.  We do not know what they are doing but we read the reports and we accept their advertising and their public relations work.  An outside body should be asked to carry out this examination because I know that savings could be effected and they could become more effective in the future.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies are not up-to-date with modern conditions and spoke in their contribution as if we were still in the age of camel trains and merchants in the Middle East and shiploads of merchandise as in the Elizabethan days.  We are talking about the advance of technology and how quickly we are prepared to exploit it.  The world has been reduced by telecommunications and the development of high technology and the market has come to our doorstep.  It is not a disadvantage to be small; it is an advantage.  It is also an advantage to be placed on the western edge of Europe.  People have come here from America so that they can be within reach of the EEC while they are also able to exploit the markets of North and South America and of the Middle East.  The Loctite Company have moved their entire research and development operation from America to this country and many others have done the same.  There is a quiet revolution in the high technology telecommunications and micro-electronics industries which has been exploited very well by the IDA and the educational institutions, away from the old academic mould.  The climate is perfect, especially in the Middle East and Africa, for Irish firms.  There is a huge market in the Middle East for semi-conductors, even in the oil countries where solar energy is developing. They are looking for micro-wave stations for their villages so that they will not have to haul oil to remote areas.  I <Col N="925" /> have already mentioned the development in this field at Fota Island.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of these fairly revolutionary Bills.  I congratulate the Minister and encourage him.  With little or no expenditure the Bills will give an enormous boost to employment and they are not coming into operation a moment too soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of these Bills.  It is very important that the relevant administrative machinery is geared for the promotion of goods and services and we simply cannot afford to be left behind in this regard.  I fully accept the Minister's statement that it is vitally important for job creation and job maintenance that all administrative facilities be made available to exporters, whether in goods or in services.</P>
      <P>I should like to praise the work of CTT. Their staff at home and abroad have done magnificent work on behalf of the Irish people and Government.  I had the honour and privilege of serving as Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, as it was then known, and I was very much involved with CTT.  I say without fear of contradiction that our finest State agency, barring none, is CTT, although there are others who are not bad at self-promotion. CTT have been operating on a relative shoestring with regard to resources and they have been superbly successful in their work.  They have worked not only with the major international companies which have based themselves here but also with our own indigenous industries whom they have encouraged to look beyond our shores.  They took our industrialists by the hand, first of all to the UK, then into the European market and the Far East.  We owe a deep debt of gratitude to the management and staff of CTT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has recognised the importance of the service industries. In the future we in the European Community must recognise that the Southern Hemisphere will concentrate on the basic processing and manufacturing industries, such as leather, which we took for granted as being our own.  In future our <Col N="926" /> country will have a greater involvement in services such as computer services, insurance, re-insurance, banking and the supply of technical expertise to the developing countries, such as the ESB and An Foras Forbartha are already providing. We must look more and more towards service industries as the vehicle for job creation and I congratulate the Minister on the timely introduction of these two Bills.  At a time when unemployment figures are heading towards 200,000 it is important that we should concentrate our minds on all avenues of job creation and the service industries represent a very important area.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned research and development.  We have had magnificent successes in attracting foreign investment to Ireland during the past ten or 15 years, particularly American and Japanese investment.  Too often the industries we attracted were assembly line operations and we were not successful in our efforts to attract the research, development and marketing aspects of foreign companies.  There is tremendous potential in the marketing aspects of industry.  If foreign companies base their marketing headquarters here in conjunction with assembly lines many new jobs would be created.</P>
    <P>In dealing with services it is important that the House should recognise that tourism needs all the encouragement it can get.  While we must plan to market abroad we must bear in mind that it is important to market at home also through the Irish Goods Council and in regard to tourism.  There is great potential in the tourist industry for job creation. For too long jobs in that sector were looked upon by certain sectors as being less than attractive or meaningful occupations. The Minister, who has a responsibility for tourism, should devote his energies to that industry.</P>
    <P>As Europeans we must recognise that our jobs in the future will be in marketing, research and development.  The low technology industries will in future be based in the Southern Hemisphere and, if we recognise that, we will see that there is a great potential for job creation.  Our young people are educated to a high <Col N="927" /> standard and we have a tradition of highly-skilled operatives, but now we must look further afield.  We must try to make Ireland a centre for the insurance business, international banking, marketing, research and development.  In welcoming the Bills I should like to congratulate the Minister on bringing them before the House.  They were prepared by my colleague, Deputy Flynn, before he left office and I am glad the Minister has followed up his work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Flynn, and other Members, for the good wishes they expressed to me in the course of their contributions. I should like to extend my congratulations to Deputy Flynn on his appointment to the Front Bench and I hope we can work together for the good of the country, although we are on opposite sides of the House.  I am sure it is his intention also.  I should like to thank those who contributed constructively to the debate. Deputy Flynn's contribution was very constructive.  He recognised the advantage and necessity for the two Bills to enable us to participate more comprehensively in the exporting market.  CTT have run a successful operation up to now and the two measures before the House will give them greater scope by permitting them to export assistance and expertise. Firms engaged in the export market will also be given the necessary insurance cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter that has been raised on many occasions during the course of the debate was the question of marketing. The importance of that cannot be over-emphasised. Unless Irish firms who wish to engage in export markets realise the importance of proper marketing expertise it will not be possible to make much progress.  CTT provide the expertise, but it is essential also for Irish firms to develop their own expertise in marketing. While firms engaged in the export business may get by without proper marketing expertise in their own firms in good times, when a recession hits, such as at present, they will not succeed.  The <Col N="928" /> necessity for marketing expertise must be recognised.</P>
    <P>The legislation before the House will bring us into line with many other countries which have these facilities available for exporters.  We are confident that our export performance in the next year or so will benefit greatly.</P>
    <P>I should like to give some indication of how successful CTT have been.  Deputy Burke paid a glowing tribute to CTT and statistics justify that.  The value of our exports from January to December 1982 was £5,690.6 million, an increase of £915.5 million or 19.2 per cent on exports over the same period in 1981; and from that one can see how successful CTT and Irish firms, semi-State and private, have been in this highly competitive market. I should like to refer briefly to the figures announced yesterday by the Central Statistics Office last there is an impression that all is gloom and doom.</P>
    <P>Naturally, one must be concerned at any drop in our exports and an increase in our imports, but it is important for the morale of exporters and people in general, particularly when talking about the manufacturing field which provides four out of five jobs, that things should be kept in perspective.  In January there was a 20 per cent increase over the corresponding month in 1982 and the target set by Córas Tráchtála for the current year is a 17 per cent increase.  When projecting that increase a number of factors were taken into consideration &mdash; the recession, the fiercely competitive nature of the export business and the change in sterling. That latter was a development that had to be taken into consideration. Although we have shifted the emphasis the fact remains that our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, is still our biggest customer where exports are concerned. It is important I should mention these factors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn queries our obligations and the effect these Bills will have on those obligations <i>vis-à-vis</i> our membership of the EEC.  We have had informal discussions with the Commission.  We will have formal discussions with them after the Bills are passed.  We do not anticipate <Col N="929" /> any difficulty but it is right that I should raise this particular issue.  Mention was made of the insurance scheme and whether or not this scheme will be self-financing. It will be self-financing.  That includes the administration of the scheme but it does not include the cost of departmental work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly questioned the operations of Córas Tráchtála.  He raised one or two specific issues.  He questioned whether or not firms had free access to CTT and how all-embracing the activities of Córas Tráchtála were.  He also mentioned the cost incurred by Irish business people travelling abroad in the hope of securing contracts for exports and now, of course, services.  My information is in over 2,000 exporting companies more than 1,800 received some assistance from CTT.  Córas Tráchtála do in fact provide grants to assist foreign business travel and they also provide monetary assistance for advertising abroad and the promotion abroad of Irish businesses interests.  That is, I think, a reasonable repudiation of any suggestion that CTT are not operating in a comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>While it is fair to say there is a clear recognition of the beneficial operation of Córas Tráchtála it would be wrong &mdash; indeed it would be stupid &mdash; for us to become complacent because this is such a vital area nationally.  Our economic recovery will depend very, very largely on our success in the export field and so we cannot become complacent about the operations of CTT.  One of the first things I did on taking office was to arrange with Córas Tráchtála that a small &mdash; I emphasise small &mdash; top level group would be set up comprised of top officials from CTT and top officials from my Department. The purpose of that group would be to review the whole strategy of our export business and pinpoint geographically produce areas in which there was potential, as well as setting realistic targets in such areas.  Secondly, as far as produce was concerned, the group should monitor year by year the produce area instead of just looking at the CTT operation in global terms.  That would enable the group to identify the best potential and set realistic targets for the particular <Col N="930" /> areas, subsequently monitoring the success or failure of the exercise.  There is no danger of our becoming complacent in regard to the work of CTT.  In fairness to CTT I should say that this suggestion was accepted by them without hesitation and it had their full cooperation and participation. That speaks well for them. Indeed, it gave me an insight into why the body had been so successful in the past.  They were prepared to allow their targets to be monitored.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn spoke about the extent of their operations in service areas and the possibility of risk.  He also said he would like to see flexibility in the areas designated since I will have the right to designate under the Bill.  I understand that approach and I have considerable sympathy with it.  However, it is only fair to say that after discussion between my Department and CTT the areas which will be designated initially are fairly comprehensive but they are areas where it is expected there will be a high return in a fairly short period of time.  CTT like everyone else is suffering from recession. The money given to CTT is taxpayers' money and there has to be due regard to value and return.  While I will be as flexible as possible and while I do have sympathy with the approach advocated by Deputy Flynn, I must also take that aspect into consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly queried the necessity for having this restriction in the Bill at all.  It is a normal provision in a Bill.  I am sure Deputy Kelly, as a Minister, promoted Bills that had the same provision.  It is not an innovation or restriction in the normal sense of the word.  It is a safeguard to ensure that both taxpayers' money and the very valuable expertise of CTT are utilised to the best possible advantage for the Irish people and the Irish economy.  If one were to put in a long list of services which had very little export potential one would be retarding the progress that could be made by this breakthrough.  I can assure the House that I will, in consultation with CTT and other interested bodies, be reviewing and updating the list frequently.  Not only will I be adding to it but I will also possibly be taking areas which are now being <Col N="931" /> included out of it because they have shown themselves not to be successful or because their potential has diminished over a period of time.  There will be a constant review of the services that are covered under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The activities of the IDA and CTT have been raised.  We have looked at this carefully to ensure that there will be no overlapping or duplication of work by the two bodies.  We are satisfied that that will not happen and that where they come into the same field they will be complementary to each other and not in competition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly raised the question of training.  He spoke about universities and the training of police forces in other countries. Training is included in very general terms to give us greater flexibility should any particular project be presented that has good potential.  The words I used when introducing the Bill were: &ldquo;training services covering all activities.&rdquo; That is an all-embracing approach to training, so I do not think Deputy Kelly need worry on that score.</P>
    <P>I have always admired Deputy Kelly as a very colourful speaker with a wonderful turn of phrase.  He has amused and entertained me in the House many times.  But he seemed to get somewhat confused this morning in relating this Bill to a speech he made outside the House last week with regard to emigration.  While I say a colourful speaker with a wonderful turn of phrase that does not necessarily always reflect accuracy and there is no relationship between this Bill and the subject matter of Deputy Kelly's speech last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not mind coverage but I would be very reluctant to have it confused with the purpose, the objective and the undoubted effect of these Bills.  People who will be serving abroad under contract as a result of this approach will be doing so on behalf of Irish-based firms.  They will be doing so <Col N="932" /> for a limited period of time under contract, but their roots, their opportunities, their promotion and their progress in their particular profession or occupation will not be outside this country except for a very limited period.  It would be just as unrealistic to say that the people working abroad on behalf of the State for Córas Tráchtála, or indeed people who work in our embassies for three and four years, would fall into that category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be, but it is important that the advance that has been acknowledged by all sides of the House in this Bill, the beneficial effects of it on exporting and on the national economy, should not be confused by a contribution that could unintentionally do that.</P>
      <P>The other matters raised were of a general nature and referred to the work of Córas Tráchtála and the IDA.  The IDA do not come under my Department, so I will not make any comment in that regard.  If we are to make economic recovery it is essential that we be successful in the export climate.  Every reasonable assistance that can be given to our exporters should be provided.  I believe those two measures will have an extremely beneficial effect on the export trade.  It is embracing an area where there is very considerable potential which has been identified.  The initial services that should be covered have been identified and, hopefully, it will now get the support and the aggressiveness by Irish firms engaged in this market that is necessary to make it successful.  It is a highly competitive market and is even more so now because of the recession the world is going through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures I read out comparing 1981 with 1982 prove that Irish firms need not feel any sense of inferiority in this market. They have shown they can do it and these provisions will, undoubtedly, make it easier for them to do it.  Apart from designating a number of service areas the other Bill, the insurance credit, is also essential because our greatest potential <Col N="933" /> would appear to be in the Middle East, the Continent of Africa and Latin America. There are some of those areas where dealing is a relatively risky business. Unless companies have these facilities, particularly as far as credit insurance is concerned, it makes it difficult, if not impossible, for them to engage in these markets.</P>
    <P>These facilities are now being provided. There has been a clear recognition here today that there is, not only a willingness, but an anxiety, to facilitate the export trade by the Opposition as well as by the Government.  This is not political, it is recognised for what it is, essential for the national good.  I believe, with the passage of those two Bills, that we can all reasonably expect a significant increase in our exports over the next few years. That is my hope and my expectation. However, everything cannot be laid on the Government or on a Government agency.</P>
    <P>I would like to come back to the question of marketing.  I refer again to the highly competitive nature of the operation but other countries and other firms are geared for that market.  They have recognised the supreme importance of proper marketing expertise and techniques. As I said, Córas Tráchtála have that expertise.  They are able to give very considerable assistance to Irish firms, either seeking orders for export or those who are actually engaged in the export of goods and now services, but at the end of the day, the main responsibility will have to lie on the individual Irish firms and companies who are engaged in this particular business.  The figures prove that they have the capability to do that.  They can reply on the continuing support of Córas Tráchtála.  That is extended now by the measures proposed in these Bills. At the end of the day it is the recognition that their performance and their expertise, particularly in marketing, will be essential to the success or failure of the particular venture they are engaged in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn mentioned one other thing this morning, which is extremely important, that there should be a coordination of the activities of Government Departments, State and semi-State <Col N="934" /> bodies, to ensure that they are aware of their responsibilities as far as export markets are concerned, that anything they can do on their own or in conjunction with another Department or Departments, State or semi-State bodies should be done.  I would like to assure the House and Deputy Flynn that I have been conscious of the necessity for such an approach and that steps will be taken to ensure that that approach is made.  While the work we have been engaged in in export has been successful it has by no means reached its full potential.</P>
    <P>I feel Córas Tráchtála will get undoubted courage to continue and reinforce the task they are engaged in by the contributions that were made today on both sides of the House.  An unstinting tribute was paid to the work they are engaged in.  While that is justified, I said earlier in regard to the establishment of this top level group to monitor, that I was sure there was no feeling of complacency, but it is also proper that I should say that if there were any indications of complacency, the attitude of the House, particularly the other side of the House, would change quite dramatically.  I do not believe there is any danger of that development. I believe there is a clear recognition by them of their responsibilities.  I believe they are heartened by the success they have had in the past and that they will be further encouraged in their efforts by the passage of these Bills.  I would again like to thank the Opposition and Deputy Flynn for his very constructive approach to this Bill.  I would like to thank the other Members of the House for the way in which they have approached this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate coming very shortly after the debate on private Members' Business on the same topic only last week provides the opportunity to set out clearly and unambiguously the history of the introduction of charges for school transport for second level pupils.  No amount of special pleading or righteousness expressed by the Opposition can alter the chronicled facts of the situation.  On 18 November 1982, the previous Government published their Estimates for the Public Services, 1983, and held press conferences to announce the main details of these Estimates.  The main thrust of these Estimates was a recognition that there was a definite limit to the available financial resources for the public services in 1983 and that the amount of the provision which could be made for these services had accordingly to be restricted.  It follows as day follows night, that the provision for a service cannot be restricted without the imposition of restrictions on the service itself.  In connection with these Estimates the then Minister for Education issued a statement, on the same day, 18 November 1982, which dealt with the restrictions which would have to come about in education as a result of these decisions on the Estimates for the Public Services.  I quote as follows from his statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be no charge introduced for pupils of national schools eligible <Col N="936" /> for free transport in accordance with the school transport regulations.  The cost of the scheme for Primary and Post-Primary Schools has, however, been growing to such an extent that measures need to be taken in regard to it.  Since no alteration is contemplated on the range of the service, the measures required to control cost must involve the introduction of a charge in the case of second level pupils.  Consideration is being given to the question of the arrangements to be made for the implementation of such charge.  It is contemplated that such arrangements would take the form of the issue of a season ticket, that there would be a lower rate for junior pupils and that a concession would be made to take account of the circumstances of larger families.</P>
    <P>There can be no denying this statement. It is there on the record and for the record.  For the Opposition to take the position, that when in government they did not contemplate and decide on the introduction of school bus charges, is hardly in accordance with the record.  To adopt such a position would be tantamount also to treating their published Book of Estimates for the Public Services, 1983, as a work of fiction.  In these Estimates the provision for the operation of school transport in 1983 was £28.2 million, as against an estimated operational cost of £33.6 million.</P>
    <P>What then could Fianna Fáil, in Government, be thinking of if it was not to make up the shortfall as between the estimate provided and the estimated operational cost, from the charges on second level pupils which they announced on 18 November?  If this were not done there would be very little alternative other than that of restricting the service, or perhaps cutting it off altogether at the latter end of the year, or maybe, just maybe, they would have had recourse yet again to further supplementary estimates funded by yet further foreign borrowing to postpone even further the day when the nation would have to come to terms with paying its bills.  Or maybe they now feel they are adequately <Col N="937" /> fulfilling their function by shedding public crocodile tears about the imposition of school bus charges.  Constructive opposition indeed.  The single most significant fact that emerges from all the debate and discussion on school bus charges, is that nowhere has there been a suggestion that the service be restricted, or discontinued, or not be made available to a single eligible pupil.  There has been no clearer endorsement of the Government's policy, on assuming office, that the school transport service should be continued and that an effort be made to cope with the increasing cost of the service by the introduction of charges for second level pupils as a means of offsetting a proportion of the cost.</P>
    <P>Let us look then at the steps taken by the Government in this regard and the way in which they differed from the proposals put forward by the previous administration.  The provision in the November Estimates was accepted and a charge was introduced for a term ticket for second-level pupils only with a lower charge for junior than for senior pupils. A maximum contribution per family was fixed to take account of the circumstances of large families.  So far, so good.  The Opposition cannot take exception to these arrangements as they followed exactly the pattern contemplated by the then Minister for Education, Deputy Brady, in his public statement of 18 November.</P>
    <P>What then are they taking exception to?  Is it the level of the charge?  It will have to be acknowledged that at a little more than £1 per week for junior cycle pupils and £2 per week for senior cycle pupils it represents good value.  But apart altogether from that consideration, the level of the charge follows automatically from the number of pupils using the service and the amount of the deficit to be made good in its operation.  This could not have been significantly different had there been no change of Government.</P>
    <P>The provision in subhead D.3 of Vote 28 in the published volume of the Estimates for the Public Services for 1983 is £28.55 million of which £28.2 million is for the operation of the school transport <Col N="938" /> service in 1983 and the remainder is a capital provision.  This represents a very considerable charge among those items of expenditure in the Education group of Votes classified as non-pay.  It is appropriate to compare this charge with the outlay for the support and maintenance of schools other than for the payment of teachers' salaries.  For comparison, the provision for the grant in lieu of tuition fees payable to secondary schools is £18,347,000 and capitation grants to primary schools £10,400,000.  The hard fact emerges that in any attempt to contain expenditure on educational services, the growth and scale of the school transport charge made it inevitable that it would come under scrutiny and this it did in the Estimates of the 18 November.</P>
    <P>The present Government accepted the estimate of 18 November but modified the proposals by waiving the school transport charge in respect of senior cycle pupils whose parents or guardians were holders of medical cards.  This was done out of consideration for the less well-off parents who make considerable sacrifices to keep their older children at school during a stage when it is expensive to meet their needs and who forego the income these young people might have earned had they taken a job.  Surely the Opposition cannot be objecting to this concession.</P>
    <P>The majority of the parents of the country are well aware of the difficult economic situation which obtains at present and have demonstrated in this situation their anxiety to maintain the school transport service by making the necessary contributions in respect of their children. The representations received by me and by the Government as well as the response to the school transport charges has indicated very clearly that this is the case.  What has also emerged from these representations, however, is a growing concern for the small minority of parents for whom meeting the charge of junior cycle level would constitute particular hardship and for whose children the use of the school bus service is essential in order to enable them to make a satisfactory attendance at school.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> This concern is felt by the Government no less than by the Opposition and it was for that very reason that the Government have now decided to bring forward a measure which would discreetly identify such cases of real hardship and exempt the parents concerned from the payment of the school bus charge in respect of their children attending the junior cycle of second level schools.  I would find it impossible to believe that the Opposition are now objecting to such a measure when no later than last week, several of their number in Private Members' Business, including Deputy O'Rourke, who has since been appointed as their spokesman on Education &mdash; and I want to offer her my warmest congratulations on this well-deserved appointment &mdash; were clamouring for just that.</P>
    <P>What remains except an allegation of confusion?  Perhaps it is a confusion which exists only among members of an Opposition who do not profess to know about provisions made in the Estimates which they themselves framed, which attempts to disown public statements made by their Minister for Education when in office.  There is no confusion among the parents of Ireland on the issue.  School bus charges remain and parents who have not paid the charge are urged to do so if they wish the school transport service to be continued.</P>
    <P>Parents of pupils in the senior cycle attending their appropriate centre who have medical cards do not have to pay the charge in respect of such pupils.  Parents of pupils in the junior cycle attending their appropriate centre for whom the payment of the charge would constitute a particular hardship and where the school bus service is essential to the satisfactory attendance of their children at school will be given exemption from the charge under the provisions announced by me yesterday, the details of which will be made known following consultation with the schools authorities and the transport liaison officers.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed at the crocodile tears being shed by the Opposition on this matter.  I can only attribute this <Col N="940" /> extraordinary carry-on as the technique of the big lie and the loud shout.  It comes strangely from a party who brought this country to the point it is at today who belatedly turned around in the latter half of last year and tried to convince the country they had finally learned their lesson.</P>
    <P>Over four years, from 1977 to 1981, Fianna Fáil played fast and loose with Ireland's financial dependence.  Every soft option was taken, every difficult decision was run away from, business confidence was shattered, wages and salaries were allowed to spiral without check and the arrival of the present Leader of the Opposition to the office of Taoiseach was the signal for a further massive slide into irresponsibility.  Presumably the motivation for such irresponsibility was a desire for power at any price but the price was being paid by and being lumped firmly onto the people throughout the country, and in particular on the young people whose future was put in jeopardy by the massive foreign debt which the Leader of the Opposition and his erstwhile Cabinet colleagues piled up.  It is extraordinary to see the Fianna Fáil Front Bench washing their hands of a decision which had to be made when reality finally struck them.</P>
    <P>In this discussion about school transport charges I would like to appeal to the Opposition to behave responsibly, to acknowledge the fact that the country has arrived at a situation where financial contributions must be expected from the people who can afford them, to acknowledge freely the fact that they designed the 1983 Book of Estimates and that they were quite relieved in an election campaign when the then Opposition parties agreed that these Estimates would be accepted.  It is amazing to find the Opposition decrying school transport charges and I look forward with interest to hearing the details of how the £5.5 million for school transport was to be found.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to the Minister for Education.  I am very glad the request put forward by the leader of the Opposition and myself <Col N="941" /> this morning to have this matter debated has been granted because it was very necessary to clear up the confusion which exists throughout the country about school transport charges and the seeming change of heart by the Minister.  I want to put it on record that we asked for this debate.  I am very grateful for the time being given to us and for the Minister's statement, but I must admit that I am appalled that I was treated to a party political broadcast on behalf of a particular party.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister and I expect to receive the same treatment from the Government parties. We were treated to a recital of what happened in the past.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hussey is the present Minister for Education.  Yes, Fianna Fáil suggested introducing school transport charges, but there would have been consultation before they were brought in.  In my capacity as a rural Deputy I would have had a considerable input into the formulation of those charges.  Therefore I find it extraordinary to see the present Minister washing her hands in public and blaming past administrations for the present position.  She and her Government are the legitimate rulers of this country and it is their proposals for school transport charges we are discussing.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to two statements issued by the Minister for Education, the first made on 23 December in which she announced the implementation in the foreseeable future of these charges and the second was made on the radio yesterday, 22 February, and we subsequently received a statement of what appeared to be a change of heart and a climb down. If it is such, I welcome it but it appears to be an unsteady stumble rather than a clear climbing down.</P>
      <P>We, the Opposition, are today seeking clarification of those statements.  Having listened to the Minister I, as the spokesperson on Education, am not happy with the proposals for modifications she outlined, and how they will be agreed and implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> The Minister has referred to a Private Members' Motion and to crocodile tears. I was one of the three Fianna Fáil Deputies who on this day last week put down a Private Members' Motion that no child in Ireland would be denied access to education because of the school transport charge.  There is a very clear, salient point here.  Up to the passing of the School Attendance Act, 1972, children were compulsorily obliged to attend school from the age of six to 14 years, although common usage, particularly in rural areas, is to have the school entrance age at four.  Subsequent to that Act, every boy and girl, by the law of this land, must go to school until 15 years of age.  The anomaly which I have pointed out on previous occasions is, how can you say to a child, &ldquo;You must go to school&rdquo; and yet a limited number of children cannot do so, because of the financial circumstances of their parents?  No exhortations, lectures or sermons will change that fact that every boy and girl must go to school until 15 years of age.  I am repeating myself, but the Minister will bear with me because she repeated much of what she said last week.</P>
    <P>One leaves primary school at the age of 12, or sometimes 13.  One then proceeds to a vocational or secondary school.  However, many children will not be able to do this because of the school charges.  I repeat that there is something wrong with this provision of the Department of Education and the Minister must look at it.  There is a clear anomaly in the law as the matter now stands and confusion reigns.  I suggest that the Minister, the Labour and Fine Gael Deputies should note that the three daily newspapers and &ldquo;the paper&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Cork Examiner</i>, have all subscribed to the idea that Irish parents today do not know what is going on in regard to school transport. There are parents facing particular hardship. The Minister and her Minister of State had previously said that they knew of no child who could not go to school and I am glad that in the space of one week they have come to face the hard fact that there are young children who cannot go to school because of the prohibitive transport charges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> I hope that the Minister, in reply, will clarify the position regarding the points I have made, which need very strong and unequivocal clarification.  The Minister in her statement says:</P>
    <P>The Government have given consideration to the question of a modification of the decision for the imposition of a charge in respect of school transport in so far as it concerns junior cycle pupils attending their appropriate centre whose parents would face particular hardship in meeting the charges, and where the use of such transport was essential to enable the pupils to make satisfactory school attendance.</P>
    <P>Who will be the judge and jury in these cases?  The Minister continues:</P>
    <P>It has been decided to consult with representatives of the school management authorities and the transport liaison officers with a view to seeking their cooperation in the implementation of arrangements for exemption from the charge in such cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Her final paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>The parents of all other pupils... ......</P>
    <P>But who is to decide who is to be one kind of pupil and who is to be another? We are all acquainted with education, which is a very emotive, lively, everyday subject.  One does not have to be a parent to be interested in it.  Parents with young children are very directly involved, but an older brother or sister, an aunt or uncle would also be interested.  We are all caught up in education in some way. If affects every home in Ireland every five days of the week.  Who is to decide that Mary Ann is a special child and Tommy Joe is not?  From my fairly considerable knowledge of school management authorities and of school liaison officers, it is not correct to put upon them the onus of deciding the category of the pupil.</P>
    <P>We know that it is in the raw nature of young and growing persons to be hard <Col N="944" /> and cruel to one another and I can envisage the scene on the buses when the finger is pointed at a child and he or she is told by the others: &ldquo;You are the special child&rdquo; or &ldquo;You are not a special child&rdquo;, as the case may be.  In all sincerity, and certainly without crocodile tears, I do not want to appear immodest but in this line of education and transport charges, while I do not know everything, I know this problem.  I am a Deputy from a town with a strong rural hinterland, have taught for many years in a school with a large catchment of rural pupils and know the nature of the girls and boys, fathers and mothers of whom I speak.</P>
    <P>The modification announced by the Minister, which I welcome and for which we pressed for last week on separate occasions and this week, will not work. How can the Minister or her Department officials work out who is needy and who is not?  The school transport charges were hastily introduced and are hastily going to be implemented, but could the Minister not remove herself from her subject, think about it and consult with people?</P>
    <P>At Question Time today, Deputies from all sides of the House brought up various questions on education and I credit the Minister with replying that she would be consulting.  In one case in which I had a particular interest she used that phrase and I was very glad to see again that word coming back into educational matters, one which should be used more often, in fact constantly, that of consultation.</P>

      <P>Education is a lively, real subject.  It is not academic, not connected with the alphabet, or with addition and subtraction but with very real people, mostly with young people.  One cannot tell one young child he or she can get on a bus and another that he or she cannot.  Last week, following on our educational debate Professor Raftery, the educational expert, speaking at a seminar said that perhaps one of the reasons for the backwardness of Irish agriculture today is that 80 per cent of farmers today in Ireland have no secondary <Col N="945" /> school education.  He said he hoped that in the changing climate of today that position would change.  I hope so too. Loss of free transport will affect urban children, but more particularly, rural children.</P>
      <P>Are we to go back to an era of life in Ireland when there will be discrimination against the urban, rural bias?  Are we to go back to an era in Ireland when there will be discrimination against children? Does any one of the Deputies sitting on the opposite benches, or indeed on the Labour benches, wish to go to a meeting and face people who will say to them: &ldquo;My child is taken on the bus free,&rdquo; while another will say: &ldquo;My child is not taken on the bus free&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Regardless of the past, I submit, as spokesperson for education on this side of the House &mdash; and I know there are many Deputies on the other side of the House who agree with me on this &mdash; that we were very glad when free education came in in Ireland.  It has produced a crop, a generation of young, bright, lively people entitled to and getting education. I would plead that we do not go back on that now.  The saving of £5 million would ill-serve the future.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for her very kind wishes to me extended across the floor of the House today, as I wished her well last week in her new portfolio. There is no rancour or ill-feeling for the present incumbent of the office in what I say.  There is only a broad, educational wish to say to the Minister that I feel the educational charges are confused, are causing confusion in the country today, that they will lead to further confusion and discrimination against young people. I would say to the Minister: leave the school transport charges for this year, sit back, consult with her officials, with the interested parties, with parents, with the various bodies involved and come up with an equitable answer.  I intend, for however short or long a period I will be sitting on these benches &mdash; and I hope it might be short &mdash; to be constructive about education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The debate so far has been about whether one or the other is responsible for the cuts when in fact the debate should be about whether or not the cuts are correct in view of the need for the best possible education for the youth of this country.  The approach of the present Government is no less or no more scandalous in this regard than that of the former administration.  The Minister has pointed out already that the cuts proposed were part and parcel of Fianna Fáil policy before their defeat at the last general election.</P>
      <P>The point that needs to be debated is whether or not this House wants to provide equality of opportunity for all of the children of this State.  If that is what we want to do &mdash; and I understand that to be the declared policy of all the parties in this House &mdash; then clearly any attempt to introduce school bus charges, or charges in any form of educational service already provided free, is totally at variance with that declared aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that Fine Gael in a pre-election statement said <Col N="947" /> that when in government, they would review the school transport system, that they recognised the need to make savings in this area.  This review would take place at local level so that anomalies could be removed and the system made more cost-effective.  Some changes, they said, may be necessary.  How have the Government shown that the moves they are making at present are cost-effective?  To what extent will the changes they are effecting now result in greater red tape, in greater administrative costs, in means tests and so on?  There is absolutely no sense to the chopping and changing in which the Minister has engaged since taking up office.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, part of the present administration, said in their pre-election manifesto that, in general, the scheme should be free.  They said also, in the event of insufficient resources, some subsidy might be necessary from the better-off sections of the community.  What precisely they meant by that is difficult to say.  Obviously they were keeping their options open in case the opportunity of Coalition presented itself.  But it can be contended that a subsidy of any kind must come from taxation.  The principle must be adhered to, if we accept that education should be free and that the opportunity of education should be made available to all, then the payment for education should be made through general taxation. To attempt to introduce charges at that or any other level, to attempt to cut-back on various services already provided in schools, in order to save money or balance the books, is totally at variance with any commitment to equality of opportunity in education.</P>
    <P>The present Government came into office in December last.  On 23 December last, the eve of the Christmas holiday, the Minister announced her cuts.  Presumably she announced them then in order to avoid having to face the public on the issue, presumably hoping that the row over the cuts would have died down before the Christmas holiday was over.</P>
    <P>The announcement made last evening was made outside this House also.  I find it strange that Government policy statements <Col N="948" /> increasingly seem to be made outside the Dáil.  It is difficult to find a policy statement that was not first made outside the Dáil before being practically dragged out of the Government in the House.  In future, the Minister should attempt to present her policies and policy changes to the House before going to the media.</P>
    <P>This is not a practice confined to the present Minister for Education.  Other Department policy changes have been announced outside the Dáil.  They have not been made here and therefore we have not been able to have debates on them.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that education, as a matter of right, should be available free at the point of delivery and that the costs should be met from taxation.  The Minister today said that parents accept that the country is in a difficult economic situation. It is true, but parents want to know why is it that they are paying for the services in their taxation while they are being asked time after time to pay not only for school bus services but hardly a week passes when the schools to which the children go send home requests for money for this, that and the other &mdash; heating for the schools, equipment for the schools, maintenance of the schools. Parents are being asked practically every week for assistance to maintain the educational system, despite the fact that parents are paying through the nose by way of PAYE, for the educational system.  At the same time, Deputy Skelly's friends, the self-employed, the small companies and the farmers, owe £450 million in back taxes which the Revenue Commissioners have not been able to collect.  The Minister is trying to save on the school transport service at a time when sectors of the community which are not in the PAYE scheme owe between £7 million and £8 million in social insurance contributions which have not been collected by the agencies of the State.  It is therefore difficult to convince parents that the Government are serious when they talk about the country being in a difficult financial position, when this money is left in the pockets of people who simply refuse to pay their just share of the running costs of the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> It is clear from the budget and from statements The Workers' Party have been making in the House in the past year that there is nothing to choose between the present administration &mdash; it is clear from the Budget taxation and the cuts that have been made that it is a Fine Gael dominated Coalition &mdash; and Fianna Fáil, now in Opposition.  Many times we have made the point that there is no difference between the two major conservative parties. Every time the Minister for Education introduced her cuts since she took up that portfolio she has proved the point.  She has continually stated that the Fine Gael dominated Government have accepted Fianna Fáil Estimates, that by and large they have accepted Fianna Fáil decisions made when they were in Government.  Apart from minor adjustments here and there, we have not heard of any major policy changes by the Fine Gael dominated Coalition since they took office.</P>
    <P>The decision, now possibly forestalled, to put inspectors on the buses warning children they will not any longer be allowed to travel if they cannot produce evidence that their parents had paid, is possibly one of the most harsh and insensitive moves which the present administration have made.  The VAT on shoes and clothing perhaps was an indication of what a Fine Gael dominated Coalition would be capable of, but for hard neck the most recent decisions cap it.</P>
    <P>A factor which so far has been ignored in the debate is the manner in which the subvention to CIE has been withdrawn. It was given to enable CIE to keep school bus fares at 10p.  This has been withdrawn by the Government.  Parents, accordingly, whether they have £200 a week or £40, have to pay twice as much money to get their children to school.  Parents have come to me who are living on assistance and who now must pay £8 a week for school bus fares because of the withdrawal of the CIE subvention.  The other elements in the Minister's package, increasing the teacher-pupil ratio, doing away with guidance counsellors in schools of fewer than 500 pupils, tampering with the number of remedial teachers in schools and taking away secretarial <Col N="950" /> and caretaker services from schools&mdash;all of these things, not just the taking away of school transport, will affect directly the quality of education which children can have.  It will affect children directly in proportion to the amount of the incomes their families will have &mdash; the poorer the families the greater the effect this will have on the chances of getting their children educated.  The decisions taken by the Minister yesterday are simply token gestures &mdash; she is reacting to the very strong and justified anger of parents and teachers at the manner in which the educational sector is being treated.  I do not think the gesture will fool anyone, the parents, the teachers or their trade unions.  The Government must restore the subvention to CIE and reverse their decisions with regard to guidance counsellors, remedial teachers, caretakers and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed) Donal Creed">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief in putting a few points before the House. This subject has been freely debated in the last week or so.  Last week we had a Private Members' debate on it for three hours.  In the last few sitting days I replied to more than 300 questions, most of them dealing with school transport.  Now we are having a third debate on school transport generally.</P>
      <P>At the outset I should like to emphasise that it is a very complicated and a very difficult scheme to keep in operation throughout the country.  I would pay a tribute to those who in the past have done their best to try to keep the service going. Now that the Minister has asked me to take responsibility for the operation of school transport and its administration, I will put a few points before the House. Free school transport was introduced in 1967 when fuel prices were low and the cost of manpower was cheap.  In that year it cost £1.9 million.  In 1983 the cost will be approximately £33.5 million, an enormous growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk here about free education, free transport, free health services, free this and free that.  It is very fashionable and popular to talk about things which are &ldquo;free&rdquo;, but someone will always have to <Col N="951" /> pay, the school transport service being no exception.  We must consider whether we should continue to ask taxpayers to subsidise school transport for people who could well afford to make a contribution towards it.  That is a very important factor in this debate.</P>
    <P>I stated last week, and I now repeat, that I am carrying out with my officials an in-depth study of the entire school transport system and I hope in the near future to make recommendations to the Government in relation to some changes which I regard as necessary.  We have had discussions with the Private Bus Owners' Association and other interested people and there has been no scarcity of suggestions and recommendations.  In many instances, however, the recommendations would not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to CIE for their contribution in operating this scheme since 1967.  There are many problems relating to catchment areas and the exclusion of some children because they do not live within the required distance to qualify for free transport.  The school transport system was introduced in 1967 and we have some school buses which are owned by the Department of Education and operated by CIE.  These are the yellow buses known as bus scoileanna.  Very few people realise that these buses are over 16 years old.  How many Members drive to this House in cars which are 16 or even six years old?  The Government will be faced in the near future with the need to expend a huge capital sum to replace those buses, if we do not change the present system.  We are transporting the children of this nation in buses which are hardly roadworthy.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said by Opposition Members and others that one of the reasons the school transport system is so expensive is that these bus scoileanna are not competing for private work.  Let me clarify the position.  I do not believe that these buses would be in a position to compete because they were originally designed as school buses and even if they were able to compete with private enterprise they would be operating in a very limited market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> I have not seen Deputy Gerard Brady, the former Minister for Education, taking any part in the discussion on this subject.  While Minister he made a statement on 18 November 1982 that charges should be introduced.  I cannot understand why he has not been in this House during the discussions and has not given a reason for his statement.  In his statement of 18 November 1982 there was a reference only to the position of larger families.  This Government provided that children whose parents or guardians were holders of medical cards would have free transport to senior cycle post primary schools.  It rings hollow for the Opposition to try to make political capital out of a decision for which they bear more responsibility than anybody else in this House.  This matter must be viewed against the background of the serious economic situation for which they cannot disclaim responsibility.</P>
    <P>I am reviewing the entire school transport service and I hope to be able to make some recommendations shortly.  I should like to see a more efficient system.  We must bear in mind that someone always has to pay the piper and there are people who could well afford to make a contribution towards school transport costs.  I appeal to the Opposition to reconsider their stance and to consider whether they are justified in bringing this matter to the floor of the House and trying to make political capital out of a system to provide transport for our children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>We are glad of the opportunity to discuss the school transport scheme and I do not mind how often this matter is brought before the House.  We make no apology to anyone for raising it as often as we can.  The chaos being created by the indecisiveness of this Government justifies our pursuing this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the element of modification announced by the Minister for many families whose children's education was in danger of being discontinued, I am not satisfied with the overall position.  It is daily becoming more obvious that there was little if any examination or consultation in relation to the Government's original proposals of 23 December 1982. <Col N="953" /> The decision was hurriedly taken and announced on the eve of the Christmas holidays.  What happened to the election promise of Fine Gael?  Did they not consider that before the announcement was made?</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement yesterday afternoon was to the effect that it had been decided to consult with representatives of school management authorities and the transport liaison officers with a view to seeking their co-operation in the implementation of arrangements for exemption from the charge.  I contend that the emerging chaos caused by the Government in regard to school transport was forecast by educationalists, trade unions involved in education&mdash;the INTO, ASTI and TUI&mdash;parents' associations, school management committees and managers and public representatives.  In particular it was forecast by Fianna Fáil Members who contributed to the motion discussed last week in the House.  It was brought home to the Minister by those Members, especially those from rural areas, the foolishness of her inept endeavour.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the stupid decision by the Minister in regard to families holding medical cards.  Those cards were issued on the general criteria of low income.  Parents and guardians of junior cycle students are obliged to pay for transport out of their already established meagre income.  If such families have a student in senior cycle&mdash;many of them have but they are fewer in number than the numbers in junior cycle &mdash; that student is entitled to travel free while the junior is expected to pay.  What sort of reasoning is behind that?</P>
    <P>In Monday's issue of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> there was a headline, &ldquo;Pupils Must Start Walking&rdquo;.  The story under that heading contained a very disturbing statement.  It was:</P>
    <P>In a statement issued over the weekend CIE inspectors were told to board all school buses and to inform the &ldquo;spongers&rdquo;, as the Department sees it, that they have two days in which to pay up or make alternative arrangements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> That was a nice title for the Department to give people who cannot pay these savage charges.  I did not see any subsequent condemnation of that description in subsequent issues of that newspaper.  That newspaper was not taken to task by members of the Government although recently two members of the Government complained about the accuracy of the reporting in <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> I was waiting for the third Minister to attack that newspaper but silence gives assent.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has already been forced to radically revise one aspect of the scheme she should go the full distance and re-examine all her proposals.  The Minister should enter into consultations with all concerned to formulate a new scheme for school transport.  If the Minister adopted that attitude she would eliminate the confusion caused by her decision, her indecisiveness and that of the Government.  I do not accept the continued reference being made to Estimates and programmes of the last Government.  The Coalition are in power and they have the responsibility.  They have created the chaos and it is up to them to sort it out.  In the meantime we will give all the constructive help we can.</P>
    <P>The Government, and the Minister, must seriously examine the contradiction where children are compulsorily required to attend school up to the age of 15.  The Government's decision in these times of economic depression denies some children access to school due to the inability of their parents or guardians to pay the transport charge.  That bears most severely on children in rural areas.  Are they expected to walk to school or cycle without taking into account the volume of traffic on our county roads?  Ceist eile atá agam.  Cad faoi páistí scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha? Na scoileanna sin nach bhfuil go ró flúirseach tríd is tríd na tíre agus dá bhrí sin go gcaithfidh páistí taisteal turasanna fada chucu.  Tá brú orthu siúl agus ní ghlacaim leis sin ar aon chaoi. Measaim go mba chóir go mbeadh breis cabhrach le fáil dóibh in ionad laghdú cabhrach.  Ach tuigim go maith agus tuigeann an tír ar fad go bhfuil sé de chuspóir ag an Rialtas seo faoi mar a bhí ag gach <Col N="955" /> Comhrialtas a bhí sa tír seo nach gcloínn siad leis an Ghaeilge agus nach gcloínn siad le Gealeachas na tíre seo.  Tá sé soiléir dom agus do roinnt daoine eile nach bhfuil clú ná cáil ag an Rialtas seo ar chúrsaí Gaeilge agus cúrsaí oideachais sa Ghaeilge i measc na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha.</P>
    <P>The cart-before-the-horse attitude of the Government in regard to school transport has been accepted by them under pressure as being a wrong and ill-informed decision.  I am glad the Government are now indicating to the House that they are prepared to talk to people in an effort to provide a school transport scheme that will be equitable and will not bear heavily on families or parents in the furtherance of their children's education. I regret I must conclude on a nasty note in reply to one introduced by the Minister earlier when she attacked the Leader of the Opposition.  That will not endear the Minister any more than it did her leader when he spent six hours on the same stunt when our leader was proposed for Taoiseach. I suggest with respect to the Minister that it would be better for her to concentrate her efforts on the solution of this problem in regard to school transport created by her and the Government of which she is a member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on having made some slight alteration in the severe cutbacks in school transport.  I do not subscribe to the back-down theory.  I think it is a good thing if the Minister listens to people's objections and looks again at some decision and it is a good thing that the Minister has taken another look at the problem in this case. I suggest now that she looks much more closely again and again, and listens again and again, to what the parents are saying. I agree with her there is an element of hyprocrisy in the Fianna Fáil objections because they intended in their Estimates to do the same thing.  They did not do it because they were not in Government and so it is the present Minister who has done it.  Most of her speech was taken up in pointing out it was Fianna Fáil who originally introduced the cutback and so <Col N="956" /> they should now sit quiet and say nothing. It must be hard for her to listen to Fianna Fáil Deputies now lashing her for doing precisely what they intended to do, but it is she who must now take the responsibility.</P>
      <P>She said it was the intention discreetly to identify those who are not in a position to pay for school transport.  That is something that just cannot be done.  You cannot discreetly identify one child from another.  We in The Workers' Party are asking that there should be no change in the availability of free school transport at the level obtaining on 1 December last. We are also asking that CIE be given an additional subvention to enable it to restore school buses to the level obtaining on 1 December last.  I am asking the Minister to look again at the whole question of free education and equality of opportunity.  These have been the foundation of the thinking and tradition of the State since it first evolved.  We were not able to do that for a long number of years but right from the Proclamation the whole question of equality of opportunity for the children of this nation was the basis on which the State was founded. Having got to the stage of being able to give free education we should have done everything possible to ensure that no change would ever subsequently take place in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent budget has imposed a charge for school transport and that charge is tantamount to putting a tax on school children, putting a tax on education, a tax on the future of our citizens, a tax on children who cannot answer back, who have not the opportunity of putting their case and must depend on their parents to do so for them.  Any of those who have agreed to pay the extra charges are people who cannot afford to do so.  They are paying by taking away from something else, in some cases by taking food off the table.  They are prepared to do everything they can to give their children a good education.  It is not sufficient just to say that there are some who have paid and there are some who have not paid, who probably are not able to pay, and we shall discreetly identify these.  We must also indentify those who <Col N="957" /> are making tremendous sacrifices in order to pay.</P>
    <P>I would make a special plea to the Minister in regard to urban school transport. In urban areas the charge is £72 a year whereas in rural areas it is £54 a year.  The Minister was making the case that those in rural areas should not be crying so much about these charges because those in urban areas were getting it even worse.  It is a fact they are getting it worse.  The increase in urban areas is 100 per cent because of the reduction in the subvention to CIE.  It is a small sum in the region of £1.5 million.  I can tell the Minister where she can get the money.  I can list numerous areas in which the money can be found.  Take the £8 million in health charges still owed by the farmers. They refuse to pay them.  That would provide the necessary subvention to CIE. Take the PRSI and PAYE which employees have paid but which are held back by employers from the Exchequer.  Why are the Revenue Commissioners allowing employers to do that?  It is absolutely illegal.  These payments are made by employees to the Exchequer and they should come into the Exchequer.  Without any more taxation the Minister can sit in the Cabinet and ask her colleague, the Minister for Finance, what he is doing about bringing in money legally due to the Exchequer, money which will enable the Minister for Education to continue a proper school transport system.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liomsa freisin cúpla focal a rá thar ceann na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha. Níl mórán díobh sa tír.  Níl a fhios agam cé mhéid atá sa tír ar fad.  I mBaile Atha Cliath sa dara léibhéal níl ach cúig scoileanna lan-Ghaelacha.  Tá dhá cheann amuigh i Stillorgan; tá ceann i Clondalkin, ceann eile, Coláiste Mhuire Cearnóg Pharnell, agus ceann thuas i nGlasnaoín, Scoil Chaitríona.  Tá daoine ag teacht ó Chill Mhantáin, ó Chontae na Mí agus ó gach aird den chathair chuig na cúig scoileanna sin.  Cad tá á dhéanamh futhu siúd.  Ar a laghad iarraim ar an Aire eisceacht a dhéanamh des na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha nuair atá an beartas seo faoi deireadh a chur le saor-thaisteal ar na busanna, mar má chuirtear é seo i bhfeidhm sna scoileanna <Col N="958" /> lán-Gaelacha tiocfaidh laghdú ar líon na ndaltaí a bheidh ag freastal ar na scoileanna sin.  Ni bheidh fágtha ag freastal ar na scoileanna ach na daoine siúd go bhfuil in achmhainn costas na mbusanna agus an costas breise seo a íoc.  Iarraim ar an Aire mar sin, mura bhfuil sí in ann deireadh a chur leis an mbeartas in a iomlán, ar a laghad go ndéanfadh sí eisceacht des na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha agus mar a deirim níl ach cúig cinn i mBaile Atha Cliath.  Níl a fhios agam cé mhéid atá sa tír ar fad ach níl morán díobh.  Is í an Ghaeilge céad téanga na tíre seo.  Sin atá san Bhunreacht. B'fhéidir nach gcreideann an Rialtas sin ach tá sé sin san Bhunreacht.  Mar sin ba chóir eisceacht a dhéanamh des na scoileanna sin.</P>
    <P>I, therefore ask the Minister to look again at the whole question of school transport and to end the cutbacks, to restore the subvention to CIE and to restore the free buses to the situation in which they were on the 1st December.</P>

      <P>I wish to congratulate Deputy Hussey on her appointment as Minister for Education.  I must say, however, that the warmth with which her appointment was received by the teaching profession has come to an end.  Parents felt that the appointment of a lady Minister for Education would be a step in the right direction, but unfortunately this is the first Minister for Education who has proposed to remove a service to the schools in the State.  We in Fianna Fáil are very proud of the fact that we introduced the free school bus service and we will not stand over the dismantling of this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refute the allegations being made by the Government and their effort to wash their hands of a decision which they and they alone made.  We were not returned to office on 24 November.  The Estimates which were prepared and published were Estimates and not decisions in relation to specific items of expenditure at any particular time.  If we were brought down on a budget after outlining details of a particular scheme in a Budget Statement, we could be justifiably criticised. Our spokesperson on Education, Deputy O'Rourke, has clearly stated our <Col N="959" /> position in relation to this matter.  We resent the Government trying to allege that we had made specific detailed decisions in relation to the school transport service.  Deputy O'Rourke has stated that if such proposals came before the parliamentary party she would have been at the forefront in any debate on this matter. We made no decision and we refute the allegation that those decisions were imminent and would have been made.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be aware of the proposals made by her party in Opposition. She may not be aware that her party published a policy on education in 1980. Deputy Collins was spokesperson on education at the time.  There was no mention then of removing the school transport service or of imposing these charges. When the Government got into office they brought in these proposals for which they were not given a mandate.  I wonder where the backbenchers of the Labour Party are.  They were not prepared to come in here today to contribute to this debate.  The once great Labour Party is now gone.  They lost their leader before the election and now they are lost in the right wing Fine Gael Government.</P>
    <P>We in the Fianna Fáil Party are the only Opposition.  It is regrettable for democracy to see the Labour Party no longer representing the working class people and no longer representing policies for the betterment of our people. I indict the Labour Ministers who sat around the Government table and agreed to the imposition of charges which will deprive many young people of the opportunity of free education, something we brought in and will fight to maintain.  It has always been our policy to support the free education concept and the opportunity for young people to obtain education. How do the Labour Party or indeed the Minister feel about the many representations coming in to every Deputy pleading with them to do something I will be sending specific cases to the Minister in the next few days.</P>
    <P>I have here a letter from a distraught parent in my constituency.  She states quite bluntly that her children have the choice of either thumbing or staying at <Col N="960" /> home.  Her weekly allowances are just keeping her head above water.  I get letters like that every day of the week and so, I am sure, do the backbench Deputies of Fine Gael who are not prepared to come in and stand over the Minister's decision because they are ashamed of the decision which she and her fellow Cabinet Ministers have made.  I can say the same for the discredited Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Last week I was one of the people who signed the requisition for the Private Members' motion which read:</P>
    <P>The Dáil calls on the Government to ensure that no child is denied the right to education because of the imposition of school bus charges.</P>
    <P>As a result of that we had at the weekend the arrogant statements by the Department of Education on behalf of the Minister that she would put on the inspectors, to name names and to deprive young people of transport, to put them off the buses, to divide townlands and areas, to make second-class citizens of our young people.  We will not allow that to happen. Thank God, due to the efforts of my party, the Minister last night in desperation decided to issue a statement that she would modify the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke, Deputy Hugh Byrne and Deputy Michael Kitt spoke here last week and there were many more lined up to oppose the measures being proposed.  The Minister was forced by public pressure to put out a statement last night.  Since 23 December 1982 she had stood coldly by and refused to be moved.  She told the Congress of Catholic Secondary Schools Parents Associations that she had so much to do she could not sit and talk to them.  In fact she said she would bring out a document on education in about six months time when the dust had settled.  The Minister hoped this would blow over and that people would pay up, but then she discovered that the dust would not blow over.  She may deny it, but I suppose the ordinary decent Fine Gael backbenchers were absolutely horrified and appalled and wished to disassociate themselves from her high-handed statement.  That would not be their style <Col N="961" /> and Deputy Kenny can nod his head and agree with me.  I pity them at the next election because many of them will lose their seats as a result of their standing idly by and allowing their Minister to take these decisions before the House and trying to impose them.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister consulted with the Attorney General to find out if charges on young people up to 15 years of age are constitutional? It is a legal requirement that parents are obliged to send their children to school until they are 15 years of age.  In the situation I have outlined one particular parent cannot afford to send her children to school because of the charges.  What will her position be in law if the gardaí arrive to inform her that her children were not at school and she would then be liable for prosecution? Would she have a constitutional case to fight because the Minister has deprived her children of going to second level education?  That is a very important point.  Maybe the DPP would be good enough now to put forward his views in relation to this matter as he was so willingly available last week in relation to the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. Perhaps he could put his legal ability to play in relation to that matter.</P>
    <P>A former Minister in England called Margaret Thatcher was called Thatcher the snatcher.  She took the milk from young children, another lady Minister. Please God we will have a really good Minister in Deputy Mary O'Rourke. Many of my constituents wonder what way will Minister Hussey be named in relation to taking school transport away from our young children.  She is going a very bad way in relation to her policies. Last night the Minister issued a statement. It is some statement, because we will now have consultation.  As Deputy O'Rourke said today, that is the first time the Minister has talked about consultation. She did not consult anybody on 23 December last when she imposed those charges.  Will she inform the House if the people who have now, unfortunately, paid the charges and had to beg and borrow money to pay those charges, will be refunded this money now because, <Col N="962" /> pending finalisation of the proposed arrangement for these pupils, CIE are being asked to ensure that transport services will continue as heretofore and parents of all the other pupils are reminded that the charges must be paid if their children are to be eligible for school transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now Minister for Education and she finds the going very heavy. It is getting very hot in the political kitchen.  The Minister does not know which direction to go because she will charge one day, then she will not charge, now she has to go back to the drawing board.  I make an appeal to the Minister for God's sake let us be rational and sensible.  Will she withdraw the charges and ensure that all our children are allowed to have free education?  Surely that is right, because the Minister is going in a direction now she will never find a way out of.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a former teacher.  She is going to the schools now asking the teachers and the school managers to decide if one parent can pay and another parent cannot pay.  The medical card service was bad enough.  I appeal to the Minister, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, to please be sensible and rational and we will not criticise her if she decides to withdraw the charges and finds out her mistake.  She has got good advice from my colleague Deputy O'Rourke &mdash; let us go back to square one, go back to the drawing board again and come up with a rational new scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening statement I explained how this charge in respect of school transport came to be introduced.  I pointed out it was done in the context of a need to control the rate of increase in expenditure on this service, particularly in the context of the difficult financial situation which affected the preparation of the Estimates for 1983.  I want to emphasise that I take my full share of responsibility in relation to a decision made by this Government to confirm the arrangements which had been prepared for implementation by the previous Government, subject to the modification that <Col N="963" /> pupils in the senior cycle would be exempted if their parents or legal guardians were holders of medical cards.</P>
      <P>I can appreciate that members of the general public and other supporters of the Government or the Opposition could, on the basis of holding a particular point of view, criticise me in respect of the decision which was taken.  I do not accept that the members of the Opposition, who were directly responsible as members of the cabinet or as members of the party who must have been fully informed of what was involved, should not be prepared to bear their share of responsibility for the action which was inevitable in the context of the provision made in the Estimates published on 18 November.  I want to repeat that I take my full share of responsibility, and I expect that responsible members of the Opposition would do so too.</P>
      <P>I have had discussions in recent weeks with various educational organisations and I have received representations from many sources, not alone in relation to this particular proposal, but also in relation to the other proposals which were introduced in the context of achieving a measure of balance in the public expenditure Estimates, including expenditure on the education group of votes.  I have listened carefully to all the representations made to me and I have taken note of the very many valuable suggestions and sincere and genuine recommendations made by people who accepted the need for special measures but consider that alternative means should also be explored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the suggestions which were made had already been fully examined in the context of the original proposals.  Perhaps, because I am a Minister with no previous ministerial experience, I am particularly susceptible to paying special regard to recommendations and suggestions made to me.  It may also be that the Government are particularly responsive to public opinion and decide to take seriously the expression of all points of view. Whatever the reason, I felt compelled to pay special attention to the arguments made and pleas put forward that some <Col N="964" /> means should be found of alleviating the situation of parents of junior cycle pupils for whom it would be a particular hardship to meet the charge.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the attendance of the pupils might be adversely affected, to some degree at least, by the application of the strict requirement for payment in all cases.  We live and we learn.  A few days ago I would be charged with being disdainful and contemptuous of the pleas of the general public if I did not pay heed to the various suggestions that have been made.  Now, because I have allowed myself to be impressed by the sincerity of so many people who are anxious to help and put forward their ideas, and because I again had the matter examined by the Government and was authorised to make a further examination of the situation with a view to finding some measure to ease the problem for deserving cases, I am attacked and so are the Government. For what?  For backing down.  It seems to me to be an extraordinary turn of events when you are accused of not consulting then you are accused of doing something wrong when you make a decision to consult.</P>
    <P>There has been one particular thread running through all the representations which most impressed me.  It was considered that with the co-operation of school authorities, who were familiar with the circumstances of the pupils, and also of the social welfare agencies, a method could be devised which would enable exemptions from payment to be given to real hardship cases.  It was not alone accepted, but apparently given a degree of benediction, that parents who could afford to pay should be requested to meet a charge in respect of school transport for their children.  The degree of unanimity with which these proposals were advanced greatly impressed me, and I became satisfied that an effort should be made to achieve what so many people seem to want.  I have arranged for discussions with representatives of the second level school authorities and the transport liaison officers tomorrow morning so that I can put to them the proposals of the Government, as I announced them yesterday, and seek advice and co-operation <Col N="965" /> as to how the intentions of the Government in this regard could be implemented. I should be only too glad to take into account the various contributions made in the course of this debate.  It has to be admitted, however, that debates in this House do not directly contribute additional revenue for this or indeed any other purpose but that they are desirable not only as an expression of the workings of democracy but also as a means of inspiring us to greater effort as well as vindicating the examination of some new avenues.</P>
    <P>I shall reply briefly to some of the contributions that have been made. Unfortunately, though, the major questions I posed at the outset have been avoided totally by Fianna Fáil.  I reiterate that I take full responsibility for my decisions, and I should like to hear the Opposition take some of the responsibility for their decisions.  If they agree with what their people did in Government in regard to the introduction of school transport charges, they should say so; if they disagree they should say that also but in that case they should let us know where they would have found the £5,500,000 they took off the Estimates.  Any confusion there may be is in the minds of the Opposition.  Selective quotations from the media are interesting from a party who apparently believe only some of what the media say but generally consider the media to be their enemy.  Reference has been made to education as being an emotive and a lively issue.  I am acutely conscious that that is the situation and I am becoming more aware of it every day.</P>
    <P>I believe in full consultation.  I have engaged in full consultation and I am in the process of full consultation now. Apparently, Deputy Brady when in office did not consult with members of the Cabinet, let alone members of his party.  I do not believe in that kind of procedure.</P>
    <P>The Workers Party, whose Members are not present at this moment, were taking the easy line, that is, that everything should be free, that no one, except perhaps foreign bankers, should pay for anything.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the timing <Col N="966" /> of the announcement in respect of school charges.  The decision to make the announcement before Christmas was taken very seriously by me because I considered that it would be unfair not to give parents sufficient warning of the introduction of the charges.  Since the charges had been mentioned in the course of the election campaign, I considered it important before perhaps a post-Christmas tristesse had set in, to announce the introduction of the charges.  I was fully aware that I would be accused of being some kind of latter-day Scrooge, but the line I took was responsible.  It has been pointed out that parents pay taxes which go towards education, but parents are very well aware that unfortunately most of what is collected by way of taxation is being used to repay the borrowing that was incurred as a result of the live-now, pay-later philosophy of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I am amazed to hear Deputies O'Rourke and Leyden ask that school transport charges be dropped completely in 1983 without their suggesting where the £5,500,000 that Fianna Fáil took off the Estimates is to come from.  Do these Deputies believe that the extra money should be raised by way of taxation or of borrowing?</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Rourke has asked that the school transport charges be dropped but she has not responded to my invitation to her to put forward an alternative source of revenue.  Deputy Lyons raised the question of bodies everywhere objecting to every measure that is taken.  A Government who are governing properly do not expect to be congratulated for doing their job.  It is a measure of the determination of this Government to govern that we are incurring such criticism.  We have applied evenly and fairly across the board a range of economies and taxation.  This is in direct contrast to the soft options that for so long were taken by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the extraordinary use of words in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> I assure <Col N="967" /> Deputy Lyons that I am not responsible for the exaggerations in that paper any more than I am responsible for the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> or for any other newspaper. The phrase to which the Deputy refers was recognised for the flight of fancy that it was.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla seemed to be adopting a constructive approach to the debate.  He applauded my decision to consult and to discuss on those issues, but unfortunately he reverted to the whole question of everything being free for everyone with apparently no one in sight to pay.  The same Deputy raised the question of all-Irish schools.  These schools are doing extremely important work, and if it were possible to do so I would excuse them from charges, but unfortunately they are only one of very many large interest groups who have asked for a similar concession.  The concession they already enjoy, that is that they take the distance to the nearest school in determining eligibility, continues as before.  I might add that all-Irish schools enjoy a very much better pupil-teacher ratio and a higher rate of grant than is the case of very many other schools.</P>
    <P>It is important that we consider very carefully this whole question of school transport charges.  While appreciating the kind remarks and congratulations offered by Deputy Leyden in respect of my appointment, I seem to have disappointed him greatly.  I am sorry about that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should not be surprised or disappointed at this stage because of any Minister not following the kind of action followed by Ministers of Fianna Fáil Governments in the past, that was to give in to every possible pressure and to run the country into further trouble.  If the Deputy expects me to behave in that way he will be disappointed, because that is not the way I intend to behave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect my popularity will evaporate <Col N="968" /> even further as this Government proceed to do the job they were elected to do and which we believe the people wish us to do.  I regret that Deputy Leyden joined Deputy O'Rourke and Fianna Fáil in general in a total disowning of the Book of Estimates for 1983.  The statement that figures which appeared in that publication did not represent decisions must be one of the most significant statements that this debate has produced.  It is tantamount to saying that some items in the Book of Estimates ought to be withdrawn as soon as the issues in question become uncomfortable.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear to the House and to parents that the school transport charges are not being withdrawn, that the system remains fully in operation.  Parents who have paid already have done so in the knowledge that they must contribute to school transport in order to preserve the extent of the system.  If what I decided on last night is a climb down, so be it.  I am not among those who are afraid to listen to representations.  I am not a politician who is afraid to postpone something in order to think further about it.  Through this debate I must assure the parents that there is no change in the plans but that we are considering a special arrangement for particular hardship cases, and that arrangement will be announced at the first possible opportunity. The situation remains as before.  In this matter we have acted honourably and will continue to do so.  That is in direct contrast to the kind of opportunism indulged in by the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I had all but concluded when I spoke here last week.  At some length I had put on record the extracts which had been published of the opinion of the Attorney General on the proposed wording.  Since then there has been further public debate on the wording and it is not unfair to suggest, as some have done, that we have been over-cautious in our concern to get the wording right.  I do not want to travel the same territory again, but I want to make very briefly and bluntly this point.</P>
      <P>We have been asked to bring in an amendment not because anybody suggested that the <i>status quo</i> is unsatisfactory, and not because anybody suggested that there is an immediate danger of the Supreme Court upsetting that <i>status quo,</i> but against the possibility that at some date in the medium or long term the Supreme Court might interpret the Constitution in a way not now foreseen.  If it is appropriate, and such a view has gained support from both sides of this House, to take account of that possibility in the medium term, then it equally behoves us to take particular account of the wording, and to take into account, not just what the Supreme Court might do today but what it might do at some stage in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier I said I was distressed by what seemed to be a lack of respect for the Supreme Court that had emanated from both sides during this debate, but if it is ever the case that we are so ill-served by our Supreme Court that its members would interpret the Constitution as it now stands, and the fact that it is silent on the question of the right to life of the unborn as providing for abortion, is it not equally likely that those members who compose the court would in turn take advantage of any conceivable ambiguity in an amendment to achieve the same results?  Does it not make basic, common and logical sense that if we ever had a Supreme Court which wanted to take advantage of the fact that there is no reference in the Constitution, as it now stands, to the right to life of the unborn child, and take the view that there is a personal right to have an abortion, they could place that interpretation <Col N="971" /> on the amendment?  Our responsibility is to put the <i>status quo</i> beyond doubt now and for the foreseeable future. We know what the members of the Supreme Court would do under the Constitution as it stands, but we do not know what might happen at some dim and distant date in the future.</P>
    <P>If anybody who is unconvinced by the views of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions that the amendment as presently drafted is imprecise and vague, may I suggest that the situation would be put beyond doubt if they took the trouble to read the speech by Deputy Woods.  On 9 February 1983, at column 1386, volume 339 of the Official Report he said:</P>
    <P>Despite what would undoubtedly have been the wish of the promoters of this amendment and the majority church in this island, there is no attempt in the wording of the amendment to define the moment at which the life of the unborn begins.  The amendment does not attempt to make this definition.  Most, of course, would argue that it begins at the time of conception, but this is a matter of theological and scientific argument and in preparing the wording of the amendment we felt it was not appropriate to the Constitution to have such definitions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods, Opposition spokesman for Health and the Minister who had charge of the Bill when first brought before this House, admits openly and without shame that the Bill is deliberately vague, deliberately bland, keeping a foot in both camps and an eye in every direction.</P>
    <P>We were asked to bring in this amendment for one purpose, and one purpose only, to copperfasten the <i>status quo</i> and to meet the fears that had been expressed by responsible people in the legal and medical worlds.  In those circumstances we have an absolute obligation to get this wording right and to ensure that there are no ambiguities and no double think. That means we must look beyond the wording which is being presented to us.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate a number <Col N="972" /> of Deputies expressed concern about the tenor of the debate in sections of the media and in the contributions made. Any proposal to amend our Constitution deserves to be seriously examined and scrutinised, and all must be free to engage in that exercise without any fear or pressure that their concern to do their duty as legislators, would leave them open to the charge of somehow being concerned with technicalities and, in an unspecified way, being soft on abortion.  Those who attempt to make that sort of point do no service to the cause they seek to promote.</P>
    <P>I notice Deputy Flynn is sitting on the Opposition benches.  He is a good humoured colourful contributor to our debates, one to whom it is a pleasure in times of light relief to listen, but he did himself, his cause and his party no credit when, while in Government, he purported to suggest that the Fine Gael commitment to oppose abortion was in doubt.  If he shares our total opposition to abortion &mdash; and I have no doubt that he does &mdash; he has a responsibility to go a little beyond his usual colourful exchanges and to look very seriously at what he proposes to put before the people.  He should ask himself whether, in conscience, he is prepared to put to the people a wording which might, just might, provide for abortion up to perhaps 25 or 28 weeks.  It is precisely because we on this side of the House are absolutely determined that no such mistake is going to be made that we are determined to look at this wording very carefully and see that the wording the people are eventually invited to vote on will put the matter beyond doubt.</P>

Sin an rud a bheidh romham san méid atá le rá agamsa.</P>
      <P>I regard this enabling legislation as a very serious business, indeed.  It is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation ever brought before this House.  Ideally, I would have been very pleased if every single Member could have found the time and the willingness to contribute to this debate, so putting his or her attitude to the whole business on public record.</P>
      <P>My views on this matter are well known.  They have been expressed, not only in the House, but outside in public. It is unnecessary for me to say anything at all on the matter here, but because of my personal attitude towards this legislation and the proposed referendum it is incumbent upon me to put on record my stance.  I look forward to many more Deputies taking the same opportunity afforded to them.  If we had this type of discussion on a lot more legislation, we would have a real cross-section view of the various elements which go to make up this House.</P>
      <P>Changing a Constitution, or any part of it, is a matter of considerable importance and seriousness and it will be treated accordingly by me.  On 23 March 1982 the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Haughey, indicated on the Government bench opposite to me here that his Government were going to promote this amendment to the Constitution, specifically to protect the right to life of the unborn child and it was in those terms that the Taoiseach of the day initiated this amendment in the Dáil chamber.  If we are to believe all that we read in the newspapers, the Attorney General of that time had suggested very many different wordings which might be suitable, or at least might be considered as suitable for the promotion of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at liberty, even in the privilege of this House, as a former member of that Cabinet, to divulge what went on at the Cabinet table or what documents or memoranda in support of matters were raised in Government and I do not propose <Col N="974" /> to do so.  There would seem to have been very educated guesses, to put it at its least, concerning some of that documentation of which I have good memory, because it was a memorandum in which I was particularly interested.  From recent reports in the media it would appear that certain people in the media had more than just a casual acquaintance with some of the confidential material submitted in this matter to the Government of which I was a member.  We have heard a lot of talk recently about leaks of Government papers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is a very serious matter and leads one to begin to believe that perhaps nothing is confidential in so far as Government papers are concerned.  This might not be a proper place to raise such a matter, but it is relevant in that in the very recent past it was obvious to me, as one with a clear memory of some of the memoranda attached to this item, that certainly more than educated guesses were being made by certain people reporting on this issue.</P>

      <P>It would not have been when the Cabinet were considering it. This certainly is leaking no confidence about Government happenings and procedures. It was the view of the Taoiseach of the day, of all concerned and of myself that the wording would be positive.  That was an essential element on which all were agreed.  I was reinforced in my attitude towards the idea of being positive in that in not a single Article of the Constitution is condemnation of any specific activity expressed.  The framework or framers of the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;must have had that uppermost in their minds, as well, at the time.  Certainly, I would regard it as inappropriate, many years later, that an element of negativeness should venture into <Col N="975" /> any provision for reform of our Constitution.</P>
      <P>It is easy to be critical about any word or word framework which might be suggested as the proper one, but I uphold the view, as expressed by my leader and my party, of supporting the wording as outlined in the enabling legislation which we are asking the House to pass and in the wording as outlined in Minister Noonan's speech to the House in the recent past.  It is easy to be critical of it, or any alternative type of wording. Obviously, certain individuals would not like to have that wording incorporated in the final Act, but it would be extraordinarily difficult to find an alternative wording because, if they had had wording of an alternative nature readily available to them, I am quite sure that they would not have allowed the Minister for Justice to suffer the enormous embarrassment on Second Stage of the Bill &mdash; the wording as agreed by us incorporated in the speech &mdash; of finding subsequently that somebody said perhaps there should be a rethink on the subject.</P>
      <P>Two months is a fair time and I would have thought that if an alternative wording were being promoted by the Government as a substitute to what had already been agreed by all in the matter, it was a reasonable period of time in which to find an alternative and promote it.  They did not do so.  This leads me to think that there is something other than common embarrassment involved as far as the Minister for Justice is concerned.  I will try to suggest what might very well be the ploy and strategy of the Government in adopting this divisive tactic which they have employed as far as this legislation is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister of State when he suggests that this is a very serious business.  I agree also that a referendum to bring about an amendment of our Constitution is the ultimate in the democratic process and reflects the real will of the people.  To deny that lightly would be a very undemocratic thing to do.  It not only reflects the real will of the people but also protects those same people in public from a <Col N="976" /> number of things important in the context in which we speak.  It protects them from a certain kind of legislation, from a certain kind of Government trying to protect or promote a certain sectional interest they might wish to legislate for.  We are all here familiar with and well aware of political manoeuvring.  I suppose that would be regarded as fair game for the day in most things.  A certain amount of political manoeuvring goes on; otherwise we would not have political parties putting forward various manifestos and programmes to entice people to their way of thinking.  Political moods have a big bearing on political activity here also, the moods of individuals, groups of individuals and parties.  Particular types of movements and moves have a way of developing at particular times during the legislative process as practised here.</P>
    <P>The first thing the Constitution does is that it protects the public from certain kinds of legislation, from certain kinds of Legislatures at certain times who might accommodate the interests of certain sections of the community.  The Constitution fulfils a second function: it protects the public from certain kinds of judicial rulings.  Here I refer to rulings of the Supreme Court when it hands down majority decisions on the existing Constitution that might very well be at variance with the attitudes and principles of the wishes of the majority.  That is not unique in our society, decisions being handed down by the Supreme Court that would not find favour with the majority of the electorate.  That is another reason we have the Constitution and why it affords some element of protection to the majority point of view.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, there is nothing more fundamental than human life.  Equally I contend there is nothing more democratic than giving the ultimate decision on constitutional matters to the electorate.  That is precisely what was in the minds of the Government of which I was a member when they considered bringing enabling legislation into this House for the purpose of getting the decision of the people of Ireland, no more or no less, on a subject on which we believed the majority had a particular <Col N="977" /> wish they would like to express in a certain way.  We said we would like to give them that opportunity.  Would any one person or persons seek to disallow such a process or such freedom to the electorate? If they would, then they have no place in the democratic process.  To deny the electorate the right to decide this matter would simply be undermocratic and we are determined that they will be given that right.</P>
    <P>Some people would say that the Constitution is the voice of the people.  Others would say that the voice of the people is as enshrined here, from the mouths of those people whom the electorate voted to represent them.  Whatever attitude one takes on that matter, however one regards it, there is one thing sure: the Constitution does exert a control on Governments.  It enunciates the basic rights of the citizens of this State; it declares ideals and maintains standards for the common good.  These matters are enshrined in our Constitution.  But, like any document devised by men or women, it has its limitations; it can have weaknesses. It is incumbent on those who represent the electorate at any given time during our lifetime, when they feel that some element of that Constitution has developed a weakness or is in danger of being interpreted in a way that would be contrary to the majority wish, to seek a formula that will put that weakness right. No one politician, no one group of politicians, has the right to think for all the people of this land or to impose a bias on them.  That Constitution has served us well; we are all agreed on that.  It has served as a major bulwark against those who would seek to have it interpreted in a particular way to suit their interests.  It has served also as a bulwark against the infringement of our country's rights and on the rights of the individuals who make up that country.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to pose the question why the pro-life campaign started at all. While it might sound simplistic, I would offer the folowing as at least one good reason it became necessary to have a campaign.  I would contend it is as a result of the policy of the referral clinics in certain areas of our country of proceeding <Col N="978" /> by degrees in their campaign for legalised abortion.  That 1861 Act has no definition at all of when life begins.  There is no doubt at all in my mind but that that Act would have been challenged in the not too distant future.  It was going to be challenged by a very vocal, articulate and well-placed minority in our society.  They are seeking to impress and impose their aspirations and attitudes on the majority who do not share their permissive latitude in the matter of abortion, and any shilly-shallying now, or any device to thwart or confuse, or worse, to abandon the enabling legislation, as far as I am concerned will be regarded as a victory for the abortionists.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt if that could be achieved it would accommodate their stated objectives, which is legislation to allow abortion here.  They do not put a tooth in it &mdash; I will give them that.  They print it in their leaflets.  The one I have here by the Anti-Amendment Campaign, with a PO box number, states in item 4, without any ambiguity, that the proposed amendment will impede further discussion and possible legislation on abortion.</P>

      <P>I have referred to a document produced by the Anti-Amendment Campaign.  I will be referring to the matter later.  It does not give an address.  It has a PO box number, 1285, Dublin 7, and a telephone number.  As far as I am concerned, confusion is one of the main strategies, the main aim of the abortion lobby.  It could be achieved in various ways.  You would have those against the amendment, one way or another; those who would be against the wording; those who would prefer various types of wording; those who would be against abortion but against the amendment, for their own reasons.  You could have a whole range of small sectional groups who would be against this for many little reasons of their own.  But it is hoped by that abortion lobby that in the confusion the Government might be tempted to abandon the amendment altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That abandonment would mean the <Col N="979" /> life achievement of the abortionists and it would not please anybody except themselves. I believe the amendment of the Constitution is not just desirable but essential, because the Constitution does not contain any specific protection for the unborn child.  When I say that, I am aware that the amendment will not change the present legal position in regard to abortion.  That is not at issue. However, it will do something: it will reinforce the existing law as we know it and it will guarantee that any future decision regarding abortion or the legalising of abortion, or any related matter, will have to be done by a further referendum, the surest guarantee the electorate will have that the majority opinion, which abhors abortion, will be protected. The electorate are entitled to have control of the fundamental policies attached to their rights in this land.  Those rights are enshrined in the Constitution and it is important for the electorate that they can recognise them and have them on display.</P>
    <P>We do not want a situation ever to arise when, because of political gatherings, or groups or interests, or difficulties that might be attached to a particular Government at a particular time because of voting strength, that legislation could be promoted here to give effect to something that the vast majority of the people do not want, namely, to legalise abortion in some shape or form.  What a magnificent document the Constitution is.  It is a fundamental document that has stood the test of time.  Just as it is fundamental as a document it sets out our fundamental rights.  I am suggesting that a weakness has been found and it has become mandatory on us, if we have the respect for that document as the protector of our fundamental rights that we should have, to take the necessary steps to bring about a situation that will put that weakness right, that will continue to afford the protection that the vast majority of the people wish to enjoy.</P>
    <P>The insertion of this amendment in the Constitution will mean simply that abortion cannot and will not be made legal either through legislation or judicial <Col N="980" /> decision.  Abortion is prohibited under the 1861 Protection against the Person Act.  We might as well face up to it that that piece of legislation could be changed by the Oireachtas any time it likes.  It is simply a matter of getting enough marching feet through the lobby.  For any reason, through pressure that might be put on a Government not totally in control of their destiny, the marching feet might very well be found to traipse through the lobby to change the legislation.</P>
    <P>What protection then would the vast majority of our people have against something they abhor, namely abortion?  Whatever safeguard there might be because there are people here who would stand their ground no matter what the pressure put on them &mdash; there are people here who would prefer to march out the gate rather than have to carry the load if this legislation were changed &mdash; there would be no protection at all if the thing could be changed by the courts.  It might possibly be changed by the courts in the event of a challenge to the constitutionality of the 1861 Act.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald on 22 February 1983:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government, in view of the B &amp; I Company's announced decision to abandon the Cork-Pembroke Service, to ensure that a full, regular and round the year service be provided as soon as possible between Cork and South Wales, such as operated satisfactorily for more than 10 years between Cork and Swansea, and pending this outcome to ensure that a service be provided <Col N="981" /> immediately by the B &amp; I Company for the remainder of 1983 in accordance with their contractual obligations.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
    <P>notes the decision of the B &amp; I Company to close the Cork-Pembroke Ferry Service as part of its plan to reverse its serious loss-making situation; notes also that since the decision was conveyed to the Government in October 1982, it was not found possible by successive Governments to recommend a reversal of this decision; and welcomes the initiative of the Minister for Transport, and his continuing efforts, to provide a Summer ferry service in 1983.</P>

      <P>In my contribution last night I tried to establish the inefficiency and blunders of B &amp; I which brought about their withdrawal from the Cork area.  Cork is an industrial area which demands a proper shipping service.  My colleagues as well as Corkmen on the opposite benches, will vouch for that fact. I would remind the Minister that almost all new industry setting up in the State is export-dependent and further industrial development in the Cork region will be greatly inhibited unless there is a regular roll-on roll-off service direct to the UK.</P>
      <P>We will continue to highlight this demand as well as the blunders and lack of imagination of B &amp; I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept the amendment which welcomes the Minister's continuing efforts to provide a summer ferry service in 1983.  Our motion calls on the Government to ensure that a full, year-round service is provided as soon as possible between Cork and South Wales, similar to that which existed between Cork and <Col N="982" /> Pembroke.  We will continue to make this demand, joined by business and commercial interests, tourist concerns and everybody interested in the welfare of the region.</P>
    <P>I was hoping that some constructive view would be expressed by the Minister in relation to the Cork area and we are hoping also to hear about his efforts to restore this all-important service.  Unfortunately this has not happened and I hope before the debate ends that some information will be given to us providing some hope that Cork will have a proper and efficient shipping service.</P>
    <P>Cork is suffering from very severe unemployment.  Over 10,000 people are out of work there.  It is sad that a State-sponsored body who are responsible for the investment of £70 million in the development of Cork harbour should be part of this effort to bring more unemployment in Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on this motion as a Deputy representing Cork North-Central, a constituency which has above average unemployment and which has suffered through the years because of the demise of some of our traditional labour-intensive industries.  Unemployment is uppermost in our minds and I am very concerned about the continuation of some form of ferry service between Cork and the British mainland.</P>
      <P>Along with a very representative delegation from the Cork and Kerry region, I have during recent months made three visits to different Ministers.  We met the then Minister, Deputy John Wilson, on 19 October 1982 and the delegation put a very good case.  The Minister was very well informed on the problem and was very polite and receptive to the ideas put by the delegation.  We met the present Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, on 30 December last with the closure date of 7 January decided by B &amp; I management hanging over our heads.  The Minister treated us very cordially and listened to the submissions we made and we came away satisfied that we had made a very good case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We met the Minister again, in accordance with an agreement with him, on 3 <Col N="983" /> February, the date the closure was announced.  The delegation put forward very good reasons for the maintenance of the Cork-Pembroke service because the Cork-Kerry region is a prime tourist area dependent on an efficient ferry service. The delegation were very conscious that the development of existing industry and the ability of the region to attract new industry is also dependent on an efficient sea link with the British mainland.</P>
    <P>The majority of the delegation came to Dublin on each occasion convinced that a pull-out by B &amp; I would seriously downgrade the region, with serious social and economic implications.  The delegation opposed the withdrawal of the service from Cork on a number of major points. The point which was uppermost in our minds was the fact that if the closure took place there would be resultant redundancies in the B &amp; I staff in Cork.</P>
    <P>The second point was the adverse effect the withdrawal of the service would have on tourism and commercial interests in the Cork-Kerry region.  I felt the delegation sought a meeting with the Minister because they felt that Cork was being used as a scapegoat for the serious financial situation B &amp; I found itself in. That situation was brought about by unsound commercial decisions by management in recent years.  We were conscious of the fact that the switch from Swansea to Pembroke in 1979 was to the detriment of the service and resulted in a longer land journey for those travelling from here to Britain.  We are all familiar with the condition of the Welsh roads from Pembroke.</P>
    <P>It was made known to the delegation by the workers in Cork that they had a grievance because of their agreement to a Rosslare-Pembroke run in 1980 and, subsequently, their agreement to a Rosslare-Cork to Pembroke service resulted in a diversion of traffic from the Cork area.  In our dealings with the workers in Cork we learned that they were responsible people and conscious of the B &amp; I situation.  We also learned that they had facilitated management in every way they could in recent years.  In fact, some of them made financial contributions to <Col N="984" /> B &amp; I coffers from their salaries.</P>
    <P>The delegation was also conscious of the fact that the Ringaskiddy ferry terminal had been provided at a cost of about £8 million on the basis of assurances from B &amp; I.  We are now given to understand that that terminal will be under-utilised as a result of the threatened withdrawal from Cork by B &amp; I. We met the Minister firm in our conviction that a fundamental lack of commitment existed by the B &amp; I to Cork and that this has resulted in the present situation. What happened on 3 February is history.  The decision was made then to close the Cork-Pembroke service.  The withdrawal from Cork was a blow to us all because we knew many of the workers involved and some of us had relations there.  We left the meeting with the Minister with a sense of personal loss.  It is understandable that since then B &amp; I staff in Cork have been critical of politicians and management.  They see themselves as victims of commercial and political bungling down through the years.</P>
    <P>We must give an account of our stewardship at election time but B &amp; I management do not have to account for themselves. They should not be allowed to walk away from the Cork debacle and they must be made account for their mismanagement in recent years, in particular, their policy decisions in regard to Cork.  I find it hard to accept some of the points made by the Minister in reply to the Opposition.  I demand that the Government set up an inquiry into the decisions and activities of the B &amp; I management in recent years.  The decision to switch from Swansea to Pembroke was a disastrous one.  The purchase of the jetfoil was a major mistake and it has dogged the financial position of B &amp; I since.  We must look at what I term the conspiracy by B &amp; I to abandon Cork in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the decision by B &amp; I to leave Cork people from that area will have to travel to Rosslare to avail of the ferry service to the Welsh coast.  There is no need to tell the House about the condition of the roads between Cork and Rosslare.  The roads in Cork are not bad but once one leaves Waterford city one must travel on poor roads. I wonder what effect the B &amp; I decision will have on the condition of those roads. What draw will there be on Exchequer funds to bring them to a standard suitable for carrying heavy freight traffic to Rosslare? The Exchequer will be forced to make a massive investment in infrastructure in that area because of the withdrawal from Cork.</P>
      <P>I have been told that Rosslare is a limited port, suffers from silting and needs to be dredged from time to time. I am also given to understand that the landing berth at Rosslare causes problems from time to time.  I have read press reports about delays because of tidal difficulties at Rosslare.  In my view influential vested interests are involved in the decision to wind down the Cork operation. It is said in Cork that some of the board of management of B &amp; I have vested interests in the Wexford area.  For example, it has been said that the executive officer of B &amp; I was formerly involved at senior management level in a Wexford company and that a director of B &amp; I has widespread business interests in the Wexford area.  I should like to know the input those people had into the decision to reduce the Cork operation and, eventually, withdraw from that city. The people of Cork and B &amp; I workers are entitled to answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been established that Cork will have a new service operating from Ringaskiddy to Wales starting sometime in March.  I am not aware of the extent of the service but at least there will be continuity between Cork and Wales.  But I am not altogether happy about the position. I want more details on the type of service that will be provided.  B &amp; I must set up a summer service from Cork this <Col N="986" /> year and I believe the Government will ensure that this service is established for the people in the region.</P>
    <P>I must defend my party and our Government against some of the charges levelled against us recently by some Opposition speakers and their political allies in high positions in the southern Cork region.  I must remind them that many of the decisions made by the B &amp; I were made when the Opposition Party were in Government.  These decisions ultimately decided the fate of the B &amp; I in Cork and those in Opposition now were quite aware of what was happening and did very little to prevent the winding down of the Cork operation.  It reduces the status of the House somewhat when Deputies, discussing a serious situation for Cork, attempt to make that situation into a political football.</P>
    <P>The Government have been accused of abandoning the Cork and Kerry region and a good deal of play has been made about the £1 million taken from the Ringaskiddy area recently.  The Chairman of the Cork Harbour Commissioners was very vocal and very critical of the decision not to go ahead temporarily with the Ringaskiddy deep water terminal.  I would remind the House that it was during the term of office of the Coalition Government in 1976 that Cork development was initiated.  That development originated back to 1970-71.  It stayed on the shelf in the early seventies until the Coalition Government initiated the plan in 1976 and that was initiated when the country was going through one of the worst recessions ever.</P>
    <P>The Cork Harbour Commissioners went ahead with the construction of a ferry terminal on the assumption that the B &amp; I would come to Ringaskiddy.  I have checked this out to the best of my ability from the records made at the time and I have yet to find any evidence that a signed agreement existed in this matter and I would like the Chairman of the Cork Harbour Commissioners, before he accuses my Government of adverse action against the Cork region, to examine the activities of his own board.  I put it on record now that it has not been all doom and gloom in the Cork region in <Col N="987" /> recent times.  The impression is being created, but not by the Government or the parties in Government, that Cork is going downhill fast.  This is not true.  Murphy's Brewery was saved and over 200 jobs were assured.  Secondly, industries were announced for the Kilbarrack Industrial Estate with an employment content of 220 jobs and the possibility of a third major company coming into the area. Thirdly, Schering Plough announced a major development in the Innishannon area which will have a labour content on completion of 160 jobs and, at the construction stage, will have 600 people working on the site.  Fourthly, in the Ringaskiddy area £300,000 is being allocated for road development.  Cork has suffered serious setbacks but it has not been abandoned, as some would have us believe, by the present administration.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Opposition in this debate has been very hypocritical.  The Minister proved last night that Fianna Fáil, according to that party's policy document, <i>The Way Forward</i>, would not have acted any differently.  Deputy Wilson will not, I am sure, deny that the inter-departmental report submitted to his Department recommended the winding down of the Cork operation and he did not overrule that recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>My interpretation was that the situation was allowed to drift and no attempt was made to cope with it.  The Opposition seem to have done a complete U-turn on this issue now.  Some consideration will have to be given to the workers involved in the B &amp; I, some of whom have up to 38 years' service.  Mention was made last night of the Verolme contracts.  The B &amp; I have chosen to go to <Col N="988" /> Britain to get their ships serviced.  Our taxpayers have a financial input and interest in the company and we must be told how and why contracts are allowed to go out of the country.  Now despite the impression given here that Cork Deputies are divided on most issues my experience has been quite the contrary. We have all learned to co-operate and put our heads together when faced with problems in the Cork area and I hope this co-operation will long continue.  I am demanding a full inquiry here into the workings of the B &amp; I.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the problem of B &amp; I's abandonment of Cork one has to begin with the basic situation and say that there was a well established, nearly a century old established, Sealink route from Cork to Britain.  It was an effective viable proposition.  Why did that service suddenly become non-viable?  I am sure part of the answer must be found in poor management, a lack of commitment by B &amp; I to Cork, the determination of B &amp; I to concentrate its activities in Dublin and one other port but Dublin in particular. All Cork people know that for many years the old Inishfallen left Penrose Quay on Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings around 5.30.  Regrettably we saw, in our younger days, the masses of people boarding that boat with the livestock and the commercial produce. We were glad to see from the middle sixties onwards a discontinuance of the emigration of people but commercial development and improvement in the Cork area warranted the existence of this link from the port of Cork to the British markets.  The board of B &amp; I changed their schedules.  They moved to the car ferry terminal a little downstream to shorten the time of crossing and give manoeuvrability to the boats in the port. All that was allowed to happen because of mismanagement, because of a lack of commitment to the port of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We met three Ministers in recent months.  There is no doubt, and I am sure <Col N="989" /> the Ministers we met have no doubt about the validity of the case put forward by the constituent bodies of those delegations that the service was not only essential but was also viable if properly carried out.  That point was stressed by each of the interests involved.  Unemployment is one of the serious problems facing the country at present.  Every public representative has this to say but unfortunately we have to say it even more strongly in the Cork area.  It is beyond our comprehension why this Coalition Government allowed this to happen. Their attempt to downgrade Cork has been very significant.  May I, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, introduce another copy of our bible, <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> On Tuesday, 15 February we saw a heading:</P>
    <P>Yes, minister, but are we right?</P>
    <P>That refers to an interview with the Minister for Transport when he condemned <i>The Cork Examiner</i> for being &ldquo;hysterical and outrageous&rdquo; in its accusations that the Government were downgrading the south-west.  I quote:</P>
    <P>But faced with the blunt question, &ldquo;are you saying that what the <i>Examiner</i> has claimed is not accurate?&rdquo; Mr. Mitchell refused to come up with an equally blunt answer...Asked again if what the <i>Examiner</i> has been saying was inaccurate, the Minister again sidestepped, &ldquo;For the <i>Examiner</i> to blame us isn't fair or reasonable,&rdquo; he said.  Asked why he had refused to receive a deputation from Cork Harbour Board about the B &amp; I pull out from Cork &mdash; a decision condemned by the Board's chairman, Mr. Denis Murphy, as &ldquo;disgusting and insulting&rdquo;. &mdash; Mr. Mitchell said he had not refused. He had been &ldquo;inundated&rdquo; with requests for deputations and his Department was refusing them to give him a chance to settle in.</P>
    <P>And then, astonishingly, as our paper records, Mr. Mitchell revealed that he had not consulted with the IDA about the decision not to go ahead with the building of a deep water berth at Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> I like to lay blame where it properly rests and the decision by the Government not to give the £1 million that was earmarked by our Government for the further development and completion of the Ringaskiddy deep water berth has to be seen in the light of the overall decisions being taken for the Cork area.  If that £1 million had not been withdrawn by the Government we could have seen at least 200 direct jobs at Ringaskiddy and many more indirect jobs as a result of that part of the plan proceeding.  What are some of the semi-State bodies at with regard to Cork?  The worst aspect of it is that they have the support and collusion of the Coalition Government.  We could also delve into the activities of Aer Lingus but we will have that another night.</P>
    <P>It was said in the discussion tonight that the plan for the lower harbour development was initiated by the Coalition Government.  People might like to believe that but we in Cork local authorities know well when the plan was formulated. We know when it was ready to become effective on the ground with the input of finance.  We also know that during the period of the Coalition Government of 1981, they stopped £2 million for the development at Ringaskiddy. When we got back into Government for a short period we took it off the shelves.  Lo and behold, the Coalition are only back a couple of weeks and they are shelving it again.</P>

      <P>I looked at the Deputy in the All-Ireland in 1965 and I was sad when the Minister of State's team beat Kerry.  No amount of propaganda will ever distort the facts.  As far as my colleagues and I are concerned there is absolutely no hypocrisy on our behalf regarding the supportive role we play with the many organisations from the Cork region.  I would like to include in that the entire south-west region in our approach to the various Ministers in relation to the B &amp; I.  It is essential for the development of the south-west region, with Cork as its base, to have this <Col N="991" /> direct link with Britain for trade, commerce and tourism.</P>
      <P>Many of the tourists who come to the south-west are the mothers, fathers, sons and daughters who emigrated from the south-west to England in the fifties when they could not find work at home.  These are the people we want to accommodate. These are the people who like to come home to their native heath for their holidays and encourage a few of their English colleagues to come with them. Statistics were given here last night on the number of people involved in the tourist industry and how seriously the withdrawal of that service is affecting so many people in our region.</P>
      <P>Our motion asks that a full and regular round-the-year service be provided as soon as possible between Cork and South Wales, like that which operated satisfactorily for more than ten years between Cork and Swansea.  That part of the motion is very relevant.  My colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, last night said that the crazy decision &mdash; there is no other way to describe it &mdash; by B &amp; I and anybody else responsible to move from Swansea to Pembroke was the beginning of the end for that service.</P>
      <P>Our motion goes on to say:</P>
      <P>and pending this outcome to ensure that a service be provided immediately by the B &amp; I Company for the remainder of 1983 in accordance with their contractual obligations.</P>
      <P>B &amp; I keep telling us that a service out of Cork is not viable.  We thoroughly reject that suggestion by them.  We want to emphasise that with a service, with the proper commitment given to it, with proper scheduling, with good service provided on the crossing, the people in Cork have no doubt whatever that it would be viable.  I heard mention last night and again tonight in a critical way of <i>The Way Forward,</i> which our party introduced.  I have looked through the section dealing with transport, particularly the area dealing with B &amp; I and I do not see any variance in that from what the people are asking for at the moment.  It is stated in that section of <i>The Way Forward:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> Timely and decisive action will be needed to ensure that all services will be operated on an economic basis and the Company's cost overheads significantly reduced.</P>
    <P>That is the point which applies to Cork and is what I have been saying for the last five minutes.  I have no doubt that my colleagues in Cork, irrespective of their political affiliations, know well from the many organisations in Cork that such a service, properly structured and properly run, would be a viable proposition.</P>
    <P>Every effort has been made by the B &amp; I to downgrade the operation out of Cork.  In any development and in the creation of employment, which those of us in the Cork region are concerned about, it is not a fact that if we have not available to us the transport facilities to deliver and to export the product, we are doomed to certain failure before we begin?  Have I not shown that over the years the ferry link from Penrose Quay, Tivoli and latterly Ringaskiddy was necessary for the development of commercial life in the area?  It will not be possible for us to encourage industrialists into the area, to encourage entrepreneurs to go into commercial activity in the creation of employment if they are faced with the extra transport cost of sending containers by truck from the Cork region to Rosslare or to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Those of us who drive occasionally on the Cork road pass many trucks and container traffic going with us and going against us on that road.  If all this operation were properly managed and structured those containers could travel through the port of Cork.  If my colleagues from the Cork and Kerry area who are in Government cannot, with our help, direct this Coalition Government away from their obvious bias against the Cork region I am afraid the outrageous suggestion by a Fine Gael backbencher last week that emigration is the alternative will be only too true.  However, there is no place to emigrate to.  There should be no need to emigrate if we had the proper will and commitment to develop a long-established industrially oriented people in the Cork region.  All the efforts <Col N="993" /> of the Government are directed to the enlargement of the employment problem. I believe it was a red herring, to say the least of it, for my colleague from Cork Central to come in here tonight and give an excuse or adopt a diversionary tactic in respect of the various problems in setting up an industry in the Cork area.  He mentioned Brinny.  There is nothing wrong with that.  It is not too far from any of us but who does Deputy Allen think he is codding so far as Schering Plough is concerned?  He would need to come up with something better than that to appease the people of Cork on the matter that is the subject of this motion.  I am a member of the local authority who granted planning permission many months ago for the development of Schering Plough.  Is the Deputy not aware that only last week there was an injunction granted against that development? No amount of propaganda will distort the fact that the Coalition have allowed the B &amp; I to pull out of Cork.</P>
    <P>A number of my Kerry colleagues have put their names to this motion.  With the permission of the Chair, I am willing to give some of my time to Deputy Foley.</P>

      <P>I conclude by appealing again to the Government in this matter to ensure that there is provided from the port of Cork a service on the lines I have outlined.  We must have a service that is run efficiently.  I am confident of the viability of a properly-managed service there.  Such a service would have the full support of all interests in the Cork and Kerry regions but there must be the proper commitment and proper scheduling and so on on the part of the B &amp; I or of any other State body that might be charged with that responsibility.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice to that of my colleagues from Cork in seeking the retention of the Cork-Pembroke service on a regular round-the-year basis such as the service that has been in operation for the past ten years.  I ask that, pending a decision on those lines, a service be provided immediately by the <Col N="994" /> B &amp; I on this route for the remainder of this year.</P>
      <P>The Cork-Kerry tourist region is the biggest within the Bord Fáilte area.  It claims 33 per cent of all registered accommodation and this is made up of hotels, guesthouses, town and country homes and farm guesthouses.  The region claims 29 per cent of the overall tourist business to the country.  The direct value of this business to the region is approximately £117 million while indirect business by way of spin-off activities is estimated at about £100 million.  There are 18,000 people employed directly in the tourist industry in this region with an additional 3,000 or 4,000 people engaged in spin-off activities.  The alternative to the present service is by way of Rosslare but that would not be acceptable in any way to the people of Kerry because we could not hope that any more than about 10 per cent of visitors arriving at Rosslare would find their way to Kerry.</P>
      <P>The costly promotions undertaken by the Cork-Kerry region down through the years, and which were based on the operation of the ferry service, are now to be proved a waste of time in the event of the service not being continued.  Leading up to the general election both Fine Gael and Labour gave a commitment to this B &amp; I service.  I am asking the Government to honour this commitment because the loss of the service would be a major blow to the leading Cork-Kerry tourist region.  From a Kerry viewpoint alone the loss of the service would be a major blow both from the tourist and industrial viewpoints, especially when taken in conjunction with the recent VAT increase from 18 to 23 per cent.  The loss of the service could signal the downfall of the whole tourist business in Kerry.  Many leading hotels in Kerry are closed at the moment and indications are that because of present circumstances they may not reopen. I appeal again to the Minister to consider seriously this motion in the interest of uplifting the seriously depressed tourist industry in Cork and Kerry.</P>

      <P>When this motion was circulated I accepted it for what it was worth, having been considering this problem <Col N="995" /> since 1981 when what was happening in the B &amp; I was brought to my notice. Since then I have been a member of the various deputations to successive Ministers. I regarded this motion as a genuine effort to come to grips with the problem.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gene Fitzgerald gave a very fair assessment of the situation and he did so without rancour and without trying to score political points.  He expressed clearly his concern for the region, for the people concerned and for their jobs.  I regret, though, that Deputy Wyse saw fit to introduce a note of rancour which did not add anything to this debate.  To accuse the Minister of having had his speech prepared by an executive of B &amp; I was most unfair.  Deputies Lyons and Foley went a little further and implied that the whole closure of the B &amp; I was a Coalition plot.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I am asking the movers of the motion to accept the amendment as proposed.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputies opposite.  I am asking them to accept the amendment in the light of a note that was circulated to each member of the Cork Harbour Commissioners on 8 February last and which, referring to the recent decision of the Minister of Transport to allow the B &amp; I line to terminate the Cork-Pembroke service, went on to say that a specially convened meeting of the commissioners decided unanimously to request the Minister to meet representatives of the commissioners and other local interests in order to press for the retention of the B &amp; I Cork-Pembroke service until the end of the 1983 tourist season.  This was the group of people who came to meet Deputy Cooney as Minister, who subsequently met Deputy Wilson more recently while he was in office and the present Minister.  That is the appeal of the official Cork non-political line.  The Minister is prepared to meet this group <Col N="996" /> on 1 March, so I am asking the movers of the motion to give some cognisance to the representations of those who are led by the Cork Harbour Commissioners. The people on that side of the House know who is the present chairman of the Cork Harbour Commissioners.</P>
      <P>There has been long association with the port of Cork, stretching back 130 years.  As Deputy Lyons rightly said, during the late forties and fifties we witnessed a haemorrhage of our young people through the port of Cork but thankfully there was a turnabout; they came back as tourists.  In 1965 the Government &mdash; a Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; acquired the City of Cork Steam-packet Company because the Government, under Mr. Lemass, were of the opinion that we did not have any passenger facilities on this corridor.  Since then that company has played a vital role.  The first action of the B &amp; I company was to close the Cork-Liverpool service.  We had two ships sailing from Cork, a weekly sailing with the SS <i>Kenmare</i> and the <i>Innisfallen</i> providing a passenger service. The <i>Innisfallen</i> has been a part of Cork folklore.  Recent events have caused great concern to the people in the Cork area and other speakers have listed the likely effects of the withdrawal of this service.  I regret to say Fianna Fáil have not come up with anything that would provide an alternative service.  All they said is &ldquo;Let us bring back the ship&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be factual. During recent months there were proposals from the chairman of the B &amp; I board, Mr. Boland, and a former chairman of the Cork Harbour Commissioners, Mr. Foley.  Mr. Boland envisaged a privately run company taking over from B &amp; I.  Mr. Foley had a different proposal, that is, to set up the City of Cork Steampacket Company, a subsidiary of the B &amp; I, which is still in existence and registered but not working at the moment.  At present there is a ship tied up, the MV <i>Munster</i>, which could be put to a very good use on this route.  He asks that this ship be given for a three year <Col N="997" /> trial period.  The suggestion was that the <i>Innisfallen</i> be chosen because of its traditional links with the port.  This could be done as a subsidiary of the B &amp; I as distinct from a separate commercial undertaking.  That would prove worthwhile and I have no doubt that the people of Cork would support this venture.  I will be suggesting this to the Minister and I would ask the Deputies who tabled this motion to reconsider their decision in the light of what has been said and in view of the fact that a deputation will be meeting the Minister.  With other members of a deputation I met Deputy Wilson, then Minister, and he received us in a very courteous manner, as did other holders of that office, but nothing definite came from those meetings.  Deputy Wilson said he had decided in May not to close the B &amp; I but we did not get a decision to keep it open either.  That was very important.  This motion is having the effect the board of B &amp; I wanted, that is, that it is divisive.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers I would like to put before the Oireachtas the serious problem of the deterioration <Col N="999" /> of the transport services in the Cork area. These are recessionary times and one cannot expect the best of everything, but I seriously question the recent decision of the management of B &amp; I.  It is right that they should be questioned and the position investigated.  They have squandered millions of pounds on a hovercraft which is lying idle in Arklow at a cost of £6 million and costing the ratepayers approximately £900,000 in interest. These decisions should be very seriously questioned.</P>
      <P>One can imagine what this service meant to the Cork area, whose second largest industry is tourism.  We are now abandoned, having no ferry service.  No one can deny that the B &amp; I line gave the tourist access to the most attractive regions of West Cork and Kerry.  Without doubt, the losses suffered by the south-west region will be great when compared with the losses suffered already by B &amp; I.  I have been approached &mdash; and I am sure other Deputies in this area have, also &mdash; by the hoteliers in the Cork area whose businesses have suffered badly due to massive cancellations because of the abandoning of the ferry service.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that cutbacks are needed, but are they to be aimed at only one region?  Why are these cutbacks made in Cork?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I must put the blame on the B &amp; I management who deliberately, it would seem, ran down the Cork service which, for a period from 1976, was not only a viable proposition, but actually made money.  There are people travelling from Cork to Swansea every week, shoppers going from country to country.  I am sure some Deputies use this route.  There were good relations between the Welsh area and our south west region.  The impact of that loss, socially and economically, cannot be sufficiently stressed. <Col N="1000" /> Deputations went to the present Minister, Deputy Mitchell, and to the previous Minister, Deputies Wilson and Cooney, confirming the truth of these claims.</P>
      <P>When spending public money, our first priority must surely be ferry services, to generate economic activity in areas of greater need, such as the south-west region.  Why tolerate the abandoning of this service which is so needed by an undeveloped area, when at the same time empty boats are going from Dublin and Rosslare ports on every second trip?  This cannot be denied&mdash;the statistics are there to prove it.  There is a serious regional bias in the B &amp; I board.  Even on the Rosslare-Pembroke service they are losing heavily but are prepared to compete against Sealink services, which is utterly crazy.  We should not allow semi-State bodies to attempt to compete against existing services.</P>
      <P>I know my time is short but I ask the Minister to have a full inquiry into B &amp; I activities, to insist on the provision of a summer service for 1983 and to confirm this without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I want to let the House know that we are standing by the words of the motion which calls on the Government &mdash; not the B &amp; I &mdash; to make sure that a service is provided between Cork and South Wales.  We left it open for the port to be Swansea, Pembroke, Fishguard, or some other, but it must be Cork-South Wales, South Wales-Cork and that something must be done about the situation in 1983.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record that we reject the amendment which has neither muscle nor guts.  There is nothing in it and, therefore, we could not possibly accept it as a substitute for our substantive motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a reference to a serious loss-making situation and I will return to that in a moment.  There is a welcome for the initiative of the Minister for Transport &mdash; such initiative was very carefully concealed until this motion came before the House; we did not know anything about it&mdash;and his continuing efforts, again efforts in the dark as far as the House was concerned until we put down this <Col N="1001" /> motion, for the provision of a ferry service in 1983.</P>
    <P>There has been much pessimistic talk about the service.  I want to point out that on 2 June last I put a Bill, now an Act, through this House which authorises the share capital of B &amp; I to be increased from £35 million to £60 million and also increased by £25 million the maximum of the company's borrowings which the Minister for Finance would guarantee&mdash; from £15 million to £40 million.  We were not writing off B &amp; I.  I want to point out that it is a horrific statistical fact that between 1979 and 1981 B &amp; I lost, in industrial disputes, £5.9 million.  Now, some of those industrial disputes had nothing to do with B &amp; I and they had no responsibility for them.  I say &ldquo;some&rdquo; deliberately.  However, £5.9 million is a very considerable loss indeed, and I blame the Minister for giving global figures about B &amp; I losses and no specific losses for the Cork-Pembroke route, a most important statistic which this House should have been given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right if they are losing on the Dublin-Liverpool, Dublin-Holyhead, Rosslare-Pembroke runs &mdash; that has nothing to do with an argument for the retention of the service from Cork to Pembroke.</P>
      <P>If my memory serves me right, before I left that Department the estimated loss for the Cork-Pembroke run was £1.2 million. The House will note from that that the losses from industrial disputes alone would make up the service losses on the route from Cork to Pembroke in five years.  Five years is a very long time, in which we might expect an uplift in the tourist industry and a development of the industrial and commercial use of that link between Cork and Pembroke.</P>
      <P>From the Government side of the House there has been a heavy attack on B &amp; I itself.  I have a suspicion that this is in order to slough off responsibility from the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and concentrate the fire on the B &amp; I.  I say bluntly that the Government have the responsibility in this regard.  If they would keep the statistics which I have mentioned before their minds, they might see a reason for the retention of this service and a possibility of its coming back into profit in the not too distant future.  I know the Chairman of that board &mdash; who is a Cork man, incidentally &mdash; and he is an excellent Chairman, fully conscious of the need for efficiency in B &amp; I, of his obligation to the State, the taxpayer and the company. I shall be putting some questions later about this.  I also know that he had a scheme to tighten up the financial controls in the company on the Cork-Pembroke, as well as the Rosslare-Pembroke, Dublin-Holyhead and Dublin-Liverpool services.  I am instancing that as another point which might indicate that it is premature to stop the Cork-Pembroke services.  There will be benefit to the company when all these financial controls are brought into effect.</P>
      <P>The dedication of the workers in that company has been mentioned already by several speakers on both sides of the House, and deservedly so.  They have shown good example of dedication to the company and, as has been mentioned by some speaker one even invested his own money in the company to keep it viable. Another factor which would indicate that the Minister might have a good reason for having another look at the Cork-Pembroke route is the cost of fuel.  The fare is only 20 per cent higher than on the Rosslare-Pembroke run, although the journey is twice as long.  The cost of fuel on that service is, consequently very high. We all know, as of now, that the cost of fuel worldwide is dropping; I hope it drops and drops and drops.  I hope this Government will give the benefit to the users of the greatest percentage of that drop although we have had warning from the Minister for Finance that that may not be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the drop in the price of fuel, with the new arrangements for a tighter ship &mdash; if that is a suitable metaphor here; I am sure it is &mdash; the Dublin-Holyhead service, if it makes a profit, would also <Col N="1003" /> aid the company in general and help to sustain the Cork-Pembroke service.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee, as has been said in the course of this debate, made a number of recommendations, including the suspension of the Cork-Pembroke service in their report.  The Fianna Fáil Government accepted all of their recommendations except the one to close the Cork-Pembroke service.  I want to put that on the record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Not merely that, as well as the Bill I put through the House in early June 1982 the Fianna Fáil Government provided £9 million extra in equity for the B &amp; I line which showed a commitment to the company and an appreciation of the work they were doing.</P>
      <P>Various propositions have come into the Department of Transport with regard to this service.  There was the idea that the B &amp; I should have a sub-company, a Munster company, Munster members with a commitment to sell in the Munster region to industrial and commercial concerns, that an area should be delimited, that an area should be designated for the B &amp; I, that other B &amp; I operations should be excluded from that area, that there would be a possibility of this being a way of strengthening the commercial activities of the B &amp; I.  It is a possibility.  What this side of the House is asking for is the continuation of the service to our second biggest city in the State.  A £1.2 million loss over the whole year is not a big loss; I believe £1 million was made available by this Government to Arklow, just like that.  There are some citizens who say it is the biggest qualitatively even though it is only the second quantitatively; I am not saying whether or not I agree with that.  The big thing I want to castigate the Minister for is giving global losses and not being specific about the losses on the Pembroke service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not forget Kerry.  Deputy Foley has already made his case for <Col N="1004" /> Kerry.  I shall not go over the arguments which were very well presented by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, Deputy Wyse, Deputy Lyons and Deputy Foley and indeed by the Members who contributed from the Government side of the House.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons given for the change from Swansea &mdash; and Deputy Gene Fitzgerald when speaking lauded Swansea and told of all the advantages Swansea had &mdash; was the M4, the route to Birmingham, the advantages of its being a city and so on.  One of the reasons B &amp; I gave for pulling out of it was that the silting was fairly extensive there, that the B &amp; I themselves would be committed to a large expenditure to clear the silting, making the harbour available.  I do not know what size boats use Swansea. I presume B &amp; I were not the only company using Swansea; I do not know whether the B &amp; I, when they did pull out, succeeded in having the job done for other boats, and whether it would not be possible to go back in there.  I do not know about that, but it strikes me that we should have some information about that.</P>
    <P>On the plus side again, because there has been so much said on the negative side, the Minister in his speech indicated that the total carryings increased in the years 1980 and 1981.  In May when I was Minister, the Department and the Government decided not to discontinue the Cork-Pembroke service, we asked for monthly returns.  Again, on the specific Cork-Pembroke service we should have had the monthly returns from the Minister, when speaking, so that a case would be made, or the best case he could make for discontinuation of the service.  The Government, he said, reluctantly decided.  It does not matter a tinker's curse whether one decides reluctantly or not, once one decides it is the decision that counts and Cork is without this service and that is that.  There was no alternative, he said.  I have mentioned several factors that are very important, in particular the price of fuel.</P>

      <P>We have been told that something said on this side of the House in some way cuts across the principles we laid down in our National Economic Plan.  I submit that there is no scintilla of evidence of this.  I have been talking about a chairman who is efficient, who is conscious of his obligations to the taxpayers, conscious of his obligations to the company.  I am talking about a situation in which fuel prices are dropping.  I am talking about a situation in which five years' losses on this service could be paid for by the amount that was lost through industrial disputes between 1979 and 1981.</P>

      <P>I do not think there should be any gospel of despair; we are adhering to every little bit of our philosophy in our plans for national development.  I am saying that we are also maintaining that there is no excuse at all for the gospel of despair, of no hope, no <i>sursum corda</i> coming from the Government side in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are facing the moment of truth as far as the commitment to the retention of the service or the development of the summer service even, is concerned, and Deputy O'Sullivan from Cork city, <Col N="1006" /> Deputy Allen, and all the Deputies who have spoken, I am not going to go through them as I have very little time &mdash; will have to vote on this motion.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Transport takes his little brief over from Kildare Street into the council chamber, to the Government meeting, he should have enough votes there to sustain him.  He has Deputy Deasy, from Waterford, Minister for Agriculture, he has Deputy P. Barry, Minister for Foreign Affairs, he has the Tánaiste from Kerry, in Deputy Foley's constituency, to vote for him.  Give it another try; that is what we are asking for.  The circumstances are changing.  Ask for a commitment from the people, from the people of Cork and, if they do not give it, then kill the service in the future but do not do it in 1983.  We do not want any stunting.  The industrial and commercial growth of Cork is dependent to a great extent on its ability to export.  I visited Ringaskiddy, I was very impressed by it, and I had to argue to get money for the development.  We got £1 million which is all the Cork Harbour Commissioners wanted for this year.  The people on the far side of the House snatched that £1 million away from the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  It is a very impressive place.  The IDA have a magnificent and large site &mdash; admittedly one major industry only on it yet &mdash; right beside it.  It was all linked up to the B &amp; I and its activities in Cork.</P>
    <P>I am appealing, with all the intensity I can command, to the people, particularly from Cork, particularly to the Labour Party because people will lose jobs when this vote comes in a couple of seconds' time, to come in, create a sensation, come into the lobby with us and try and help what is in fact the second city, as some say, the second quantitatively and the first city qualitatively.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the Government will forward an integrated development programme for south west Kerry, as prepared, to the Commission of the European Communities for appropriate action including financial aid at the maximum rate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I assume that what the Deputy has in mind is the submission of the programme in question to the European Commission with a view to securing financial assistance for its implementation from the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a prerequisite for securing aid from the Regional Fund that the projects in respect of which the moneys are drawn <Col N="891" /> down should already be in receipt of Exchequer assistance.  The Community funds serve to increase the resources of the Public Capital Programme and enable additional regional development to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>In Ireland's case the whole country is regarded as one region for the purpose of Community regional policy.  The financial aid received from the Community under the quota section of the fund is used, in great part, to finance national programmes of infrastructural expenditure, the priority areas being telecommunications, roads, water supplies.  Substantial benefit accrues to all areas of the country from this expenditure and the needs of particular areas must be seen in the context of overall national priorities.</P>
    <P>Moneys are also received under the non-quota section of the Regional Fund in respect of the special Border areas programme.</P>
    <P>Given the structure of the fund and the way in which moneys are allocated, it is not possible to say which parts of the south-west Kerry proposals would be aided by the fund.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that the integrated operations envisaged by the European Community authorities give rise to certain disadvantages and are therefore not in favour of proceeding along these lines.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit on 2 December 1982 in respect of an incapacity which he attributed to an accident at work on 26 November 1982.</P>
      <P>He did not then qualify for payment of disability benefit on an interim basis pending completion of investigation of the accident in the absence of at least twenty six contributions recorded in the 1980-81 governing contribution year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 3 January 1983 his claim was governed by his contribution record in the 1981-82 contribution year.  He satisfied <Col N="910" /> the contribution conditions in that year and payment of benefit in respect of the period up to 17 January was made by cheque on 25 January.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the employers confirmed the occupational accident and injury benefit was allowed from 27 November (first day of incapacity).  His 1980-81 contribution record (52 AI Contribution) was also confirmed.  The contributions gave an underlying title to disability benefit (from November, 1982) and consequently qualified the claimant to receive pay-related benefit with his injury benefit.</P>
    <P>Pay-related benefit was awarded from 11 December 1982 the 13th day of incapacity and all benefit due in respect of the period up to 24 January 1983, the final day of certified incapacity, has now been paid.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the free telephone rental allowance scheme is to ensure that aged or disabled persons will have access to aid in an emergency. Allowances under the scheme are confined to qualified pensioners who are either living entirely alone or are living with persons who are so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to summon such aid.  In the case of two old age pensioners living together, an allowance is payable only if one of them is permanently incapacitated.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 22 July 1982 to 13 September 1982.  Payment was disallowed after that date for a period of six weeks as he failed to attend for examination by a medical referee.  He attended however on 1 October 1982 and was examined by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance and, in connection with his appeal, he was examined on 18 November 1982 by a different medical referee who also considered him to be capable of work.</P>
      <P>His case was then referred to an appeals officer for determination.  The Appeals Officer, held an oral hearing of the case at which the claimant was present. Following the hearing and having regard to the medical reports in the case, including the specialist report of 13 January 1983, the appeals officer decided that the claimant was not incapable of work during the period from 1 October 1982 to 10 January 1983 (the date of the latest medical certificate before him) and is not entitled to be paid benefit in respect of that period.  Medical evidence of incapacity from his doctor has not been received since that certifying incapacity to 10 January 1983.</P>
      <P>On review of the case it has been decided to waive the disallowance for failure to attend for the medical referee examination originally scheduled.  Payment of benefit for the period from 14 September 1982 to 30 September 1982 is, accordingly, being issued to the claimant.</P>

      <P>The first person named by the Deputy is not entitled to unemployment assistance because a qualification certificate was refused on the grounds that his means exceeded the statutory limit.

      <P>The second person named by the Deputy is not entitled to unemployment assistance on the grounds that the means assessed against him exceed the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable to him.

    <P>The third person named by the Deputy is not entitled to unemployment assistance as his qualification certificate was revoked on the grounds that by failing to furnish details of his means he failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit.

      <P>The person concerned is not qualified for unemployment benefit.  He was however in receipt of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £12.25 being the maximum rate payable to him £25.45 less means £13.20, derived from the value of board and lodging.</P>
      <P>His case was recently reviewed and the assessment of his means was reduced to £10.75 weekly.</P>
      <P>He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £14.70 being the maximum rate £25.45 less means £10.75.  Arrangements have been made for the early payment of adjusting arrears.</P>

      <P>Pay-related benefit is payable as a supplement to unemployment benefit, disability benefit and maternity allowance.  It is also payable with injury <Col N="915" /> benefit if the insured person would be entitled to receive disability benefit or maternity allowance were he/she not receiving injury benefit.</P>
      <P>Payment depends on the existence of entitlement to the flat rate benefit as indicated above and to the level of reckonable earnings in the relevant tax year.  It does not depend on the sex or marital status of the claimant.</P>

      <P>The woman concerned had been in receipt of unmarried mother's allowance from October 1973 until recently, when her allowance was terminated.</P>
      <P>Among the conditions for receipt of this allowance are that the claimant has a qualified child residing with her and she must not be cohabiting with any person as man and wife.  As a result of recent investigations, however, it came to light that this woman does not have a qualified child residing with her and that she has been living with another person as man and wife since 2 July 1981.</P>

His claim for increased pension has been investigated and referred to the local pension committee for decision.  Payment of an increase has not been recommended by the social welfare <Col N="919" /> officer as the assessment of the pensioner's means, consisting of capital, the disposal of part of which was not accepted for pension purposes, does not entitle him to pension at a higher rate than that in payment.</P>
