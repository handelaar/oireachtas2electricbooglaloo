    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he will substantially increase the penalties for which a person may be liable for the committal of <Col N="1543" /> an offence under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and in particular the penalties that can be imposed on those who kill or maim any animal which is designated as a protected species under section 23 of the Act, e.g. seals and dolphins; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The penalty levels for conviction of offences under the Wildlife Act, 1976, in relation to protected species are regarded as adequate in present circumstances. However, the various provisions of the Act, including the penalty aspects, are being kept under constant review with a view to putting forward amending proposals should such a course prove necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the maximim criminal sanction that can be imposed for killing seals, dolphins or protected species under this legislation is a fine of £500, which in no way could be regarded as a deterrent?  Would the Minister in his review seriously consider increasing the penalty provisions under this legislation in particular to extend as a possibility the sanction of imprisonment to serious breaches of the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are both monetary and non-monetary penalties attaching to offences under the Act itself.  As I said, the levels of penalties are kept under constant review and the Deputy can be assured that in the event of the Department feeling, or my feeling, that the levels are not adequate, they will be increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla  Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Mac Giolla</b> asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he is aware of the serious difficulties created for wood processors by their inability go get wood on a supply contract basis; the reason a supply contract was agreed with an American firm which is to open in Ireland; and if he will agree to supply timber to all firms on a similar basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1544" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances governing the pulpwood and saw-log processing situations are quite dissimilar.  In the case of pulpwood there are now only two major processors here, including the firm mentioned.  These firms are not competing with each other for available pulpwood supplies and their products, generally speaking, are not in competition with each other.  In such circumstances limited contractual arrangements for supply of raw material are fully warranted and indeed essential in these two instances.</P>
      <P>As regards saw-log, however, the limited and dispersed supply situation is such that it is not practical to conclude contractual arrangements for a constant supply of raw material, having regard to the large number of processors involved and the variations in their sawmilling capacity. I should add however that in an effort to guarantee some continuity of supply, the Department operate a quota system whereby sawmillers can qualify for a proportion of their large saw-log requirements on a regular basis outside the normal tender system for disposal of State-owned timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the latter part of the Minister's reply, is this a new procedure in relation to quotas from the Department or has that system been in operation for some time?  Is the Minister aware that the wood processing factory which closed down in Fermoy, Home Timber Supplies, stated that among the matters that created difficulties for them was the question of supply? The firm stated that when they were commencing operations they were promised they could get a particular size and type of wood but this was not supplied to them.  For that reason will the Minister agree that the tender system should be reviewed in certain cases so that the supply of the correct type of timber can be given on contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question I should like to state that the quota system has been in operation for a number of years.  The <Col N="1545" /> reason it was introduced was that some people in the trade failed through the tender system to get adequate supplies. In some cases, they failed to get supplies at all.  It was felt that in order to alleviate the pressure on them they should get a certain percentage of their previous year's consumption.  The last review brought this to 30 per cent.  Saw-millers who can now get 30 per cent of their previous year's consumption of saw-log can seek the remainder under the open tender system.  That is being reviewed at present and an interdepartmental committee is looking into the possibility of improving the present tender/quota system.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second question I should like to point out that the company which no longer trades did include as one of their difficulties the unavailability of raw material.  This matter is in dispute and while it may have been one reason it was very far down a long list of reasons as to why the company failed.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of some of the more important reasons why the company failed.  There is a problem with saw-log. Supply cannot meet demand and it is as simple as that.  The reason is that timber is not growing fast enough and we cannot make it grow any faster; we must await the outcome of nature in relation to the provision of timber.  The failure of the company mentioned cannot be put down to the unavailability of raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that in order to get supply of the correct type of timber they had to take timber which was not suitable for their purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal tendering system that applies is that the tenderer purchases standing timber, big and small. If a successful applicant has timber that he cannot use he can dispose of it to people who need it.  There is no problem with that.  Normally one buys a forest standing and one takes the timber as it comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that another large company have complained that the biggest single factor <Col N="1546" /> affecting their operation is the lack of timber at the proper price.  It is not that timber is not available but because other companies operating in the North of Ireland who have British Government 100 per cent capital grant-aid and labour subsidies are able to out-price them for the timber on the market.  Is the Minister aware of that?  Has the Minister any policy in relation to the fact that these companies because of the subsidies they receive are in a position to price local companies out of the market?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he will make a statement on the decision to discontinue the export refund scheme for mackerel; the efforts he is making to have the fund restored; and the proposals he has put forward to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made every effort and am continuing to explore every avenue open to me to secure a review of the decision by the EEC Commission to reduce to nil the rate of refund on frozen mackerel exports to certain third countries. I travelled to Brussels on Friday, 28 October to discuss the position personally with the President of the Commission, Mr. Thorn.  During our discussions <Col N="1548" /> Mr. Thorn indicated that the Commission decision had been taken in the light of the buoyancy of third country markets for Community mackerel exports in general but conceded that the decision had created particular problems for Ireland. Mr. Thorn said he would ask the Commission to examine possible measures which might help to ameliorate the adverse effects of the decision for Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have also consulted with BIM and industry interests as to what could be regarded as acceptable alternatives and I will be in contact with Mr. Thorn again during this week.  I should like to add that a document prepared in consultation with the exporters and BIM is being submitted to the Commission in support of our case today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the refund reduced by 10 per cent in January and if so what action was taken about that reduction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct to say that the refund rate was reduced by 10 per cent.  We protested at that time.  This took place prior to the agreement on the Common Fisheries Policy and we were given to understand, as were other member states, that this rate would be kept under constant review.  It was only towards the end of October that the review took place and this resulted in applying a nil rating from 1 November. Prior to this proposal I took the matter up with the Fisheries Commissioner, Mr. Kontogeorgis.  I presented him with a written aid memo on what would be the effect for us and expressed our strong objection to any reduction in the export refund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy should know, and I am sorry to have to refer to this again, it is not a subject matter for Council decision or Council input.  The only time it comes to Council is when proposals by the Commission are discussed by the Management Committee and if they give a negative decision or vote against the Commission proposals there is a facility for bringing that subject matter back to Council.

      <P>Is is not normal for a Minister to be critical of himself.  The industry was aware of the situation.  I have discussed on many occasions with the industry what might happen in the interim.  People in the industry made me aware of their strong objection to any further decrease in the level of subsidy on exports of mackerel and that was transmitted to the decision-makers in Brussels who are dealing with this matter. I met members in the industry last Tuesday. They understand the difficulties I am in; in fact, they are much more understanding than is the Deputy because they are aware of the technicalities involved. As I told them, every effort is and will be made to ensure that one of two things will happen; that some form of subsidy will be restored or else that some other form of compensatory measures will be introduced to make up for the loss of subsidy.  The industry is not worried as to the name that may be called.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for individual trawler skippers where they land their catches.  I must assume that landings are made at the most convenient port having regard to such factors as the location of the fishing grounds and the availability of markets and services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  It would seem they land at Derry for reasons of convenience.  In the early part of the season, as the Deputy knows, the location of the fishery is adjacent to Derry harbour and that is the most convenient harbour. Possibly that is their reason for using it.  I would point out that 8,900 tonnes of fish were landed in Derry out of a total catch of 119,000 tonnes.</P>

It was conveyed that unless minimal improvements were made Derry would take over although <Col N="1554" /> Rathmullan obviously is more convenient. Is the Minister ignoring the fact that in going up the Foyle 15 miles to Derry, totally out of their way, fishermen are also passing Greencastle which, due to silting of the existing harbour and the failure of successive Governments to extend the works at that harbour, is not capable of taking these boats?  It is wrong to suggest that this is happening because of the convenience of Derry.  It is totally inconvenient.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> I am informed by the trade interests involved that the removal of the EEC mackerel export refund will have an adverse effect on the profitability of their operations and could lead to reduced prices being paid for mackerel to the fishermen.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible, however, to provide an Exchequer subsidy to compensate for the removal of the EEC refund.  Apart from other considerations the present budgetary position would preclude the provision of such subsidy.  I would point that such subsidy would probably be in breach of EEC rules in regard to competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has pointed out that any Government subsidy might be in breach of EEC rules.  Does the Minister accept that the subsidy withdrawal will have serious repercussions on the industry in Donegal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  I discussed the matter with the processors as late as last week.  I am aware of the consequences of the removal of the subsidy in the light of contracts entered into and the importance of the mackerel catch <i>vis-á-vis</i> our overall catches.  As I have said, every effort is being made by me to salvage the position by either having the subsidy restored in full or having compensatory measures provided by the Commission to replace the loss caused by the withdrawal of the subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been references to discrimination.  Does the Minister accept that we in Ireland have been discriminated against in regard to the mackerel subsidy?  All other countries fishing for and processing mackeral have obtained the benefit of the £25 subsidy and their season has been terminated, particularly in Britain.  We are at a special loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree we are the hardest hit for the reasons mentioned by the Deputy.  Our season is now commencing. Our mackerel catch represents about 60 per cent of our total catch and 73 per cent of our total fish exports.  I therefore <Col N="1557" /> appreciate the importance of our mackerel catches and exports.  I am operating along these lines and I am impressing it on the Commission at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been reference to the possibility of a national subsidy being contrary to EEC rules.  I should like to equate that with what has been said by the Minister and Deputy Gallagher in regard to contracts having been entered into.  There have been breaches of those contracts by the withdrawal of the subsidy during our season although this did not happen in regard to any of the other EEC maritime nations.  Since the Minister is still working on either getting the subsidy restored or the provision of some compensatory measure, despite the budgetary situation and in spite of any EEC rules, a national subsidy should be given on a temporary basis for the remainder of the season from the national Exchequer in the hope that it can be recouped through the efforts of the Minister.  The season would be over before any repercussions in regard to any violation of the EEC rules might come to light.  If there would be a violation it would be on the part of the EEC who have knocked the industry, who have knocked the contracts and who have done grave damage.  If this is allowed to go on without compensation from the national Exchequer we will not have markets in the coming years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The seriousness of the position in relation to mackerel exports has not been lost on me.

      <P>Will the Minister accept that there seems to be a complete lack of policy in the EEC in relation to these matters?  The subsidy has been withdrawn in the middle of the mackerel season.  Could the Government not justify a case for making a subvention from national funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would correct the Deputy in relation to a misapprehension he may have about the subsidy.  I have been told by the President of the Commission that the subsidy has been withdrawn because the market is now a viable, buoyant one.  When the question was put if it was for reasons of saving money he denied such allegation categorically.  The Commission said it is on the basis of the market now being buoyant and viable. He also vouchsafed the information that, of course, because of fluctation in the market place this would be kept under constant review and, if remedial action was necessary, such would be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that on the fishing front it is the fishermen who will suffer most as a result of this reduction of £25?  Has he any plans, if these fishermen are unable to meet repayments to BIM, to try to alleviate the situation?  Would the Minister accept that it is not a question of buoyancy, that it is a question of the Germans, through their strength in the EEC having asked the Commission to withdraw this subsidy because most of our 70,000 to 80,000 tonnes, which up to this would have gone to Nigeria, must now go to Germany at a much lower price?  Will the Minister accept that we did not voice our dissatisfaction soon enough?  We should have done it in January but we did not do it until 26 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny that categorically. In January the Minister expressed his dissatisfaction at the reduction and was aware that the whole subsidy issue was under review.  The moment I was informed of an impending decision I took the appropriate action.  We must remember that it was a matter for the Commission <Col N="1559" /> not for the Council in which I would have an input.</P>

Maidir leis an bád farantóireachta seo go Árainn Mhór leagadh síos mar cheann de na coinníollacha go seasfadh an Stát costas iomlán an bháid ar an gcoinníoll nach mbeifí ag iarraidh fordheontas reachtúil ina dhiaidh sin.  Sin ceann de na coinníollacha.  Ní dóigh liom ag an bpointe seo &mdash; sula dtosnaíonn an seirbhís nua &mdash; go mba cheart a bheith ag iarraidh fordheontas.  Ar a laghad, beifear ag súil go mbainfear triail as an tseirbhís féachaint an mbeidh sé ábalta íoc as féin agus má bhíonn is amhlaidh is fearr.  Muna mbíonn, ansin beidh sé loigiciúil suí síos agus ceist fordheontas a phlé.  Ach ag an bpointe seo &mdash; sula dtosnaíonn an tseirbhís &mdash; ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé ceart a bheith ag iarraidh glacadh leis go mbeidh caillteanas ann ón gcéad lá.</P>

Séard a dúirt mé ná go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos fearr agus go mbeadh loigic i bhfad níos mó ag baint leis dá mbainfí triail as an tseirbhís agus taréis bliana nó dhá bhliain má bhíonn caillteanas ann sin an t-am suí síos agus an fhadhb a phlé.

    <Title>Meeting with British Prime Minister: Statement by Taoiseach.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="An Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>An Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to make a statement on the meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, in Chequers on 7 November, attended on the Irish side by the Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry.  The Prime Minister was accompanied by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, Q.C., M.P., and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Prior, M.P.</P>
      <P>I have arranged to have laid before the House a copy of the communique issued after the meeting which includes, by way of annex, a Joint Report of the Steering Committee of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council and a review of activity in relation to the Anglo-Irish Joint Studies since November 1981.</P>
      <P>The meeting took place in three parts. There was, first of all, a <i>tete-a-tete</i> between the Prime Minister and myself, which lasted for almost two hours.  Simultaneously the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs met with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  Following these separate meetings the entire group met in plenary session.  The discussions continued over a working lunch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste, Minister and I also had meetings with Mr. Kinnock, Leader of the Labour Party, Dr. Owen, Leader of <Col N="1635" /> the Social Democratic Party and Mr. Steel, Leader of the Liberal Party.  At these meetings we discussed matters of common concern, particularly the situation in Northern Ireland and recent and pending developments in the European Communities.</P>
    <P>In brief, our discussions with the Prime Minister related to Northern Ireland and other bilateral issues, the European Community and international affairs. The principal purpose of the meeting was to improve and deepen the relationship which I had originally developed some years ago.  There have already been 13 meetings at ministerial level of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council since last February.  There have also been three meetings each of the official Steering and Co-ordinating Committees.  The documents which I have laid before the House will illustrate the range of subjects which have been dealt with through this process in the time scale I have mentioned. They are a record of considerable achievement.</P>
    <P>The discussion on Northern Ireland and bilateral issues ranged widely.  I took the opportunity, as leader of my party, to brief the Prime Minister on the work of the Forum, as it has developed in public sessions and in the published documents, particularly the recent document on <i>The Cost of Violence Arising from the Northern Ireland Situation Since 1969</i>.  I have been most careful not to pre-empt in any way the conclusions of the Forum, to whose freedom of deliberation and action I attach very considerable importance.</P>
    <P>During our discussions I stressed to the Prime Minister the very real dangers arising from the sense of alienation from the institutions of Government on the part of a large minority of the population in Northern Ireland.  I urged the necessity for deep and urgent reflection on how this might be tackled.</P>
    <P>We both recognised that the challenge to our Governments is very simply to ask ourselves together &mdash; in the interests of peace and stability in this island and of relations between this country and Britain &mdash; not what we want, but what workable <Col N="1636" /> arrangements can we devise together which will give to the people of Northern Ireland what they want and what they need.  Their fundamental requirement is for stability and order. The test of any solution must be that it be realistic and answer the basic need for identification by the people with the institutions of Government which is the very basis of society.</P>
    <P>We discussed the problems facing the European Community, both at the <i>tete-a-tete</i> and at the plenary sessions.  The forthcoming European Council in Athens will be of crucial importance to the Community, which, as Deputies know, is approaching the limit of the &ldquo;Own Resources&rdquo; system of financing, and therefore finds itself inhibited not only in developing new policies but even in administering the policies which form its very foundation.  We discussed the growth in total spending of the Community and the various proposals for dealing with future financing problems.</P>
    <P>I stressed to the Prime Minister the vital importance of increasing the Community's resources and the unsatisfactory nature of current proposals from the Commission which would limit the increase in these resources to a figure likely to be exhausted in a short period of years.  The whole problem would then, of course, again have to come before the entire community in the type of confrontational way which has been visibly so damaging.  I am not suggesting that the British Government have the same perspective on this aspect of the problem but they do, at least, now know our view on it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Common Agricultural Policy I explained very clearly the nature of the burdens which the proposed super-levy would impose on the Irish economy and the fundamental damage it would do if implemented.  This would do, proportionately, to our country many times the damage that would have been done to other countries by measures which have in recent years occupied a great deal of the Community's time, and which the Community has found it essential to ameliorate.  The Community cannot function if it seeks to impose on its <Col N="1637" /> members solutions which those members find unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should perhaps comment that the proposal of the Greek Presidency with respect to the super-levy, while it recognises the existence of a special Irish problem, will not in its present form be acceptable to the Irish Government.  We shall be seeking a derogation from the proposed super-levy.</P>
    <P>The progress with the negotiations for enlargement of the Community to include Spain and Portugal and the financial and political consequences were also discussed in some detail.  Finally, I took the opportunity of raising with the Prime Minister briefly the operation of the European Monetary System.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, at the meeting with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, expressed Irish concern in relation to discharges from the nuclear reprocessing plant at Windscale.  This matter is shortly to be the subject of a special inquiry by the British Government and they have noted our concern.</P>
    <P>In relation to international affairs, we had a substantial discussion on the situation in the Lebanon and also discussed the problems throughout the Caribbean and Central America.</P>
    <P>I went to London with the objective that we should lay the foundation for dialogue on ways and means to achieve peace and stability in Northern Ireland in the interests of this island and of a constructive and friendly relationship between the peoples of our two countries, I believe that this objective was achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to comment on what was essentially an non-event.  There seems to have been no substance at all to the meeting between the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach and we are clearly no closer to a solution of the Northern Ireland problem. In fact, I read with some dismay a leader in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>&mdash; I am not too sure how accurate it is &mdash; but it says, in so many words, that none of this amounts, of course, to an answer to the Northern Irish question which does not <Col N="1638" /> appear to have been discussed in any detail at yesterday's meeting.  I trust the Taoiseach will discount that particular report, if it can be discounted.</P>
      <P>Last week I openly questioned the point of this meeting yesterday because it seemed to be a question of having a meeting for a meeting's sake.  The private meeting seems largely to have consisted of a monologue from the Taoiseach and I quote what the Taoiseach said in <i>The Times</i> of London:</P>
      <P>It was an exposition by me rather than an active discussion between us.</P>
      <P>There is no indication that he made the slightest impression on the British Prime Minister or that there has been the slightest change in her position.  Indeed, when the Taoiseach was questioned on that very point at the press conference yesterday he had, unfortunately &mdash; and, I thought, somewhat embarrassingly &mdash; to evade the question entirely.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is quoted as speaking about a return to the warmth and positiveness of two years ago.  The only thing I can say about that is: Taoiseach, come off it.  I do not know about the warmth, because I was not there, but I certainly do know that any single member of the Irish public looking at the television press conference last night could not have identified one single positive in anything the Taoiseach said.  Indeed, watching that press conference on television, one had to be conscious of a total lack of substance and an entire preponderance of vague generalities and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Taoiseach's objectives going to the meeting were relatively modest but, even allowing for that, it is seriously disappointing that the communiqué contains no acknowledgement by the British Government of the importance or potential value of the Forum, still less any endorsement of it.  Here let me say that I acknowledge that the Taoiseach was scrupulously careful in talking about the Forum and describing it as having been established by the four parties concerned. I appreciate his doing that on that public occasion.  However, in that communiqué there was no joint commitment to finding a political solution even <Col N="1639" /> over a period of years.  All the communiqué states is that &ldquo;They expressed their deep concern about continuing violence and their joint determination to take all possible means to end it&rdquo;.  <i>The Irish Press</i> pointed out this morning that, as far as the British Government are concerned, this means a joint commitment to a security solution.  I would have thought that everybody by now accepts that to search for a security solution in isolation and without any political progress is entirely futile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the communiqué amounts to.  On the Taoiseach's own account there was no reference in the discussion to an Anglo-Irish parliamentary institution, for instance, or to any suggestion that any new institutions might be proposed by the Forum.  The only subject that appears to have been discussed in any depth was the alienation of a section of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  I think it would have been the Taoiseach's duty to press home to the British Prime Minister just how much violence has cost this country, as illustrated graphically by the Forum report on that subject last week.  That report showed that we are paying four times as much per head on security as Britain is, about £134 million alone this year.  That report also showed that the direct cost of violence and the economic cost to us came to over £2 billion since 1969, while some £9.5 billion was the cost to the British Exchequer.  It is, of course, a matter for the British public to say whether they chose to go on pouring out these vast sums of money to support the <i>status quo</i> in Northern Ireland.  However, everybody knows that in our present economic situation it will be increasingly difficult to carry these costs and to justify them to the Irish taxpayer if there is no clear indication that the British Government share our anxiety and determination to secure a political solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief claim made for the meeting has been that it has re-established normal Anglo-Irish relations.  I do not believe <Col N="1640" /> that Anglo-Irish relations are any more normal than they were the day before yesterday.  There was a noticeable lack of conviction in the Taoiseach's statement when he was talking about that aspect. The evidence produced that there has been a series of inter-governmental meetings since November 1981 is a bit thin.  I note that no fewer than three of those 20 meetings listed took place in May 1982 when Anglo-Irish relations were supposed to be at the lowest ebb ever.</P>
    <P>However, underlying all those generalities about restoring good relations and putting them back on course is this subservient innuendo that we were wrong to assert our own independent policies at the time of the Falklands war.  I want to reject that snide suggestion.  We have every right &mdash; indeed, it is our duty &mdash; to take our own independent view of that conflict and to assert that view and to act in accordance with the principles in international affairs to which we have always adhered.  In my view Anglo-Irish relations can never be normal as long as Britain maintains a presence in Ireland against the opposition of four-fifths of the Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way to establish real normality is for both Governments to come together and adopt a joint approach leading towards a resolution of the problem.  No sign of a joint approach emerged from yesterday's meeting and I think the Taoiseach must acknowledge that.  The Taoiseach appears to have radically modified and watered down the approach adopted by him during the last general election.  He said on 18 November 1982:</P>
      <P>Complete and radical rethinking of British policy is now needed and needed quickly if the situation is to be retrieved from a drift towards chaos.  It must be the purpose of the Government elected to office on 14 December next to secure from the British Government a recognition of the need for such a radical revision of its policies while there is yet time to save the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1641" /> It is quite clear from the communique and the Taoiseach's press conference that there was no sense of urgency yesterday. The Taoiseach actually spoke of a relaxed atmosphere.  Did the Taoiseach impress on the British Prime Minister the need to revise radically British policy on Northern Ireland as he promised the electorate he would in November 1982?  The Taoiseach and the Government in their dealings with the British Government must avoid anything that smacks of the junior partner attitude.  We need not make too much of the point, but yesterday's meeting, for instance, should have been held in Dublin; and to me and to many of my colleagues the Government seem to be adopting an approach on a number of issues determined more by British policy needs than by the merits of the issues themselves.  Is there any reciprocation of this attitude, such as an all-eventful meeting at Chequers?  I see a danger in all this that this Government will sacrifice our position and interests in some areas without any return whatsoever. I note, and I cannot help mentioning with some interest and cynical amusement, that the Taoiseach's new bible on Northern Ireland has become the speech of the Minister for Justice to the British-Irish Association.  This presumably superseded the speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 9 March in Limerick.</P>
    <P>On the economic side, of course I welcome the conclusion of the major initiative launched by Fianna Fáil in 1980 and brought to a provisional conclusion in 1982, and I refer to the supply of Kinsale gas to the North, which is an excellent development which should in the course of time be appreciated and should contribute greatly to better relations between the two parts of the island.  I am very glad also that the Taoiseach made reference to the problem of the pollution of the Irish Sea from Windscale.  That is increasingly engaging the minds of our people and very real, not fanciful, worries are entertained about it.  The situation there needs to be investigated fully.</P>
    <P>The super-levy and other EEC matters seem to have been discussed at some length.  It was not clear, however, that the Taoiseach had won any understanding <Col N="1642" /> in practical terms for our position. Indeed, the results from Ireland's diplomatic initiatives on the super-levy seem to have been very slight so far.  I note that in the European publications concerning Community discussions and the lead-up to the Athens Summit Irish problems are rarely referred to, and when they are referred to no indication of the Government's outright opposition comes through.  The Government's negotiating tactics &mdash; yesterday's meeting fits into that pattern &mdash; have not been singularly successful to date.  First of all, there was the Taoiseach's over-optimism that the threat had been defeated at the Stuttgart Summit, when in fact the onslaught was just about to commence.  The result of his meeting with Mr. Papandreou seems to have been minimal, with the proposal yesterday to impose a 1983 limit on Irish dairy production instead of an 1981 limit. I quote from the Taoiseach's own communique, page 5, where he said:</P>
    <P>In passing I should perhaps comment on the proposal of the Greek President with respect to the super-levy which, while it recognised the existence of a special Irish problem, will not in its present form be acceptable to the present Irish Government.</P>
    <P>So much for the journey to Athens.  I could be cynical and ask the Taoiseach &ldquo;Was your journey really necessary?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There must also be, I am afraid, some suspicions in our minds, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has not taken any action so far to disabuse our minds of those suspicions, as to why exactly the meeting with Chancellor Kohl was called off.  Potentially that was an important visit.</P>
    <P>Nothing in the nature of our national interest is set out in this.  It is a strange situation when one reflects on it to find that our nearest neighbour is prepared to take no account whatsoever of our national interest in these matters.  It should not be forgotten that there is an imbalance in our trade.  Last year it was an imbalance of £1 billion.  In other words, their exports exceeded our imports by roughly that amount.  In the first eight months of this year the figure <Col N="1643" /> was £630 million.  The Taoiseach could surely have persuaded the British Prime Minister to pay some regard to our economic life remembering that anything that we might win in Brussels on the agricultural front would benefit Northern Ireland farmers just as much as it would benefit our farmers.</P>
    <P>Again I go back to <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> and to the sentiments expressed there.  I am not too sure how much <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> represents official British Government thinking but what I want to draw attention to is something the Minister for Foreign Affairs may also regard as of some significance:</P>
    <P>Why, then, is a roughly amicable relationship between Britain and the Republic to be so strongly desired? Essentially because such a relationship helps to isolate and discourage the IRA and also because it powerfully assists Britain in presenting the case for her Ulster policy to the outside world and particularly the United States.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make too much of that but it is something that should be kept in mind in deciding, and this is something I have been arguing for some time, whether or not Summit meetings of yesterday's kind should be held at all.  All in all, I believe very little was achieved yesterday and I doubt very much if that very little will lead anywhere.  Meetings like that held yesterday produce nothing and lead nowhere and because of that the course of events here will be dictated by others outside the political and constitutional arena in which event the position in Northern Ireland will probably be exacerbated rather than ameliorated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's statement has not given the House much more than what was in the communiqué.  The only expression of concern was that voiced by the Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment.  He expressed concern in relation to the threat of nuclear war. It is significant that Mrs. Thatcher was not present then and we can only conjecture what she said when she heard about it.  She probably thought, as she did in <Col N="1644" /> regard to the Minister for Defence the other day, that he had a colossal cheek.</P>
      <P>Concern was not expressed upon other areas either.  The Taoiseach mentioned this, expressed that and said something else but expressions of real concern were conspicuous by their absence.  It is extraordinary that only two bodies are mentioned neither of which has any parliamentary or statutory function whatsoever. First, there is the New Ireland Forum which has no responsibility to this House, was not set up by the House and does not have to report to the House. Secondly, there is this rather extraordinary new body Encounter set up by we do not know whom, responsible to nobody but apparently of some consequence because both the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach went to the trouble of having a separate section on that.  I refer to section 5 of the communiqué. This is an extraordinary group and I am sure all of us will now be running around trying to find out who they are, who started them off and what influence they have on the British Government and the Taoiseach that they should be given this extraordinary position in the communiqué. The real point is that neither group has any parliamentary or statutory basis whatsoever and are, therefore, of no consequence.  There is no mention of the Northern Ireland Assembly which has authority from the British Government. I am not sure what the Taoiseach's position is on it.  He refused to recognise it and no part of the meeting was devoted to a discussion on whether or not it should be strengthened or abolished, have no power, or more power.  There was no pressure that something should be done and there is no reference of any kind to it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to neutrality it is a matter of concern that the Taoiseach does not seem to have emphasised our independent neutral role in foreign policy.  It is very important that that should be clearly understood.  It is our position.  It is our policy.  It is something that must be recognised. We intend to adhere to it.  It must never become a bargaining point in relation to Irish unity or the Northern Ireland problem.  Neutrality is a mark of our freedom <Col N="1645" /> and independence.  We have a free and independent foreign policy.  I am sure &ldquo;Maggie&rdquo; was not displeased at what the Taoiseach said in relation to Grenada because what he said was exactly in accordance with what she said.  That is a further indication of our failure to honour our independence in foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell too much on the statement because it is not of any great significance.  The meeting has not achieved anything practicable.  On the EEC I note the Taoiseach did express concern on what appears to be the joint strategy of the United Kingdom and Germany to alter the fundamental purpose of the EEC and make it some type of supranational free market area in which that would be abolished together with social and regional units and the EEC would be a market area for the benefit of the industrial powers.  That appears to be the strategy behind many present developments. I hope that the Taoseach expressed concern on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income and Capital) (Swiss Confederation) Order, 1983.</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on the 27th day of April, 1983.</P>
      <P>The present double taxation Convention with the Swiss Confederation was signed on 8 November 1966 and was ratified on 16 Feburary 1968.  For reasons which I will explain later, it has become necessary to amend this convention and a protocol to this effect was signed on 24 October 1980 by the Minister for Foregin Affairs on behalf of the Irish Government and the Swiss Ambassador to Ireland on behalf of his Government.  A White Paper containing the text of the protocol, as signed, was subsequently laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Foregin Affairs.</P>
      <P>Under the Income Tax Act, 1967, an arrangement with a foreign Government to afford relief from double taxation will have force of law in Ireland provided the Government makes an order accordingly. Before such an order can be made, it must be laid in draft form before Dáil Éireann and a resolution approving it passed by the House.</P>
      <P>A draft order to give the force of law to the present protocol was laid before the last Dáil on 11 June 1982 but had not been approved when the 23rd Dáil was dissolved.  The draft order has since been redated and was laid before the present Dáil on 27 April 1983.  It contains in its schedule the text of the amending protocol and an explanatory memorandum which sets out the effects of the protocol has been circulated.  Copies of the original convention are also available in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Swiss Federal Council have approved the protocol and the Swiss Confederation <Col N="1665" /> are now ready for the exchange of instruments of ratification as provided for in Article VIII (1) of the protocol.</P>
    <P>The protocol provides for revisions in the arrangements for the avoidance of double taxation of income and capital between the Swiss Confederation and Ireland.  Such revisions were made necessary mainly as a result of the introduction in Ireland of the imputation system of company taxation under the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.  The opportunity has also been taken to update definitions to bring them into line with the double taxation conventions entered into by this country since the present convention with Switzerland was signed in 1966.  Regard was also had to the revised Model Double Taxation Convention approved by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1977.</P>
    <P>I should now like to draw the attention of Deputies to the more significant provisions of the protocol.  Article III of the protocol inserts a new Article 3A in the convention which deals with the matter of residence or fiscal domicile.  Questions of residence are to be decided under the law of each country and in the event of both countries claiming residence on this basis, certain tests are provided for to enable an individual to be regarded, for the purposes of the convention, as a resident of one of the countries only.  This article also provides that where a person other than an individual, for example, a company, is resident in both countries, that person shall be deemed to be a resident of the contracting country in which its place of effective management is situated.</P>
    <P>Article IV substitutes a new Article 9 in the convention dealing with the treatment of dividends.  The new article provides for partial payment by the Revenue Commissioners of the tax credit in respect of Irish dividends received by Swiss portfolio investors, that is, investors with a less than 25 per cent voting power in the company paying the dividend. The tax credit is not payable in the case of a direct investor, that is, a Swiss investor with at least 25 per cent shareholding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" /> Swiss dividends received by an Irish resident will be subject to Swiss withholding tax of 15 per cent in the case of portfolio investors and at the rate of 10 per cent in the case of direct investors. As long as Ireland does not pay the tax credit to Swiss direct investors, the Swiss withholding tax in the case of direct investors will remain at 10 per cent rather than the 5 per cent which is normal in Swiss agreements with other countries.</P>
    <P>Article VI substitutes a new article for Article 22 of the convention and continues to ensure, as under the existing convention, that the benefit of Irish tax incentive reliefs is substantially preserved for Swiss investors in Ireland.  In particular, it preserves the benefit of the Irish tax incentive reliefs for a Swiss company with a branch in Ireland qualifying for such relief, as well as the benefit of those reliefs for Swiss parent companies having at least a 20 per cent holding in an Irish subsidiary.</P>
    <P>Article VIII provides that the protocol shall enter into force upon the exchange of instruments of ratification between the two countries.</P>
    <P>The protocol to the existing convention ensures that the benefit of our tax incentives for Swiss investors continues to be preserved, updates our arrangements with the Swiss Confederation for the avoidance of double taxation and brings those arrangements into line with international practice generally.</P>
    <P>I recommend that Dáil Éireann approve the draft order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this agreement and have no hesitation in giving our approval to the motion.  The agreement updates the taxation arrangements between Ireland and Switzerland.  As all Members are aware, Switzerland is a very important financial centre, in many ways perhaps one of the most important in the world.  Therefore, it is desirable that the flow of investment to here from Switzerland should be facilitated in any way possible. To that extent in so far as this agreement will facilitate to some extent investment here it is to be welcomed.  I should like to ask the Minister one question. I assume that the agreement applies <Col N="1667" /> exclusively to the private sector and am I correct in thinking that, as far as Exchequer borrowing is concerned, the arrangements that have obtained up to now will continue to apply, namely that Swiss investment in Exchequer borrowings here would be paid free of reduction of Irish tax as heretofore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement applies to the taxation of individuals by the two countries and, in particular, to the taxation of individuals who have taxable income arising in both countries.  As to the question of Swiss investment in Irish Government paper &mdash; I believe that is what the Deputy has in mind &mdash; the payment of dividends on such Irish Government paper would depend on the particular arrangements under which the funds are borrowed.  That would depend on the actual formula used.  If the holders are individual taxpayers the dividends will be paid in Switzerland and, therefore, the income will fall to be taxed in Switzerland. The question of double taxation arises only if a national or resident of one member state has an income arising also in another member State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is normally the position that on Exchequer borrowings we pay the dividends without deduction of tax to investors from abroad.  Am I correct in thinking that will continue to apply in the case of welcome investments in Irish public securities from Switzerland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is being very helpful to me.  My question is a simple one.  If a Swiss private citizen, bank or financial institution invests in what the Minister calls Irish Government paper but which I should prefer to call an Irish Exchequer loan, will the situation continue to obtain that as a normal rule the Irish Government will pay the dividend to the Swiss or any outside investor without the deduction of Irish tax on that dividend?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to authorise a special contribution of £2,076,667 by the Irish Government to the International Development Association.</P>
      <P>The association, which is an affiliate of the World Bank, was founded in 1960 has over 130 member countries.  Its role is to provide loans on highly concessionary terms to member governments in the poorest of the developing countries to help them to develop their economies. The loans made by the World Bank itself, which also go to public sector entities, are on commercial terms.  The other affiliate of the bank, the International Finance Corporation, concentrates on private sector firms and makes equity investments as well as providing loan funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> Some 90 per cent of the association's lending goes to countries with a <i>per capita</i> income of US$475 or less.  The lending terms reflect the extreme difficulties that the poorest countries face in meeting any loan obligations.  They provide for interest-free loans for 50 years, with capital repayments starting after ten years. There is a small service charge of 0.75 per cent a year and a fee of 0.5 per cent a year on loan amounts committed but awaiting disbursement.</P>
    <P>Most of the projects financed by the association are aimed directly at improving the conditions of the poorest groups in the populations of the countries concerned. The projects must be financially and economically viable.  They must meet the same standards of viability as are required by the World Bank whose own lending, as I have indicated, is undertaken on commercial terms.</P>
    <P>The association at present commits some $3½ billion annually in loans.  It is one of the largest providers of concessional aid to the poorest countries.  Its role is particularly important at present because of the hardship these countries have been undergoing as a result of the world recession.  The stagnation in world trade, combined with commodity prices which fell for a long period, has hit their external earnings and increased further their dependence on concessional external aid of the kind provided by the association.</P>
    <P>Lending by the association is largely in Africa south of the Sahara and in South Asia.  The demand for loans has, so far, always exceeded the supply of available resources.  The association has had, therefore, to ration its money carefully. In doing so, it takes four main criteria into consideration: the poverty level in member countries; the creditworthiness of the prospective borrower; the economic performance of the prospective borrower; the availability of projects suitable for IDA financing.</P>
    <P>The pattern of the sectors within countries favoured for association loans has changed over time, in response to the needs of borrowers and changes in development thinking.  In the association's early years it was assumed that growth <Col N="1670" /> would follow once an economy's basic infrastructure was in place.  Thus, the association concentrated largely on activities ranging from investments in railways and roads to investment in ports and power plants.  It was assumed also that poverty would be reduced and income disparities narrowed as an automatic consequence of industrialisation.  Both these sets of assumptions proved to be simplistic.</P>
    <P>Early efforts at industrialisation failed to generate sufficient employment and resulted in a neglect of agriculture.  As food deficits increased and payments imbalances mounted, it became clear that agricultural production was indeed a key development priority.  In response, the association increased its lending in the agricultural and rural development sectors. At present over 40 per cent of the association's total lending is in these sectors compared to a figure of only about 20 per cent in earlier years.  Basic infrastructure must, of course continue to receive substantial support and accounts for some 30 per cent of total lending. Most of the balance of lending is spread over such sectors as industry, education and health.  The association also devotes about 7 per cent of total lending to loans that are not related to specific projects but that are designed to assist countries in carrying out more general adjustment of their economies.</P>
    <P>The association's resources are obtained in a number of ways.  By far the most important way is by periodic replenishments in which additional resources are provided mainly by the richer member countries, known as Part I members. A small number of its other members, the poorer member states &mdash; Part II members &mdash; also participate in the replenishments. The total number of donor countries at present is 33.  The funds are provided by these donors on a grant basis and are not repayable.  The total financial resources of the association, as at June 1983, comprised, in round figures, initial subscriptions amounting to $1 billion, transfers from the World Bank of $2 billion and proceeds of replenishments amounting to $26 billion.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the explanatory memorandum <Col N="1671" /> circulated with the Bill, Ireland joined the association on its foundation in 1960, and subscribed $3 million to the initial capital.  We did not contribute to the first or second of the three-yearly replenishments, but we made a contribution of $4 million to the third replenishment. This was on a voluntary basis, as Ireland was still a Part II member at that time.  When Ireland became a Part I member in 1973, it was accepted that this would involve a continuing commitment to contribute towards the association's financing.  As a Part I member Ireland agreed to contribute £3.1 million to the fourth replenishment in 1973, £5.8 million to the fifth replenishment in 1977 and £6.2 million to the latest sixth replenishment in 1980.</P>
    <P>The sixth replenishment was negotiated on the basis that it would meet the association's funding requirements for the three-year period from mid-1980 to mid-1983.  However, the USA &mdash; the largest donor, which had agreed to contribute 27 per cent of the replenishment total of $12 billion over the three years &mdash; later indicated that as a result of action taken by Congress it would have to phase its contribution to the replenishment over a four-year period.</P>
    <P>When the USA refused despite pressure from other donor countries to revert to three years, most of the other donors decided that, as an exceptional measure in order to ensure that the association's activity could be maintained at a worthwhile level, they would adhere to the originally agreed three-year phasing of their contributions.</P>
    <P>The non-USA donors also decided that they would make additional special contributions in the fourth year, that is the year from mid-1983 to mid-1984.  In the absence of the special contributions the association's funding for the year would consist only of the remaining part of the USA's contribution &mdash; which would imply a drastic reduction below the association's normal annual level of activity. The special contributions will have the effect of extending the sixth replenishment to a fourth year without any additional contribution from the USA.  This <Col N="1672" /> procedure was accepted reluctantly by donors as being the option least detrimental to the association's operations.  It is hoped that after this fourth year the seventh replenishment &mdash; currently being negotiated &mdash; will come into effect.  This would mean that the usual three-year replenishment cycle would be resumed.</P>
    <P>Agreement was reached on the conditions to apply to the special contributions and on the amount to be borne by each donor country participating in the arrangement.  The results were incorporated in a draft report and resolution approved by the executive board of the association.  It is expected that all the non-USA donors will participate and that the special contributions will enable the association to maintain its activities in 1983/84 at about the level of recent years.</P>
    <P>In general, each participating donor's share consists of one-third of its total contribution to the sixth replenishment. In Ireland's case this gives a contribution of £2,076,667.  The other donor countries contributing to this operation comprise basically all our fellow EEC member states, the other main western developed countries, except the USA, some of the richer Middle East states and some of the more advanced of the developing countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.</P>
    <P>Under the agreed arrangements, the special contributions will be made available through either one of two mechanisms: a Fiscal Year 84 Account or a Special Fund.  A donor may choose whichever mechanism it prefers.  The association has been informed that Ireland would propose to participate in the Fiscal Year 84 Account.  Contributions to that account will add to the general resources of the association, and the account is considered by the majority of donors to provide the best means of preserving continuity in funding.  The contributions to the Special Fund, on the other hand, will not be part of the general resources of the association.  The fund will be a more limited operation parallel to, though administered by, the association and involving initially only seven donors.</P>
    <P>As is the case for normal replenishments, <Col N="1673" /> donor countries have the right initially to substitute non-interest-bearing demand notes for the amount of their special contribution.  The notes, denominated in the member's currency, are to be deposited in one instalment during the year to mid-1984.  Cash payments on foot of the notes will arise over the years 1984 to 1992.  The rate at which cash payments are called depends on the progress made in implementing the projects financed by the special contributions. Calls in the first two years will be small.  I expect the bulk of these payments in fact will not fall to be made until the years 1986-1990.  Calls on contributors to make payments will be broadly in proportion to their shares in the special contributions.</P>
    <P>It is of interest to note in this context that Ireland is making actual cash payments of nearly £2 million to the association in the present year.  These payments are on foot of commitments which we entered into in earlier years in respect of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth replenishments. Cash payments will continue to grow in future years.  These payments count, as will the payments under the special contribution arrangements, as part of our national offical development assistance programme.  It is evident that the payments currently are a significant element in that programme.</P>
    <P>Ireland traditionally has been a strong supporter of the association which has been widely recongnised as one of the most effective development agencies, providing not only financial resources but also technical know-how and advice for recipient countries.  The special contributions meet the particular circumstance of a one-year hiatus in the association's funding in 1983/84.  In the ordinary course of events, if this hiatus had not arisen, we would be making a contribution this year in any case under the seventh replenishment.</P>
    <P>I should add that at this year's annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, which I attended in Washington in September, a great deal of concern was expressed about the recent difficulties in the financing of the Association.  It is to <Col N="1674" /> be hoped that the USA, which has played a big part in building up the association as an effective aid instrument, will be able to agree on an adequate and speedy seventh replenishment, so as to remove uncertainties about the association's future.  The negotiations will be resumed at a meeting in Washington on 8/9 December.</P>
    <P>It is essential, at a time of recession and of debt problems which have and a particularly serious adverse effect on the developing countries, that the future financing of the association should be placed on a sound footing.  The various multilateral financing institutions, especially the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, have a vital role to play in promoting financial stability and in helping to foster economic growth, in the interests not only of the developing countries but also of the developed countries.  There is increasing recognition of the interdependence between all our economies.</P>
    <P>Ireland's basic membership of the association is covered by the International Development Association Act, 1960.  As in the case of normal replenishments, the legislation to authorise our special contribution takes the form of an amendment to that Act.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has played an honourable part as a donor country to the association since 1960 and we will continue to play that part, which represents a substantial portion of our assistance to countries requiring it.  This is a contribution which we have never welched on and which we will continue to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill arises because of a temporary hiccup in the actual funding until next year, caused by the US seeking to change the cycle from three years to four years. I share the Minister's concern that though this temporary measure is essential to bridge the funding until 30 June next, this sort of <i>ad hoc</i> approach will be abandoned at the meeting of the association scheduled for next month.  Obviously it is important that the cyclical replenishment <Col N="1675" /> by donor countries should be resumed so that we will not have this differentiation or separation in the cycle of a number of donor countries and the US.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the US is the major contributor, to the extent of 27 per cent, by far the largest donor, but it is greatly in the interest of everybody in the developing world, from the US down, to ensure that developed countries, particularly those mainly involved as recipients from this fund in the southern part of Africa and Asia, would also contribute. That is the main theme that runs through the Brandt Report which, understandably, tends to be forgotten in a period of recession, when developed countries have their own exchequer and budgetary problems.  However, the basic message of that report should not be forgotten.  It would be a mistake if we in the developed world forgot the need there is in the developing world and that there must be a realistic transfer of resources to the developing world, particularly in the southern hemisphere.  Unless there is a very real and meaningful transfer of resources there, divergences will grow. Those divergences can only give rise to very serious trouble on two fronts.</P>
    <P>It can give serious rise to trouble on the economic and financial front as there will be countries in the Southern Hemisphere deteriorating in regard to purchasing power and capacity to develop and thereby will not be in a fit position to be markets for the developed world.  That is putting it on a strict economic basis.  It is of great economic value to the developed world to have the developing world developing substantially so that by reason of investment inputs into the Southern Hemisphere that part of the globe can develop an infrastructure, an agricultural arm, an industrial arm, social development and a gradual raising of the standard of living which can make it a market place in the future for higher technological exports which inevitably will flow from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere.</P>
    <P>On the market place argument alone, which is mentioned in the Brandt Report, <Col N="1676" /> there is an overwhelming argument, looking at it in medium and long term, to provide for a substantially greater transfer of resources than is envisaged.  It is very short thinking to go at this whole problem in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  It is disappointing to see that this sort of <i>ad hoc</i> approach has arisen in the current year. I know the difficulties involved, which I hope will be resolved at the conference next month.  I hope we can renew adequate replenishments through the National Development Association on a regular organised cyclical basis of three years, four years or whatever.  I hope that there can be positive expectations so that constructive planning can take place to ensure that the transfer of resources can be done on a reasonably medium term or long term basis.</P>
    <P>It is highly unsatisfactory that an agency such as this should be subjected &mdash; I know this is necessary &mdash; to this burden of having to have legislation of this kind passed in our Parliament and I am sure it is being passed in the parliaments of all the donor countries &mdash; to deal with this situation merely to get over a hump for the purpose of enabling funds to flow only until 30 June next.  I know it is important to do it in order to achieve just that, but it is not good enough for a situation involving an association which has done such magnificent work over the past few years and that is participating in a very practical way in the sort of transfer of resources from the northern part of the globe to the southern part of the globe, which is a central theme of the Brandt Report.</P>
    <P>Apart from the economics involved in the transfer of resources the other more important aspect which makes it imperative for the developed world to continue this transfer of resources is on the social and political side.  If divergences in regard to standards of living are allowed to develop further, if the poor in the Southern Hemisphere are allowed to become poorer and if development does not take place and population continues to expand like it is in those areas, we are creating a classical revolutionary situation.  We are leading to world unrest, political unrest and the sort of ideological struggle <Col N="1677" /> between sections of the world which can only be aggravated unless there is a real and meaningful co-relationship of progress to some degree between all parts of the world.  Any reluctance or fall back by the developed world in regard to its aid programmes can lead to the disadvantage in practical economic terms of the developed world by depriving itself of a market and, looking at it at its bleakest, the gradual overwhelming of the Third World by a huge deprived population emanating from the southern part of this world who will not live indefinitely in that sort of deprived situation, making for enormous political and ideological upheavals in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>That is why we have played an honourable part in our contributions over the years to the association.  I welcome our efforts, along with those of the other donor countries who have come together, in ensuring that the replenishment is maintained at last year's level, although I do not think that is good enough, but at least it gets over the hump.  I wish the Minister and the other donor countries well in reaching some agreement on the matter at the conference next month.  I hope that the United States, as the major donor country, which cannot be forgotten, will participate with the other donor countries in ensuring some rational cyclical funding arrangements that can continue for a predictable period ahead and guarantee the sort of transfer of resources that will meet the very important and fundamental objectives involved in ensuring such a transfer of resources to the southern half of this globe and thereby meet the requirements I have just referred to and avoid the type of dangers which inevitably will arise unless there is the type of real transfer of resources envisaged in the Brandt Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am just making a few preliminary remarks before I get into my speech.  I am reacting to what Deputy Lenihan said.  He supported our efforts in development co-operation generally. In fact, when I originally mooted the idea of establishing an all-party Joint Oireachtas Committee to deal with this whole area, that was one of my fundamental reasons, because I felt the best way of making progress in the area of development co-operation was to establish an all-party consensus.  The views expressed by Deputy Lenihan and the underlying philosophy in his speech are very much in accord with our outlook.  I believe that through the all-party committee we will have an opportunity of developing this underlying philosophy and that we will have an Irish approach in relation to development co-operation &mdash; not a Fine Gael approach, a Labour approach or a Fianna Fáil approach, but an Irish approach.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the humanitarian approach in our development co-operation efforts but Deputy Lenihan has rightly broadened the scope and referred to the other issues.  Of course there is the issue of the economic approach and the question of interdependence figures largely.  I would agree also with the remarks that were made in the political context.  It is clear that unless the developed world takes fully its responsibility towards the Third World, there will be a situation of further destabilisation in that area, a situation of revolution and of coup in various countries.  There would possibly be a general destabilisation in the Third World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small nations such as ours who have such interest in international peace and stability cannot but be affected by such a prospect.  If one looks at the history of the past ten or 20 years, one finds that a huge proportion of the various conflicts that have been experienced in that time, have been in the Third World.  Undoubtedly, the state of underdevelopment in those countries and the problems resulting <Col N="1679" /> from that situation have contributed in large measure to that political instability.</P>
    <P>I speak in favour of the Bill and I endorse the statement of the Minister for Finance.  As Minister of State with specific responsibility for Irish relations with the developing countries, I have a special interest in the adoption of the Bill which is designed to enable the International Development Association to continue their activities during their fiscal year, I July 1983 to 30 June 1984.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has outlined the technical circumstances which have made the Bill necessary and also the financial problems facing the International Development Association and which have led us, together with most other donors, to make this additional extraordinary contribution to the organisation. Those less familiar with the international development organisations may ask, and not unreasonably, why we should give more money to any international organisation at a time of severe financial restraint at home.  This raises fundamental questions for giving assistance to developing countries, questions which go perhaps beyond the scope of this debate.</P>
    <P>At the outset I mentioned that there are other factors but I wish to deal here with the humanitarian aspect of the help. If we consider those countries that are being helped by the international development associations, we cannot deny that their problems are much worse than ours, that we are so much better off than they and that at the very least we have a moral obligation to help them.  Sometimes statistics pass over people's heads but there are times when it is necessary to keep repeating figures in the hope that they will penetrate.  In the Third World today there are 800 million people living in absolute poverty.  In the context of my responsibility, I am asked from time to time why we would not mend the potholes at home before giving thought to problem abroad.  It is essential always that we continue to make the effort so that people will put the position in perspective and realise the difference <Col N="1680" /> between not being able to travel comfortably along a by-road as opposed to a situation in which people do not have enough food.  The other statistic which is very relevant is the question of relative prosperity.  I am not denying that we have problems but let us not forget that in the global community of almost 160 nations, we are the 25th richest.  That must be borne in mind and continually impressed on people if for nothing else than to show cause and justification for making our effort in the development co-operation area.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that we have a great tradition of caring for and helping people in developing countries.  For decades Irish missionaries and voluntary organisations have been providing assistance that was much needed and much appreciated by the countries in which they work.  More recently the Government have extended their involvement in this area and in the last decade Ireland's official programme of assistance to developing countries has expanded rapidly. Much of the public interest in Ireland centres on our programme of bilateral assistance which is concentrated in four countries in Africa.  Three of these countries are classified as least developed which means that they are among the poorest countries in the World and that consequently their need of outside assistance is greatest.  The International Development Association concentrate on helping the poorest countries and so we have a very special interest in their work.  The Bill provides us with a useful opportunity to look at the International Development Association and their work and see how they relate to our overall programme of assistance to developing countries.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the International Development Association concentrate on the poorer among the developing countries, what are known as the low-income countries.  Of their total lending, 80 per cent goes to those countries who have a <i>per capita</i> GNP of less than $410. To put the figure in perspective, a corresponding figure for GNP <i>per capita</i> in Ireland is approximately $4,800.  That is more than 11 times greater than that of the low income countries.  We are experiencing <Col N="1681" /> difficult economic conditions at home and rightly we are concerned with the protection of our living standards but as we do so it is worth remembering the enormous gap that separates us from the least developed countries and that what for us would be a very small drop in living standards would be for them a major catastrophe.  If, with other countries, some of which may be richer than ours and some of which may be poorer, we can help in raising the living standards of the developing countries, there will be a return from that in economic terms.  We are developing areas which not only will be markets for our goods but which will provide a return even in economic terms. However, the present gap is huge and unfortunately the situation is becoming worse rather than better.</P>
    <P>Although the gap separating the richest and the poorest countries &mdash; is already very great unfortunately, it is getting worse instead of better.  The economic recession which we have all experienced in recent years has affected the poorest countries much more severely than it has the developed countries.  This is partly explained by the low level of development of these countries when the recession began, the scarcity of natural resources in most cases and their weak capacities to withstand the pressures imposed by the recession.  Another factor was the high increase in the price of oil and oil-based products.  Most of the poorest countries rely very heavily on imported energy supplies and the steep increases in these costs have been a severe drain on their scarce reserves of foreign exchange.  We must also recognise that the policies adopted in developed countries to combat the recession exacerbated its effects on the poorest countries.  The anti-inflationary strategies, with the consequent high interest rates and stagnation in demand and consumption, resulted in depressed commodity prices, higher import prices and higher borrowing costs for the poorest countries.  All of this led to huge indebtedness and a sharp deterioration in their terms of trade.  We can see the effects of this in low income countries by looking at the average annual growth in <i>per capita</i><Col N="1682" /> GDP in the last decade.  From 1973 to 1980, annual growth averaged 3.2 per cent.  Over the last two years, however, this has declined to less than 2 per cent per annum.  Since 1970 exports from low income countries have risen at an annual rate of 11 per cent but imports have risen even faster, at an annual rate of 16 per cent.  This has led to a substantial increase in the current account deficits which rose from 1.7 billion dollars in 1970 to 12 billion dollars in 1980.  These countries rely heavily on external aid to finance these deficits.  Official aid finances almost two-thirds of the current account deficits of the low income countries and the International Development Association alone accounts for 10 per cent of this total.  The International Development Association has also been an important source of investment financing for low income countries and now accounts for 9 per cent of all official aid to developing countries.</P>
    <P>Over the last 22 years the International Development Association has committed 27 billion dollars in aid.  A total of 15 billion dollars has been disbursed on over 1,300 projects in 78 developing countries. The International Development Association uses three principal criteria in assessing whether a country is eligible for assistance.  The first is the relative poverty of the country concerned; secondly, its credit-worthiness, in other words, the extent to which it is able or, more importantly, unable to raise loans from other, more commercial sources; thirdly, the capacity of the country to use external aid effectively and the extent to which there are suitable projects available for assistance.</P>
    <P>In 1980 the upper limit for eligibility was a <i>per capita</i> income of 730 dollars. In fact, as noted earlier, 80 per cent of the International Development Association's lending goes to countries with a <i>per capita</i> income of less than 410 dollars.</P>
    <P>Clearly, as developing countries improve their situation they grow beyond the income level which makes them eligible for assistance from the International Development Association.  Of the 78 countries that have received assistance, 27 have graduated and are no longer eligible for the highly concessionary <Col N="1683" /> terms offered by the International Development Association.  In some ways this is a measure of the success of this International Development Association &mdash; the fact that it has been effective in helping countries to, as it were, leave the school and get on to another level.  That is something worth noting.</P>
    <P>The countries which have graduated from the IDA have become clients of the World Bank whose terms are less concessionary than those of the IDA although still much more favourable than commercial loans.  The IDA is, of course, an integral part of the World Bank and the same criteria for assessing and approving projects are used by both organisations.  They also complement each other in their spread of assistance. During the period 1979 to 1982 83 per cent of IDA loans went to low income countries and 1 per cent to middle income countries while, for the World Bank, the corresponding proportions were 8 per cent to low income countries and 66 per cent to middle income countries.</P>
    <P>The largest concentration of IDA activity has been in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa which, between them, account for 84 per cent of total commitments in the period 1961 to 1982.  The major beneficiary was South Asia which received 59 per cent of total commitments compared with 25 per cent for Sub-Saharan Africa.  The largest single client has been India with 39 per cent of total commitments.</P>
    <P>Just as the geographical distribution of the IDA's assistance has changed over the years, so also has the pattern of lending. This reflects the changing needs of developing countries and also changes in developmental thinking.  In the early years of the IDA's operation, the main objective was to accelerate economic growth.  The assumption was that once the basic infrastructure was installed, growth would follow and this in turn would lead to a reduction of poverty and higher living standards.  In line with this approach, there was a heavy concentration on infrastructural projects in the earlier years, chiefly railways, roads, ports and power plants.  These projects <Col N="1684" /> received 40 per cent of total commitments during the first decade of the IDA's operation.</P>
    <P>The theory however, proved simplistic and inadequate.  Efforts to industrialise did not generate enough employment and the neglect of agriculture led to food deficits and balance of payment imbalances. It became clear that agriculture was a key priority in development and the emphasis in the IDA's lending changed accordingly.  From 1961 to 1970 agriculture and rural development received 23 per cent of total allocations, a figure that almost doubled to 42 per cent in the period 1977 to 1982.</P>
    <P>Over the last 22 years the International Development Association has played a major role in the development of the agricultural sector in developing countries. It has achieved particular success in South Asia where the reliance on agriculture has been reduced from 50 per cent of GDP in 1960 to 35 per cent in 1980.  Many of us know of the green revolution which began in the sixties with the introduction of higher yielding seeds and fertilisers.  We sometimes forget that proper irrigation systems were essential for the success of these new techniques. It was in this area in particular that the IDA played a major role.  The IDA also provided assistance for improved drainage and flood control which, in countries where 90 per cent of the rice grown depends on the monsoons, is of crucial importance.</P>
    <P>The green revolution was not entirely successful.  Its critics argue that it took no account of local conditions or the traditional approaches of local farmers.  Some of these criticisms are undoubtedly valid. There is no doubt that, for this approach to be successful, it requires very close co-ordination and also investment in other areas such as transport, storage and pricing policies.  It is clearly difficult to get all of these factors right at the same time and it has not always been possible to do so.  What the green revolution has done, however, is to show that half-heartened, amateurish approaches are quite inadequate. We need sustained, professional strategies in order to gain the maximum benefit from the resources available.  We <Col N="1685" /> know this from our experience here in Ireland.  We are very much aware of the difficulties involved in the transition from old to new methods.  So we can appreciate the complexities and pitfalls inherent in the green revolution approach.</P>
    <P>Despite all this, the effects of IDA assistance in India, for example, has been dramatic and 25 million hectares of land were brought to irrigation in the period 1960 to 1980.  In the same period there was a six fold increase in fertiliser consumption to over five million tonnes per year.  Grain production increased at a rate of 3 per cent per annum during the Seventies, which led to India becoming self-sufficient in grain production for the first time.</P>
    <P>This example is very often quoted and one would wish that the successful operations which have been carried on in India could be repeated elsewhere and that the same results could be achieved. There is no doubt that the effects of the IDA programmes in India are a dramatic example of what can be done in this area. They also indicate the opportunities that can be lost unless countries like ours contribute to the continuation of the IDA work.</P>
    <P>The same progress, unfortunately, has not been recorded in Sub-Saharan Africa, the other major area of concentration for the International Development Association.  In fact, the food supply situation there is getting worse. During the seventies food production increased at less than half the rate of population growth.  This led to growing food deficits and greater reliance on food imports and food aid.  The poor performance in Africa has been influenced by several factors: sharp rises in the price of oil and oil based products, frequent droughts, wars and civil disturbances and, not least, poor pricing policies; and economic infrastructures.</P>
    <P>The question of food security is becoming one of the major issues in the North-South dialogue and one in which we, as an agricultural country, have a special interest.  As Deputies will be aware, the four countries in which Ireland's Bilateral Aid Programme is concentrated are in Sub-Saharan Africa <Col N="1686" /> and a substantial part of our assistance to these countries is devoted to the agricultural sector.  In addition, within the EEC framework, we are considering new approaches, on the basis of EEC Commission proposals, for tackling the food deficit situation in Sub-Saharan Africa. The most important of these proposals is called the food strategy approach which seeks to develop a comprehensive and coherent programme for each developing country which will lead ultimately to self-sufficiency in food production.  We cannot emphasise too strongly the importance of finding a solution to the food production problem.  Until we remove the scourge of hunger and under-nourishment, we cannot hope to tackle effectively the longer term development problems.</P>
    <P>Ireland has strongly supported the food strategy approach by the EEC.  A number of countries have been selected and there are some indications that the food strategy is the correct one because it marries, as it were, the aid operation to the policies in the country itself and the result of this marriage will, I believe, have a great chance of success.  If the early indications of success in these countries such as Mali and Ruanda and others continue, they will set an example for an extension of this policy and I hope that in the coming years most countries with food production supply problems will be involved in this food strategy approach.</P>
    <P>The second largest area of IDA lending is basic infrastructure.  Over the last 22 years, one-third of total commitments have been allocated to this sector, chiefly to the areas of transport, energy, and telecommunications.</P>
    <P>The heaviest concentration has been on transport, mainly roads and railways. These are obviously essential for the development of the economic infrastructure in developing countries.  Because they are so capital-intensive, however, they are usually beyond the scope of most bilateral donors.  In general, it falls to the multilateral institutions such as the International Development Association or the World Bank to provide funds on the scale required to finance these projects.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the energy sector, <Col N="1687" /> where, in most cases, the enormous investment required for power generation and transmission systems this can only be provided by multilateral organisations. By contrast, in the field of telecommunications, financing is often available from the equipment suppliers and the role of the International Development Association has been mainly to provide technical advice and financial planning. Again, we know from our own experience the importance of adequate telecomunications services for industrial and economic development.</P>
    <P>Another area where the International Development Association have provided assistance is water and sewerage systems. Deputies may recall that during the recent visit to Ireland of the Executive Director of UNICEF, Mr. James P. Grant, he stressed that water borne diseases are the leading cause of infant mortality in developing countries.  It is no harm to give statistics here for the record. These statistics show that the rate of infant mortality from hunger, disease, malnutrition and related diseases is 40,000 children every day.  It is such an enormous figure it is hard to comprehend, but it cannot be repeated too often in an effort to get through to people the enormity of the problem.  For example, the city of Cork has a population of about 130,000.  It is hard to imagine that in three days the entire population would be wiped out if the same conditions applied there.  Possibly this will bring home to people the significance of the statistics.</P>
    <P>It is vital, therefore, to provide clean water supplies and there is an obvious spin-off in terms of better health from doing so.  The International Development Association have also invested directly in social services, including health and education activities and also urban development.  This latter area is one which is posing ever increasing and ever more pressing problems in developing countries as the number of people drifting to the cities from the rural areas grows.  The IDA have done valuable work in addressing the problems of urban poverty and have pioneered programmes <Col N="1688" /> to find solutions to urban shelter problems.</P>
    <P>Industry is another sector which has received substantial assistance from the International Development Association, more than two billion dollars since 1961. In the early years of the association much of the assistance in this area was devoted to large scale projects specialising in import substitution, for example fertilisers in India and textile plants in Egypt. Increasingly, however, the emphasis has been placed on small and medium scale firms which tend to create more jobs. Once again, we can see the parallels with our own situation here in Ireland and the approach of our own Industrial Development Authority is now placing a higher priority on this sector also.</P>
    <P>More than one tenth of the International Development Association total commitments have not been tied to particular projects.  This form of assistance is called programme assistance.  It is intended to ease foreign exchange constraints and is usually accompanied by policy advice to help a country's overall performance.  The IDA's assistance in this area has been concentrated mainly in South Asia with India receiving half the total.  Initially the programme assistance to India was used to help private industries with necessary imports.  More recently it has been used to help bridge chronic current account deficits.  This sort of assistance is extremely useful for developing countries especially for overall policy reform and economic management. At times it can be more urgently required than project assistance.  Generally speaking, programme assistance is beyond the capacity of most bilateral donors and so there is an important role for international organisations such as the International Development Asociation. Indeed, there may be justification for increasing the IDA's activities in this area and shifting their operations more in the direction of programme assistance.</P>
    <P>The International Development Association are not only involved in providing financial assistance but also in providing assistance to governments in developing countries on a broad range of policy issues.  When the IDA assess projects, <Col N="1689" /> they carry out a detailed analysis of all the factors affecting the project including the constraints on development, whether they be financial, infrastructural, or political. These analyses form the basis for a policy dialogue with the recipient country in which the IDA advise on policy reform and on creating viable development institutions so that the maximum benefit can be derived from the financial assistance provided.</P>
    <P>Institutional support and technical assistance are also central factors of our bilateral aid programme.  We are unable to provide large sums of capital aid and we see our primary role as helping developing countries to set up the necessary administrative, managerial and technical systems to direct their own development efforts.  We can see the effects of this in our priority countries where the assistance we are providing has helped these countries to use more effectively the aid they receive from other sources.  A good example of this is Lesotho where extensive assistance from the International Development Association for the extension of the rural educational infrastructure was implemented by Irish technical assistance which was provided to the Lesotho Ministry of Works.  This institutional approach, where we aim to build up the development structures, goes to the very heart of our development policy. In our view the primary responsibility for developing the Third World rests with these countries themselves.  We can help them to develop the proper policies and structures but it is up to them to take overall charge of and responsibility for their own development.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the IDA are, of course, shared by a number of other aid institutions and programmes which have recognised that certain areas of the world and certain types of development call for special and original aid instruments.  The European Community's policy for development co-operation is comprised of several aid instruments, the best known of which is the Lomé Convention.  However, the programme of financial and technical assistance which the Community draws up each year for non-associated developing countries is of considerable <Col N="1690" /> importance to those countries which the Lomé Convention does not cover. Over the period 1976 to 1983, total commitment credits of IR£735 million have been made available under this programme to assist some 30 countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa with a total population of some 1,350 million and an average <i>per capita</i> income of $310. The major recipient of aid in the period has been India which accounted for over 40 per cent of the total commitments. The other major beneficiaries were Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand. It remains one of the policy guidelines of this programme that aid shall be directed to the poorest developing countries and the poorest groups in their populations and shall be aimed essentially at developing the rural sector, with particular emphasis on improving food supplies. Indeed, the 1982 programme of financial and technical assistance to non-associates, as in previous years, was almost entirely concentrated on the rural sector.  The particular emphasis on food production and agricultural services involving the support of projects on rural development, rural credit, irrigation, drainage and water supplies is reflected in the fact that this sector accounted for almost 82 per cent of total commitments. We can see here a very close connection between the patterns of assistance provided by the EEC and the IDA.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the co-financing of projects with member states and other aid agencies under the EEC's programme and, while the overall share of co-financing in total programme commitments in 1982 at 35 per cent was slightly lower than in previous years, it still continues to play an important part in the programme.</P>
    <P>Within the framework of the Lomé Convention the Community has singled out the least developed countries for special treatment not least in taking a broader definition of the term &ldquo;least developed&rdquo;.  Whereas the UN list is based on criteria such as <i>per capita</i> gross domestic product, share of manufacturing and rates of illiteracy, the Community's definition takes into account liability to natural disasters, lack of material <Col N="1691" /> resources, disfavour by geography, landlocked states and island states, and low productive potential.  Under the 5th EDF the programmable resources for the LDCs amount to IR£1,243 million. Therefore, on a <i>per capita</i> basis the LDCs receive on average double of what was received by the other ACPs.  These financial resources consist essentially of grants and/or special loans or risk capital.  Similarly, access of the ACP LDCs to EIB risk capital is facilitated as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>Looking at the experience of the International Development Association over the last 22 years a number of points emerge.  The first is that small scale projects are often more effective than large scale projects.  The association have recognised this and in several areas, including agriculture and infrastructure, they are now tending to support smaller scale projects which have a greater chance of helping the poorest people. The second point, as noted earlier, is that the effective use of IDA funds requires adequate implementation capacity on the part of the recipient country.  This means having the right policies, the right structures and properly trained people to run them.  As I have already said, this is the area in which we feel that our bilateral assistance to developing countries can be of most use, but it is equally important that other donors also recognise the importance of structural and policy reform in developing countries.  This is an area in which developing countries themselves have a very great responsibility for only they can effect the necessary changes that are needed.</P>
    <P>A further point is that there is a vital need in the poorer regions of the world to increase food production in order to combat famine and poverty and to obviate the need for food imports and the growing dependency on food aid.  In order to achieve this, there is a clear need for research which will help to overcome these food shortages.  The spectacular gains which have been achieved in wheat, maize and rice production since the late sixties through the application of new <Col N="1692" /> varieties and improved technology have been pioneered in international centres of research of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), a co-operative research system which is administered through the World Bank, and of which the World Bank, FAO, United Nations Development Programme and donor governments are the financial sponsors.  Ireland has been a contributor to the CGIAR system for the last three years, our contribution being directed to research on the improvement of livestock production in Africa, potato, wheat and maize production, and support for national research capabilities in the developing countries themselves.  There is no doubt that moneys spent on research, such as the rice, wheat and maize improvements which have eliminated huge deficits in parts of Asia and Latin America, can have a very high rate of return, not only in financial and economic terms, but in the human terms of saving millions of lives which would otherwise be lost through hunger.  While there have been some very important gains in recent years in the production of food grains, especially in Asia, as a result of scientific and technological breakthroughs, some 300 million people in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America subsist on roots, tubers and coarse grains which have not shared the production increases of these cereals. We must, therefore, continue to support research in this area so that the latest advances in science and technology are applied to the most fundamental and urgent problem of all, namely the elimination of hunger.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the activities and the experience of the International Development Association over the last 22 years at some length because the organisation is experiencing a difficult time at present. Each replenishment of the IDA has always been more difficult than the previous one, but the present one, the sixth replenishment, has proved especially difficult and indeed the purpose of the Bill before us today is to help preserve order in the financing of the IDA.  In many quarters today multilateral development organisations have become unfashionable. <Col N="1693" /> They are criticised, often justifiably, for being over-bureaucratic, for being too slow and for being insufficiently responsive to local needs and circumstances. There is a general preference nowadays for bilateral aid, often &mdash; it must be said &mdash; because this form of aid can be tied to the procurement of goods and services from the donor countries, although I am happy to say that this is not a feature of Irish assistance.  Despite shortcomings, multilateral organisations have an important role to play in the development process. Developing countries prefer to deal with them because multilateral aid is predictable and usually untied.  We also need the positive and constructive influence that they can bring to bear on policy making in developing countries.</P>
    <P>The history of the International Development Association over the last two decades shows that, on the whole, they have been a valuable and important instrument for development and have been a major support for the low income countries which are so reliant on external aid for their very survival.  We in Ireland have always seen the poorest countries as the major priority for our bilateral aid. We share a lot in common with the approach and the philosophy of the International Development Association.  The association is a significant part of our aid to developing countries, accounting for almost 10 per cent of the total last year and it will continue to be an important part of our overall assistance to developing countries in the future.</P>
    <P>I would urge Deputies to support this Bill and, in doing so, to reaffirm their support, not only for the International Development Association but for the work of all those, and especially those Irish people engaged in helping developing countries in their development efforts.</P>
    <P>It is important that we in this House remember the work of our people abroad.  Indeed, many do not realise how many are working in developing countries, trying to assist them.  Through the programmes in my Department and through the APSO agency there must be 500 or 600 people officially involved in the aid efforts, but we cannot forget the <Col N="1694" /> approximate 5,000 missionaries scattered over the globe, most of whom are involved to a greater or lesser degree in helping the peoples of the countries in which they reside at present.  It is important that in the Parliament of their own country they should be remembered and that we place on record our appreciation of their work, be they missionaries, members &mdash; as a large number are &mdash; of voluntary organisations, or people who are abroad in an official capacity.  I am very glad, as Minister of State with special responsibility in this area, to put on the record of this House my appreciation of the work that they are doing and, if nothing else, to let them know that even though they are very far away &mdash; in many cases many thousands of miles &mdash; they are not forgotten.  They are appreciated as ambassadors of this country.</P>
    <P>In the light of our efforts at official and voluntary level and the support we have given in the past to the International Development Agency, and particularly so because of its present difficulties, it is very important indeed that we make this additional contribution and join with the other countries which are making a similar special contribution to enable them to continue their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly happy to be present here today to welcome this Bill.  It had been my intention to commence where the Minister of State had concluded, by paying tribute to the many working through Congood in the Third World Countries for the wonderful work they have done.  I am already on the record of the House as paying tribute to these great ambassadors for our country of whom we are very proud.  We do appreciate what they are doing and share their frustrations at there not being more money available to them to give to the Third World.  We are giving to the maximum of our ability.  It is important to stress that no matter how difficult our own situation may be, there are people throughout the world who are living in extreme deprivation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I watched a television programme dealing with Ethiopia or some other African state, which showed <Col N="1695" /> starving women and children.  It was so devastating that I was unable to continue watching the programme.  I felt, not a sense of guilt, but was extremely moved. I wondered if those people at whom we were looking had been white, would the amount of aid pouring in from the west have been greater?  I thought many times since about that.  Perhaps the sight of starving people is bearable to some but my reaction was that, if they were white, we would have reacted in a very different way, a more urgent way.  That is why I sometimes feel the message is not going home.  People are used to seeing black people or people of the yellow races hungry. They have almost become inured to that sight.  I wonder what would it take to shock people out of their complacency and make them realise that there is so much we should be doing for these people.</P>
    <P>The problem of an increasing world population is extremely serious.  In 1979 Deputy Timmins and I went to Sri Lanka to a conference under the auspices of the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  We listened to talks about the problem the world will be facing around the year 2020.  By then the world population will have virtually doubled. There is a great need to spend money on digging wells and on irrigation schemes. Sadly the developed world associations are behind target in developing these resources.  The reality is that famine will be with us for some time.  We are fighting a terrible uphill battle against poverty and starvation throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I believe the figures in Sri Lanka showed that families had one egg per family per month.  When you see people in these countries you realise that they are eating to survive.  We are used to eating to enjoy.  We are used to looking at a menu and making a choice of what we will have for dinner, and whether we will eat this, that, or the other.  Other people eat to survive.  They do not question what they have to eat.  It may be a handful of rice with saffron and they have been eating rice every day for God knows how long.  Many of these people would not know what a steak is.  I know that in <Col N="1696" /> India Hindus would not eat steak anyway.</P>
    <P>With all our difficulties here, we do not realise how fortunate we are.  We have not got a famine in the land.  We had one in 1847 and following years, and I do not think the Irish people will ever forget that.  That has given us a willingness and urgency to do something to the best of our ability to solve the problem of hunger in other countries.  It is such an uphill battle.</P>
    <P>The amount of money taken up in administrative costs causes me anxiety at times.  Through their agencies Governments should endeavour to keep administrative costs to a minimum and to channel as much as possible of the money donated into self-help schemes.  Perhaps we could spend more money to finance voluntary workers who go out to the Third World countries.  Many young people are anxious to do this.  Recently money was raised to send people from Dún Laoghaire to part of India to see what life was like there.  When they come back they will say: &ldquo;We want to go out again as quickly as possible to help the people.  We want people with skills, with training in agriculture and administration and teachers to help people to help themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the new missionary from Ireland complementing the missionaries of the past and the missioners of today who, as the Minister said, do such wonderful work and dedicate their lives to working for these people.  Many of them never see their families again.  They correspond with them but they do not come back.  We do not take time as often as we should to pay tribute to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing a very good job. I compliment him on his speech.  It is an excellent statement because it outlines very clearly what is happening.  I wish we could talk out this debate this evening so that it could be resumed next week and more Deputies would be enabled to participate. I know many people who are not here today who would love to contribute to this debate.  Deputy O'Kennedy has always shown a great interest in it.  I believe Deputy N. Andrews may be out <Col N="1697" /> of the country and he too would like to contribute to the debate.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility to educate people on the need for us to contribute on as wide a base as possible to the Third World through these agencies.  The recession has hit everyone and particularly those in the Third World.  The increase in the price of oil has had its impact. Ultimately these resources will run out and new forms of energy will be required. It is not popular to say this but ultimately nuclear energy will be the answer when the world population is doubled.</P>
    <P>In the past the solution to famine and over-population has been war.  As the Minister stated quite rightly, unless the developed world contributes very substantially more than it is contributing at the moment to the Third World, there will be the most horrendous holocaust in the 21st century.  This message has to be spelled out.  We are leaving it very late in the day even now.  The masses of people from India and China will pour over the borders in search of food to survive.  An enormous problem is facing the world.</P>
    <P>That is why I am very glad we have this opportunity to have this discussion.  I am sorry we did not have more notice of the debate.  I am not blaming the Government because business is always agreed between the Whips.  I am sorry more attention was not drawn to the fact that this matter was coming before the House. If we had known about it at our last party meeting, we would have brought in more speakers to back the Government whatever Government are in power.  The solutions are not easy.  In the few minutes available to me and from my knowledge of what is going on, I feel we should emphasise more the needs of the Third World, not only in Ireland but in other countries.</P>
    <P>I am a great believer in bilateral agreements. It is very important that we go out into the world and are seen as a country without aspirations to take anybody's land; we simply go out to help people.  I think that is our image in the Third World and it is incumbent on us to maintain it. I have great pleasure in responding in this way to the Minister's speech, and I want to tell him that there will not be any <Col N="1698" /> criticism from this side of the House when the Government see fit to increase our contribution for the Third World.  When the people understand why this money is going to the Third World, automatically they will respond favourably, because our people do not give just through taxes but they give to every charity, sale of work and so on for the Third World.  As a people we give more per head of the population to charity than many other countries.  The generosity of the Irish people is recognised and appreciated abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take up from where Deputy Briscoe left off.  I have no doubt that on a <i>per capita</i> basis we are as generous as any other nation in the world.  The folk memory is long here. Cecil Woodham-Smith referred to the fact that Trevelyan, the Home Secretary, in 1847 said of us as a people that if the Irish nation ever discovered they could get something for nothing, the world would witness a stampede such as had never been seen.  That folk memory has helped to condition our thinking to assist the Third World.</P>
      <P>Our greatest contribution has been in the area of missionary endeavour.  I would like to be associated with the remarks of the previous speakers in their tributes to the wonderful contribution in kind in the areas of education and training made by our missionaries &mdash; priests, nuns, brothers and clergymen of all denominations.  It is no harm to remind ourselves that in the preface to the book <i>The Great Hunger,</i> Cecil Woodham-Smith pointed out that when we speak of the famine in 1846-47, we sometimes forget that in the preceding 40 years there were 20 minor famines.  I mention this point to highlight the need in the Third World for education and training to help those people cope with their own problems and become self-sufficient.  Kenneth Galbraith, the distinguished American economist, pointed very strongly to this need when he referred to the absurdity of developing Third World economies buying cars in America instead of developing their own economies to produce their own consumer goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> In welcoming this Bill I commend the Minister for his philosophy in this area as reflected in this legislation.  On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to draw attention to some aspects of the present world situation which must be a cause of grave concern to anybody interested in the way the international situation is developing.  The International Development Association was established in 1960 and is tailored to the needs of those countries whose external debt had become so crushing that they could no longer afford even the long-term relatively modest cost IBRD loans.  Such countries bear intolerable debt burdens, often devoting 20 per cent or more of their national earnings to the servicing of these debts.  The IDA has the same structure and voting procedure as the World Bank.  There are 117 subscribing members and their funds are periodically replenished by governments. The fourth replenishment went through with considerable difficulty in 1974 after the then leader of the World Bank, Mr. Eugene McNamara, had threatened his board &ldquo;that there is now a danger of complete termination of IDA's activities next July&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The IDA also received direct transfers of funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  Their loans bear no interest, merely a service charge of ¾ per cent.  They provide for a ten year grace period and allow for repayment in 40 years, but yearly the situation is growing worse for these countries in so far as the debt they have to repay is becoming greater each year.  While it is true to say that we have seen great developments in the way of contributions by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, nevertheless the situation leaves a great deal to be desired.</P>
    <P>Those of us over 40 have witnessed one of the great political developments in the history of human civilisation.  I am talking about the withdrawal of the European maritime nations from the former colonies and empires in the fifties and sixties. I remember reading in graphic detail when Belgium pulled out of the Congo &mdash; I do not know if it is true but I did not see it contradicted &mdash; that only one native <Col N="1700" /> of the Congo had graduated from a university. The situation was that bad.  Different colonial powers acted in different ways &mdash; the Dutch, the English, the Germans, the French and the Italians &mdash; but we now have a situation where some of the former colonies are in greater economic bondage to their former masters than they were during the days of the empire, and statistics will prove this.  It is very disconcerting to read that, despite the best endeavours of the Third World countries, they are now paying more for the same volume of goods from the more developed sectors of the world than they were paying ten years ago.  This shows that their situation is worsening.  Many of the loans they are getting from the IDA are merely going to reservice previous loans.  Certain countries hold no bank-proper loans at all, only IDA concessionary credits &mdash; Afghanistan, Jordan, and several Sahelian countries among them.</P>
    <P>India, as was stated by the Minister, is by far the prime recipient of IDA credit with over $4 billion in 79 separate grants, or more than three-quarters of its total bank group loans.  Pakistan is second with with over $700 million in credits and is followed by Bangladesh and Indonesia each with more than half a billion.  Thirty per cent of the IDA's credits go to agriculture &mdash; the largest proportional share &mdash; with transportation the next largest sector.</P>
    <P>Besides suffering vastly discriminatory trade terms and wholly inadequate Western development assistance, the neediest nations are also confronting a heavier and heavier debt burden.  The outstanding debt of the poor countries &mdash; what they owe to bilateral or multilateral arrangements, public or private suppliers of credit &mdash; has reached an astronomical $180 billion on which they pay interest in the region of $13 billion a year.  The amount they owe in interest alone is growing faster every year than their incoming hard-currency revenue, solely because of unfavourable trade terms their collective trade deficit was about $37 billion in 1975, rounding out the vicious circle.</P>
    <P>Although the figures are relevant for late seventies rather than early eighties it <Col N="1701" /> must still be noted that in these recessionary times the gap between rich and poor nations will continue to grow until at least the year 2,000 largely owing to the selfish of the richer nations.  Mr. McNamara, President of the World Bank, is on record as stating that nothing can be done to prevent what is in fact an international scandal that does not receive the type of highlighting from the world media it should.  What we can do is begin to move now to ensure that absolute poverty and utter degradation is ended.</P>
    <P>Colonial exploitation that I referred to must not be permitted to be replaced by economic and political domination of the developing countries.  This can be guaranteed only by a balanced approach in which political freedom is matched by the creation of effective and acceptable systems of administration, and education, and the provision of an economic infras-structure capable of enabling people to have control of all aspects of their own affairs.</P>
    <P>The achievement of a new international economic order will demand major reforms within the international organisations through which the world development issues are debated and tackled in practice.  These are the indispensable channels for future progress and for the monitoring of this progress.</P>
    <P>The United Nations, and its affiliated bodies, UNCTAD, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, are central and crucial to the whole process. It is essential that these organisations should be appropriately structured and that their orientations should take into account the legitimate interests of the developing countries.</P>
    <P>Economic relationships on the world level must be based on a clear set of values.  Central to these values must be an acceptance that development relates to the welfare of the human beings and not to the dictates of capital.  The IMF must conform in practice to this principle and must ensure that in its programmes of financial support it fully respects national integrity and imposes only conditions which are in line with the goals and possibilities of development policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> President Nyrere of Tanzania said:</P>
    <P>The World Bank and the IMF ..... were set up by ..... and are still controlled by, the rich nations of the world.  Whether they are now effective in serving the purpose for which they were established, is, I would have thought, questionable.  But what is quite certain is that &mdash; apart from the IDA subsidiary of the World Bank &mdash; they are not instruments for attacking world poverty, and dependency.  The IMF in particular endorses and serves the present international financial structure, rather than in any way acting as a corrective to its injustices.  Further, although it is a creature of the developed nations, these hide behind the IMF when they find it convenient. They pretend that it has a special expertise and is politically neutral; when a poor country seeks credit it is therefore first to reach a system which will support development and not crush it as in the current deplorable case of Jamaica.  For example Prime Minister Michael Manley, leader of the People's National Party of Jamaica, announced that his government was ceasing any further negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on the question of loans for his country. The conditions the fund was trying to impose on his government in exchange for its aid, he said were too onerous.</P>
    <P>The rationale behind the strategy is one which is shared by many countries of the developing world, one which is severly critical of the methods of working of the Fund.  It is mirrored in the Brandt report which commented that the credit conditions of the IMF &ldquo;normally presume that balance of payments problems are a result of too much domestic demand and can be solved by balancing the budget, curbing the money supply, cutting subsidies and setting a realistic exchange rate. Sometimes these measures are appropriate and have been effective but in many cases these measures reduce domestic consumption without improving investment; productive capacity sometimes falls even more <Col N="1703" /> sharply than consumption.  This is because many developing countries with deficits have a shortage of food or of basic consumer goods or cannot readily shift resources in line with their new needs.  Indeed, the Fund's insistence on drastic measures, often within the time framework of only one year, has tended to impose unnecessary and unacceptable political burdens on the poorest, on occasion leading to `IMF riots' and even to the downfall of governments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The world monetary system must be reformed so as to fight instability and speculation and to meet the urgent trade and economic needs of the developing countries.  Worldwide monetary instability is leading to changing economic relationships and to distortions in markets for the basic commodities on which so much of the prospects of the developing countries still depend.  We must support any further financing of IDA because it is directed to the poorest Third World nations.  We should emphasise our level of confidence in the World Bank-IMF set-up secure from domination by former colonial powers and tradition of the worst possible policy conditions such as I outlined occurred in Jamaica.  We support this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in concluding his contribution recommended the Bill and I welcome that recommendation. My welcome for the Bill is qualified in regard to one aspect.  We should not have the Bill before us today seeking an additional £2 million for IDA.  We should have before us an order committing Ireland to the Seventh Replenishment for IDA.  That is being held up while discussions take place and the Bill is before us because the US were not able, or prepared, to undertake the commitment they agreed to in 1980 in the Sixth Replenishment.  It is unfortunate that that happened.  It would be easy to be critical of the US because of their failure to carry out their commitment thereby putting the onus on the other 22 countries to bolster the account.  This measure is a <Col N="1704" /> bolstering of the account for one year to give the Americans time to fulfil their commitment.  It would be easy to be over-critical but that would be unfair because the USA have been the major donors to the fund.  They donate approximately 37 per cent of all the money available under the IDA.  Therefore, one has to temper one's criticisms of them because of that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it gives us an opportunity to inform ourselves on where multilateral funding goes.  It is fair to say that the majority of Members of this House and the public know we have commitments under this programme under the heading of multilateral aid but I do not think most people know much more about it.  This Bill gives Members an opportunity to examine one aspect of our funding, namely, our commitment to the IDA fund.  The debate today has shown that a number of Deputies are anxious to learn more about the matter and to express their views on the work of the IDA and the World Bank.</P>
      <P>The IDA was set up by the World Bank in 1960.  The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development was set up after the Second World War to give loans to developing countries but after 15 years in operation it was found the bank was not able to help many of the least developed countries.  They could not make use of many of the loans available under the IBRD and their situation was getting worse.  Under the terms then obtaining the IBRD loans had to be repaid within 20 years and this was not possible for some of the least developed countries.  The IDA was set up giving more advantageous terms for the least developed countries.  The main repayment of the principal sum did not fall for repayment until after ten years and the rest of the repayments were spread over 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose was to give loans for economic development and initially much emphasis was placed on infrastructural development.  However, there has been a change of emphasis in IDA loans.  The World Bank have come in for considerable criticism for some of the projects they have financed and the emphasis they <Col N="1705" /> have put on some of their work.  In the opening statement of their annual report for 1983 it is stated:</P>
    <P>Since 1980 the Bank, in response to the deteriorating prospects for the developing countries during the 1980s, inaugurated a programme of structural adjustment lending.  This lending supports programmes of specific policy changes and institutional reforms in developing countries designed to achieve a more efficient use of resources and thereby contribute to a more sustainable balance of payments in the medium and long-term and to the maintenance of growth in the face of severe constraints and to lay the basis for regaining momentum for future growth.</P>
    <P>This is where the emphasis should lie so far as development is concerned.  For many years emphasis was on giving aid as a reaction to natural disasters.  Food, clothing and shelter are still essential parts of any aid programme but it has become evident that this is not the answer for the least developed countries.  They must be helped to reach a stage of development where they will no longer need the help of developed countries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change of emphasis in the policies of major groups such as the World Bank and the IDA.  This will be followed by the other countries involved with the World Bank and it will help to educate the policy-makers in those countries. It will ensure a more enlightened approach to development and a greater awareness of the responsibilities of countries to the least developed nations.  We have a situation where 80 per cent of the wealth of the world is in the hands of approximately 10 per cent of the population. Recently I was at a conference where a speaker said that if someone were to come from Mars and land anywhere in this world the chances are he would land in a Third World country because they cover approximately two-thirds of the land mass.  That visitor from Mars would have a very different view of this world than we would wish because it would be a world of extreme poverty and under-development.  The responsibility <Col N="1706" /> lies with the 10 per cent who hold the massive wealth of the world.</P>
    <P>The purpose of IDA was to give loans for economic development with the hope that eventually all countries would become partners and on an equal level. Loans from IDA are paid directly to governments as opposed to the work of NGOs and other bilateral aid programmes from which local groups may benefit.  This is where lies one of the main areas of criticism of the World Bank and the IMF.  Many of the governments of the least developed countries are extraordinarily unstable and agreements reached with them are not always implemented. The rate of success of some of the programmes financed by loans from the IDA is very low and naturally there is criticism because it appears that the money has been wasted.  It can even be said at times that the IDA should withdraw loans because they do not appear to help in the development of countries.  However, that will not help and I think the loans should continue to be made available even when the governments concerned are not ones we would like to support.  I visited one of the under-developed countries, the Philippines, where there is massive wealth on one side and extreme poverty on the other.  I visited an institution, a rice research centre, that was financed by World Bank money.</P>
    <P>Before my visit we were given a lot of literature about it and I looked forward to visiting it.  However, I was given a lot of very bad information about it.  The feeling had been that the money going into it was helping the research centre in which many people were employed, many of them from outside the Philippines, but it was found that the money being spent, far from helping the development of the country, would only bring more hardship to the people.</P>
    <P>Because of the type of group I was with when visiting the place, I was shown certain areas of the research centre but not others &mdash; we were privy to certain information but not to all.  We found it difficult to discover why we were not allowed into the library proper but only to an annex. We were given booklets but we were not allowed to go into the main research <Col N="1707" /> department.  Afterwards I spoke to many people and found that one of the main reservations about the project is the concentration on varieties of a rice crop, rice being one of the main foods of the people as it is in many of the least developed countries.  In that research they are purifying the genus of rice so much that its survival requires an enormous amount of fertilisers, which the poor people cannot afford to buy.  Therefore the productivity is far less than it should be.</P>
    <P>Projects such as that give rise to severe criticism of groups like IDA.  The association must be cognisant of this and continuously assess the kind of projects they get involved in so that they will be really helping to sustain development in those countries.  Obviously IDA are making efforts to do this because in their reports they have indicated they are assessing what they are doing continuously so that they can be sure their programmes can sustain themselves after the IDA have gone.</P>
    <P>In 1980 ODA subscriptions from all over the world financed 65 per cent of the deficits of low income countries, and IDA funds alone accounted for 16 per cent of the total of ODA, going into those countries. Long may this last provided the association continue to assess and monitor what they are doing.</P>
    <P>In our contributions to IDA we are trying to get worldwide structures that will be balanced and that will exhibit the responsibility of the industrialised developed countries.  When these countries are donating to funds such as this, the danger is that they will wash their hands of their responsibilities after that and say: &ldquo;We have given so many million dollars to a fund to help the poor people.  That is our responsibility gone.  We are very good boys and girls&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Therefore I hope the Minister will do much more than rubber-stamp our contributions to groups like IDA.  I hope that when they attend the annual meeting he and his officials will question the kind of projects that the money will be going into.  We can note the lack of understanding here of the development aid movement. It is very easy for the general public <Col N="1708" /> to be critical of what is going on in this field, in regard to how the billions of dollars are being spent.  Last year a colleague of mine criticised some of the projects in which one of our Irish organisations were involved in.  Many people echoed that criticism.  Those criticisms may have been relevant 20 years ago but I do not think they are today because understanding of what we are about when we go into those under-developed countries has increased and we all understand nowadays that the giving of aid and food is not enough any more because it has become obvious that the least developed countries are not getting any better and that a change of emphasis is needed.</P>
    <P>One may question the manner in which IDA decide on the countries they should become involved in.  The <i>per capita</i> income is one of the most important gauges and the Minister stressed that in his speech.  He said that the majority of the loans were going to countries in which the <i>per capita</i> income was $475 per annum.  That is about £400 a year.  How many of us here could even countenance living on that sum?  Some of us would say we cannot live on even £400 a month.</P>
    <P>This puts into perspective the kind of countries these funds are helping through the concessionary loans.  It has been emphasised here today that in our present difficult period of recession it would be easy for us to rule out any further aid to those countries until we get our own economic situation sorted out.  It is easy to argue that we have many poor people here, and that is true, and that we could use the money we are voting in this Bill to better effect at home.  We could do with an extra £2 million for many of our domestic programmes, but our commitment will be measured by the responsible action we are taking here today which will try to ensure that the IDA programmes will be continued and sustained.</P>
    <P>IDA try to ensure that the countries which will be helped will be those with large populations.  In the 20 years of their existence, the association's aims have changed considerably.  At the beginning they aimed mainly at infrastructure development but in the last 10 years they <Col N="1709" /> have been getting involved in agricultural and rural development projects mainly because for many years agricultural development in those countries was neglected and because of that their peoples had nothing to eat because their own resources were being diminished. Belatedly it has been discovered that this is where a lot of the money should be going.  Now almost 40 per cent of the funding is going into agricultural and rural development programmes. Another large percentage of the money is going into institutions in the least developed countries.</P>
    <P>One could pour millions of dollars into most of those countries but it would not be used effectively and productively because they have not the institutions or the personnel.  They have not got the expertise to use that money effectively where it is most needed.  Unless there is some kind of structure to permit the money to be used to the best advantage it is useless to be pouring money into those countries.  Many times we have read of aid to those countries being left on docks and in warehouses and not getting to the people who need it, partly because the structures in those countries have been so under-developed that they cannot get the aid to the people who need it most.  Therefore, it is most important to develop the institutions and the structures that will help to administer the aid when it reaches those countries.</P>
    <P>The IDA are most anxious to improve the health and the diet of those people. This may appear not to have anything more than a concern for human rights, but it must be realised that under-fed people cannot work productively and that if their health and the quality of their diets are not improved, productivity in those countries will continue to fall.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the <Col N="1710" /> Government to provide maternity facilities at Bantry Hospital, County Cork.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came to power a number of maternity units have been selected for closure, including Monaghan, Dundalk and Roscommon.  A crisis situation exists in Bantry where the maternity unit was closed last February and the Minister has refused to sanction its reopening.  Bantry is one of the two hospitals in the country where an archaic system existed where the county physician was the obstetrician and the county surgeon was the gynaecologist and carried out the operative procedures.  This was the system in all county hospitals until about 20 years ago.  Bantry and Dundalk were the only hospitals where the old system continued.</P>
    <P>Last February the county physician in Bantry went on sick leave.  While it was possible to find a <i>locum</i> to carry on for him in relation to general medicine it is understandable that it was quite impossible to find a <i>locum</i> prepared to carry on general medical duties and obstetrics and gynaecology as well.  I understand there was no difficulty in getting two consultants to replace him at different times for general medicine but it was not possible to get a <i>locum</i> to look after the obstetrics. The unit was closed last February.  The health board requested the Minister to sanction the reopening of the maternity unit and the development of an obstetric unit at Bantry hospital but the Minister has refused to do this.  It is difficult to understand this decision.</P>
    <P>Bantry general hospital has a catchment area with a population of 55,208. The west Cork health district has 48,973 and Kerry has 6,235 people in the Bantry hospital catchment area.  It is interesting to note that the figure of over 55,000 is up 15,000 since the time the Fitzgerald report was published in the late sixties. There are at least three peninsulas in west Cork each about 50 miles from Bantry and there is also an area of Kerry going west as far as Sneem.  The number of births in the area in 1982 was 823 and they were divided as follows: in Bantry <Col N="1711" /> hospital there were 191 births, Skibbereen 99, Erinville in Cork 269, Saint Finbar's 115, Bon Secours 130 and Victoria 19, a total of 823.</P>
    <P>The geographical distribution of where the women came from is Bantry 171, Castletownbere 34, Clonakilty 180, Dunmanway-Drimoleague 142, Skibbereen 185, Schull-Goleen 28, Kenmare-Sneem area 72 and others 12.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal published their recommendation in a document in 1976.  The objectives for good obstetric care, as outlined by An Chomhairle, are monitoring and maintaining the health of the mother during pregnancy through regular and ante-natal care ensuring safe delivery under skilled supervision, ensuring that through skilful attention the infant is given the best chance of optimum health and normal development. An Chomhairle also pointed out that many considerations point towards the concentration of inpatient obstetrical services at consultant level in viable centres catering for a minimum of 1,500 to 2,000 deliveries per annum.  I understand that in Sweden, where some research was done, they discovered that the infant death rate dropped in units where the birth rate was more than 1,500 per annum.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that here the infant death rate declined over the past decade. An Chomhairle pointed out in their document that this is in considerable measure because of improvements in obstetrical management.  This decline occurred with the majority of the maternity units having less than 1,500 births per annum. In reply to a question last week the Minister said that there are 51 units in the country with less than 1,500 deliveries per annum and there are 17 with more than 1,500.  If one takes the major boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford out of it there are only six areas left in the whole country with more than 1,500 deliveries per annum: Sligo, Letterkenny, Wexford, Castlebar, Drogheda and Ballinasloe.</P>
    <P>In Cavan hospital the infant death rate is very low compared with the rest of the country.  This is one of the hospitals with <Col N="1712" /> less than 1,500 deliveries per annum.  It is very interesting that Professor Henry from the Rotunda Hospital in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> of 21 October said that there was a very high perinatal mortality rate in the Rotunda last year.  He said that he was satisfied that part of the blame for this must rest with inadequate labour ward accommodation.  Obviously it has not been proved that the large centres have any more to offer than the smaller centres.  Fianna Fáil reject the concept that it is necessary to have 1,500 deliveries per annum to have a viable unit. We showed that when an appointment was made for an obstetrician to Roscommon with considerably less than 1,500 deliveries.  We believe it is necessary to have adequate maternity facilities throughout the country even if the deliveries in such units are considerably less than 1,500.  It is important to recognise that there is a move away from major hospitals and super-specialities.  Rex Lowry stated in the College of Surgeons Journal that only 10 per cent to 15 per cent of all the people who go into hospital need super-special attention.  Up to 95 per cent of the deliveries are normal so we are talking about the 5 per cent of deliveries that there are problems with. We have to balance the risk to the mother and infant where the birth takes place in a smaller maternity unit compared with a major maternity hospital a distance of anything from 60 to 100 miles away.  This applies in Monaghan, Dundalk, Roscommon as well as in Bantry.  Some parts of the Bantry catchment area are 110 miles from the nearest maternity hospital which is in Cork city.  It is very difficult to understand how a Minister could be satisfied to tell any woman that it was acceptable for her to travel 110 miles to have her baby delivered.  We are talking of a distance that is equal to the distance between Belfast and Dublin or between Nenagh and Dublin.  I fail to understand how anyone in his senses could suggest to a woman in Belfast or in Nenagh, for instance, that she should be satisfied with the maternity service in Dublin.  That does not take into account the fact that if one were travelling from Belfast to Dublin or from Nenagh to Dublin, one <Col N="1713" /> would be on a national primary route whereas in west Cork one would be travelling on roads which, it is fair to say, are among the poorest in Europe.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted that the medical risk both to the mother and to the infant in travelling such distances to a major maternity unit is greater than travelling the much shorter distance to a hospital where there is an obstetrician in attendance although there may be fewer than 1,500 deliveries there each year.  There is also the risk of road accidents in travelling the long distances especially when the driver may be the husband of the woman concerned and, consequently, is under stress.  All these factors must be taken into account when we are deciding on the best maternity service that we can provide. We must ask ourselves, too, what the medical implications would be if a number of women decided to remain in their own homes during the deliveries of their babies when they may live up to 100 miles from the nearest maternity hospital. Emergencies can occur very rapidly in obstetrics.  For example, there can be severe bleeding.  If specialist attention is necessary to deal with such an emergency the patient may have to be transferred to hospital which in the case of the Bantry catchement area would be more than 100 miles away or it may be possible to have the emergency service brought to the woman.  If we are talking of the emergency service in the nature of the flying squad coming from the maternity hospital in Cork to one of the peninsula areas in west Cork we are talking of a delay of two to three hours and that could prove fatal.</P>
    <P>The closing of the unit in Bantry could not be justified in circumstances in which fatalities might occur as a result.  In the event of a patient having to be transferred to Cork, I understand that there is available from Cork a helicopter service but it is not necessary for me to remind the House that such a service is very limited. Assuming that a helicopter were available in Cork to go to West Cork there is the factor that these machines do not fly at night.  Any doctor who practices obstetrics will confirm that the vast majority of babies are delivered at night. <Col N="1714" /> Consequently, the vast majority of emergencies are likely to arise at night.</P>
    <P>I would accept that it is not possible to have in Bantry a maternity unit where there are two or three obstetricians and two children's doctors but the results in the smaller units compare favourably with those in the larger maternity hospitals. I have given the example of Cavan where the perinatal mortality rate is among the lowest in the country.  I have pointed out what Dr. Henry had to say about the hospital in which he works, that is, the Rotunda.  Of the 823 deliveries in the Bantry catchment area to which I have referred, 191 were in Bantry.</P>
    <P>In a letter sent on the direction of the Minister for Health to the Southern Health Board in July this year it was stated that the development of a consultant obstetric unit at Bantry would not have attracted more than 300 deliveries per year.  However, the Ceann Comhairle as well as the rest of us from his constituency will recall that the same was said in respect of Cavan in 1973 but after the appointment there of an obstetrician the number of deliveries at the unit increased from 500 to more than 1,100, despite there being a decrease in the birth rate in the country as a whole.  That, then, is an indication that if an obstetrician is appointed in an area and there is created a good consultant service, the numbers of women availing of that service will increase.  There is no reason why there could not be a viable unit at Bantry with, perhaps in a short space of time, the necessity to appoint a second obstetrician. This would be the ideal rather than having one man working in isolation.</P>
    <P>In the middle of the last century a leading obstetrician in the UK, Robert Lee, wished to close all maternity hospitals. In the centenary issue of the <i>Practitioner Journal,</i> 1966, he is quoted as saying that it becomes a subject deserving of most serious consideration on the grounds of humanity whether lying-in hospitals should not be abolished altogether as injurious rather than beneficial to society.  I am sure everybody here will agree that it was very fortunate that the administrators of the time did not take <Col N="1715" /> him too seriously; otherwise, not many of us might be here today.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in Ireland in the eight years between 1968 and 1976, two opposite opinions were put forward by very eminent bodies.  I refer to the recommendation of An Comhairle that in order to make a maternity unit viable, there would need to be 1,500 deliveries at the unit per annum.  The FitzGerald Committee in their report expressed themselves as being satisfied with retaining maternity units not only in county hospitals but in district hospitals.  They suggested that the name of district hospitals should be changed to district nursing homes but they reported about keeping the maternity facilities at such places. These two eminent advisery bodies have expressed conflicting views in the past ten years in relation to maternity services. The lesson is that we should move slowly in any programme of rationalisation in the context of discontinuing the smaller units.  Dr. Courtney in his combined report for the years 1975 to 1982 had the following to say about the importance of an obstetric unit in a rural community:</P>
    <P>Many parameters have been put forward to assess the value of various services to the community.  In obstetrics assessment has been based on the number of deliveries in a specific institution or hospital, though this criterion has not been uniform.  This is a crude method of assessment.  It is clear that the proximity of a consultant to a given area provides significant advantages.</P>
    <P>It means that a wide range of doctors have immediate advice available to them, which will help to improve maternal care and neonatal health. Running clinics from a distance has been both useful and necessary in the past but it is more effective clinically to bring obstetrics to the rural areas, quite apart from the cost of travel, the inconvenience and the effect on community life.  A rural hospital without obstetrics ceases to be a focal point in the community and the argument that a small unit cannot function effectively is disproven.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> Not alone are there good medical reasons for developing an obstretical unit in Bantry, there are other good reasons for having such a service.  It is necessary to appreciate all the human, emotional factors involved in childbirth.  In a smaller unit nearer to home all these aspects of having a baby can be more comfortably accommodated than in a big hospital. When one considers the human, social and economic factors involved in perhaps travelling to Cork City from Bantry one can see another reason for the re-opening of the maternity unit in Bantry General Hospital.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered also that some women may have to remain in hospital for a number of weeks prior to having their babies delivered.  It is essential to their well-being that they have frequent visits from their husbands and young children, if they have any.  Obviously, while we must be concerned primarly with the high level of medical care, having regard to the geography of the area about which we are speaking, I do not think anybody would doubt that, when one considers the risk of the long distance to be travelled and not having a maternity service available &mdash; when one considers that against having a baby in a smaller unit, with an obstetrician appointed &mdash; medically one can be satisfied that the smaller unit, in an area such as south-west Cork has the advantage.  When one accepts that medically there is an advantage then one examines other aspects of the case.</P>
    <P>From the social viewpoint certainly one must consider and examine the problem of a woman who is, say, six months pregnant, having to go to Cork hospital and remain there for the remaining three months.  One must consider the effect of that on herself, having regard to the emotional state of women during pregnancy, and, secondly, the effect on her husband and other young children, if any. One must consider also the difficulties involved for relatives travelling that distance. If such a woman were in Bantry &mdash; even from a distance of 40 or 50 miles out &mdash; her husband could visit her twice or three times a week but it would be impossible to make visits of that frequency <Col N="1717" /> if she were in Cork city hospital. It is unreasonable for anybody to believe that the needs of such women and their families can be catered for within the distance we have been speaking about, with a hospital situated over 100 miles, in many instances, from their homes.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are responsible for the decision not to develop an obstetric gynaecological unit in Bantry hospital.  Although this Government have not been in power a year yet it is extraordinary that their main targets for closure have been maternity hospitals.  There is the instance in my county of Monaghan where the Minister wrote to the health board, telling them that he would not sanction the signing of the contract for Cavan hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the short reference I am making to it will prejudice the decision of the court.  In the context of this debate it is necessary to point out that it seems to be maternity units particularly that are the targets for closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely pointing out that the Minister had asked the board to close the hospital in Monaghan and dispose of it before he would sign the contract for Cavan hospital.  I shall not say any more about that.  The Minister also pointed out to the health board, when he invited them to Dublin for, I think, the third time during the summer months, that there would be three maternity units only in the North-Eastern Health Board area, one in Navan, one in Cavan and one in Drogheda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting very far away from Bantry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the point I am <Col N="1718" /> developing is the Minister's general policy. I cannot understand why it seems to be maternity hospitals he always wants to close in terms of rationalisation.  However, the Southern Health Board never took a decision to close the obstetrical department in Bantry hospital and, on any occasion on which the issue was discussed, the health board never decided that the unit should be closed.  In fact on a number of occasions in 1982 they wrote to the Minister asking him for finance to develop the maternity unit in Bantry. There was not the crisis now obtaining back in 1982.  Since the beginning of this year, when the physician there got ill suddenly, a crisis arose, when there was nobody to carry out the maternity services and the unit was closed.  In a letter to the members of the board on 29 April 1983 the chief executive officer stated:</P>
      <P>the current problem in regard to the operation of the obstetrical department of the General Hospital, Bantry is, contrary to the general belief, not related to either financial cutbacks or the current recession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore it appears that it was due entirely to the fact that the Minister would not sanction the reopening of the unit for the benefit of the people of the area.  Since the unit was closed there have been 19 deliveries in Bantry hospital, three of which I understand were emergencies. I want to ask the Minister which consultant in Bantry was asked to take responsibility for those deliveries.  The country physician was out sick for a lot of that time, his <i>locum</i> was not a qualified obstetrician; the county surgeon &mdash; while he could do the gynaecology and the operative procedures &mdash; I am sure would not take on the obstetrics.  It appears to me that the health boards have been placed in an extremely difficult situation having regard to their statutory and legal positions in that they must accept responsibility for adequate consultant cover to ensure that if there are deliveries in the hospital there will be a consultant to look after them.  I should like to know what <Col N="1719" /> arrangements existed there for those 19 deliveries since February this year.</P>
    <P>In his whole attitude to maternity services I would accuse the Minister of discriminating against women because of the point I made earlier, that to date the main announcements of hospital changes have been the closures of obstetrical and gynaecological units in Monaghan, Dundalk and the refusal to reopen Bantry. Not alone are the women being deprived of a maternity service, they are also being deprived of a gynaecological service to deal with a number of diseases specific to women.  They had this service in Bantry and, presumably, they will continue to have it as long as the present county surgeon is there but, when he retires, who will then offer a gynaecological service to the women of south-west Cork?  Will they also have to travel the long distance into Cork city?  The Minister in this instance is discriminating against women and surely the women of south-west Cork are entitled to exactly the same facilities as the women in any other part of the country?  Indeed I do not think women in any other part of the country would be asked to travel the distances that women are being asked to travel in this instance.  There is no consideration for the impact on family life, the anxiety of being so far away and the difficulties which families have in visiting them.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude in relation to the closure of Bantry and to reverse his decision.  He should also reconsider his decision to close Monaghan and Dundalk maternity units and, in each instance, to respect the opinion of the relevant health board.  The Southern Health Board have stated very clearly in letters from the CEO to members of the board that the Southern Health Board never decided to close Bantry hospital maternity unit and the same can be said of the North-Eastern Health Board in relation to the other two hospitals.  The opinions of the health boards should be considered because the health boards are made up of elected representatives and representatives of various professions, many of whom <Col N="1720" /> would be involved in the delivery of obstetric cases.  These people have decided that the unit should be kept in Bantry general hospital and the Minister should respect their decision.</P>
    <P>While the main development of health in the future must be the promotion of good health, the prevention of disease, the promotion of health care rehabilitation and the avoidance of risk, the area I believe we must all address ourselves to is the accessibility of services.  The level of health care service offered here compares favourably with anywhere else in Europe.  However, we must give some attention to the accessibility of services which is of critical importance.  This problem is seen at its greatest in remote and inner city areas.  Very often people who are in bad circumstances and suffering from poor nutrition are worst affected.</P>
    <P>In rural areas, services are often inaccessible because of difficulties in travel, whereas in the inner cities the biggest difficulty appears to be in communication. People are unaware of the services to which they are entitled or, even if they are aware of them, they do not know how to avail of them.  This is an area to which the Minister, the Department and all public representatives should address themselves.  If the Minister were to turn his attention to this aspect of health care, in the longer term it would be more cost-effective than to be closing down maternity units and leaving people to travel distances of up to 100 miles.  The motion tonight is specifically about Bantry Hospital and the health board have backed the re-opening and the retention of the maternity unit there.  They want to develop a proper obstetrical service there.  There are very good reasons why that should be done.  As I said, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, before you came in, women are going to be asked to travel the distance from Nenagh to Dublin for maternity services.  I know what your reaction would be if somebody told you that in future the women of Nenagh would have to avail of maternity services only in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is a very big catchment area in south-west Cork, there is a high population of over 50,000, well above the average <Col N="1721" /> for a consultant obstetrician.  There are human and medical factors which are important once we are satisfied that the medical factor is satisfactory.  There are over 800 births annually in the region and it is understandable, when there is no obstetrician and obstetric unit, that women feel, perhaps wrongly, that the service is not as good as it might be. Nevertheless, women like to be delivered of their babies where there is an obstetrician and an obstetric service.  I have no doubt that if the Minister were to appoint an obstetrician there, he would find, similar to the situation in Cavan, that the number of deliveries would increase and that perhaps in the future it would be possible to appoint a second obstetrician and to have a major obstetrical service in Bantry.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision.  South-west Cork is possibly unique in Europe in having such a large area without any maternity service.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the various points raised, to write to the Southern Health Board telling them to re-open the maternity unit, to advertise for a <i>locum</i> obstetrician in the short-term and to make arrangements to ask An Chomhairle to recommend the appointment of a permanent obstetrician.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;endorses the action of the Minister for Health in not agreeing to the establishment of a consultant staffed obstetrical unit at Bantry Hospital and in seeking to ensure that the Southern Health Board make provision for scheduled consultant obstetrical ante and post natal clinics at the hospital and for coping with any maternity emergencies which may arise.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity of placing on the record of this House, the facts concerning maternity services at Bantry General Hospital.  I welcome the opportunity of counter-balancing in a very necessary way the unfounded allegations <Col N="1722" /> and, I suggest, misrepresentations which have been recklessly bandied about in the hospital for a number of months now and which have resulted only in sowing needless fears among the population affected, more particularly among mothers in the area.  I reject that.  I am surprised that members of the medical profession such as my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, should suggest on such evidence that I as a matter of policy am closing small maternity units around the country or that I as a matter of policy am discriminating against women.  I remind the Deputy in relation to his own health board area that one maternity unit, namely Trim, has been closed, and I am sure the Deputy will agree that it was closed on sound medical advice on the grounds that it was not safe for women to have their children in that unit.  As a consequence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I closed it, and there is not a GP or a consultant in the area who would not agree with that decision of the health board which I endorsed and implemented. Likewise the only other one closed in the country is Dungarvan, closed by the South Eastern Health Board, and, incidentally, closed on the casting vote of the Fianna Fáil chairman of the health board, Mr. Murphy, a sensible man.  There were 13 votes for and 13 against and he voted in favour.</P>

I want to return to the subject of Bantry General Hospital and I will finish by dealing with the broad allegations that have been made.  I have not said at any stage that I intended to diminish the maternity services in the Cavan-Monaghan area. What I said very clearly is that if the new hospital in Cavan is to have a number of obstetric beds which have been tabulated, a number of beds for gynaecology, a number of beds for paediatrics, then for the catchment area of Cavan and Monaghan only that number of beds would suffice for the totality of the area and there would be no logic in having maternity beds in the Monaghan hospital. I have said that to the board and I reiterate that statement.</P>

      <P>Therefore, looking back over my first 12 months I want to reiterate that whether it be Waterford, Cavan-Monaghan or County Meath.  I have not discriminated or attempted to discriminate against women.  It has been part of a general hospital situation.  For example, I have received a unanimous recommendation from the Midland Health Board, including Fianna Fáil <Col N="1724" /> members on the board, that we should close the surgical hospital in Longford. That will be done in due course.  In Dublin, again with absolute unanimity from the medical profession, from paediatric consultants, from everybody involved including the board of the hospital, I have closed St. Ultan's Hospital. Lest one might think that I am discriminating down the country I emphasise that that is in Dublin.  Mercer's Hospital in Dublin has closed.  A great deal has been happening and in a corrective way because, above all, I have not adopted what I call the &ldquo;born again hospital promises&rdquo; policy of the Opposition party that it does not matter what hospital, what county, district hospitals, general hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, maternity hospitals, all that has to happen &mdash; as happened last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is for some deputation to walk in to the party opposite and say &ldquo;We want this, we want that, regarding hospital development&rdquo; and automatically it is conceded whether the case is justified or not, as we see here this evening.  I am shocked that an eminent person such as Deputy O'Hanlon should walk in here and say in regard to Comhairle na nOspidéal, the statutory body for the appointment of consultants throughout this country in the specialities of obstetrics, gynaecology and paediatrics that the guidelines of 1,500 to 2,000 births no longer exist as far as his party are concerned.  In fact he said a few minutes ago that the guideline of 1,500 even does not exist.  Where do we go from there? One must beg the question; what is their policy?  I do not know, but I want to get back to the subject of Bantry and I have taken long enough in dealing with the points raised here this evening by the Fianna Fáil Party spokespersons on a very emotional issue where anybody can inflame local opinion and create fears needlessly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> Up to the beginning of 1983, the obstetric unit at Bantry General Hospital was the responsibility of the county physician in the hospital.  In terms of present-day organisation of services, this situation was rather unique.  While being unique, there can be no suggestion that the level of service provided by the county physician has over the years been anything but of the highest order.  I am sure the Government and Opposition would pay that tribute to the county physician. In February of this year, because of the absence through illness of the county physician, it was necessary to close the obstetric unit in the hospital. Arising from that closure, I received a proposal from the Southern Health Board that I should agree to the appointment of an obstetrician/gynaecologist to Bantry General Hospital.  I would put it on record that there never has been a consultant appointment in the history of Bantry General Hospital.  Let us be clear about that because an enormous amount of propaganda is put out about that situation. My Cork memory suggests that former Deputy Tom O'Higgins, at present Chief Justice, worked in that hospital.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1970 the Cork Health Authority &mdash; the predecessor of the Southern Health Board &mdash; submitted a proposal to the Department of Health for the appointment of an obstetrician/Gynaecologist at the hospital.  This was pursued with the Department in the succeeding years and the Deputy's Party were in power then and in 1972 when his Party were in office the Department informed the Southern Health Board that they were not prepared to approve the proposal.  Comhairle na nOspidéal, to whom the proposal had also been referred, indicated that they, too, did not approve of the creation of the post.  I see an eminent member of the comhairle here tonight who is relatively youthful and was not a member then, but our medical colleague on the back benches will be well aware of the background.</P>
    <P>When the health board requested my approval to the appointment of an obstetrician &mdash; gynaecologist in May of this year, I carried out a most comprehensive examination of all the factors involved. <Col N="1726" /> In considering this situation, I was conscious of the fact that perhaps, of all medical specialities, obstetric services, because of their nature, and the many issues involved including some of the emotional implications raised this evening, require the most sensitive approach in arriving at any decision.  My approach was to consider the problem solely from the point of view of how the best possible obstetric service could be provided for the women of the area.  That, we would all agree, is a fundamental issue &mdash; not scoring party political points against a Deputy or trying to embarrass somebody in the House on the issue.</P>
    <P>The requirements of an obstetric service have been examined in great detail in recent years.  Consequently, I had available to me a substantial body of advice on the matter.  This advice was unanimous, I stress, in its recommendations that the well-being of both mother and baby is best assured when the birth takes place in a unit staffed by consultant obstetrician &mdash; gynaecologists backed by the immediate availability of a paediatrician experienced in neo-natology.  It would be of use to Deputies and indeed to the many other concerned people around the country, if I quoted some relevant sections of this advice.</P>
    <P>For instance, in the 1976 document produced by Comhairle na nOspidéal on the development of hospital maternity services, it is emphatically stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the basic aims of ensuring safe delivery and giving the infant the best chance of optimal health and normal development are to be achieved, every expectant mother should have ready access to care at a consultant-staffed obstetric-neo-natal unit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Surely no one in this House can argue against these basic aims.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the same document it is also stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An individual is probably at greater risk during the first week of life than at <Col N="1727" /> any other period up to the age of forty. Once the first week has been safely passed, his requirements in relation to medical care are greatly reduced.  In fact, the situation has been reached in recent times where the needs of the infant, as much as those of the mother, dictate the circumstances in which deliveries occur.  It follows that no obstetric unit can function effectively without its complementary neo-natal paediatric service.  Thus, in the modern maternity service, obstetricians and paediatricians must function as complementary medical teams.  There is good reason to believe that there are individual suffering from physical or mental handicap which might have been avoidable had they been delivered in the circumstances (quoted already) rather than in less favourable conditions which prevailed when they were born.</P>
    <P>These strong arguments were further emphasised in the comhairle's document on the development of hospital paediatric services published in 1979.  It is relevant to quote finally from the submission of the Irish Paediatric Association to the comhairle when it was preparing the document. The association stated:</P>
    <P>The situation in rural areas is worsened by the demands of distance and the misconception that social conveniences in terms of small units close to home outweighs the advantages of delivery in a hospital with full neo-natal services.  Such small units can never, in our economy, be properly staffed.  The lessons of other developed countries in terms of neo-natal morbidity have yet to be learnt by many in the medical profession in this country.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that advice on the basis that it obviously affords the best safeguards for mothers and the best care for the new-born infants.  Particularly I was concerned about the care of the new-born infants, I have no hesitation in recommending and agreeing to the organisation of services which can contribute to the elimination of circumstances which could <Col N="1728" /> contribute to, for example, the development of mental handicap.  Not just to those who are intimately involved in the controversy concerning Bantry hospital, but also to those involved in similar campaigns throughout the country, I say that I am not prepared, and never will be prepared, to sacrifice what I believe to be the best services for mothers and children for the transient kudos that might be associated with glib and party political agreement to pressures for the continuation or development of services about which I have the most serious reservations. I intend to apply that principle for whatever duration I shall be in this office, not just to west Cork which I know intimately, but to the country as a whole.  It is quite clear from the evidence I have given that the establishment of such consultant-staffed units have to be carefully considered for a number of reasons.</P>
    <P>One other very important reason, as anybody who has worked in a major or a relatively large hospital will agree is that it is most important that such a unit should not be grossly under-utilised.  I challenge anybody to suggest that in Bantry there would be more than, at the most optimistic, about six children born in any one week, averaging about 300 per annum.  At the moment the number is between 180 and 190.  The figure of 800 has been mentioned by Deputy O'Hanlon but I would point out that in the Dunmanway-Drimoleague area, for example, 37 to 45 miles from Cork city, out of the 142 children born there, which is supposed to be the catchment area of Bantry &mdash; which I believe to be a load of nonsense &mdash; 104 were born in Cork city. Women like to vote with their feet.  When it comes to having their babies, they know where to go.  They go to a hospital which will have consultant-staffed, expert services available to them.  Likewise in the Clonakilty area, which is 32 miles from Cork city, 180 children are assigned as having been born and of these 179 were born in Cork city, with one born in Bantry &mdash; and that was last year.  The total number of children assigned as having been born to these areas is 324 all within, at the very maximum a 45 miles radius.  Out of that number of children <Col N="1729" /> 283 were born in Cork city.  One would have to start deducting those, first of all, from the magical figure of 800.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the facts which I have to put before the House and these are some of the basic considerations which I took into account when arriving at a decision.  The basic statistics in relation to the area are, of course, that the catchment area of Bantry general hospital has a population of about 55,000. In 1982 the total number of births assigned to mothers for the whole of the catchment area was 823 &mdash; I have already referred to 324 of them &mdash; of which 191 took place in the maternity unit of Bantry general hospital.  There is no evidence to suggest that for the foreseeable future the number of births in the area would be much in excess of that number.  That whole area includes Bantry, Casteltownbere, Clonakilty, Dunmanway, Drimoleague, Skibbereen, Schull, Goleen and Ballydehob.  I assure the Deputies that the vast majority of births take place in Cork.  Last year 533 out of the 800 mothers had their children in Cork city. We middle-aged politicians play politics with mothers having their children.  That is what we are doing for narrow political gain.  I am concerned about the 533 mothers who came to Cork city in 1982 and had their children in fully serviced consultant units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1730" /> I am shocked that Deputy O'Hanlon should suggest a <i>locum</i> consultant.  As a member of An Comhairle Deputy Ormonde would be aghast to hear that type of thing.  If you appoint a consultant into an area, what do you expect him to do in this day and age as a member of the medical union?  Work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year?  The days of single handed consultants are gone.  You have to appoint two.  As the Deputy knows, most of them will tell you to hump off.  They have to go on holiday. They get sick.  They need weekends off. When I appoint a consultant, I appoint him on a common contract 33½ hour week.  Therefore we need two, and none of this nonsense about single handed consultants working in isolation in hospitals. That day is over.  That is another reason why this type of utility proposition cannot be accepted.</P>
    <P>I have informed the Southern Health Board that there are problems in Bantry. I do not deny that.  There are problems of distance for some of the mothers.  I accept that the road network is not particularly good in the area.  I also accept that we have to make arrangements for the area.  I have informed the Southern Health Board that I could not agree to the development of a consultant staffed obstetric unit at Bantry general hospital. I do not believe I could find a consultant who would be prepared to live in Bantry. As far back as 19 October An Comhairle sent a letter to the health board saying they would not agree to the suggestion. I could not expect any consultant to live in Bantry and supervise the delivery of five or six children a week at maximum.</P>
    <P>How would one operate on a paediatric basis apart from anything else?  I have informed the Southern Health Board that we must ensure that we make regular provision for scheduled consultant obstetric out-patient clinics at Bantry hospital.  I have asked the board to make arrangements to cope with any maternity emergency which may arise.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with attempts to drag the circumstances of the unfortunate deaths of two infants into the campaign since the unit closed.  That reflects very <Col N="1731" /> poorly on those involved.  Lest there be any unnecessary fears on that score, I want to state clearly that these deaths cannot be attributed to the facilities or expertise available in Bantry general hospital or any other hospital in the health board area.  I have had the most detailed investigation carried out in my Department and at health board level into these two infant deaths.  The population of the area can rest assured in that regard.  I deplore the hysteria which has been generated. I am making those arrangements with the Southern Health Board in relation to scheduled consultant obstetric out-patient clinics at Bantry hospital.  It is of interest to note that these out-patient consultant services did not exist to that extent in terms of the formal arrangement now proposed for the Bantry area.</P>
    <P>I do not profess to have any particular medical knowledge.  I am the father of four children and I recall that my wife made three or four hospital visits on a prenatal and an antenatal basis.  As Deputies will agree prenatal care is of critical importance.  These consultants attending in Bantry on a regular basis will provide effective antenatal care for expectant mothers, a service which does not exist at the moment in that area.</P>
    <P>Last Friday night I attended a medical union conference.  I spoke to many members of the union from Munster, both consultants and general practitioners. Not one of them criticised my decision. They were representative of all political parties.  They all said it was a terrible shame that, for narrow political gain, politicians in Leinster House were creating this stir.</P>
    <P>I have received very detailed submissions from the three Deputies in the constituency. I want to pay credit to Deputy Walsh, Deputy Sheehan and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, and also my colleague in the adjoining constituency, Deputy Creed.  They have made calm, rational and understandable representations to me.  They have not played politics. For political gain some local interests are forcing the hands of Deputies.  I have spoken to the professional staff of the Southern Health Board and privately <Col N="1732" /> to members of the health board in the area and they all agree with my decision. They believe it is the sane and sensible thing to do.</P>
    <P>We will develop effective maternity out-patient services for the hospital, and I will keep a very close watch on the situation.  I will make arrangements for emergencies which may arise.  In any health board area an emergency may arise.  For example, a woman in Arklow who has to travel 50 miles to Dublin to attend the maternity hospital in Loughlinstown or in the Coombe may have to face an emergency, or a woman living in Cabra may face a maternity emergency and may not reach hospital in time to have the matter dealt with despite the best efforts of everybody.  Emergencies will arise.  Thank God 90 per cent of mothers have no problems.  With effective antenatal care and consultancy services, these emergencies will be anticipated as far as is humanly possible and dealt with effectively.</P>
    <P>Now that I have had an opportunity to outline the circumstances to Deputies, we should continue this debate in a calm atmosphere.  We should make the necessary arrangements for a proper maternity service in the area.  I will do that. Despite the extreme difficulties facing me as Minister for Health, I will endeavour to ensure that we have an effective health service.  The problem is compounded by a plethora of promises.  We have yet to deal with the question of Carlow.  I am surprised it was not mentioned tonight. That is another promise which was made and which would cost another £500,000.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this debate has cleared the air. I welcome the observations made by Deputy Ormonde who is a member of An Comhairle.  We can achieve a unity of purpose if we leave narrow party political gain out of it in this Chamber.  Our job is to look after the women of Ireland, their infants and their problems.  Politics come second to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case for the retention and maintenance of the obstetric unit in Bantry hospital.  This crisis has not been precipitated by political expediency, as the Minister tried to <Col N="1733" /> suggest; it was precipitated by the unfortunate illness of Dr. McCoy.  I want to pay tribute to Dr. McCoy for the excellent and outstanding work he has done for a number of years in Bantry hospital. I live in the west Cork area and to my knowledge there has been no political opportunism so far as this very critical matter is concerned.</P>
      <P>In support of the case for the retention of this unit in Bantry I would like to point out that there were 823 births in the area last year.  If we take a conservative figure, 500 or 600 of those births would have been in Bantry hospital if the maternity facilities had been provided there.  In that case the expenditure incurred would be justified.  As the Minister pointed out, there is a catchment area of 55,000 people in west Cork and, thankfully, that figure is increasing.  In the summertime the population doubles, because west Cork is a very beautiful area and many people visit it during their summer holidays.  The Minister and his Minister of State, with their backgrounds in west Cork, should realise that the hospital unit has to cater for a doubling of the population for perhaps three months of the year and that should be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What makes Bantry unique is the distance from the nearest maternity facilities. Bantry is almost 60 miles from Cork city, which provides the nearest facility and there are at least four peninsulas, the Sneem Peninsula in Kerry, Bere Peninsula, Kilcrohane and the Mizen Peninsula. This shows we are not talking about an isolated headland but a vast area.  We must also take into account the islands off the coast.  Expectant mothers have to travel long journeys to Cork city now that the Minister has decided to turn down the request to have this facility reopened and maintained.  I ask the Minister to consider those who have to travel in the winter months, perhaps a concerned husband trying to take his wife to Cork city trying to get through Healy Pass, the Pass of Keimaneigh, the Goats Pass, just to mention a few of the difficult passes and mountainous areas these people have to travel to get to Cork city.  On humanitarian grounds alone I ask the Minister to give this matter further consideration. <Col N="1734" /> Some of my colleagues are members of Comhairle na Ospidéal, but while they take into account only the medical factors involved in this issue, the human factors should outweigh all other considerations. Again, I ask the Minister to take them into account.</P>
    <P>This difficult terrain has been recognised by a number of Government Departments and has been given special consideration by people as far away as Brussels.  West Cork has been designated a severely handicapped area and in the directives the people in Brussels have allowed higher rates of grants and have given better rates of development grants for the west Cork area.  If it was possible to have west Cork designated as a special area for agricultural purposes, I cannot see why the Department of Health cannot consider it a special area too.  It can be said that no other part of Ireland suffers the same remoteness and has the same problems, with low density of population, a very low number of telephones per household, a small number of cars per household and a high number of medical card holders.  A recent figure suggested that up to 60 per cent of the families in that area are in possession of medical cards.  Medical card holders deserve as good facilities in their local areas as the more fortunate people in the urban and built-up areas.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take into account the distance people have to travel, not just from one area but from several areas. Not alone has that distance to be travelled by the mother but in some cases she has to spend quite some time in the hospital before the birth.  This can cause a certain amount of suffering because the husband, or father, and his young children live enormous distances in time and miles from the wife or mother.  That is not good for the mother's health.  Not only economics should be taken into account when making a local service available to the people, and especially the mothers, in the west Cork area.  We must also take into account the dangers of a long journey to Cork city.  We are a great people for doing things after the event, but I would like to warn the Minister that sooner or later there will be a <Col N="1735" /> tragedy because of the lack of this service in Bantry.</P>
    <P>The original report of Comhairle na nOspidéal issued in 1976 and a discussion document issued in 1979.  At that time there were various agencies and bodies thinking big.  At that time the Mansholt plan was produced for agriculture and farmers were told that unless they had 100 acres or more they would not have a viable holding.  The IDA for a few years after that spent millions of pounds trying to attract super industries here but at the end of the day we have more people unemployed than the total employed in those large industries.  The IDA have come to the conclusion that big is no longer beautiful and that the small compact industry is better.  In fact, small industries are being promoted by that body today.  The bureaucrats in Brussels have come to the same conclusion and I have no doubt that the new farm package will promote the smaller units.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in due course Comhairle na nOspidéal and the planners in the Department of Health will reach a similar conclusion, that we should not have all the service in palatial buildings in Dublin, Cork and other major centres of population and leave remote areas without any facilities.</P>
    <P>I appeal to my colleagues, Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Sheehan, to support this motion and continue their efforts to have this facility retained in Bantry hospital. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision.  He should bear in mind the anxiety of women living in remote areas who when they go into labour must travel long distances to a maternity unit. The Minister must reflect on the anxieties of pregnant women in west Cork now that the maternity facilities have been discontinued at Bantry hospital.  The Bantry area is unique because of its location, the low density of population and the lack of proper communications.  It deserves to be given sympathetic treatment and economic expediency should not take precedence over the care of patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be given an opportunity to speak on this motion.  Of paramount importance in this debate must be the health of mothers and children.  The Minister and the Department when making decisions must give priority to mothers and children and that does not appear to be the reasoning of the Opposition side.  The Opposition are solely concerned with political expediency and that is to be regretted particularly when the motion is moved by a Member who is a medical practitioner.  The best facilities must be made available for all our people.  The fact that people live in remote areas should not mean that they should be asked to accept anything less than the best.  The Opposition in their efforts are asking the people of the area to accept a second-class service.  They will not admit that because it is not in their political interests to do so.  If we put mothers and children in second place to political interests we are in serious trouble.</P>
      <P>Bantry had a first class physician, one of the traditional type medical practitioners who was so conscientious that he ran himself into bad health.  Such people are no longer in practice and we now have in the medical profession highly specialised people in the areas of obstetrics, gynaecology and paediatrics.  If mothers are to be given the best treatment they must be permitted to avail of the services in the larger hospitals.  To ask them to accept anything less is to put them at risk.  Deputy O'Hanlon told the House that 95 per cent of births were all right and 5 per cent would be at risk.  I should like to know who the Deputy is prepared to put at risk.  I do not think there should be any question of putting a percentage of people at risk.  People must be permitted to avail of the best services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that there is some validity in the argument about distances but that must be weighed against whether it is better to have a limited maternity service or a full service such as is available at the larger hospitals.  The figures for the area give a clear indication of what the position is.  Of the 823 births in the area 191 <Col N="1737" /> were delivered in Bantry.  Of the 180 births in Clonakilty 179 were delivered in Cork.  In my view, mothers went to Cork because they knew they would get the best service and that the expertise would be available if any difficulties arose.  I do not think such services would be available if we adopted the Fianna Fáil suggestion. If the Fianna Fáil view were accepted children would be put at risk.  Of the births in Skibbereen 75 were delivered in Cork city and 14 in Bantry.  With regard to the areas of Skull, Goleen and Ballydehob districts 11 births took place in Bantry and 17 in Cork.  From those statistics Members can see that we are not imposing anything on those people.  We are simply adhering to the wishes of the people whose choice is to go to Cork City.  In the catchment area 533 deliveries took place in Cork City as against 191 in Bantry.  Those figures are a damning indictment of the case being put forward by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch as ucht an seans a thug tú dom an cheist seo a phlé sa Dáil anocht.  Ní rabhamar sásta le freagraí an Aire inniú ar Cheist 20.  Is fíor nár thug sé aon fhreagra ar bith ar an chuid is mó de na ceisteanna a chuir mé air.</P>
      <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta have an outstanding record of success in attracting industrial enterprises to Gaeltacht regions.  Since 1981 industrial employment has consistently increased in Gaeltacht areas.  From January 1981 to June 1983 full-time employment in industries promoted by Údarás na Gaeltachta has risen from 4,011 to 4,300.  One must remember that the authority serves an area with a population of only 80,000. This increase occurred at a time when the rest of the country is suffering massive unemployment.  The success of Údarás na Gaeltachta is clearly established in the statistics I have given.</P>
      <P>In the mid-seventies some enterprises were grant-aided which were not established on a sound commercial basis and many closures occurred and losses were heavy.  However, since the establishment in 1980 of Údarás na Gaeltachta many of the lossmakers run by the previous body, Gaeltarra Éireann, have been closed down and stricter commercial criteria have been applied.  Under An tÚdaras there has been a reduction in the losses in their own subsidiary companies from more than £3 million in 1980 to £2 million in 1981 and a small profit was achieved in June 1983.  It has been a record of great success and an example to other industrial-promoting bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new policy which has achieved such great success has been spearheaded by the new chief executive, Frank Flynn, who took over in July 1981.  A comment on the work of An tÚdaras was conveyed in the recent Trident Report which was carried out by an independent group of consultants.  That report shows that Údarás na Gaeltachta have a positive effect on economic development in the Gaeltacht and they have proved themselves to be a successful development <Col N="1739" /> agency by national and international standards.</P>

      <P>I would direct the attention of the Deputy to the fact that he requested permission to raise the subject matter of Question No. 20.  I hope the Deputy will relate his remarks to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will as far as I can.  The new board with democratically elected members, sitting with ministerial appointees under the chairmanship of Mayo County Manager, Mr. O'Malley, had undoubtedly worked very hard and the success achieved brought morale in the organisation to a new high.  This new organisation that had been brought into existence against the bitter opposition of some members of Fine Gael began to exert a dynamic influence for good throughout the Gaeltacht regions.  However, those in Fine Gael who had opposed the establishment of a separate Gaeltacht authority commenced an insidious campaign to discredit the organisation. One Deputy in particular carried out a mean, vindictive campaign of negative obstruction, aided by an outside individual whose motives were never clear to me.  The Official Report gives extensive evidence of the unhelpful, negative attitude adopted by Deputy Michael Begley of south Kerry since the Údarás were established.  I have not spoken in the Dáil debates as I was satisfied that our party's spokesperson dealt with the situation satisfactorily on all occasions.</P>
      <P>However, I regret that recent events, particularly the meeting of Údarás last Saturday and the speculation in the newspapers today that the Government intend firing members of the board and the chief executive, have left me no option but to draw the attention of Dáil Éireann and the Irish people to the ugly campaign of vindictiveness now being waged openly by this Minister and this Government, egged on by Deputy Begley&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask the Deputy to come to the question.</P>

    <Col N="1740" />
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>He is solely responsible for the disgraceful campaign which now seems to have the support of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and all on that side of the House.  Surely there are some decent, fairminded people on the Government side who will stand up and call halt?</P>
      <P>Two years ago approximately Eamon Delaney, an employee of Údarás na Gaeltachta, asked if he could call to discuss with me an important personal matter that was causing him great concern. Mr. Delaney unfolded a story of intrigue that astonished me.  He explained how he had been approached by a former employee of Gaeltarra Éireann who told him he was acting for the Minister who wanted information on the workings of Údarás and that he was being approached as a person the Government could trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has broadened the scope of the question.  If he would relate his remarks to the question it would make the matter easier for the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Chair hears all I have to say he will agree it is relevant. Mr. Delaney took it that the Minister was instructing him to report on certain matters to assist in a Government review of the operations of An tÚdarás.  Mr. Delaney dutifully wrote the letter he was requested to write and handed it to this person who handed it not to the Minister but to Deputy Begley, then a junior Minister in another Department.  Deputy Begley went post haste to Deputy O'Toole, Minister for the Gaeltacht, with this letter.  When the Minister chose to ignore the contents of the letter Deputy Begley went public with it with an extensive interview in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> to force the hand of the Minister.  Mr. Delaney was shocked that a confidential letter he had written for the Minister should now be the subject of press speculation following Deputy Begley's action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mean, vindictive use made by Deputy Begley of Mr. Delaney's confidential letter made it look as though Eamon Delaney had, of his own volition, <Col N="1741" /> deliberately written things on paper for the Minister's eyes which were uncomplimentary to Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would relate his remarks to the question it would put the Chair at ease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Eamon Delaney was an honourable person who never did anything underhand in his life and he was greatly distressed that it might seem as if he had broken trust with his employer and his colleagues on the staff.  This good man who had been used in this way by unscrupulous people was so distressed by all of this that he suffered a heart attack within a few days of his relating the story to me.  He died instantly from this massive attack.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam naomhtha.  To this day Eamon Delaney's good name had not been cleared officially. The Minister has a duty to do so.</P>
      <P>Despite such a tragic outcome, the conspiracy against the Údarás continued. Despite an investigation by the Fraud Squad which the Minister knows showed there was no basis for any case against Údarás, the conspiracy continued.  Evidence of this vindictive conspiracy abounds.</P>
      <P>The Minister's assistant whom I mentioned today, Mr. Benson, was overheard in conversation with a journalist and an allegation followed that Mr. Benson was collaborating with a named journalist in a series of articles damaging to An Údarás.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that legal advice has judged the allegation to be well founded.  I call now on the Minister to place this matter before an independent tribunal and to let the public <Col N="1742" /> judge whether there is a conspiracy. Would the Minister deny he has instructed Fine Gael members of the board of Údarás to obstruct in every way possible the working of Údarás and that this has been done by them since June 1983?  Would the Minister deny he has countenanced the possession by Deputy Begley of Údarás confidential documents relative to a company in County Galway? Would the Minister deny that he is aware that the Garda are investigating an alleged statutory breach of confidentiality by a Fine Gael member of the board?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair will allow me I will do so.  Would the Minister deny that it has been stated publicly by a Fine Gael member of the board that the Government have decided to replace appointed members of the board in order to contrive the dismissal of the chief executive of Údarás?  I understand the Minister has stated he is not satisfied with information received regarding a loan to an Údarás-promoted company.  If this is so, would he deny he has refused to meet the chairman and chief executive at the request of the board of Údarás where the matter might be cleared up once and for all?</P>
      <P>Is it not further evidence of this petty, vindictive conspiracy that the Minister would go so far as to refuse to announce new projects bringing new jobs to Gaeltacht areas?  Deputy O'Toole's ministry has been one of dismal failure for Gaeltacht areas.  Road grants have been cut completely, there has been no increase to mná tí, there has been a major cutback in capital grants to Údarás na Gaeltachta, he has delayed development of the Rossaveal harbour with a loss of 200 jobs and he is creating complete confusion about the future operations of Údaras na Gaeltachta, the major industrial job-promoting body for Gaeltacht areas.  He should drop this vindictive campaign or resign or move over to some other Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Údarás have been doing their job <Col N="1743" /> well as is evident from some of the figures I have put before the House.  I ask the Minister to stop the obstruction.  This thing has gone on too long and it has gone too far.  It is time the Taoiseach took a personal interest in this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is é an fáth go ndeirim sin ná gur ghlac mé i gcónai go raibh saibhreas sa Ghaeltacht nach bhfuil in áit ar bith eile sa tír.  Ní hionann é agus saibhreas maoine.  Séard atá ann ná saibhreas cultúir, saibhreas intleachta &mdash; saibhreas ár ndaoine.  Má imíonn sé ní bheimid in ann é a fháil ar ais.</P>
      <P>Tá sa Ghaeltacht eagras ar a dtugtar Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Bunaíodh an tÚdarás mar saghas comharba ar Ghaeltarra Éireann chun go mbeidh slí maireachtála ag muintir na Gaeltachta mar atá ag chuile dhuine eile sa tír.  Is cúis díomá domsa, cúis fíor-dhíomá dom, go mór-mhór le bliain anuas, go bhfuil ionsaí á dhéanamh ar Údarás na Gaeltachta. Nuair a bhí mise mar urlabhraí ar an nGaeltacht thug me faoi Ghaeltarra Éireann faoi rudai áirithe, abair, nuair a chuir siad tuairisc bhliantiúil os comhair an Tí, nuair a bhí daoine dá bhfostú acu agus gan fianaise go raibh siad ag obair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Glacaim gur ceart i gcónaí, go bhfuil dualgas orainn, tabhairt faoi rud ar bith nach mbreathnaíonn i gceart.  Ach, is é an rud nach dtaithníonn liomsa faoin Údarás ná go bhfuil na ráflaí seo ann, go bhfuil an innuendo seo ann.  Má tá rud ar bith ag déanamh imní do Theachta ar bith cén fáth nach n-abraíonn sé sa Teach é?  Cén fáth go mbeadh aon leisce air é a rá taobh amuigh den Teach?  Ach i nainm <Col N="1744" /> Dé caithfimid cothrom na Féinne a thabhairt don Údarás mar gach uair a laghdaítear ar an reputation atá ag an Údarás laghdaitear ar tábhacht na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Glacaim nach dteastaíonn ón Aire go mbeadh an laige sin ann, agus sin é an fáth go bhfuil mé ag iarraidh air anois agus go raibh mé ag iarraidh air inniu nach leor é a rá go raibh sé ag caint leis an Údarás ar an 20 lá den mhí seo caite. Má tá an deacracht seo ann ba cheart don Aire bheith i gcomhairle leis an Údarás chuile lá go dtí go gcuirfidh siad aon deacrachtaí atá ann in ord.  Má tá fianaise aige nach bhfuil rudaí ag dul ar aghaidh mar is cóir, tá dualgas ar an Aire teacht isteach anseo agus é á rá, ach níl aon mhaith sa chiúineas nuair nach bhfuilimid cinnte go bhfuil rud ar bith ar strae.  Glacaim go bhfuil chuile dhuine atá ina bhall den Údarás, chuile dhuine atá ag obair don Údarás, níos díograsaí faoina gcuid oibre ná mar atáimuid féin, ach nílimid ag tabhairt cothrom na Féinne dóibh nó do mhuintir na Gaeltachta má fhananimid ciúin agus an ionsaí á dhéanamh. Glacaim leis an méid atá ráite ag an Teachta Molloy.  Muna gcloisim ón Aire freagraí ar na ceisteanna seo, ní bheidh aon dul as agam ach glacadh leis an méid atá ráite nach bhfuil bunús ar bith leis an ionsaí seo, ach go bhfuil leisce ar an Aire cosaint a dhéanamh ar na daoine atá neamhurchóideach.

    <P>Ach céard a thárla.  Ar feadh ceithre bliana gheall an Comhrialtas go mbeadh <Col N="1745" /> an tÚdarás ann, ach níor éirigh leis an Aire an tÚdarás a chur ar bun.  Níl mise ag fáil locht ar bith ar an Aire.  Rinne sé a chion féin don Ghaeltacht mar Aire agus níl achasán ar bith á chaitheadh leis, ach ní bhfuair sé tacaíocht ar bith óna pháirtí féin leis an Údarás a chur ar bun. Níor éirigh leis an tÚdarás a chur ar bun &mdash; bhí sé ceithre bliana ag iarraidh é a dhéanamh ach níor éirigh leis.  Tá sé le feiceáil anois chuile lá nár theastaigh Údarás ariamh ó Fhine Gael.

    <P>Le dhá bhliain tá caint ar rudaí atá in n-ainm a bheith ag tárlú sa Ghaeltacht, gadaíocht agus rudaí eile den chineál sin. Tugadh isteach an DPP le scrúdú a dhéanamh ar chomhlachtaí sa Ghaeltacht. Cuirim ceist ar an Aire anois: an bhfuil toradh an scrúdú le fáil?  Má tá, an innseoidh sé dúinn cén toradh a bhí ar na scrúduithe sin?  An innseoidh sé do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus don Dáil cén toradh a bhí ann?  Táimid ag fanacht air le fada an lá ach tá an tAire ina shuí ansin ag déanamh tada chun an t-eolas sin a chur os cómhair na Dála nó na tíre.</P>
    <P>Ag caint ar fhiosrúchán, ba mhaith liom a fháil amach céard dúirt an tAire leis an Údarás faoi fhiosrúchán?  Tá a fhios agam céard adúradh ag Ard-Fheis Fhine Gael nuair a gheall an tAire go poiblí go gcuirfí an fiosrúchán ar siúl agus go ndéanfaí scrúdú ar chuile ghné de chaitheachas san Údarás.  Cén uair a thárlós an fiosrúchán seo?  An bhfuil an tAire in ann é sin a innsint dúinn anocht? An dtárlóidh sé nó cén uair a tharlóidh sé?</P>
    <P>Rud eile, tá ceist muiníne san Údarás, agus tá mise ag tabhairt seans don Aire anocht, an fichiú uair ar feadh an lae, an bhfuil muinín aige san Údarás? Dhiúltaigh sé freagra a thabhairt inné nuair a chuireadh an cheist air ar chlár raidio agus dhiúltaigh sé freagra a thabhairt dom inniu sa Dáil nuair a chuir mé an cheist chéanna air &mdash; an bhfuil muinín aige san Údarás?  Má tá, an innseoidh sé dúinn anocht go bhfuil, agus go bhfuil sé sásta leis an obair atá á déanamh acu ar mhaithe leis an Ghaeltacht?  Tá an ceist seo faoi chaibidil ró-fhada agus tá dochar á dhéanamh don Údarás.  Níl siad in ann <Col N="1746" /> a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh, deirtear.  Cé h-iad nach bhfuil ag déanamh a gcuid oibre?  Tá daoine i bPáirtí Fhine Gael go síorraí ag caitheamh anuas orthu, ag caitheamh drochmheas orthu, agus an tAire ag tabhairt tacaíochta dóibh, os rud é nach bhfuil sé sásta teacht isteach anseo agus an tÚdarás a chosaint, nó dul ar aghaidh leis an bhfiorúcháin atá geallta le fáil amach céard tá mícheart leis an Údarás agus gan a bheith ag ligint don rud seo bheith ag dul ar aghaidh ar feadh na blianta.  Chuir sé féin ceisteanna nuair a bhí sé sa bhFhreasúra.  Iarraim air anois mar Aire deireadh a chur leis na ráflaí seo ar fad agus an rud a cur ar bhealach amháin nó ar bhealach eile.  Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire anocht, mar dhuine ón iarthar, nó mar dhuine a bhfuil fearúlacht ann gan a bheith ag tabhairt áird ar dhaoine atá go siorraí ag clamhsán, gligíní casta, cama, nimhneacha nach ndeineann tada ach clamhsán ó mhaidin go hoíche.  Cuireadh an tAire deireadh leis mar dhuine ón iarthar, agus mar dhuine a bhfuil fearúlacht ann, agus cuireadh sé an tÚdarás agus an Ghaeltacht ar a bhonn arís mar is cóir.</P>

Tá an toradh céana a bhí le feiceáil nuair a bhí an Teachta agus a cháirde thall ar an taobh seo den Teach agus bhí an rud céanna ar siúl an t-am sin.  Dúradh chomh maith go bhfuil díultaithe agam an cathaoirleach agus an príomh-fheidhmeannach fheiceál.  Ba mhaith liom a rá leis an Teachta Molloy gur bhuail mé le Cathaoirleach an Udaráis inné.  Ba mhaith liom a rá leis an Teachta gur scanallach an rud é ainm fir atá caillte, go ndéanfa Dia grásta air, agus go dtug mise onóir dó ar an taobh sin den Teach mar go raibh a fhios agam gur fear ionraic a bhí ann.

Bhuail mé le feidhmeannaigh an Údaráis leo féin; bhuail mé leis an bpríomh-fheidhmeannach leis féin agus leis an gcathaoirleach leis fein níl fhios agam cé mhéid uair ó ceapadh mé <Col N="1749" /> an t-am deireannach.  Tá mise ag seasamh anseo anocht le eolas a chuireann imní orm maidir le iasacht £170,000 agus níl sé de cheart ag éinne, muna bhfuil a fhios aige céard faoi a bhfuil sé ag caint a chos a chur ann agus an rud a chasadh toisc nach bhfuil an t-eolas aige.  Tá iarrtha agamsa don chéad uair ar an 11 Lúnasa agus arís ar an 30 Meán Fomhair eolas faoi leith a thabhairt dom faoi chuntas bainc, faoi ainmneacha daoine.  Tá sé de cheart agam agus de dhualgas orm faoi Alt 20 d'Act na Gaeltachta an e-eolas sin a iarraidh agus an t-eolas sin a fháil ón mbord.  Tá diúltaithe ní ag an mbord ach ag an bpríomh-fheidhmeannach an t-eolas sin a chur ar fáil don bhord ionas go gcuirfidh an Bord ar fáil domsa é.  Sin í an fhírinne.  Tá seans agam anois é sin a rá.  Níl an t-eolas fáighte agam maidir le cruinniú an tSathairn seo caite.  Níl cúntas ná tuarascáil oifigiúil fáighte agamsa go fóill.  Bhí mé caint leis an gcathaoirleach tráthnóna inné, tá sé ag cur tuarascala scríofa ar fáil dom faoi céard a thárla an Satharn seo caite.  Nuair a gheobhas mé é sin beidh sé le cur faoi bhráid an Rialtais ag an gcéad chruinniú eile&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are no funds at the disposal of my Department for any new State subsidised schemes of rural electrification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, a western package electrification scheme administered by my Department and jointly funded by <Col N="1573" /> the State and the EEC which provides aid towards the cost of connection of electricity supply to farms in the west of Ireland.  Qualified applicants in the designated counties will have to pay only 20 per cent of the total cost of connection. Details of the scheme and application forms are available from local ESB offices throughout the designated counties.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the ESB that approximately 99 per cent of existing rural houses are connected to the electricity supply.  In fact, since 1946 almost £158 million has been spent by the State and the ESB on rural electrification.</P>
    <P>I also understand from the ESB that under their present terms for the provision of electricity supply (other than to qualified applicants under the western package) the board bear 40 per cent of the total cost of the work involved.  These terms, which are effectively a subsidy by the board, are of considerable assistance in reducing connection costs for individual consumers in rural areas.  In addition, facilities are available for payment of the applicant's contribution by instalments over a period of up to five years.</P>

In that context it should be noted that while the cost of the existing zero rating for books, referred to by the Deputy, is estimated at £6 million for 1984, the cost of a similar regime for newspapers and periodicals would be about £28 million; a reduction to the 5 per cent rate would cost about £22 million.</P>

      <P>Since 1979, loans totalling £1,179.81 million have been made available to this country by the European Investment Bank either from its own resources or from the resources of the New Community Instrument for Borrowing and Lending (NIC).  These loans have been concentrated mainly in helping to finance the main programmes of economic infrastructure notably telecommunications, energy, roads and water supply and sewerage. These programmes, e.g., telephone subscriber connections, electricity distribution link-ups, are by their nature very widely dispersed and cover every county.  The loans are related to the total cost of the programmes and it would not be practicable to give a county by county breakdown of the amounts involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of deserted wife's allowance/benefit is that a husband must have left his wife of his own volition.  The claim of the person concerned was disallowed as the deciding officer held that this condition was not satisfied in her case.  Written notification of the decision and the reason for the disallowance of her claim was sent to her on 14 February 1983.  She appealed against the decision and an oral hearing of the appeal at which she attended and gave evidence was held. The appeals officer upheld the decision refusing her claim and written notification of this was sent to her on 7 September 1983.</P>
      <P>The appeals officer's decision can only be reviewed in the light of new facts or fresh evidence which come to his notice. If any such are produced in this case they will be brought to the attention of the appeals officer.</P>
      <P>The conditions for entitlement to a deserted wife's allowance are prescribed by law and there is, therefore, a statutory obligation on officers of the Department to satisfy themselves that the conditions are fulfilled before payment can be made. It is frequently necessary to make extensive inquiries in these cases and when all inquiries have been completed it is the responsibility of the officer deciding the claim to make up his mind whether or not the conditions for entitlement are satisfied and decide the claim accordingly. It is no function of officers of the Department to ascribe blame in such cases nor do they attempt to do so.  The only concern of an officer deciding a claim is to find out whether or not the statutory conditions are fulfilled and give a decision accordingly.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 31 December 1982 to 10 October 1983, date of the latest medical evidence received. Payment of benefit was not, however, authorised as, according to the records of the Department, he has less than the required minimum of 26 contributions, paid or credited, in 1980/81, the contribution year governing his claim.</P>
      <P>Following the receipt of a previous Dáil question from the Deputy, an officer of my Department visited the claimant and established that he had not been insurably employed in the 1980/81 contribution year and is not, therefore, entitled to payment of benefit.</P>
      <P>The possibility of the person concerned having been insurably employed in 1982 is, however, at present being investigated. Any contributions due in respect of him for the period April to December 1982 would govern his entitlement to benefit from January next when a new benefit year commences.

      <P>The person concerned, whose husband died on 14 June 1983, has been awarded a widow's contributory pension at the weekly rate of £40.60 with effect from 29 July 1983.  This is the maximum rate of widow's contributory pension payable to a widow under 66 years with no qualified children.  Her late husband had been awarded a retirement pension of £65.95 from 5 May 1983 (increased to £73.90 from 30 June) which included an increase in respect of his wife and this pension was paid to her for six weeks after his death.</P>
      <P>A widow's pension book with orders payable from 28 October 1983 was sent to the designated post office on 19 October for collection by her and she was notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>A payable order for £452.80, being the arrears of widow's pension for the period 29 July to 27 October 1983, amounting to £527.80 less £75.00 supplementary welfare allowance paid to the claimant by the South-Eastern Health Board during that period, will be sent to her within the next few days.</P>

      <P>He does not qualify for retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts as he fails to satisfy the condition which requires him to have a yearly average of at least 24 Irish contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year to 5 April 1983, for example, the end of the last complete contribution year before he will reach age 65.  The Department's records show that he had a total of 378 contributions during this period, which is equal to a yearly average of only 12.</P>

    <P>He also has a record of British employment and, in accordance with EEC Regulations on Social Security, his Irish and British records have been combined to qualify him for a <i>pro-rata</i> rate pension.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Gaeltacht allowance has never been payable to gardaí serving in any area in County Cork.  When the allowance was introduced in 1934 it was decided that it would be paid only in areas where Irish was the general medium of speech and where all the members of the force were proficient in Irish and were required to perform their duties in Irish.  The areas where the allowance was to be paid were determined on the basis of districts.  These are Garda administrative areas&mdash;each comprising five or six stations &mdash; under the supervision of superintendents.  It was not regarded as practicable to arrange for members of the force in any particular station to conduct all their duties in Irish if Irish was not also in use at the district headquarters.  The allowance has continued to be paid to members at stations <Col N="1626" /> where it was originally paid and no change has taken place other than those brought about by the closing of stations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> In order to improve the Garda service for the population of the Tallaght area it has been the policy to assign extra gardaí to the area and it is accepted that the existing station there is no longer adequate to accommodate the number of gardaí now assigned to it.  Due to a lack of appropriate facilities, no ban-ghardaí are at present assigned to the station.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to replace the existing station by a new one to be erected within the precincts of the new town centre planned for Tallaght.  The necessary site has been secured and the plans for the new station are in the course of preparation. The station will provide high quality accommodation for the gardaí assigned there and facilities for banghardaí will be included.  It is hoped that the new station will be ready for occupation in approximately two years.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, it is considered that, even if suitable temporary accommodation were available, the cost of securing and adapting it would not be justified, having regard to the comparatively short time for which it would be required.  Some alleviation of the present difficulties has been made possible by the provision of portacabin accommodation.</P>

      <P>The implication of the Deputy's question that £2.85 million was allocated to Tralee Regional Technical College in 1983 is not correct.  The position is that architectural planning of the development is expected to be completed early in 1984.  The question of the allocation of capital for the project will then fall to be considered in the context of the availability of capital and the extent of the Department's commitments generally in 1984.</P>
