    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has yet completed his consultations with the Leader of Fianna Fáil regarding the proposed review of the Constitution which he referred to in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 1 of 15 February last; when proposals for the review will be laid before the Dáil; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not discussed the question of a constitutional review with the Leader of the main Opposition party.  I have, of course, had discussions with him and with others, including the Deputy and his party Leader, on the initiation <Col N="590" /> of consultations on the manner in which lasting peace and stability can be achieved in a new Ireland, through the democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to a question I put to the Taoiseach last February he indicated that he would like to discuss a review of the Constitution with the Leader of the Opposition.  In the light of the remarks made by the previous Taoiseach he gave us a clear understanding that consultations were to take place with Deputy Haughey&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on a constitutional review.  Is he now saying he has decided against this constitutional review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give a clear indication and I went on to refer to discussions that I might hold with the Leader of the Opposition.  I should add that I fully adhere to my view that it is necessary to have changes in the Constitution both in relation to requirements within the State and with a view to the reconciliation of the major traditions in Ireland.  In regard to the latter aspect, I believe it is highly desirable to proceed as far as possible by agreement between all the parties in Dáil Éireann.  The Government wish to expand the area of consensus and hope that the work of the New Ireland Forum will achieve that objective.  In the meantime the question of proceeding with the constitutional review will be kept under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Taoiseach manage to introduce the forum into a simple parliamentary question about constitutional review?  How does he propose to relate this question to the proposed forum on Northern Ireland which, from the consultations we had with him, had no bearing whatsoever on the constitutional position?  Will he explain that relationship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have thought it was fairly evident, given what I said <Col N="591" /> about the constitutional review when I first raised the matter in September 1981. I still believe it will be necessary to make changes in our Constitution but, as I said in a radio interview recently, I do not want to intrude that into the discussion in the forum context because we are trying to seek a measure of agreement on what would be a possible model for the future.  I went on to say in that radio interview that I do not want to bring forward any proposals now, or to raise issues, which might make it more difficult for the forum to do their job this year.</P>

      <P>A final supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this clear.  Am I to take it from the Taoiseach's reply that the subject under discussion in this forum is a new Constitution for this State or for the whole of Ireland?  If not, then the forum bears no relationship to the question put down by Deputy De Rossa or if it is, the House should know what precisely is the purpose of this forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear if the Deputy is being deliberately obtuse or is pretending to be, but it is clear to anybody who has followed events in the last couple of years that our immediate concern is to achieve the greatest measure of consensus possible in the forum as to possible ways of proceeding within this island towards securing peace and stability.  If at this point I were to take further action with regard to the constitutional review which was a matter upon which the major Opposition party found themselves in disagreement, that would prejudice the possibility of co-operation in the forum and I will do nothing to prejudice that co-operation which, I am glad to say, we have secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the final supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related to a promise given to this House that there would be a constitutional review and that <Col N="592" /> the Taoiseach would consult the Leader of Fianna Fáil to see how that review could be carried out.  Now we are told this review is not going ahead but we will have the forum which is a much broader&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;platform than this House.  It includes people who are not Members of this House.  Does the Taoiseach intend now or at any time in the future to engage Deputies in a review of the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My inclinations and wishes in that respect are well known.  I said in February that I would like to discuss the matter with the Leader of the Opposition and that I might do so.  Since then we have reached agreement on the establishment of the forum and to pursue the constitutional review at this time could make it more difficult to maintain and develop the consensus which has emerged.  Therefore, I feel it appropriate to leave the question of the constitutional review to one side during the relatively brief period of the life of the forum while leaving it open to revert to the matter at that point.  I will not be dragged into anything to prejudice the success of the forum and the achievement of the maximum degree of agreement within that context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism the action he proposes to take on foot of the recommendations of the report of the committee of inquiry into the cost and method of providing motor insurance in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Prices Advisory Committee made several recommendations in their very comprehensive report.  These recommendations will require action by a number of Government Departments <Col N="593" /> including my own, as well as some outside agencies.</P>
      <P>Urgent consideration is being given to the recommendations by all concerned and account is being taken of the views already submitted by interested parties. I hope to bring forward proposals to the Government as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will do my utmost to ensure that such action on the committee's recommendations as is considered desirable by the Government will be taken as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any substance in the suggestion that there are as many as 25 per cent of motorists uninsured?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no knowledge of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion that is a fairly speculative, top-of-the-head statistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is suggested that approximately £16 million is being lost because of the large number of uninsured motorists on our roads and that that money has to be taken up by those who are paying their way.  If that money could be collected it would mean a considerable reduction in insurance costs for people who are prepared to insure.  Is the Minister taking any steps to get these uninsured drivers off our roads?  This is a national scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the law with regard to car insurance is in force and it is not awaiting the outcome of these recommendations to make it obligatory for people to insure motor vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many potential insurers are being asked to pay more for car insurance than they are for rent or repayments on their houses?  This disproportionate expense is a disincentive for these people to insure. Would the Minister show his concern <Col N="594" /> including in the review younger drivers who are being discouraged from insuring their cars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism the steps he proposes to take to regulate the position of intermediaries and brokers concerned with insurances and related business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the question of the statutory regulation of intermediaries and brokers concerned with insurance and related business has been undergoing detailed consideration in my Department for some considerable time.  As yet no convincing case for such regulation has been made, but I understand that further proposals, especially in the area of related business, may be submitted by the interests concerned.</P>
      <P>In order to be effective such control would have to be comprehensive and restrictive and could involve substantial public service expenditure.  The benefits to be gained could be somewhat illusory, since persons who are prepared to act contrary to the law and the interests of their clients will not necessarily be deterred by statutory provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that any individual can set himself up as an insurance broker by simply putting up a plate outside his place of business without any regulations governing his activities, or any investigation into his financial solvency or his qualifications and so on which might fit him to be an insurance broker?  Does the Minister regard that as <Col N="595" /> a satisfactory way of having business continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the legitimate concern of the Deputy about operations in this area, it should be pointed out that in the United Kingdom a proposal along the lines which the Deputy would seem to imply has been in operation, was found totally unsatisfactory. I agree that it may be desirable to have a very close look at this area with a view to bringing in measures which would be effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that a system of self-regulation similar to that operating on the Continent should be encouraged by his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In a number of other areas where self-regulation has been introduced, it has proved successful. It is not an approach which I would dismiss.</P>

      <P>A final supplementary question, please, from Deputy Flynn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the situation that, when one does business with an insurance broker in the first instance, it is the broker who is responsible for funds, that there is no contract between the individual and the insurance company with which he would like to do business?  Consequently, if the broker goes bankrupt, the contributor in the first instance is at the loss. That is an unsatisfactory situation which should be rectified.  Will the Minister look into the matter to see if he can bring about a system of registration whereby the funds of ordinary customers will not be lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in reply to an earlier supplementary question by the Deputy, it is important not only that we take action but that any action which we do take would be effective action to clear up any irregularities which may be taking place in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is aware of the difficulties being experienced in different parts of the country by petrol retailers at this time; and if he proposes to take any steps to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the recommendation of the National Prices Commission, I allowed an increase of 2.13 pence per gallon, excluding VAT, in the retailers' gross profit margin on petrol, with effect from 1 March 1983.  I do not propose to take any further steps in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in certain areas around the country at this time petrol retailers are having a very lean time?  Would he agree that it would be necessary to give retailers, because of the huge costs involved in holding stocks, a small increase every time the price has risen generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, I am mainly guided by the recommendations of the National Prices Commission with regard to applications of this nature.  The last application was complied with.  I might add that there was considerable agitation before the recent March increase was given, but since then I have had no representations whatsoever from the retailers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, given the fact that about 40 per cent of the retail trade is controlled by the multi-national oil companies and that in <Col N="597" /> those retail outlets there is a particularly large turnover involved, it is inappropriate that those multi-national owners of the large retail outlets should be given the same percentage as the small retailers to whom Deputy Flynn has referred?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The 2.13 pence granted to retailers recently did not take into consideration any question concerning stocks.  Would the Minister be prepared to include in the next price increase an element in respect of the stocks which necessarily must be held over at enormous expense by these people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, would it not be in order for me to ask a question?  The Minister referred to a figure which I gave as one which he did not accept.  I wished to ask him to clarify the position, purely on a point of information. I know exactly what the Minister is saying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the figure of 40 per cent to which I referred as being controlled by the multi-national companies was not one which he would accept.  Would he give me some notion of the correct percentage of outlets held by the multi-nationals, if it is not 40 per cent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that what I said was that I do not necessarily accept the figures which were given, that there have been a number of speculative figures given in the recent past on the question of control in pricing of oil products.  In view of that, I am sure the Deputy would accept that it would be very unwise of me to accept figures which are casually mentioned in the House.</P>

      <P>Control of prices of a wide range of petroleum products sold by the major oil companies is exercised by means of orders under the Prices Acts. The current order in force is the Maximum Prices (Petroleum Products) (No. 5) Order, 1983, which was made on 29 April, 1983.  This Order sets maximum prices for petroleum products, but of <Col N="599" /> course the actual prices charged by the companies are not necessarily those set out in the order; they are in many instances lower, reflecting various discounts and rebates given by the companies on many petroleum products.  The maximum prices set are kept continually under review both by my Department and the National Prices Commission, which advises me on this matter.</P>

      <P>Since the prices are subject to Government order, could the Minister tell the House if he is satisfied that these orders are correctly made, in view of the fact that companies selling on the Irish market can sell the same produce down the road in Northern Ireland at a much cheaper rate and if the Minister can explain to traders, consumers and others concerned the reason for this difference? I need not go into the figures here and need not tell the Minister the difference in the figures.  Is the Minister satisfied that the Government should make new orders regulating those prices? Since oil companies are actually selling below the order price made, were the Government given the right information when they made those orders?</P>

      <P>I can appreciate the concern of everybody with the price of oil products here because it has very wideranging effects on the commercial and social life of the country.  As I explained, the petroleum prices are at present subject to control and the National Prices Commission keep under continuous surveillance movements that would affect the price of petrol and other oil products. There are some comparisons which, in the opinion of my Department, are not valid because they do not compare like with like.  But a number of factors are taken into consideration in determining the price of oil products and this is done with great care and attention by the National Prices Commission.  Some time ago I asked the National Prices Commission to undertake a special review of the whole pricing mechanism of oil products. That review is under way and I expect their report in the near future.  That <Col N="600" /> report will take into consideration all the relevant factors regarding any differential between here and the United Kingdom and other member states of the EEC.  It is only fair to say that I believe the National Prices Commission have approached their task in a responsible and balanced way and, while not directed by them, at least I must be guided by their recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it must be a matter of the gravest concern that, since we began controlling our petrol prices in 1979, the differential between the Irish pre-tax price of petrol and the UK pre-tax price of petrol has moved from a position of being 10 per cent in Ireland less than it was in the UK in January 1980, steadily upwards to a position where it now costs 50 per cent more per pre-tax unit of petrol here in January of this year?  Would the Minister agree also that it is a matter of gravest concern that over that same period, 1979 to 1983, the mark-up given to importers had doubled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As a matter of fact I can tell the House the factors that are taken into consideration: the international oil price movement both on official and on spot prices, as these affect the cost of imported produce and exchange rate movements of the Irish pound against the dollar on which international oil prices are fixed.  The House will agree also that there has been some considerable fluctuation between the punt and pound sterling and indeed between the pound and the dollar particularly in the period the Deputy mentioned which would have had a very significant impact on our pricing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was raised earlier of retail prices here.  In retail prices here there is a margin of between 6p and 7p more than is given in the United Kingdom and in other European countries.  That is justified by our throughput and the limited market we have.  All of these factors, including the Whitegate one, tend to make the difference.  As I said earlier, all relevant factors are very closely scrutinised by the National Prices Commission <Col N="601" /> and they are at present engaged in a comprehensive review of price control with regard to oil products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions the Minister has emphasised that all relevant factors are kept under constant surveillance by the National Prices Commission. How then can the National Prices Commission and the Minister justify signing orders for prices which are greater than the companies can actually charge the motorist because the market place will not withstand them?  Surely it is the responsibility of the National Prices Commission and the Minister to protect the interests of motorists?  How then can the Minister justify signing orders for prices which are higher than the market place itself can sustain?</P>

      <P>As I explained earlier, the order relates to maximum prices. There are factors in individual companies that would allow them to charge less than the maximum price which would not necessarily apply to other companies.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that a Government agency dealing in an area such as this must do so in an objective and fair manner and take into consideration the circumstances not merely of the very large companies which may be in a position to offer their produce at lower prices &mdash; and that applies to a wide range of produce &mdash; but also those companies who would not be in a position to do that and who, in order to remain solvent, would have to charge the maximum price.  It is the maximum prices that is important and there is nothing to stop anybody in any other area charging less.</P>

      <P>The commission have made many recommendations to me over the past years in relation to petroleum product prices and details of these recommendations are contained in the Commission's monthly reports which are presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In their latest recommendation on this subject which I received in late March 1983 the Commission recommended significant across the barrel reductions in petroleum product prices and following this recommendation I made an order on 31 March 1983 which reduced the pre-tax price of petrol by an average of about 13 pence per gallon.  Reductions were also made on the same date, in the pre-tax price of gas oil averaging about 7 pence per gallon while fuel oil was reduced by amounts ranging from 1p to 3.5p per gallon.</P>

We appreciate that this is a situation the Minister inherited from his predecessors, and not something that happened today or yesterday.

It is only fair to say that it was not just the price of petrol or of oil dropping on the international market that contributed to the decrease we experienced but also the fluctuation in international currency which had an effect, and that all of those factors were taken into consideration by the National Prices Commission.  However, to ensure that the full facts are known and so that there can be no doubt but that all the relevant factors are taken into consideration, at my request the National Prices Commission are engaged in a very comprehensive review of the whole pricing mechanism with regard to oil products, and I expect to have their report in the near future.  I can assure the House and the Deputy that any factor which can contribute to the reduction of the price of oil products here will be seized on and implemented by me.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that the currency fluctuation cost amounts to no more than 6p per gallon taking into account such fluctuations over the past two years?  Would the Minister also accept that the only other reason for a price differential as between this country and the United Kingdom is the Whitegate factor which he himself or his Department have assessed at a cost of about 4p per gallon?  Would the Minister accept that the other reasons given by him, namely the particular problems of small Irish retailers, are problems that existed prior to our taking the price control of petrol into out own hands in 1979 and that prior to then problems like those of retailers did not seem to cause any differential as between our price and that in the United Kingdom?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Statements are being made which are not comparing like with like.  Some considerable time ago oil prices were not a major issue as they are now and rightly so.  The factors which were mentioned by the Deputy are not the only factors that have to be taken into consideration.  The question of the retailers amounts to approximately 6p to 7p more that in other countries which have been mentioned.  On the question of Whitegate the figure would be nearer to 6p than 4p per gallon.  There are a number of other factors, including the fluctuation in the exchange rate between the dollar and the punt.  That is a major consideration. There are other factors which are not within the control of my Department but which relate to the whole question of energy policies.  It may be advantageous at a particular time to buy solely on the spot market which could result in considerable reductions.  There are, however, disadvantages in that approach.  It has not yet been decided.  Although those factors are not within the control of my Department <Col N="605" /> they are all factors which obviously have an effect on the price.</P>

I cannot honestly say whether in the past any increases sought were refused or varied except in relation to the last one.  I made a variation in the recommendation that was made with regard to the decreases of last March.  It is the normal practice to allow flexibility for the oil companies in relation to each product &mdash; petrol, heavy fuel, gas.  On the last occasion when the commission made their recommendation I did not accept it in full.  I insisted that a greater proportion should be taken off petrol than the other two products.

      <P>There are already provisions in the Building Societies Act, 1976, under which such disclosure could be made mandatory by the Registrar of Building Societies.  These provisions are found in sections 62 and 70 of that Act <Col N="610" /> and they empower the Registrar to prescribe the form of the annual accounts and annual return of a building society. The existing forms are at present under review by the Registrar and I understand that the need to regulate the matter referred to in the question will arise for consideration.</P>

I asked, and the Minister has not specified, why the same regulations should not apply to building societies as apply to limited companies in regard to the disclosure of the full list of membership, and is the Minister aware that under sections 16 and 119 of the Companies Act, 1963, this applies to limited companies and public companies but does not apply to building societies and would the Minister agree it should apply?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think a comparison between companies and building societies is fair.  Building societies are engaged in investment by a very large number of people and it would be unfair to apply a regulation to such societies which did not equally apply to other financial institutions engaged in the same type of operation.  The practicability of disclosing membership would be fairly considerable.  As I understand it, there are 583,000 members ranging from 200,000 in the largest to the smallest, 190 approximately.  Full public disclosure would obviously be an intolerable burden on the operation of these societies.  In addition, as I said, it would not be fair to compare them with companies.  If regulations were to be introduced they would have to be across the board.  In other words, they would have to apply to all institutions engaged in related types of activity.</P>

      <P>Under section 10 (1) of the Building Societies Act, 1976, the rules of every building society must specify the procedure to be observed at meetings. Therefore, each society are responsible for the proper conduct of their meetings.  The Registrar of Building Societies is not aware of any significant abuse in the area of voting at general meetings of building societies.  Should such abuse occur in the future, the Minister for the Environment has power, within the terms of section 10(3) of the Act, to prescribe rules in respect of any of the matters listed in subsection (1) of that section.  These include the procedures to be observed at meetings as well as other matters of procedure concerning meetings such as notices, voting rights, proxies and the taking of polls.  Regarding the question of communicating <Col N="613" /> information to members, section 73 of the Act is relevant also to the extent that it established a new procedure whereby a member of a building society may communicate through the secretary of the society with the other members of the society on a subject relating to the affairs of the society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In general export licences for any destination are necessary only in respect of a limited number of goods capable of being used for strategic purposes or crucial as supplies to Irish industry.</P>
      <P>Exports of some materials to South Africa are forbidden by a United Nations Security Council resolution which Ireland strictly observes.  Export licences for other goods are governed by considerations concerning Irish industry and by conditions imposed by countries which supply raw materials.  Accordingly, the Deputy should realise that export licences for trade with South Africa arise only in very limited circumstances and a major portion of trade with South Africa is not subject to licensing.</P>
      <P>I can, however, inform the Deputy that I have asked my Department to carry out a full review of the question of trade with South Africa.</P>
      <P>I have decided also that no assistance should be given by Córas Tráchtála, who are charged with the development of exports, to traders doing business with that country.

The type of licence that is issued is a global one in that it relates to 45 countries.  The only very limited trade carried out under licence is trade that is considered essential to industry.  I must point out that I have asked my Department to review the whole position of trading with South Africa, while instructions have been issued to Córas Tráchtála not to give assistance to any company engaged in trade with South Africa.</P>

      <P>There is no possibility of assuring the Deputy that the matter would be reconsidered.  During a period of time this question has been considered and the recommendations to date are similar to earlier ones.  There are a number of grounds for that situation. First, only 40 per cent of tourists use their cars here and the difficulties in implementing a petrol voucher scheme for them would be very considerable. Because of that, and having regard also to the fact that transport costs represent the least part of a tourist's budget &mdash; accommodation being the biggest part &mdash; it is not considered that the introduction of a petrol voucher scheme would create any major or even any minimum growth in Irish tourism.</P>

If we did not have industrial exports many firms would not survive.  It is not in our interest to be at the forefront in the initiation of protectionist measures in the industrial field.  We, with our small domestic market and large industrial exportation, would lose more than would France or Britain, who have a large domestic market and for whom protectionist measures, however contrary to EEC law, can be tempting.  The Taoiseach intends to raise the matter at the Council meeting in Stuttgart.

      <P>The four Deputies may be assured that the Government and the IDA will be making every effort to safeguard the tyre operation and the employment in Dunlop in Cork.

      <P>I accept and appreciate the delicacy of discussions of this nature.  We wish to co-operate in any way we can if we can be helpful.  Is there not an apparent difference of attitude between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on the issue?  Would he accept that the Taoiseach's comments were not helpful?</P>

      <P>The reference made by the Taoiseach was in the context of nationalisation.  He indicated that he did not believe that in the case of this firm nationalisation would be a solution.  I have expressed the view on a number of occasions that a firm such as this can only survive in the long-term if it is successful in selling its products.  Unfortunately there has been an inadequate performance in the sales of this operation.  That is not a reflection on the workers involved.  In any restructuring of the operation greater emphasis will have to be put on securing adequate sales performance. Otherwise, no matter who owns the company it will not succeed.</P>

      <P>If I receive information on a daily basis, depending on the nature of the information, I will consider <Col N="621" /> whether I can disclose it to Deputies.  I do not mean that in an unhelpful way but I am sure that Deputy Fitzgerald, from his ministerial experience, will appreciate that one receives information from time to time which is of a commercial and confidential nature and that I could not disclose that to the Deputy.  However, if the Deputy and his three colleagues would like to keep in touch with me I will keep them briefed on what I can inform them.  That invitation applies to all Deputies. I am anxious to make as much information as possible available to all Deputies representing all areas who have to face the problems at immediate level.</P>

      <P>In view of the enormous anxiety of the workers in Dunlop's, will the Minister verify whether negotiations were going on at a time when the Taoiseach made a statement which caused a lot of confusion among the workers.  At the same time, the Minister was in contact with the IDA and the board of management of Irish Dunlop.  Why did the Taoiseach make the statement at the time he did?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to an earlier question, the Taoiseach said he did not see nationalisation as being the answer to the problem at Dunlop.  I do not think that comment could have done anything but good in the context of the negotiations that the IDA were engaged in which were concerned with the private sector restructuring of the company.  The thought that such negotiations might be thrown off course by moving in the direction of nationalisation would obviously not help discussions. What the Taoiseach said in relation to nationalisation would only help to clarify the situation.  The discussions, I agree with the Deputy, are very important and this would help them to proceed on a proper and clear basis.</P>

      <P>Can we take it that the Minister is giving an undertaking about the continued operation of the Dunlop plant?  Are we being given an undertaking from the Government about the continued operation of the Dunlop <Col N="622" /> plant in some shape or form?  My second question is: does the Minister agree that the Taoiseach should be advised not to interfere with or comment on delicate issues of this nature which he is obviously not familiar with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated, if the Deputy had been paying attention, in response to his colleague, Deputy Wyse, that I believe the Taoiseach's intervention served to clarify the situation.  It was helpful.  The head of the Government is perfectly correct and indeed would be remiss in his responsibilities if he did not address himself from time to time to industrial problems of this nature.  All parties in the House must recognise that the Taoiseach has shown himself willing to answer questions on subjects of this kind.  I do not want to avoid answering the first part of Deputy Fitzgerald's question. The Deputy will realise that the Government cannot give undertakings of the sort he sought.  The Government are seeking to achieve a viable solution and improved performance in terms of sales by this company.  Until one is satisfied that one has a base on which sales can be expanded and profits made, obviously it is not possible to give undertakings of that sort.  If I may refer again to Deputy Fitzgerald's ministerial experience, he will know that this kind of undertaking is not one he would have been able to give himself.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the Government cannot give an undertaking but I would ask, in view of the confusion that existed because information was not available to the workers and management in Cork, would the Government desist from causing any further confusion because of an obvious difference of opinion between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste?  I want that assurance from the Minister and the Government.  Have the Government or the Minister been in communication in any way with the people across the water, because they will be involved in any decision?</P>

Though its trading position has been rather difficult largely because of the recession, I am not aware that there is a threat of imminent closure.

      <P>I am asking the Minister if he does not consider that he should have such information with him if he is in negotiations with regard to the closure of the factory.  He should know by now what IDA grant was given.  Is he aware that one of the morning newspapers today reported that more than £4 million had been given since 1969 and that only a few months ago 120 workers were laid off, accompanied by the threat of closure, and that despite their laying off the threat of closure is still there?  Would the Minister give the same courtesy to me and the other Deputies in the area as he said he would in regard to Dunlops &mdash; would he keep us up to date in regard to what is occurring?</P>

I am sure the Deputy will realise that in the short time since the Private Notice Question was put down it has not been possible to obtain all the information that one would normally get.  Therefore, I do not feel any culpability in not having the information.  I will obtain it for the Deputy and convey it to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is no, I am not satisfied that over 600 patients in St. Mary's Hospital, Castlebar, are receiving proper care at the present time.  How, for example, <Col N="627" /> could I be satisfied at a situation where the normal daily nursing staff complement of 140 is seriously reduced to approximately 40, when the medical and senior nursing administrative staff on duty are in a situation of harassment and difficulty in endeavouring to cater for patients entrusted to their care, and when therapeutic activities for patients have been severely limited?  It must be obvious from the Government decision to provide the health board with Army catering staff in recent days that I share with all my colleagues in Government &mdash; and, I trust, the Opposition as well &mdash; a deep concern for the welfare of all patients in St. Mary's Hospital, Castlebar.</P>
      <P>Once again, particularly in the light of the equality officer's recommendation yeaterday, I appeal to the striking nurses to return to work immediately so that patient care can be guaranteed and that the resumed discussions between their unions and the Local Government Staff Negotiating Board can be conducted in a calm and responsible manner.  Nothing can be gained by anyone if the strike continues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a well known and well established industrial relations machinery for the resolution of disputes in the psychiatric nursing area, namely, the Local Government Staff Negotiating Board.  Prior to the strike notice being brought into effect on 18 April, there were discussions and there have been intensive discussions since then.  Regrettably, arising out of the withdrawal of nursing services in that hospital, admissions were stopped, which in a number of instances posed great difficulties. Patients were not allowed to work outside the hospital, the day hospital was closed, all community nurses were withdrawn and there was a total withdrawal of staff from the acute female bed-fast psycho-geriatric ward, there was a withdrawal of nurses to administer the ECT <Col N="628" /> and there was a withdrawal of maintenance, laundry and domestic staff for ward cleaning.  I have no doubt that the Local Government Staff Negotiating Board, the personnel officer of the Western Health Board, the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board and the officials in the Department of Health have done their utmost to resolve this dispute.  Hopefully, there will be a resumption of work today or tomorrow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of critical importance to point out that the Employment Equality Agency's officer has found, under the Employment Equality Act, that within this hospital, and in effect within the psychiatric nursing service as a whole, there are a number of practices which are in breach of existing legislation, namely, the sex segregated promotional panel, classification of jobs by sex of workers and discriminatory recruitment, appointment and promotion procedures.</P>
      <P>In that context the workers concerned are aware of the dual recommendations from the equality officer.  It is not the practice of this Government &mdash; or, I hope, any other Government &mdash; to encourage a breach of the law and I understand the purpose of today's meeting of the Local Government Staff Negotiating Board is to review the measures being taken by the Western Health Board to comply with the employment equality legislation.  The trade unions concerned are fully aware of the implications of the situation and hopefully, within that frame-work, some transitional arrangements will be made and the dispute will be resolved.

      <P>As he is aware, from October 1980 to March 1981 an employment equality officer appointed by the Labour Court investigated a complaint by 22 temporary female married psychiatric nurses at St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe, that they were being discriminated against by the Western Health Board contrary to the provisions of the 1977 Employment Equality Act.  I would point out that many of these nurses are members of the trade union which now has refused at Castlebar to accept the findings of the equality officer.  I stress absolutely that the employment equality officer and the Labour Court have acted with great expedition in dealing with this dispute.  Not the slightest fault can be found with either the Labour Court or with the employment equality officer giving her judgment &mdash; she sought interviews with the union concerned and submissions therefrom, issued an interim finding yesterday afternoon and has worked diligently and effectively.  I would stress that the judgment and the legal opinion obtained by the Western Health Board have been counter-checked by me in my Department with the Attorney General of this Government.  I have found, on very rigorous examination of the Act, that the Western Health Board <Col N="630" /> are acting entirely in accordance with the law and the equality officer's findings bore that out again on an interim basis yesterday.</P>

I have worked unceasingly over the past weekend to ensure that responsibility would prevail.  I hope that the Deputies concerned &mdash; I refer here in particular to <Col N="631" /> Deputy Flynn &mdash; will equally ensure that at local level responsibility will be brought to bear on the situation.</P>
      <P>I would stress that this dispute is founded on a claim by the union concerned that the Western Health Board should take certain action in relation to promotions which would be contrary to the Act.  That is why the Western Health Board brought the union before the employment equality officer to explain the situation, bearing in mind the enactment of equality legislation.

It is outrageous that what happened should have happened, no matter what the exigencies in relation to transitional arrangements in regard to promotional and recruitment procedures of psychiatric nurses.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>On the previous occasion I referred to the fact that the Finance Bill was not dealing with the problems of the economy and that there was no progress since budget time.  It was merely dealing with the question of balancing the books.  I pointed out that this was the current theory in western democracies of Thatcherism and Reaganomics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Finance Bill contains nothing that will seriously burden the wealthy in any way.  The PAYE sector have been those people hit yet again.  The fact that this Finance Bill contains no proposals with regard to existing capital taxes is testimony to the fact &mdash; as shown in the post-budget revenue yield forecasts &mdash; that little or no extra revenue is to be extracted this year from the rich as their contribution to the financing of the State's borrowing needs.  The only new tax measure that might be regarded as coming on them is the new property tax which, at very best, is expected to yield something in the region of £10 million while other estimates rate the yield as low as £3 million this year.  Therefore, the taxation of the wealthy has not been dealt with.  There are proposals which we have had from previous Ministers for Finance <Col N="738" /> going back over the last eight to ten years, to deal with tax evasion, that offenders would be imprisoned, fined heavily and so on.</P>
    <P>It must be noted that capital taxation in 1974 constituted 11.2 per cent of total Exchequer revenue.  In 1981 that figure had fallen to 4.7 per cent.  Even for quite a number of years of Thatcherism in Britain, in 1981, 13.3 per cent of UK revenue came from capital taxes, three times more than the figure here.  There has been a consistent reduction in capital taxation here since 1974, when it amounted to 11.2 per cent, down to 9.6 per cent in 1975, 8.8 per cent in 1976, then down to 8 per cent in 1977, 6.1 per cent in 1978, 6 per cent in 1979, 5.2 per cent in 1980 and 4.7 per cent in 1981, a consistent, determined reduction in capital taxation during all of those years.</P>
    <P>But while we talk of evasion, of non-payment of taxes, the fact is that the general level of taxation as decided by Ministers for Finance of both Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments over the past decade has been reduced.  It has consistently been their policy and strategy to reduce taxes on capital and increase taxes on labour; labour is to be crushed all the time, to be blamed for everything and pay for everything.  Indeed in a table contained in a written answer to Deputy R. Bruton of 1 March last, the present Minister for Finance showed clearly that that has been the consistent policy of successive Ministers for Finance.  Indeed over the past four or five years, for the first time ever perhaps in any State, taxes were being abolished.  Instead of new taxes being created &mdash; which is what has been happening over the past hundreds of years; Ministers for Finance continuously thinking of new methods of raising taxation &mdash; what has happened here consistently over the past four or five years is that capital taxation has been abolished. Nineteen seventy four could be taken as the high year in that respect and there has been a consistent reduction ever since.  For instance, taxes on inheritances and gifts which yielded 2 per cent of our total revenue in 1973-74 last year, 1982, yielded 0.3 per cent, one-third of one per cent which has not been replaced <Col N="739" /> by anything else.  Capital gains tax, introduced some years ago, has been reduced consistently.  In fact those people who have been legitimately charged capital gains tax have been refusing to pay.  I am quoting from comments of the Minister for Finance who has been telling us since that there is no crock of gold out there. I am taking figures from the table furnished by the Minister by way of written answer to Question No. 412 to Deputy R. Bruton on 1 March last.</P>
    <P>The figures for taxes outstanding for 1979-80, as at 31 December 1982, still outstanding for 1979-80, were VAT £574 million paid with a balance outstanding of £16.27 million, still outstanding in 1982.  In regard to PAYE £800 million had been paid and £6.15 million was still outstanding in 1982.  For PRSI £371 million had been paid and there remained outstanding £5.94 million in 1982.  When we come to the income tax of the self-employed, including farmers, £113 million had been paid and there remained outstanding on 31 December 1982 £119.07 million.  Yet we have Mr. Donal Cashman screaming at us telling us that the farmers are paying their taxes.  The figures are down there in black and white in that table for 1979-80 and there still remain the years 1980-81 and 1981-82. Of the total of corporation tax due, £135 million had been paid, with £63.84 million outstanding.  With regard to capital gains tax a miserable £5 million had been paid leaving £11.27 million outstanding, in other words, one-third only of the amount due had been paid nearly three years later.</P>
    <P>Those figures are most disturbing and are the type of figures leading to anger on the streets and factory floors.  That table shows also that there was £20.48 million under demand from the self-employed, including farmers and £23.10 million under enforcement.  What does &ldquo;under enforcement&rdquo; mean?  The Minister for Finance says now he is going to crack down on the tax dodgers.  I am not speaking here of tax dodgers, I am speaking of people who are refusing to pay their legitimately charged taxes.  These are only some of them.  I should like the <Col N="740" /> Minister for Finance to let the House know if, for instance, the people who owe those £23.10 million which is under enforcement &mdash; which means it must have gone through the law &mdash; will be put in jail under the provisions of this Finance Bill. It is my belief that nobody will ever go to jail, that none of those who owe capital tax, property tax or capital gains tax will ever go to jail.  It has been made clear by the Minister and other Deputies that the people who will go to jail are those PAYE workers who refuse to pay their tax.</P>
    <P>In his introductory remarks on this Bill, the Minister for Finance referred to the fact that he would be introducing measures to tackle evasion and so on. But, when he came to issuing threats, he issued the one only.  While welcoming the new found interest in tax equity, at the same time he condemned &mdash; and expected all sides of the House to support him in this &mdash; outright the practice of withholding tax payments as a means of highlighting concern about tax levels. That was a specific reference to the workers in Waterford Glass.  The Minister condemned outright the practice of withholding tax payments as a means of highlighting concern about tax levels.</P>
    <P>It is strange that in all of his speech the Minister made no condemnation of the refusal of farmers to pay their health contributions or of the self-employed to pay either their health contributions or their youth employment levy.  He has not issued any condemnation of the people who owe £119 million capital gains tax for the last three years.  There was no reference to these in the Minister's speech.  However, he condemns outright the workers in Waterford Glass who highlighted the two main issues of the PAYE system.  They did an excellent job in highlighting the fact that PAYE workers are caught in an inescapable tax net.  They have no way out of it.  They never see their wage packet.  They get what remains after the tax has been deducted but they never get their full wages for which they worked and which they should be duly entitled to get into their hands and then make their decisions as to what they will do first, whether to buy food for the table or whether to pay <Col N="741" /> the Revenue Commissioners.  They should be able to make their decisions the same as farmers make their decisions, the self-employed make their decisions, the company directors make their decisions, the banks make their decisions, as to whether they will pay the Revenue Commissioners first or last, and in fact whether they will pay the Revenue Commissioners at all.  They can make a free choice and nobody says anything about it, condemns them or shouts at them.  In fact, what was done last year when the farmers organised and publicly stated that they would refuse to pay resource tax the small number who did pay &mdash; £700,000 was paid out of an expected estimated revenue of £7 million &mdash; had it refunded to them in May of last year by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance under last year's Finance Bill. Can you imagine that happening in the case of PAYE workers who refused to pay their taxes?  Can you imagine the Government saying: &ldquo;That is all right. We will abolish that tax and we will refund whatever some people had paid.&rdquo; Is it not unbelievable?</P>
    <P>This is the kind of decisions that are driving people almost to despair.  The workers in Waterford Glass highlighted this fact.  They also highlighted the fact that the Government and the State are almost totally dependent on the working class for the revenue to keep the State ticking over.  That is why as soon as they took that action the whole gamut of the law was threatened on them &mdash; the Offences Against the State Act, the lot.  I am not calling on workers in other factories around the country to carry out a similar campaign because it is a matter for each group of workers in their own factory, through their own trade union, to decide what type of action they will take.  I would not call on workers here in Dublin to do the same as the workers in Waterford Glass.  It may work in Waterford Glass, it may not work some place else.  It is a bit much for any group of workers to expect their bosses to break the law for them.  After all, it is the bosses' law that rules already and the bosses are the ones who are refusing to pay their taxes.  It is very unlikely that they will break the law <Col N="742" /> to allow the workers to get away without paying their taxes.  They depend on the Government for grants, subsidies and everything else that comes from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The amount of health contributions outstanding from the self-employed is £7,950,000.  The amount from the farmers £8,395,000.  That is over £16 million outstanding in health contributions. Youth employment levy not paid amounts to £11,500,000 from the self-employed and £6,500,000 from farmers. That is £20 million from self-employed and almost £15 million from farmers. Deputy Richard Bruton has highlighted the fact that there is a total of &ldquo;only&rdquo; £500 million outstanding in taxes although there is an estimate of £1,500 million.  I pointed out the last day that I thought £500 million was quite a crock of gold to go after.  We will be interested to see whether the Minister's actions will ensure that that £500 million is brought in this year.  Much of this is overdue for two, three or four years.</P>
    <P>Tax dodging is a social crime.  It is the kind of crime which takes medicine from the aged and teachers from the schools. It erodes the social welfare services.  The only thing this Finance Bill purports to do is to deal with evasion and avoidance, something that is very important, I agree. We put down proposals on this back in 1978.  We proposed ways in which the system of random sampling could be introduced where you would take certain samples on a scientific basis and go through those with a fine comb and in that way catch out the tax evaders and avoiders.  The Minister seems to be concentrating solely on this issue and on measures for the future.  I would like to see specific measures now to deal with those people who have legitimate bills outstanding and to know what way the Minister intends to ensure those are paid.</P>
    <P>In the November General Election the electorate turned out Fianna Fáil because of the policies they were pursuing.  They had begun to pursue in the previous August the Thatcherite monetarist policies to which I referred the last day. Their election manifesto was <i>The Way Forward</i> in which they spelled out what <Col N="743" /> they would be doing to balance the books.  Fine Gael proved very evasive right through the election on what type of policy they would pursue.  They came to power with the assistance of the Labour Party and all that has resulted is the re-introduction of the very worst aspects of <i>The Way Forward</i> with some quite new and nasty tricks thrown in like a tax of £10 on the unemployed to apply for a job.  That is what it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would do differently had he had the time to design the type of budget he wanted.  In other words, he is indicating that he is really only introducing the Fianna Fáil type of budget.  In his recent speech at the Confederation of Irish Industry he provided some further hints of what the Government have in store after this Finance Bill. The outline of the future contained in that speech was in essence no different from the simple canon put forward and implemented in Britain under the Tory Government during the past four years. The Minister presumed in that speech that he had full backing for his strategy. He said a general consensus now exists as to the need to reduce expenditure. Where he gets the general consensus from is presumably the various Chamber of Commerce dinners he attends or the CII or the FUE.  That is where he gets his consensus.</P>
    <P>Has he found the consensus from the trade union movement?  Has he found the consensus from the teachers union? Did he get a consensus from the health professions in regard to the cutbacks in expenditure?  What consensus did he get from the public sector generally?  His consensus is based on the tiny minority who are running him, who are organising him, who are telling him what to do and cheering him on when he does it.  That is the type of consensus he has.  It would appear also to be the consensus within the Government, no matter what the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, may have to say about insensitivity and the ritual dance or the tone and timing of the remarks of the Minister for Finance in that particular speech.  He did not question the content of the speech but he did <Col N="744" /> question the tone and timing of the type of ritual dance common in Coalition Governments.  This is the way in which the Labour Party try to make their mark and show they are still there.  It is becoming less and less obvious that they are there.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister: &ldquo;It is my intention, with the assistance of the planning machinery which is now being set up, to develop for adoption by the Government an approach to public expenditure, a reduction over the medium term which would be designed to minimise the long run effects of cuts on employment and economic activity generally&rdquo;.  The use there of the word &ldquo;minimise&rdquo; is highly significant.  It reveals that the Government do not intend to avoid adverse effects on unemployment and general economic activity in the years ahead.  He simply talks of minimising.  There is no plan whatsoever indicated, either in the budget or in any of the speeches of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or the Minister, since the budget or in this Finance Bill that the purpose of it is a strategy for anything.  Certainly it is not a strategy for employment or job creation.  It does not even seem to be a strategy for minimising unemployment. It seems to be a strategy for maximising unemployment.  The Minister openly accepts that unemployment will continue and grow during the period of the application of what he calls the minimum term strategy.  The only surprising thing is that he made the admission.  He has constantly attempted to get across the message that there is only one alternative to high level taxation and that is expenditure cuts.  It seems obvious, does it not? It is not a simplistic formula.  Simplistic formulas are what we have come to expect from the monetarists Milton Friedman, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.</P>
    <P>There is a third way.  It is the way The Workers' Party set out in a very realistic document before the last general election in November of last year, called <i>An End to Crisis.</i> The third way is the implementation of a production plan, a plan aimed at raising output in key sections of the economy.  Instead of cutting back on <Col N="745" /> expenditure, cutting back all the time in order to balance the books in an negative downward fashion, to balance them in the reverse way and bridge the gap between spending and incomes by increasing incomes, increasing output, increasing wealth, increasing our national income and in that way balancing the books instead of creating unemployment and chaos down on the streets and in the factories.  It is a formula for creating more employment, increasing production both on the farm and in the factory, increasing our national income overall and in that way balancing the books while, at the same time, raising the morale of the country, raising the level of employment and keeping the engine of growth growing until, finally, change comes in the recession and when that improvement takes place we will then be geared to take advantage of it immediately and go forward from there.</P>
    <P>The current position is that even if there were an improvement in the world recession internationally this year &mdash; many say there is &mdash; it will be at least two or three or perhaps four years before we will recover sufficiently to be in a position to take advantage of that international recovery.  Because we are so far down and moving further down the scale, with the constant closure of our major export industries, it will take us years even to get us geared to take advantage of any improvement in the international market. The economic strategy we offer as an alternative sees the market as the servant of the working class and of the people in general and not their masters.  This is the precise opposite of what the Government believes.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that one either has high levels of taxation or high levels of expenditure cuts.  What the Minister is doing is in fact bringing in both, exceptionally high levels of taxation and huge expenditure cuts which will increase further over the next few months.  To see how the rich will be the beneficiaries of this strategy let us examine the main cuts mentioned by the Minister.  He talked of cutting food subsidies.  That is next in line.  Perhaps just as soon as this Finance Bill is over and done with here &mdash;<Col N="746" /> certainly in the short term, at most in the medium term which he keeps talking about &mdash; food subsidies will be cut.  If he has his way in this, up will go the price of bread, milk, butter, flour and most of the basic staple foods which the working class must consume in order to survive.  He also talks of further cuts in CIE subsidies. Bus fares will go up.  Nothing there for the owners of the BMWs or the Saabs. They will not be hit.  Nothing in the cuts will affect them in any way.  For the work force employed in the public sector the Minister holds out very little prospect of any increase in wages except below single figures at a time when inflation is running at about 13 per cent and this Finance Bill will add further to that inflation.  Inflation will continue in double figures for quite some time to come and the Minister talks about single figure increases in wages for all workers in the private sector, because he is using the big stick on those also, as his letter to the insurance companies indicated.</P>
    <P>To the hundreds of thousands of people dependent on social welfare payments the Minister had the following to offer: an adjustment in the basis on which the annual increase in benefits is calculated. Since the practice followed in recent years has been to adjust social welfare increases to meet or to beat inflation, the only option left here is a decrease in the real value of social welfare benefits as a result of adjustments that represent less than the rate of inflation. This is the first time this has happened.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to set out his plans for expenditure in the areas of health and education, the pillars of whatever element of welfare state we have, and that has not been very much.  The Minister talked of the balancing of service reductions and increased charges.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the Minister's opening statement on the Finance Bill.  I submit that the argument that, if we do not have higher taxation we must have more expenditure costs, is one that I am entitled to tackle during the debate on the Finance Bill.  I suggest also that the removal of food subsidies is almost the equivalent of new taxation on food.</P>

      <P>The 1983 budget and the Finance Bill give a fair idea of what is to come so far as the Government are concerned.  The practice of a number of years of indexing social welfare benefits to inflation has been departed from, as thousands of social welfare recipients have found in the past few weeks.  This year also the Government are subjecting these people to a three-month pay pause by delaying the increases in benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I appeal to the Deputy to confine himself to what is in the Bill.  What he has just said has no relevance to taxation.  He may refer in passing to other aspects of expenditure but he must confine himself to the terms of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only making a reference in passing to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been passing a long way from what is contained in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely referring to the pay pause as it relates to social welfare recipients by way of referring to the reduced level of expenditure so far as they are concerned.  Presumably this is a <Col N="748" /> measure designed to avoid higher taxation in another area on the basis that, if you reduce one, you increase the other and <i>vice versa.</i> Therefore, it is very difficult to know the areas in mind so far as these references to increased taxation are concerned.  The distaste of the Government in regard to linking the income of ordinary people to inflation is shown even more clearly in their refusal to grant any indexation of the tax bands and allowances. This is the general trend in social welfare as in all other areas, but it is a very dangerous change in strategy especially at a time when inflation is well into the double-figure area and very likely to continue at that high level.</P>
      <P>The increase proposed in the exemption limits in respect of income tax for the lower paid from 9 per cent is another example of the very miserly approach evident in this budget, but it is a matter that will be the subject of an amendment from us on Committee Stage.  It is, then, in this broad context that we should consider the entire Finance Bill, that is, as part of an overall and longer-term strategy to assault the living standards of the vast majority of our people at a time when it is becoming increasingly evident that the tax system is unfair, downright inequitable and a social scandal.</P>
      <P>Some of the measures in the Bill are to be welcomed in so far as they represent an attempt to tackle the problem of tax evasion, but it must be pointed out that the changes proposed are very piecemeal. The real changes must be at the point of the administration of the tax system.  There is no indication in this Bill of any intention on the part of the Minister to make such changes.  We need a complete revamping of the administration of the Revenue Commissioners so that all forms, not only of income but of wealth will be known to the commissioners and, consequently, can be taxed in an equitable manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to realise that tax evasion is only a part, perhaps the least significant part, of the overall problem of inequity in taxation and budgetary practices generally.  The taxes themselves as well as the whole spending programme are a more serious source of inequity, in <Col N="749" /> terms both of the manner in which the taxes are raised and the manner in which the moneys going into the Exchequer are expended.  There has been no reference to that aspect of the whole situation in the past few months.  The Minister has not told us how Exchequer moneys are to expended for the benefit of the people, whether in the areas of employment, of housing or anything else.  The whole purpose of taxation is to collect revenue, but the Government must then make the decisions on the expenditure of that revenue in the various areas.  They must decide the best way in which the moneys can be spent for the benefit of all the people.  If the Government have any idea in this regard we should be hearing from them fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>The ICTU Executive Council, in a statement last week on the tax campaign, said that tax evasion represents one aspect only of the Congress campaign for tax equity, that in further pursuit of their objectives, Congress are seeking a meeting with the Government with a view to getting a commitment on the broadening of the tax base, especially by way of increased capital taxation and the taxation of discretionary trusts.  The Congress went on to say that they will be raising the question of tax credits, indexation and other measures for the improvement of equity in the system.  They say that there will be no real equity in the tax system until such time as there are radical and far-reaching changes in the taxation of capital wealth.  They say that it is in this area that the commitment of the Government and of the political parties to tax equity will be judged.</P>
    <P>PAYE workers never objected to paying taxes.  They never marched because they did not want to pay taxes and never at any time did any organised group of workers say &ldquo;We refuse to pay this or that tax&rdquo;.  The purpose of the marches over the past three years was to look for equality of taxation.  PAYE workers know their obligations to the State and have always been prepared to accept them.  They expect everyone else to do the same.  What they were marching for was justice and equal rights.  They got neither.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> The biggest march in the history of the State took place in January 1980.  There were about 750,000 people involved in marches all over the country and about 350,000 in Dublin.  It is probably one of the biggest march demonstrations, relative to our population, held in any European country.  Workers today, after all the marches, feel they are being laughed and sneered at by capitalists, property owners and their pawns in Government. Their anger is greater than ever before and is growing daily.  They see other groups in society able to decide whether they will pay tax.  They have seen successive Governments, whether Fianna Fáil or Coalition, fail to take any action against groups when they do not pay. That is why workers are now saying they want the same rights as others in regard to taxation.  They want the right to refuse pay or else have tax deducted from everyone. It could be deducted from a farmer's creamery cheque or mart cheque or from transactions made by self-employed people, traders and companies.</P>
    <P>People might say this could not be done because these people might not owe any tax.  However, nobody asks that question in connection with a PAYE worker.  A person may only work for five months every year but tax is still deducted.  If at the end of the year it is decided that he should not have been paying any tax the money will be refunded to him without any interest.  Why not do the same with everybody?  Why not deduct the tax and see at the end of the year if it was owed? However, if too much tax is deducted from anyone else, interest of 1½ per cent per month is paid.  They would not receive such a high rate of interest for investment anywhere else.</P>
    <P>These are the inequities in the tax system and what workers now want corrected. They want everyone to be on the same taxation and deduction system.  I pointed out before that this is a dangerous situation for the Government.  Various groups have used the Constitution to their own advantage.  Cases have been taken to the courts to decide whether, for example, the valuation system was just or against the constitutional rights of the farmers.  The court found it was against <Col N="751" /> their constitutional rights and rates could no longer be collected from them by the Government.  The Government did not worry about that.  If a PAYE worker took a constitutional case to the High Court on the basis that the only property he has is his wage packet which he has contracted with his employer to receive and that it is unlawful for tax to be deducted from it, what would happen?  Perhaps the whole PAYE system would be abolished as being unconstitutional.  Think what that would mean to a Government.  Last year £1,500 million was contributed by PAYE workers.  How would our system survive?  How would any Government survive?  The whole structure of society and government would collapse.</P>
    <P>Various Ministers for Finance and this one in particular are pushing workers to that stage.  The exceptional patriotism of the working class is being pushed to its limits.  They do not want to be pushed to those limits.  The 750,000 people who marched on the streets never pushed to the limits other groups have, but they are prepared to do so now.  The Minister for Finance should look carefully at what he is doing and take action.  The ICTU and The Workers' Party have been asking for that option to be taken for a number of years.  Otherwise PAYE workers will push to the limits and that would bring any Government to their knees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Mac Giolla drew attention to outstanding taxes.  This is the biggest source of inequity in our tax code.  Along with the situation of the self-employed paying on the basis of the previous year we have evidence that tax revenue is not coming in on time.  A lot of this is due to the procedure where high assessments are sent out to the self-employed.  These are followed by appeals, demands and enforcement procedures.  There is no doubt that delays are chaotic, and are a major source of tax inequity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  In five months the Government have made progress towards tackling this inequity.  The Bill contains a number of very worthwhile changes which will counter tax evasion <Col N="752" /> and the slow payment of tax.  The Revenue Commissioners now have the ability to go in and get full disclosure of assets from taxpayers.  There are new, stiffer penalties imposed by the Bill.  There is a tightening up of non-resident bank accounts which I hope will be effective in preventing overseas accommodation addresses being used to abuse the system. There is a promise to reveal the names of those involved in tax settlements whether in or out of court.  In short, we have a series of measures which will tighten up the procedures in force for collecting tax from the self-employed and other non-PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    <P>This Bill is probably as welcome for what is not explicit in it and that is the clear determination of the Minister to make the administrative changes needed to see that the existing powers and penalties are enforced.  To some extent, this debate has been deflected into an excessive concentration on the size of the penalties. The real problem is enforcement of the penalties, procedures and powers the Revenue Commissioners already hold.</P>
    <P>For example, at the risk of boring the House, I will quote once again some of the obvious weaknesses in the enforcement sphere of our tax system.  I should like to refer to interest on late payments.  As the law states clearly, 80 per cent of a taxpayer's guestimates of the tax he has to pay must be paid on time, by the due date following the assessment being issued to him.  The law also states that that guestimate must be within 80 per cent of the ultimate liability.  If he does not fulfil that, interest will be paid on the balance.  Similarly, interest will be paid on any late payments that he makes.</P>
    <P>The interest rate charged by the Revenue Commissioners is 1½ per cent per month.  I believe that is somewhat low and we should consider raising it, because it is 1½ per cent per month, not compounded but at a simple rate, and that works out at 18 per cent per annum, lower than would be paid on a bank overdraft.  That needs re-examination in the context of current interest rates. However, the real problem is not the <Col N="753" /> level of that interest rate, whether it is 18 per cent or a little higher, but the evidence shows it is not being enforced on late payments.  Interest in respect of late payments amounted to less than 1½ per cent of the total tax paid late.  I quote these figures from the Minister's replies to questions here on 1 March.</P>
    <P>Equally, from those answers it is clear that the vast bulk of late payments were not one month late as has been suggested but at least two years late, perhaps even longer in some cases.  I reckon therefore that the average is about 30 months during which interest should have been collected on late payments.  Clearly there is power within the Revenue Commissioners to charge penalty interest for late payments which is not being properly enforced.  I welcome the Minister's commitment in regard to the problem of tackling evasion because in practical terms it means these powers will be used.</P>
    <P>Another example which illustrates failure of the Revenue Commissioners to use their powers is that penalties and interest on back payments of tax work out at only 50 per cent of the tax due and paid back. It is clear to me that many of the people who are paying back tax see that the length during which these back taxes have been outstanding is considerable and there is no doubt that the penalties and the penalty interest rate should be far ahead of 50 per cent, which would be a relatively cheap loan.</P>
    <P>A third area in which I believe the administrative changes rather than the changes explicit in this Bill are very important.  There is a need to tackle the court and the sheriff procedures for collecting unpaid taxes.  The Minister in his answers to parliamentary questions revealed that this system is clearly breaking down.  I will quote a simple figure, the ratio of the yield from tax enforcement procedures to the face value sought in the same year.  Those figures are not strictly comparable, I admit, but there would be very little difference and I do not believe the comparability would make any great difference.  The figures reveal that the yield relative to the face value three years ago was only 16 per cent &mdash; only 16 per <Col N="754" /> cent of what was sought appears to have been realised.</P>
    <P>The situation has deteriorated since then, down to 10 per cent.  That is a very serious situation.  Not only are we getting a small amount from enforcement but the amount itself is deteriorating.  The Comptroller and Auditor General made public his discontent about this in his last annual report.  He made clear his feeling that this failure in enforcement was jeopardising the whole tax system because, naturally enough, if people feel that penalties will not be properly enforced, the risk of chancing their arm becomes much smaller.  As a result, the security of existing tax revenues is threatened.</P>
    <P>That is what the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out.  He accepted that the system should be given a chance to correct itself, but the evidence shows that the problems have got greater.  The system is more inundated than ever with work and a major backlog has arisen. Administrative reforms are required and I hope the Minister will bend his mind to this as a priority area.  I suggest the way to tackle it is to bring in for a limited period tax consultants who know both sides of the counter in this matter.  Let them report within a limited period what could be done to tighten things up and to get more revenue for the Exchequer. That probably would be the best procedure because as laymen it is difficult for us here to identify the precise problem.</P>
    <P>Some areas stand out.  One is that the sheriffs are asked to handle enforcement procedures, not just unpaid demands in cases where no appeals have been lodged, but they are asked to follow up taxes that have been confirmed by the appeals commissioners but which are still on appeal to the Circuit Court for further hearing.  Clearly they cannot get their hands on that sort of money and it is therefore wrong to be referring that sort of case to them.  Indeed it is misleading the public in regard to the true gravity of the situation.</P>
    <P>In that context we welcome the Minister's changes in the Finance Bill to put restrictions on the appeals procedure.  In a recent speech he drew attention to the fact that many people were playing the <Col N="755" /> appeals game.  Undoubtedly, that is the case.  By restricting the ability of taxpayers to go on further appeal, to go on from one appeal to the Circuit Court, we will get tax in quicker and reduce much of the administration work that is tying up the system.</P>
    <P>But there is another problem that the Minister is committed to tackling.  Very often the money which sheriffs and the courts go after is from small business people.  There is scope here for looking for a more simplified tax regime, particularly for small businesses.  A lot will be repaid through the Minister's efforts if we examine small businesses in the tax sphere because there are undoubtedly many scrupulous small business people who make their tax returns but who get involved in enormous difficulties through massive assessments being placed on them which bear no relationship to their true liability.  They are therefore embroiled in large appeals procedures. The Minister's examination of small businesses, which he has committed himself to, therefore is very welcome.</P>
    <P>Another weakness in the system of sheriffs going to execute enforcements of tax is that sheriffs are local people who have to live in their communities.  It is difficult for them to go out to seize goods from people whom they know in the course of their duty and whom they have to live with.  Very often they do not find any goods &mdash; perhaps they are hidden on the day.  Then they have to come back to court and the merry-go-round starts all over again.  Therefore there is room for examination of whether the appropriate person to enforce seizure is a local law officer or someone of that nature.  There should be some overseeing of the system if that procedure is to work.</P>
    <P>I would also welcome something not explicitly in the Bill.  That is the increase of staff that has been given by the Government to the Revenue Commissioners. One hundred and four extra staff have been allocated and that cannot but improve the administration of our tax code.  Many of them are going to farming centres where this Government have succeeded for the first time to bring all the <Col N="756" /> farmers into the tax net.  Once and for all we will be able to work towards real equity among the taxpayers.  It is important that the manpower be made available to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>Another area where manpower is being made available by this Government is the VAT audit.  The Minister should consider making this audit more comprehensive. At present it is confined to VAT but there is no reason why it should not cover other areas such as PRSI, PAYE and so on.  That would repay the effort made and would prove a cheaper way of administering the tax code.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider other anti-avoidance measures.  It is good that the Revenue Commissioners have the power to demand a statement of assets. This will make it clear that the Minister is serious about collecting taxes due.  This power might be extended to give the Revenue Commissioners the right to look at not just a trader's assets and books, but look also at the auditors' and accountants' working papers.  It has been suggested that there are maverick auditors. If there are, the threat that their working papers could be examined by the Revenue Commissioners could be very effective in getting compliance more quickly.</P>
    <P>In the anti-evasion and anti-avoidance section there is no anti-avoidance legislation introduced.  The Minister probably has in mind introducing amendments on Committee Stage and he should consider a number of possible anti-avoidance measures which ought to be introduced. He said in his Budget Statement that he would be considering retrospection in the case of tax ploys which were clearly for the sake of avoiding taxes.  I am not sure if retrospection would be a legitimate approach to such a problem.</P>
    <P>However, some sort of omnibus antitax avoidance measures, such as those in force in Canada and Germany, should be considered.  In essence such measures would say that anything found to be solely for the purpose of avoiding true tax liability would be ineffective and when discovered it would refer back to the date when the omnibus clause was brought into law.  If in four or five year's time some loophole was discovered, the <Col N="757" /> tax would be payable from that date. That would be a very effective measure to stamp out avoidance.  I understand this measure is successful in Canada and the Minister might get in touch with the Canadian tax authorities on its appropriateness for Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of years we have seen specific attempts by the Revenue Commissioners to get at particular schemes under which people are avoiding paying tax.  In 1981 the Revenue Commissioners introduced a measure regarding land deals and in 1982 a measure regarding share deals, and no doubt there are many more schemes.  This approach would avoid the present piecemeal method and would put the onus on the people designing these tax avoidance schemes to take care and be aware of what they are doing.</P>
    <P>I must mention specific areas of tax avoidance which, in my view, should get immediate attention.  One is the ongoing problem of what is called gilt rolling and deep discount stock, that is, the ability of investors in gilts, in non-productive and non-venture areas to avoid paying tax on income generated.  This escape clause can be used because under the present law Government bonds are exempt from capital gains tax.  This means that these people are able to turn what would normally be an interest payment into a capital gain by selling, just before the interest payment accrues therefore avoiding their tax liability.  The Minister has said he will be looking for the disclosure of trading in Government gilts.  I believe his intention to catch these people as traders in Government gilts rather than as once-off investors is the wrong way to stamp out this problem.  He should take the bull by the horns and say Government stock, like any other stock, will be subject to capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>Another area to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention is the avoidance of stamp duty by companies issuing shares.  A one per cent stamp duty should apply on a company share issue.  At present, by use of what is known as a renouncable letter of allotment, they can avoid that responsibility.  What they do is this: if the shares are issued to A, he renounces <Col N="758" /> them in favour of B, and the initial one per cent stamp duty does not become payable.  I do not suggest that this is an enormous source of revenue but is an anomaly where people are avoiding tax and it should be closed off.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the area where many senior company executives use scholarship trusts to get their children's education tax free.  This is not available to the normal taxpayer.  These people set up a trust with company directors as trustees and the moneys in this trust are not taxable.  The net result is that executives and directors get their children's education at a cheaper rate than the rest of the population.  That cannot but be a source of unfairness.</P>
    <P>It is important to tackle many of these avoidance techniques because they are diverting money that should be used in productive and venture areas into the non-productive and property areas, gilts and property investments.  That cannot but be seen as a bad thing for economic development because it is only productive investment which will produce employment for our work force, and this is the key aim of this Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention taxation of the self-employed.  The Minister has promised that the self-employed will be on the same year tax basis next year.  This is a very welcome move towards making the ordinary public see that everyone is on a pay-as-you-go basis.  The PAYE taxpayer has been paying along these lines for many years and I cannot see the justification for not taxing the self-employed on the same basis.  Therefore, I welcome this move.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to one problem which is likely to emerge from the public's perception of what is going on.  Over the last few weeks a great deal of attention has been given to outstanding demands and assessments.  The reason for these outstanding demands is that our tax procedure is like a long pipe, and there is always money in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>I am the first to say we must reduce the length of that pipeline, and that is what the Minister is doing, but I foresee a problem next year when people are on the same year basis&mdash;in other words, <Col N="759" /> their tax assessment will be for the year under consideration and there will be larger amounts of taxes and assessments outstanding.  There is a danger the public will see that as a deterioration in the equity of the tax system.  We have there a problem of public relations.  However, in the longer term we could change our system of tax collection from the present one which has a long pipeline and is bound to become fuller if you bring the relevant year closer to the time the assessments are sent out.  The task we face is to abandon that for a system of self-assessment.</P>
    <P>It is correct that the present system of the Revenue Commissioners sending out assessments, often quite arbitrarily, is confusing the public.  It is a bad system of tax collection.  As I have said before in this House, the self-assessment principle has great attractions.  Firstly, it puts the self-employed on the &ldquo;pay-as-you-go&rdquo; system.  Secondly, any appeals which occur&mdash;which come from the Revenue on this occasion, not from the taxpayer&mdash; find the Government not out of pocket for the tax due as at present.  In other words, the Government will get the tax in very quickly with self-assessment.  This could be at the end of the tax year or several times during the tax year, as under the PAYE or PRSI system.</P>
    <P>Firstly, the self-employed will make a tax return and the Government will have that money in their coffers and then set about examining whether there are cases where the system is abused.  If the penalties are stiff enough and the investigation procedures thorough enough, most self-employed will not take the chance of abusing that system.</P>
    <P>This system also has the attraction that it simplifies greatly the job of making tax returns.  People do not need to become embroiled every year in contesting excessive assessments, appealing them and employing accountants at great expense to do so on their behalf.  It will relieve many of the Revenue Commissioners staff of rigorous scrutiny of the tax returns becuase they will only be looking at a sample of the tax returns made, whereas at present they try to look at <Col N="760" /> every tax return and the time devoted to doing that is quite small&mdash;probably about an hour on average.  The possibility of discovering abuses under the present system is small, whereas under self-assessment it would be greatly enhanced.  Perhaps the most important thing is that it would bring visible equity into the tax collection system.  The self-employed would be paying on a &ldquo;pay-as-you-go&rdquo; system and might possibly send in multiple returns rather than one.</P>
    <P>I turn now to a number of areas where main issues remain to be tackled.  I fully support the Government's commitment to tax reform and to the closing of administration procedures which is evidenced in this Bill.  However, there are a number of areas still to be taken on.  One is the difference between the revelation procedures and the tax arrangements of building societies compared with those other financial institutions.  I know that the Minister has attempted to force the hand of building societies to reveal the true structure of their accounts, but the building societies are undoubtedly a source of stashing away hot money.  Perhaps it could be argued that it is put to a good use, and I do not dispute that housing is a good use.  However, I would dispute that we should accept abuses in our tax code in order to favour a use which could be encouraged in many other ways.  I would see it as far more favourable to encourage housing through for example, mortgage interest subsidies and so on rather than to allow this leakage from our tax code.</P>
    <P>One other point to which the Minister should give his attention comes back to the overriding target of the Government to create employment opportunities.  In the present Finance Bill I note that the Minister has extended the employment incentive to companies whereby they are allowed to claim £500 off their taxable profits in respect of new employment. The big flaw in that system is that so many companies are at present not making profits.  The net effect is that this incentive is not a real one.  One of the reasons for this is that the £500 cannot be carried forward to future years.  There must be a strong argument for carrying this amount <Col N="761" /> forward, because we want to encourage employers, when they see a pick up in their trade, to take on new employees. Perhaps the profits will not accrue for a number of years, but they should have the maximum employment incentive. That would be a welcome change in bringing more incentive to employment rather than the excessive incentives for capital in our present tax code.</P>
    <P>I welcome the many worthwhile changes made by the Minister to improve the administration of our tax code system, in making penalties more stringent and, even in a difficult time, finding the scope to offer separated spouses a far more fair tax system.  Many of us greatly welcome this because it is a growing problem in our community that people are separated and the tax code as heretofore has been treating them most unfairly as single persons despite the fact that maintenance payments may have to be paid to support the families.  Under the new, welcome system, separated spouses can have a system of either joint assessment or separate assessments, whose net effect is to give these people a higher take home pay which enables them to carry out their family responsibilities.  In the case of someone earning an average industrial wage of about £7,000 or £8,000, the benefit of this is about £800 in take home pay, or 13 per cent of it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I agree with Deputy Bruton with regard to certain aspects of this Bill.  That it has brought about a certain amount of equity is to be welcomed.  However, I hope during my deliberations to point out that, if we are introducing equity to our taxation system, it must be done honestly not dishonestly.  If one contrasts the proposals by the Minister with his party's programme for Government&mdash;and indeed the Labour-Fine Gael Programme for Government&mdash;one will see what I mean by dishonesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at this Bill from the standpoint of agriculture is like trying to shadow-box with a down pillow.  There is no substance and no train of thought in the Bill which could give the slightest consolation to that large sector of our <Col N="762" /> population, the agricultural or farming sector.  The only picture which comes through in the Finance Bill&mdash;and indeed in the Minister's earlier budget speech &mdash; is an obsession with bookkeeping which verges on lunacy.</P>
    <P>There is a total inconsistency in the Minister's approach to righting the ills of our trading position.  Surely any attempt to put us on the right track must include not alone the balancing of books&mdash;I accept that books must be balanced but that is not the be-all and end-all&mdash;but must also include an incentive to produce more and take a greater share of the world market with our produce.  Merely to say to the agricultural community, to our farmers, that we will tax you to the hilt and give you no hope for the future is to annihilate the work of advancement of the past 20 or 30 years.  Indeed, to tell them that they will have an increasing tax burden without any increase in their gross income is an unprecedented decision not worthy of a child in primary school.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of the contrast between the approach of the Government now and their Programme for Government as published.  In this respect I want to quote an extract from Fine Gael's policy for Economic Recovery as published in October 1982.  In referring to the farming sector they say:</P>
    <P>Our fundamental requirement is for policies which will secure a substantial and lasting reduction in both our domestic inflation rate and in interest rates.  Without these, agriculture and the food industry will remain in the trap which has frustrated development over the last four years.  Without such policies, farm incomes will not recover from the present depressed level which, in real terms, is over 40 per cent below that of 1978. </P>
    <P>They continue:</P>
    <P>The Poor Law Valuation (PLV) System currently used as a basis for assessing many farmers' eligibility for certain social welfare, health and education benefits and for assessing their liability for certain contributions must be replaced.  It must also be replaced as a <Col N="763" /> means of determining thresholds of liability for income tax. </P>
    <P>This section concludes by saying:</P>
    <P>We propose that it be replaced by a system based on standard results per enterprise and per region taken from the Farm Management surveys carried out by An Foras Talúntais.  We propose also that farmers should have the option of having their liability and eligibility assessed either on this basis or on the basis of factual assessment. </P>
    <P>I will quote also an extract from the agreed Labour/Fine Gael Programme for Government, as published in December 1982, where it refers to the replacement of the poor law valuation system and says:</P>
    <P>The Poor Law Valuation (PLV) System currently used as a basis for assessing many farmers' eligibility for certain ... benefits and ... liability for certain contributions must be replaced.  It will be replaced by a system based on standard results per enterprise and per region taken from the Farm Management surveys carried out by An Foras Talúntais.  These gross results would be adjusted to take account of capital depreciation, interest payments and other factors, in order to calculate taxable income. </P>
    <P>One sees the dishonesty if one contrasts those comments with those of the Minister in his budget speech of 9 February last with regard to farm taxation when he said:</P>
    <P>Public perception of tax equity demands that all income earners should be liable to tax on an equal footing.  Up to now, however, only one-third of the farming population has been included in the tax net.  There is no longer any justification for excluding the greater number of farmers from tax liability and I believe that the farming community itself accepts this viewpoint. </P>
    <P>I, too, agree with that.  The Minister continues to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> Accordingly, from April next all farmers will be liable for income tax. Due to the relatively low level of many farming incomes this extension of liability is not expected to lead to a substantial increase in tax yield in the short term.  Because of the absence of statistics it is difficult to calculate the additional yield and the best estimate is that the removal of the threshold will result in an increase of about £2.5 million in farm taxation in 1983.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the extension of liability may cause problems for farmers who are brought into the tax net for the first time, particularly as many of these will have no liability because of their low incomes.  The Revenue Commissioners are considering various means of phasing in this arrangement, including the provision of a simplified form for statement of the farmer's circumstances.  I will return to this later. </P>
    <P>The Minister does return to that later and I shall finish with this quotation from his remarks:</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government there is a commitment to establish a committee of inquiry containing representatives of small business and the Revenue Commissioners to recommend a simplified tax regime for family businesses.  I will take steps shortly to establish this committee as a matter of urgency and I intend to extend its remit to consider also the scope for simplified arrangements for smaller farmers.  To this end I will invite farming representatives to participate in the work of the committee. </P>
    <P>That is all very fine, but when one contrasts that with their Programme for Government one sees the different approach being taken now.  I am not saying that the present approach is right or wrong.  As a party we are examining the whole aspect of farming taxation.  What I am drawing attention to is the dishonest approach of this Government to farming taxation, when they outlined in their Programme for Government that they would adopt a certain system, put that to the <Col N="765" /> farming community, and now in this Finance Bill adopt a different approach altogether.  On that basis this approach is dishonest.</P>
    <P>The Government must devise a proper taxation system for all our farmers, seeing that they are now all included in the tax net.  I would hope that agreement would be reached between the various farming organisations, the Revenue Commissioners and the Government to adopt a policy which will lead to a taxation system for farming acceptable to all concerned.  Ever since farming taxation was introduced many years ago by another Fine Gael/Labour Government we have had a sort of &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; attitude. We have had the notional and all the other systems.  I hope we shall have now a system adopted that will be acceptable to all persons concerned in this farming taxation.</P>
    <P>I want to take a look at the overall situation of our farmers at present.  In this respect we must bear in mind that this is the base on which we are going to tax them further.  It must be borne in mind also that indirect as distinct from direct taxation has as great an impact on the farmer as on any other sector of the community. I would like to remind people who say that farmers are not paying their fair share of taxation that indirect taxation takes no account of the farmer's decreasing income.  A farmer's car is used for far more than joyriding.  It is an essential part of his everyday business.  One does not see many farmers' cars without a trailer hitch on the back.  It is used for almost all the farm work and yet it is taxed more and more heavily.  There is 23 per cent VAT on machinery repairs.  The drop in the sales of agricultural machinery indicates the farmer's inability to replace his machinery at current income levels.  He is, therefore, left with the task of repairing his existing machinery.  As the machinery becomes more obsolete the repairs become more frequent. Where is the justice in a 23 per cent VAT rate on these repairs and where is the hope for the future of the agricultural community?</P>
    <P>In the field of income tax it is worth noting that the Minister for Finance <Col N="766" /> introduced a divisive element into the relationship between the various sectors of the community when in his early speeches he deliberately set the PAYE workers against the self-employed by stating, on incorrect figures, that there was a vast hoard of money being retained by the self-employed and that this hoard of money would greatly reduce the impact on the PAYE sector.  This imposition of notoriety on the self-employed was a dangerous attempt to lessen the impact of the pressure from the PAYE workers.  In order to carry that bluff further he now tells the PAYE workers in this Bill that he is going to include a far larger number of farmers in the taxation net than hitherto.  This is a dangerous and a costly exercise.  There is no great increase in taxation to be got from the farming community.  There is no crock of gold hidden away.  This is a myth and the sooner the Minister and his colleagues in Government get away from that idea the better we can realise a greater equity in taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should know that the farming community at present have an inadequate income, and certainly it is not stable.  The Minister should realise that unless he devises a simple method of assessing a farmer's taxable income he is imposing on the section of the farming community who do not have a taxable income an auditing expense of sizeable dimensions which the farmer can ill afford.  Surely there must be somebody in this Labour-Fine Gael Government who can devise a fair share of taxation for farmers with an added incentive for production.  Are this Government so far beyond hope that they cannot wait, in their panic, to see what the overall situation will be in putting the country back on its feet?  The farmers form a very sizeable section of the self-employed. The idea that they are retaining some vast hoards of money that could be put to Government use is stupid.  To have that used as the butt of a Government's bluff is spurious.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the section in last year's Finance Act &mdash; and I hope to tie it up with this year's Finance Bill &mdash; which allowed a qualified farmer to take <Col N="767" /> over control of land free of stamp duty. This was a worthwhile progressive provision. However, I believe a number of changes should be included in these arrangements.  I presume I am in order in proposing changes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I would like to see that a transfer on sale to a trained farmer should also be free from stamp duty.  By a &ldquo;trained farmer&rdquo; I mean a farmer who has completed a 100-hour EEC course and the other aspects as laid down by the Finance Act, 1982, namely, that the young farmer is the holder of a certificate issued by ACOT certifying that he has satisfactorily completed an agricultural training course of a duration of not less than 100 hours, or the Farm Apprenticeship Board certifying that he has satisfactorily completed the course under the Farm Apprenticeship Scheme or the Trainee Farmer Scheme, or under the Minister for Agriculture or a committee of agriculture established under the Agriculture Act, 1931, being a certificate issued before the 1st day of December, 1980, certifying that he has satisfactorily completed a course equivalent to that referred to in the paragraph mentioned and also that he is the holder of a university degree, or equivalent university qualification, in agriculture and that the property will be used for the purposes of agriculture.  That was a worthwhile section in the Finance Act, 1982.  I am glad the Minister saw fit to have this continued in this Bill but there is another aspect in section 10 being removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the transfer on sale to a trained farmer should also be free of stamp duty.  At present a trained young farmer can take over the family farm free of stamp duty but has to pay 6 per cent stamp duty if he purchases additional land in order to make a viable holding. That is an area that should be examined. Under existing legislation a person must be a qualified person on the date the transfer of land takes place.  This provision <Col N="768" /> should be changed to allow a young farmer a period of, say, three years from the date of transfer in order to complete a 100-hour course or, indeed, to qualify under the 1982 Act.  This would have the dual advantage of allowing the immediate and significant transfer of land to young people and also it would encourage greater involvement in those courses.</P>
    <P>I believe the wife of a qualified person should automatically be deemed a qualified person for the purpose of stamp duty. We are encouraging joint ownership between husband and wife.  As the law stands, if a son on receiving a family farm from his father wishes to place his wife's name jointly on the deed she is liable for stamp duty on half the market value of the farm even though the son is qualified and exempt from stamp duty.  I should like the Minister to look into this.</P>
    <P>Given the high priority and apparent emphasis placed by the Government and their predecessors particularly &mdash; I said last week in another debate that I doubt if this Government will carry out the commitments made and the promises given &mdash; on early land transfer, there is no valid reason to discontinue the relief from stamp duty where land has been transferred in consideration of marriage.  The provision in the stamp duty law should be allowed to continue unamended.  Section 81 provides for the withdrawal of the relief from stamp duty in respect of a conveyance or transfer of property where marriage is a consideration therefor. That was provided in the previous Finance Bill for very good reasons.  If this Government are committed to greater land mobility and the transfer of farms from fathers to sons, repealing this section will be detrimental to what we are all agreed is essential, namely, the greater utilisation of land to its full potential.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a provision in the Bill to encourage the long-term leasing of land.  Outright purchase is today too costly.  With long-term leasing a trained farmer should be exempt from stamp duty on leases.  The current rate is 1 per cent of the annual rate.  If we are sincere in our desire for greater land mobility and earlier transfer we should ensure exemption from stamp duty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> There is a lack of direction in the Government's aimless stumbling about and this lack of direction has become terrifying in the extreme.  Farm Modernisation Scheme grants have been suspended and the annual cost of that suspension to the agricultural community is £146 million.  This removes any possibility of further development on the farm, such as drainage, and it also removes the possibility of purchasing up-to-date equipment.  It debars the farmer from improving his holding and increasing production and that at a time when increased production is vitally essential, particularly for the small farmer on whom income tax has been imposed for the first time.  If we are to have a proper approach to farming taxation we must also have a proper approach to farm development and the suspensions by this Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The PAYE sector is <Col N="770" /> taxed to the hilt.  Such taxation will, of course, have a long-term effect on agricultural industry generally.</P>
      <P>The suspension of the Euro loan at fixed interest rates is certainly not an incentive to greater agricultural production.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Minister went further and said that the extension of the income tax liability to farmers who up to now were excluded because of low rateable valuations represents the principal change in this matter of taxation.  He referred to the liability to income tax and said that a farmer's personal circumstances and the details of his business will have to be outlined in a farm profile form and that this will be with a view to the identification of those who would have taxable income.  The Minister <Col N="771" /> went on to say that this form will be a relatively simple document and that its completion should not present any undue difficulty.  He said that he could not think of any good reason for a farmer having to engage professional advice in regard to filling in the particulars that will be required.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us if these forms will be accepted by the local inspector of taxes in the context of assessing a farmer's liability to tax.  We should like to be given a legal definition of &ldquo;simplified accounts&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister would be prepared to produce a set of these accounts.  To date I have not been able to find any such accounts that would be accepted by a local tax inspector.</P>
      <P>On the question of the taxation of farmers it is important also to make the point that these taxes must be considered in the light of bringing about equity in the entire taxation system and that farmers will play their role in bringing about that equity, but the State must bear in mind the matter of incentives for production. A failure to provide incentives for the expansion of agriculture would lessen the importance of agriculture to the Irish economy.  Down through the years agriculture has maintained its place of the utmost importance in terms of our industrial output.  The Government must take great care to ensure that this Bill will not have the effect of undoing the good work that has been done in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the whole question of taxation we must show an aspect of leadership. Agriculture must not be allowed flounder as a result of the misdirected panic of one or indeed of many Ministers in this Government because of the imposition of taxation.  I appeal to the Minister to listen to the problems that are being outlined in terms of the taxation of the farming sector, to listen especially to the problems that are being outlined by the farming organisations.  I doubt if the agricultural sector can be considered in selfish isolation.  They must be regarded as the largest sector in industrial output. Therefore, the downward trend in farming must be reversed.  I appeal to the Minister to discontinue this dangerous <Col N="772" /> over-emphasis on book balancing and to bear in mind the overall good of the country.  I should like to refer also to Government expenditure, if that is all right with the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope some kind of agreement will be reached between the party Whips so that we will have an opportunity of going through the full Bill on Committee Stage.  I have been a Member of the House for a number of years and have found that we tend to become bogged down in the early sections of the Bill.  There is usually a long, wrangling debate dealing with a number of early sections.  The remaining sections are unfortunately never fully touched on. There are many items in the Bill which will not be reached.  I hope there will be some agreement between the Whips so that there will be a certain time span allocated to the different sections which comprise the Bill.  There are seven Parts in the Bill and a number of Schedules. The Whips should decide on the time that will be provided and provide for a debate on all sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The first few sections in the Bill deal with income tax.  There is a great deal of uneasiness, dissatisfaction and unrest among the people who are paying PAYE and PRSI.  In drafting the Bill the Government made a genuine effort to try to bring about tax equity.  This is highly desirable and something which will be achieved over a period.  The comments I will make are reasonable and fair and I hope they will be listened to.  I wish to be objective in what I say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill deals with interest on deposits.  The explanatory memorandum refers to the fact that exemption applying in the case of interest on deposits with certain commercial banks is being reduced from £70 to £50.  I will not argue the merits or demerits of that.  A lot of the money invested in banks is invested by small investors.  This money is utilised for industrial projects and so on.  Building societies have a higher exemption limit <Col N="774" /> and money invested with them is used for housing.  The people referred to here are small investors on low incomes who have saved some money.  I am sorry to see that there will be some curtailment of the right to save of such small investors.  Personally I regret this change for the reason that it will possibly cause serious concern to people who are inclined to save.  I hope it will not act as a disincentive but it is very likely it will and I should prefer to see the Bill without it.  I understand this section will be retroactive to 9 February 1982.  This alone will cause some problems to quite a number of people.  I do not suggest that its effects will be breathtaking but it will cause worry to many.</P>
    <P>The next section I wish to touch on deals with non-residents who invest here. Up to now such people simply went into a bank or to the ACC or to a building society and identified themselves as being on holidays but who were residents in, let us say, London.  The manager of the institution then got them to sign a certificate that they were living in England or elsewhere.  His account was then determined and he did not have to go through the Revenue Commisioners.  Such a person under this Act will have to sign an affidavit.  I am anxious to find out&mdash;I have been asked by a number of people&mdash; when this section will become law, whether it is on the date of the signing of the Act or on the passing of the Bill.  I would be happy if the Minister would let me know.  Section 9 deals with appeals and the explanatory memorandum, at page 3, states:</P>
    <P>Hearings, after the passing of the Act, by the High Court and Supreme Court of cases stated will no longer be held in camera. </P>
    <P>This section is of importance because it involves a difference between the dismissing of an appeal and the determination of an appeal.  It is a new provision. If a person applies for an adjournment of an appeal by the Revenue Commissioners the present procedure is that the commissioners will grant the appeal if it is made within nine months of the date on which assessment was given.  Under this section, if the appeal is dismissed <Col N="775" /> there will be no right of access to the Circuit Court.  If it is determined, the position will be that persons can proceed to the Circuit Court and the cases will be reheard.  If a person wants to take an appeal it will be to the Revenue Commissioners only and this will cause quite considerable problems.  I should like the Minister to deal at length with this matter when he is replying because of its importance to people who would have their appeals dismissed and who for one reason or another would wish to appeal to a court.</P>
    <P>My reading of the section leads me to understand that the person's right of appeal is to the Appeal Commissioners. The only case where he could go to the High Court or the Supreme Court would be on a case stated, that is a point of law as distinct from a point related to his income tax affairs.  It is a departure from existing procedures when a person goes before the Revenue Commissioners for a further determination of his tax.  Under this Explanatory Memorandum if these cases go to the High Court they will no longer be heard <i>in camera.</i> If a person tries to pull a fast one on the Revenue Commissioners he could be regarded as trying to defraud the Revenue Commissioners. It is essential that the affairs of such a person be made public.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the person who has made every possible effort to pay his tax, to keep his income tax affairs in order, who has kept his accountant fully informed and whose accountant submitted the documentation to the Revenue Commissioners.  If he finds himself in the Supreme Court his case will not be heard <i>in camera.</i> That is not fair because all his personal and intimate financial arrangements will be disclosed and this could have a detrimental effect on him.  Every person should have the right to have his financial affairs treated in confidence.  It is essential that this matter be teased out fully on Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister of State to bring this matter to the Minister's attention because it will cause many headaches over the next number of years.  Up to now our legal system has been held in high regard but if we bring <Col N="776" /> in a section like this, where a person's financial affairs will be heard in public or where a matter is determined by the Revenue Commissioners most people will find it very worrying.  Matters of that nature should not be decided on by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the section dealing with taxation of farming profits.  This is very important in a large agricultural constituency like mine.  All farmers have come to the conclusion &mdash; against their will &mdash; that it is in their interests to have their tax assessed on the same lines as other sections of the community, and this is desirable from an equity point of view.  It has been said that a simplified method of assessment for farmers with valuations under £40 would be introduced.  What is the position with regard to these simplified farm accounts?  I was under the impression farmers would make a very simplified form of returns and there would be very few problems completing the necessary forms.  I was happy to go along with that and most farmers agreed to fill in the forms and pay their accountants to complete their tax forms.  It was expected the amount charged would be minimal &mdash; not in excess of £100.  I read an article in a recent issue of the <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash; I am sorry I do not have it with me &mdash; written by Paul Drury which referred to the type of farm accounts to be submitted and completed.  I was worried about his reference to farm buildings erected over a ten year period and other items over a five-year period.  I have not seen these farm accounts and do not know if this article is correct.  However, I wish to know if people will have to go back over that length of time.  This would be totally unnecessary.  It should be sufficient to complete the previous year's and penultimate year's statements.  I question if any Member of this House could give concise and accurate information about extensions to their houses dating back five or ten years.  They would certainly have great difficulty in searching through records, trying to produce receipts and give details of the money spent.</P>
    <P>I agree with Chapter 2 which brings in people under £40 PLV.  I have had many <Col N="777" /> letters expressing reservations and opposition to this but in equity, for everybody's sake, the farming community would be wise to accept inclusion in the income taxation net and co-operate to the best of their ability.  I hope that the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance in their turn, would be equally co-operative with the farming community and would be as helpful as possible in presenting simple forms which can be satisfactorily and easily completed, without the necessity of researching records for many years.  The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance need the co-operation of farmers but will not get it if the farmers are asked to make returns on what happened seven, eight or ten years ago.  That would raise strong opposition and the matter would be a hot potato for a long time.</P>
    <P>There should be a common sense, definite and clear-cut approach by the Revenue Commissioners in this matter.  Also, the Revenue Commissioners, in attempting to check over these records of many years would be involved in a mountainous and expensive load of work, much of which would be unproductive.  On the other hand, farmers would be compelled to spend a lot of money engaging accountants, thus causing hassle and upset in the farming community.  Under a simplified method, quite an amount of money would come in, but otherwise we will run into considerable difficulty.</P>
    <P>A very important measure included in the Minister for Finance's early 1982 budget allowed farmers exemption from stamp duty when transferring a farm from father to son, where the young farmers involved had completed a course lasting 100 hours which was certified by the local committee of agriculture or, as at present, ACOT.  In fairness, this worthy legislation was implemented later by Deputy MacSharry when Minister for Finance.  It has brought about a tremendous increase in volume of transfer of farms from fathers to sons, expediting the handover to many young farmers.  This has been of considerable assistance to the whole farming community and of benefit to our agriculture.  That scheme continues to the end of this year, when it will not be <Col N="778" /> renewed.  There was no promise of renewal.  However, I asked the Minister to look at the whole situation in regard to transfers of family farms.  These transfers will be on the <i>ad valorem</i> value next year but this value will be halved in transfers of farms between families.  I would prefer, if we cannot continue with the original scheme, that we revert to the 1 per cent stamp duty which had obtained for many years before the 1982 legislation. With regard to transfers on marriage, prenuptial settlements and so on, the present system, which is very necessary and desirable, should also be retained.</P>
    <P>The next section deals with corporation tax and income tax.  I see Deputy Kelly, who is more expert on these matters than I, coming into the House and do not propose to dwell on them.  This Bill deals with taxation and its collection. Some of the charges will have an effect on the whole taxation system.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the way some of these items are being introduced. For example, with regard to An Bord Pleanála there will be increased charges for the granting of planning permissions. At the time it was set up it was necessary but it has become totally politicised and one must now question the wisdom of its cost and continuance.  In fact a lot of people are expressing dissatisfaction with it.</P>
    <P>An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom are two other items I should like to comment on.  A sizeable amount of money has been expended to date on partially setting them up.  Indeed, I question the wisdom of setting up those boards at all. I noticed reading in the <i>Irish Independent</i> recently reports of a huge office lying empty, which is a total waste of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bow to your ruling, Sir, and will not argue any further.  We are talking about taxation and the collection of taxes and I shall adhere to that.  I did, however, question the wisdom of spending some money on the collection of those taxes and I shall not dwell on the matter any further.</P>
      <P>Sections 84 onwards deal with the new residential property tax which, as the House is aware, is a self-assessment tax. This is somewhat similar to the way wealth tax was assessed.  The House will be aware also that under this Finance Bill a person must complete his returns and the actual return must be furnished with an accompanying cheque before 1 October next; otherwise a person may become liable for a penalty of heavy interest.</P>
      <P>I have reservations about this tax and fear it will cause enormous problems.  I have seen wealth tax come and go &mdash; that was one of ours.  Then Fianna Fáil introduced the resource tax which I saw come and go.  I remember going to Dublin Castle at the time of the introduction of the wealth tax where there was a large area provided for the huge staff who would collect that tax.  At the time Deputy B. Desmond, now Minister for Health, asked about the amount of money collected which was, as far as my memory serves me, less than £750,000. This new residential property tax presents a legal minefield on the one hand and luscious green pastures for accountants on the other.  The other people who will benefit from this tax will be auctioneers and valuers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want tax equity, but with common sense.  PAYE workers want to see the yield of their taxes spent wisely.  They do not want to see an army of civil servants trying to collect money bogged down in legal and other technicalities, bringing the whole system into disrepute.  Inevitably that kind of exercise winds up with a marginal amount of tax being collected and the cost of collection renders it useless. This residential property tax will <Col N="781" /> pose enormous problems yielding minimal amounts.  I fear also that in a few years time it may be necessary by public demand to have it altered or withdrawn altogether.  If I might give one example of some of the problems I foresee in its enforcement.  Take the example of a man, a widower with three daughters.  He has quite a good job, he has a large house costing £100,000 on which he has a mortgage of £75,000.  His three daughters are working, be they three civil servants, three teachers, or two teachers and one a civil servant.  That man dies without a will, his wife having died earlier&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the total failure of the Government to protect employment by not taking the necessary measures in time to prevent the collapse of an increasing number of major industrial firms. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are moving this motion in the wake of last Thursday's long list of announcements. It has been described as Black Thursday in the area of industry. We are faced with an accelerated collapse of our industrial structure, an avalanche of closures becoming a daily feature of our lives, against a background of 210,000 people unemployed.  I believe that is the real figure.  The figures for the end of April came out yesterday and they show a figure of approximately 180,000 but, when one adds to that the over 20,000 young people not qualified to be on the register or in receipt of social welfare, plus the thousands in the system applying for unemployment benefit, plus the small farmers who are not on the list but who are available for work, then a conservative figure at this stage is <Col N="782" /> 210,000.  If one were to go into it in extreme detail one could add another 5,000 to 10,000 to that.</P>
    <P>In Ireland today we are seeing a national crisis of unemployment.  There is a national emergency here.  It is against that background that we in Fianna Fáil move this motion to try to alert the Government &mdash; although the last few days seem to have shocked them out of their slumber somewhat &mdash; that we are trying to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that there is a dire need for a fire brigade action plan to combat the crisis now facing the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I know that certain Government speakers say &ldquo;Let us have the total shakeout. Let it all happen.&rdquo;  Apparently there is in certain Government circles a philosophy, and it is borne out by their budgetary policy, that the way to solve our problems is to create more and more unemployment.  I do not subscribe to that view.  I think there is a slow-burning fuse here.  If the Government do not wake up to their responsibilities and to the crisis that is upon us, other measures will be sought in other houses to try to come to grips with what I believe is a very serious and emergency situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Where other people, outside the democratic system, come together, when they look at this House and see the lack of concern being shown, the lack of action, no solutions forthcoming, I think the Minister would agree that there is a great danger of that kind of situation arising.  There are over 70,000 young people today with no opportunities and no hope of opportunities and a climate of no hope is being created by the present Government.  I condemn the Government for this in the strongest possible <Col N="783" /> terms.  The country at this stage needs leadership and it is not getting it. The only answer appears to be that there is no hope.  That is the answer that was handed out to the 500 Telectron workers last week.  There is an apparent lack of concern for the tragedy of unemployment. There is apparently a lack of concern about the effect of unemployment on people's families, the social stresses that will be imposed on people who are losing their work at a very early age with no hope of getting another job.  We are the people those workers look to for leadership to create a climate of hope.  I do not believe in creating a climate of no hope.  It is very easy to lose one's confidence and, having lost it, it is extremely difficult to get it back.  I would warn the Government that this is the climate they have been creating and I do not think that is the way to entice people to invest in this country.</P>
      <P>We tabled this motion to try to find out from the Government whether they have a policy in relation to factory closures, whether they have a policy to come to grips with even part of the problem, whether they will come out of hibernation and stop burying their heads in the sand and hoping that the problems will go away.  Day by day the problems get greater.  If they want to remain with the label of the Government of no hope, so be it.  The Irish public will have an answer to that whenever the time comes.</P>
      <P>I have been looking for the last couple of months to see if there was any action plan forthcoming from the Minister or the Government.  Any action we have seen in the last couple of days has been a post crisis action.  When the Telectron announcement came to everybody's attention two weeks yesterday nothing seemed to be done by the Government. When my colleague, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, put down questions there was a look of amazement on the far benches. No meeting had taken place between the respective Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Tuesday when we had a special debate on it, eight days after the announcement was made, the Minister had not even at that stage contacted the principals of this firm.  That is not the way to deal with a crisis situation.  I would have expected at the very least that the Minister, after a shock announcement like that, would take up the phone and ring the people concerned.  This was a firm that had taken over Telectron Limited in Ireland and was in receipt recently of a £16½ million Government contract. Surely the Minister and the Government and the people of Ireland were entitled to know how secure was that contract, how secure were supplies.  Eight days later neither Minister concerned had done anything about it.  Everything was left to the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position as it was last week.  We know that in retrospect the Minister will try to make it out differently.  I stated that here last week and I was not contradicted.  It is easy to contradict in retrospect.  I asked the Minister did he not consider it his responsibility to be there with the IDA, giving full Government backing, instead of showing a lack of concern on the part of an Irish Government and, had he done that, that multinational would have had respect for him and his Government. Two days later the junior Minister, who was in America on other business, was directed towards a meeting with AT &amp; T. Had that junior Minister been going abroad on a specific mission we would have read about it in the public press because, if there is one thing this Government is good at, it is telling us where they are going abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a saying in our part of the country that you should never send a boy on a man's errand.  Unfortunately that is what happened here.  Here we have a firm with 500 well trained employees in a growth industry of the future, a growth industry which is allowed to close its doors and put a lock on them.  Surely this was an ideal situation for the Government <Col N="785" /> to demonstrate clearly their effectiveness and show also they had a plan in their heads, an action programme to deal with the situation.  Surely this was an ideal situation for the National Enterprise Agency to become involved.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister believe this is a growth industry?  Perhaps he does not.  I believe he has more contempt for that agency than another one to which I shall come later.  If ever there was an opportunity for a national agency to become involved in a growth area of the future which was designed to ensure supplies for telecommunications this was that opportunity. Even if it were taken up seriously now I believe a good job could be done. Remember these 500 employees will now join the dole queue drawing unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit. They will receive something in the region of £3 million to £3.5 million for the year. Is it good business to pay that kind of money to a trained work force now on the unemployment scrapheap?  Surely this will destroy morale.  Is this good philosophy?  Does the Minister regard this growth industry as defunct?  I see from recent returns the Minister is encouraging the setting up of small industries to absorb some of the work force. This is to be welcomed and something good should come out of it.  We, on these benches, are not here merely to be destructive.  Our criticism is always designed to be constructive.</P>
    <P>AT &amp; T had a contract with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for £16 million to £16.5 million for digital radios.  Will this contract be honoured or is it true that already agreement has been reached with AT &amp; T that 24 of them will be made in the United States of America? Was that agreement reached before the closure?  If it was not, then the Minister has one more ground on which to argue for the future of the company.  I am also at a loss to know the meaning of some remarks attributed to Mr. White, Chief Executive of the IDA, that AT &amp; T would be around Dublin for a long time. Is this another asset stripping operation? One place closes down and, when the heat is off, it opens up somewhere else.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will take this opportunity of telling us where the 24 transmissions will be made.  Will they be made outside the country at a considerable cost to the country?  This whole situation was very badly handled by AT &amp; T and equally badly handled by the Government.  There was no hard bargaining in an effort to get the better of the situation.  Is there any plan of action or any policy in relation to factory closures? One looks at the alleged programme of the Government.  I went through it minutely and the first observation is that the Youth Employment Agency would continue its activities.  We have 70,000 unemployed youth and the only attention they get is the trite observation that the agency will continue its activities.  That agency has been in operation for quite some time.  It is in receipt of very considerable amounts of money and perhaps the Minister would take this opportunity to tell us what the agency is doing with that money.  Are they as bankrupt of ideas as the present Government? Are they just conning our youth?  Do they not know what to do with the money? Are we reverting to the Fine Gael policy of the 1950's, the emigrant ship which will rid us of our unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the policy now, then tell the people where they should go because the same problems exist in other countries. The young people today have no intention of emigrating.  They demand the right to work in their own country.  It was the late Deputy Paddy McGilligan who said the Government have no responsibility to provide employment.  Apparently that philosophy still exists.  The Taoiseach and other members of the Government have said there is no solution and no hope.  It does not matter which Government are in power.  We have moved far away from social philosophy and social justice.  The Government are in <Col N="787" /> reverse, still with the philosophy that they have no responsibility to provide employment.  It is difficult to find out the real thinking of the Government, if there is any thinking, real or imaginary.  Take the situation that has arisen in Cork. There is considerable confusion down there not alone among the work force but among the politicians.  Last evening the Tánaiste, according to the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, pledged Labour Party support for State aid if required.  There seems to be a direct conflict here because the Taoiseach on Friday ruled out State intervention to save the 600 jobs.  This is incredible. We have the Tánaiste saying that something is white and the Taoiseach saying it is black.</P>
    <P>The same sort of confusion exists between these two men in regard to the future of semi-State companies.  If we are to believe what the Labour Party say in public their opinion is that semi-State companies should be expanded in order to create more employment but the Taoiseach says that the whole semi-State area is under severe scrutiny and that State aid in the future will be on the basis only of these companies paying their way.  I do not know what is the real view of the Minister opposite.  I have read of different announcements he has made from time to time on this question but his most recent statement would seem to suggest that if semi-State companies do not pay their way they will be closed.  That was the Minister's view as outlined at a press conference in Brussels but perhaps what he says there is different from what he says at home.</P>

      <P>There is a cloud of uncertainty and confusion surrounding the future of Irish Steel, of NET and of Verolme Cork Dockyard.  It is well known that if something is not done about an order for that dockyard it will close.  Has the Minister any explanation to offer regarding the order that was to have been placed for the fisheries research and protection vessels?  If the orders for these two vessels are not placed very shortly the Cork dockyard will have to close with the loss of 1,000 jobs.  The total economic withdrawal of the Government from the entire Cork region is obvious but my colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, will be going into more detail on that.  The Government should spell out clearly in the House tonight what is the future for Irish Steel, for NET and for Verolme.  Is it the intention of the Government to sit back and create an environment in which these companies will lose more money and in that way to put of the evil day that somebody else will have to face?</P>
      <P>The Government have at their disposal all the consultants' reports necessary.  If we are well equipped in any respect, it is in terms of consultancy and inter-departmental reports.  There must be many such reports stacked away in every Government Department.  Is it not time they were taken down and something done about them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The philosophy of the Taoiseach and of some of his Ministers has changed drastically since their return to office.  On the day on which I was appointed Minister for Industry and Energy a receiver was appointed to the Fieldcrest operation in Kilkenny.  I recall the cries then from the Opposition benches and I recall the notices of motions that were put down by the people opposite asking, in effect, for the nationalisation of Fieldcrest.  However, the Taoiseach has made so many U-turns in recent times that he must have a reel in his head by now.  The people opposite on that evening I speak of walked into the lobbies to vote against <Col N="789" /> the Government of the day but we were clear in our thinking in relation to the Fieldcrest operation.  We can only assume that it would be very difficult for anyone to convince the Irish people now that the Taoiseach is a man who always adheres to what he believes in.  We are still clear in our thinking that where there is a company who have orders on their books and who are viable, they should be sustained but they cannot be sustained if it is too late when one finds out what the real problems are.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Department there was a monitoring unit that was operating very effectively with the result that the problems of companies were well known in advance.  I had monitored any company that I thought was in danger and I ensured that in any such cases action was taken in time.  There is no lack of knowledge in the system in relation to company problems but there is a lack of conviction and of commitment on the part of the Government so far as such companies are concerned.  We are aware that action in this regard is a high risk business for a politician but that is a challenge that must be faced if we are to save firms.  Last week we heard of the big names in terms of businesses going to the wall but how many small firms go to the wall about which we do not hear?  Has anybody taken the trouble of analysing what is happening?  According to the Government's programme the answer to the problem was to be mainly the setting up of a national development corporation. If the Government believe genuinely that a national development corporation will provide the answer to the problem I urge the Minister, for the second time in this House, to set them up straight away under the companies structure and to let them get on with the job.  There are plenty of precedents for that.  The Minister is aware that he can bring the corporation into action any day he wishes merely by registering them in the Companies Office.  However, I do not believe that the Government are committed to the setting up of such a body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

      <P>The Minister opposite is not committed to it anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It may happen that the corporation will be forced on him by some members of the Government or it may be that a majority of the Government would prefer to leave the situation as it is, an optical illusion, as has been the case since the mid-seventies so far as some of the Labour members are concerned. Until such time as the corporation are put into operation, the National Development Agency are there to be used in terms of the innovative work the Governmnent talk about so glibly.  I can only conclude that the national development corporation is to remain stillborn.</P>
      <P>In addition to the national development corporation, the Government's programme contains a list of task forces. Perhaps the Minister will tell us how many times these task forces have met and whether any ideas have been forthcoming from them.  When, for instance, are the National Planning Board to report?  These various committees and task forces are no more than layers of bureaucracy, each on top of the other, so as to ensure that nothing happens.  There are too many agencies without talking of creating more.  There is too much money being wasted on those agencies and there are many good people involved in them whose talents could be co-ordinated and used in the area of job creation.  What we need is a programme of action from all the expertise that is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are enough advisers, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no shortage in terms of the creation of employment so far as advisers are concerned and there is no shortage of money to pay for these advisers.  If these people were producing results I would not mind paying them; I object to a whole list of advisers being engaged when there are no results to show for the investment.  At least, I question the reasons for engaging these advisers. In the short terms during which I was in Government I did not have a personal adviser.  I did not need any because the best brains were available in the Departments concerned.  It was only a matter of <Col N="791" /> motivating these people into action in order to get all the advice one needed.</P>
      <P>The Minister, for whatever reason, is devoting most of his energy to the area of Dáil reform.  On reading the newspapers one gathers that the Minister is concerned about having the proceedings of this House, and the Seanad, broadcast. That is all right in its own time but the critical situation in the industrial scene today calls for a commitment by the Government.  The Minister should not be spending so much time on Dáil reform because that will not create one job but will involve a lot of time, expertise and energy.  We all welcome Dáil reform but it should not be given priority over the creation and maintenance of jobs.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have difficulty keeping up with the job situation and I do not begrudge him the task particularly when one considers the avalanche of closures that took place last week.  Every daily newspaper lists further threats of closure. It is time the Government got their priorities right, forgot about Dáil reform and all that goes with it and devoted their energies to the problem of the day.  The serious problem facing us is the accelerated number of factory closures and the huge number on the unemployment list. The people are looking to the House, and the Government, for a solution to that problem.  they want action and they do not want the House to be wasting time on the matters I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to the areas dealt with in the Government's programme and pointed out those that have not been implemented.  The real philosophy and thinking in relation to industrial development and job preservation is contained in the budget which is a demonstration of Government thinking.  When one looks at the budget one can only come to the conclusion that its thrust is to produce more unemployment, no matter from what angle one looks at it.  For instance, with regard to the construction industry, the Coalition, in their programme for Government, promised £100 million for that industry.  The Tánaiste met representatives of that industry and said the Government would fulfil that promise <Col N="792" /> but the £100 million was taken out of capital investment in the budget.  The result is that the Government are depressing the construction industry to the extent that one in every two people employed in that sector will be out of a job by the end of 1983.  One must bear in mind that every job in the construction industry sustains three more indirectly outside in ancillary services.  Therefore, every job lost in the construction industry means a loss of four jobs.  That is why many small businesses are closing.  The Government's policy in the budget is resulting in many job losses throughout the country.  It is foolish thinking to produce total depression in that sector when it is possible to create jobs.</P>
    <P>The heavy imposition of VAT has not helped.  We were told last week of a great reduction by the Government in VAT payments by the hotel industry but it should be remembered that the Government in the budget increased VAT on hotels.  Where is the reduction there? That is another area where jobs could be maintained if we had the right environment. The heavy imposition of VAT in that and other areas has depressed demand so much that every day people are losing their jobs in the consumer side of industry.  For the first time in about 20 years shop employees in my town are being let go because of the depressed demand and that is a direct result of the budget policy.  I am sure I do not need to refer to the loss of business, jobs and revenue to the Exchequer that is taking place in Border counties, but that problem has spread to the midlands.  At the end of the year it will be interesting to see if the decision to put on the additional VAT was worth while.  Figures shown to the Fianna Fáil Front Bench indicate that up to £100 million may be lost in revenue. For instance, at this stage up to 30 per cent of electrical business has gone across the Border.  I do not have to tell the House the percentage of petrol sales that has gone across the Border.  I have heard of a man in Clones who a couple of months ago was selling 8,500 gallons of petrol but is now selling 500 gallons. People are buying from him just enough to get them across the Border.  The <Col N="793" /> people in Donegal will also tell the Minister the reality of the situation.  Dundalk has become a ghost town and Monaghan is in a similar situation.  That crazy situation has come about as a result of the Government's budgetary strategy.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the Government take decisions without thinking them through to the ultimate or assessing the damage they may cause, just as was done in the case of the 5 per cent VAT increase on the hotel industry.  That was a bookkeeping exercise that was changed when it was discovered the amount of harm it would do.  It is time the Government looked at their policies and saw the damage they are causing throughout the economy.  We may be told that it will be necessary to borrow money to do certain things but it must be remembered also that we have to borrow money to pay social welfare.  Very shortly we will have more people on the dole than there will be in manufacturing industry.  I wonder how long we will have to wait before there will not be enough people paying to sustain the situation that is developing.</P>
    <P>The Minister should think seriously about the points I have made.  He should deal with the situation with regard to employment within the semi-State sector and tell the House whether part of the contract with AT &amp; T International will be carried out in America.  Will the Minister consider the National Enterprise Agency with a view to investigating the Telectron situation?  Are we going to permit the tyre industry here to collapse and give it over to the importers?  Dunlop and Semperit are under threat but what are we doing about that?  If we continue along the road we are travelling Ireland will have a large warehouse with a computer for the distribution of imported products.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's Department, and the Department of the Environment, I established import substitution sections and I should like to know if they are active. The Minister is aware that thousands of jobs can be saved by proper monitoring, by looking closely and severely at State purchases.  I introduced a monthly report system whereby every item purchased in the State and semi-State purchasing area <Col N="794" /> would be reported to the Minister.  As a result of that it would be possible to see on a monthly basis how much was being purchased outside Ireland and the material that could be purchased at home. Many jobs could be created in that area but that problem was never tackled seriously. The mechanism to deal with the problem exists and the Minister should make use of it.  He should not be chicken-hearted when dealing with our partners in the EEC in regard to certain imports by those countries.  The Minister is aware that the French are past masters in this matter.  They accept every Directive passed by the EEC with open arms but they always find the ways and means of getting the maximum benefit for their economy while complying with those Directives.  We need that type of action. The Minister has the ability to deal with that problem and he should do so now. Stop wasting time on Dáil reform.  Let us come to grips with the real problems. Stop the avalanche of factory closures and protect employment.  We will be thanked for that at the end of the day and not for providing a better system for ourselves in which to operate.</P>

      <P>Deputies Reynolds and Fitzgerald complained about the time being given to Dáil reform.  Two items have been with the Opposition for some time.  One of the matters the Government have in mind is the setting up of an allparty committee on small businesses.  We all know that small businesses are often smothered in red tape.  They do not get the help they need.  Deputy Reynolds correctly pointed out that there are too many agencies dealing with them.  We have a proposal to do something about that and it has been with the Opposition for the last two months.  Unfortunately we have not received a definite response from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have proposals to set up a committee to look at public expenditure.  We all realise that the burden of taxation is one of the main problems faced by industry.  The only way to reduce that is to cut public expenditure. We want a committee to examine that not as a means of preventing the Government from taking action but because it is important to have a consensus as far as possible and that all sides should make a contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need for contribution from all parties in relation to the question of preventing redundancies.  We have specific measures to put forward which will be of direct help in this regard.  We recognise that many people who have been made redundant are highly skilled and worked for years with high technology.  We have allocated staff from the IDA to talk to people recently made redundant to assist <Col N="797" /> them in establishing industries of their own.  I know of four separate projects actively being considered between employees of Telectron and the IDA which could lead to a substantial number of jobs being created.  That is the correct way to turn our difficulties to good effect. There is a great need to use the talented people we have.  There is too much pessimism about the way we are dealing with our problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a political point.  There was a rapid growth in exports in 1982.  Industrial exports grew in volume terms by 13 per cent as against a fall on the world market by a ½ per cent. Much of that came from foreign enterprises which have established here.  While we may be criticising some foreign firms which found themselves, not in the best way, closing down, we should also recognise that there are a substantial number of foreign firms which have done a good job.  Let us recognise what we can do and stop beating our breasts and complaining that we are not good at doing this or that. We are the best critics of one another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to accentuate what we have been able to achieve.  Most of these exports have been coming from new foreign enterprises.  We do not have a good export performance from domestic industries.  There have been good signs in that direction so far this year.  CTT received an unprecedented number of inquiries from Irish industry anxious to break into the export market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>To some degree this is due to the fact that the domestic market is depressed.  We cannot ignore that. Since 1980 there has been a fall in disposable income.  People have less money to spend.  That is the price we have to pay <Col N="798" /> for putting the public finances in order. We got the balance of payments down from 14 per cent GNP to 4 per cent this year.  We did that at a high price in terms of falling living standards.  It is no wonder people are complaining about the burden of taxation.  There has been a dramatic increase in taxation.  This has had an effect on the domestic market for Irish industry.  The good result is that many Irish industries are beginning to look outside. That is why there has been an upsurge this year in the number of inquiries to CTT from Irish industries seeking to export.</P>
      <P>We need to do something about State purchasing and ensure that the State seeks out Irish people who are producing the goods and give them a proper chance. Deputy Reynolds took a good initiative in that area.  I do not want to take anything from him.  I am glad to say we are going a step further.  SFADCo intend to publish a detailed guide for business people on how they can tender for State contracts.  They are extremely complex and complicated.  Many Irish businesses are not big enough to get into the system. I am glad to see that through the initiative of SFADCo, a guide is being produced to help Irish businesses to make sure that they will avail of all opportunities.  There are considerable opportunities for them to tender for State purchases.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Reynolds if he is suggesting that we should introduce some system of discrimination like that being done, lamentably, in France and Britain and other countries.  We cannot afford to do that.  We depend on exports for survival whereas they have large home markets and if they can get away with it they can afford to discriminate and allow discriminatory régimes to grow up.  If that is allowed to grow up in Europe, if the Common Market were to break down, we would be done for.  We have got to have exports and export markets if our industries are to survive. Therefore, we should not be seen in any way to give support to protectionist State purchasing.  However, we must rigorously resist the adoption of such measures by other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say that the Taoiseach has <Col N="799" /> decided to raise this matter in the strongest possible way at the forthcoming European Summit at Stuttgart to point out that we are opposed to any discriminatory measures to prevent fair tendering by Irish firms for business in the State sector in other countries.  All we want is fair competition and if we can get it I am confident that Irish workers, who are better qualified than most of their continental competitors, can easily meet and beat foreign entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>I was glad to have the opportunity to be on an industrial development promotion in the US early this year.  One thing came home very forcefully to me, and I am sure there are those on the other side who will share this experience: that whatever lack of confidence we may have in ourselves there is no doubt among US industrialists who have invested in this country and who have substantial interests here, some of them, such as Westinghouse, having started off with one plant, went on to have a second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth.  They have shown confidence in us, a confidence that we deserve.  One of the things that struck me when I was speaking to those people in the US is that what attracts them here is not just the tax régime, which is undoubtedly quite favourable, and the industrial grants which are also favourable, but the fact that we have a young adaptable work force.</P>
    <P>We have more engineering graduates than most of our competitor countries in Europe.  We have more engineering graduates per head of population than the US have.  They are the sort of factors that are attracting people to this country.  I am glad to say that the investment by successive Governments &mdash; I do not make any partisan points in expressing this &mdash; in improving regional technical colleges and providing the National Institutes of Higher Education is paying large dividends in attracting foreign industry here. We have tremendous assets here: let us not downgrade them.  Self-criticism is fine but if Irish people who criticise what goes on here could only hear what US investors who have put money here have to <Col N="800" /> say about it they would take a different view.</P>

      <P>I hope the Taoiseach will take an interest in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many things we can do.  This is the first debate in a broad sense we have had on industrial development, so let us use the debate to talk about new ideas we could adopt. One of the things I believe we are not exploiting to an adequate degree is our food industry.  Somebody pointed out recently that there are only two primary products in the world, fuel and food.  We do not have fuel in abundance but we have food in abundance.  In most cases fuel is a non-renewable resource whereas our food production capacity is constantly, annually, renewable.</P>
      <P>Let us be honest about it.  I do not believe we are exploiting our full food industry.  As a certain New Zealand agriculturalist said about 30 years ago, the Irish farmer is producing as little as is conceivable for him to produce under an Irish sky.  As a member of that profession, it comes rather hard on me to admit that to a great extent that is the case for a variety of reasons.</P>
      <P>What is lacking most in my view, is proper synchronisation between what is produced on the farm, on the one hand, and what is required in the market place. The Tennyson Report pointed out that we are producing our milk in a seasonal way only, as a result of which our creameries are not properly in use for much of the year.  Our beef equally is being produced in a highly seasonal way and therefore our meat factories are crowded out at times of the year and have no meat to keep them going at other times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to make any deep penetration in world food markets we must get added value products, downstream products, to where markets are available.  You cannot come out with a new product and hope you will be able to sell it in the market on the following day.  You have got to establish your contacts.  First of all you must discover if there is a market for a product. Then you must do your research into development, as to how you will develop <Col N="801" /> the product and present it.  Then you start developing your contacts.  All this can take between two and four years.</P>
    <P>If food processors do not have steady supplies, guaranteed at prices that they can be sure of over a reasonably long period, they will not be able to develop the food market to the extent that they should.  We have got to develop two things: one is long-term production contracts between farmers and processors and a futurist market in various food products so that people can buy an amount of a certain commodity, whether it be grain, cattle or milk products, six months or a year in advance, at a fixed price.  The money would then be paid over to the farmers and all they would have to do would be to abide by the contract to produce the goods they had sold in advance.  This would get over many of the capital difficulties of the farmers and would serve to provide an assurance of supply for the processing industry.  That is vitally necessary if we are to develop that industry in foreign markets.  Otherwise we will not succeed in the food processing area.</P>
    <P>We also need to do much more than we have been doing to develop a marketing arm for indigenous industry.  Foreign industries very often have their executives located not in Ireland but in Geneva or Brussels or somewhere else and all they have is a production facility in Ireland.  If our native firms are to compete with them they must have a marketing arm just as sophisticated as that which the non-national firms have here.  We simply have not had the time or the expertise to develop that.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Finance I introduced a scheme to provide money for more Irish firms to recruit marketing executives.  It was a very successful scheme and many people were recruited and tremendous numbers of exports resulted from it.  I have heard it said by people in industry that they have difficulty in recruiting suitable Irish people with adequate marketing skills to avail of that scheme.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is some deficiency in our educational system if we are not producing people with those marketing skills to <Col N="802" /> fill the vacancies that are there.  We need to look at our entire educational system, from secondary schools on, to see if we are producing the type of skills that are necessary.  This afternoon I attended the annual dinner of the Confederation of Irish Industry.  One of the points I made to them, and I am sure Deputy Reynolds will agree with me, is that industrialists must get into the classrooms, that they must start talking to pupils and teachers. Otherwise we will have the continuance of this sense of hopelessness amongst school-children, doing courses that will not lead anywhere because they have not been given the advice or the opportunity or the experience to think of other courses that could lead to good jobs in industry.  We need a much closer link between the educational and the industrial systems and I intend that steps will be taken in that direction.  I am doing a paper on it.</P>
    <P>We need to provide means to get more venture funds into Irish manufacturing industry.  At the moment there is quite an amount of private funds for investment. Much of this money is invested in Government borrowings, in gilts.  More of it is invested in property modules and development of one sort or another for which quite generous tax incentives are given.  We need to have a look at our whole tax code to see if this is the right emphasis because I believe the emphasis should be on giving the main incentives to people who have money to invest to put it into manufacturing industry, and not even into the construction industry. I agree there are problems in the construction industry but ultimately the construction industry is a service to the wealth-creating sector of the economy. We would not have a construction industry if we did not have wealth-creating agencies to finance exports.  As a first priority we should endeavour to channel any available funds into the manufacturing sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>I hope that in this debate we can reach a consensus on doing that.  There is a need to bring the fruits of modern technology much closer to industry.  One of the best decisions the present Government <Col N="803" /> have taken was to transfer the National Board for Science and Technology, which had been in the Department of the Taoiseach, to the Department of Industry and Energy.  That is where it belonged because the link should be between technology and industry.  There is no point in having technologists going away producing brilliant ideas, brilliant papers, in isolation from the reality of industrial development.  I intend to ensure that the National Board for Science and Technology under my aegis will get very clear policy directions to produce research and activity in the technological area that is directly related to the needs of industry.</P>
    <P>We need to have improvements in the present early warning system, which is very good in many respects although there have been a number of problems in the recent past.  The IDA, Fóir Teoranta and the Industrial Credit Corporation are actively involved in rescues. In the four months to 30 April 1983, through the rescue activities of the State agencies, 2,481 jobs have been saved that would otherwise have disappeared.  That compares with 1,619 jobs in the same period in 1982.  There has been enhanced rescue activity despite a very difficult industrial environment.  That situation may have arisen because there is a greater need for industrial rescue at present: I am not getting involved in making this a partisan point, but it shows the extent of activity by State agencies in this area.</P>
    <P>I intend to ensure that I will be involved to the maximum extent in all the difficulties arising in industry.  In any case where an industry has been in difficulties, I have immediately called in the senior executives.  I met the senior international vice-president for operations of the AT &amp; T Company in regard to Telectron.  I have met both national and international management of Irish Dunlop in regard to the problems they are encountering.</P>

There are enough problems on the home front for me to deal with, and my Minister of State is dealing with problems in the United States.  If necessary I would fly to the United States to discuss problems with industrialists there, but I believe once a Minister has confidence in his Minister of State, and notwithstanding the rather dismissive remarks made by Deputy Reynolds in this regard, I believe Deputy Reynolds has equal confidence in my Minister of State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We must develop a better atmosphere in industry.  It has been fairly said that there are restrictive practices adopted by labour unions in certain industries &mdash; I do not want to get involved in particular cases.  Trade unions are their own worst enemies when they do not see that the reality in the market place has changed and their firm is not selling the goods they produce, not because of any fault of theirs but because of changes in the market place.  People must be prepared to adapt to the new reality.  If a firm cannot afford them they must be prepared to change industrial practices which may have been perfectly justified when the firms could afford them.  That could be achieved if more Irish workers invested in their own industry, or if not in other firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the initiatives I would urge firms to use is the provision in the 1982 Finance Act which gives a tax incentive to firms which introduce a worker-shareholding scheme.  I am convinced that the traditional antagonistic relationship between management or owners on the one hand and the workers on the other is leading us nowhere.  We must have a situation where workers can have a financial stake in terms of a share in the profits, which they will get only if the firm makes a profit.  I intend to urge firms to use the provisions of the 1982 Finance Act to introduce profit-sharing schemes in their own industries.  I am confident that would create a better environment so that the type of restrictive practice which ultimately <Col N="806" /> leads to the destruction of jobs can be eliminated.</P>
    <P>We also have to tackle the problem of absenteeism and unofficial strikes which have been a major difficulty in industry. This idea of worker-participation in ownership and sharing profits of industry would help solve the problem of absenteeism and the work force would be dedicated to the success of their own firms.</P>
    <P>We must put maximum emphasis on quality control.  This area has not been given the attention it deserves.  We must produce consistently high quality products.  There is no point producing high quality produce for 11 months and producing an inadequate product in the twelfth month.  We must have consistently high quality.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Reynolds making a point about the National Enterprise Agency becoming involved in the takeover of Telectron.  He will recall that the agency made the decision that they would not become involved in rescue operations, and I think that decision was taken when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <P>The main message I would like to leave with the House is <Col N="807" /> something about which we can reach some degree of consensus &mdash; that there is no hope of being successful in Irish industry unless we are able to sell our products.  It is sales on foreign markets which are the means of succeeding in Irish industry.  Whether the State owns the industry, or a private firm, a foreign enterprise or an Irish enterprise does not make any difference one way or another if it is not able to sell what it is producing. Unfortunately, the problem with all the recent closures has simply been they have not been able to sell their products due to a number of reasons &mdash; underinvestment in some cases and failure to bring in new products when they should have. The key is that we must develop new products which we can sell abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister for the last half hour one can only express absolute disappointment at his approach to the motion and amendment before the House tonight.  Dreams do not govern.  At no stage did he try even to support the terms of his amendment before the House and the alleged action undertaken by this Government in certain areas.  There was not one reference to that, which indicates quite clearly that no progress has been made by anyone. I ask Members on the Government side, particularly Labour Party Members, to take note, since they are expected to support that type of Government in the matter of industrial development.</P>
      <P>The Minister welcomed the opportunity of this first, what he called economic debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Industrial debate.  I accept that from the Minister. In the amendment to the motion he philosophises on how he might see the future development in our food industry and our educational system.  His memory is very short.  It was we in Government who, throughout the years, despite opposition from the Fine Gael Party on so many occasions, endeavoured to change <Col N="808" /> the whole emphasis in education with the introduction, firstly, of the community and comprehensive schools and the regional technical colleges, to all of which the Minister refers.  I agree with the necessity for improved technology and the imparting of improved technical and technological knowledge.</P>
      <P>The Minister's contribution here tonight was far short of what we would have expected from him.  He obviously shied away from answering any question posed by Deputy Reynolds, for obvious reasons.  He told us how he had to be here at home when certain decisions were being taken and certain difficulties faced. The records will show that he probably, as Minister, has spent more weeks out of the country during his short term of office than any of his predecessors over a similar period.  In other words, he argued both ways: that he has to process and further the IDA case in the United States and elsewhere and, on the other hand, that he could not be away when it came to positively and aggressively taking on a company like AT &amp; T.  These are some of the difficulties being faced by the country because of this Government's mismanagement. It is a difficult time for whatever Government are in power.  As someone has said, it was far easier to be a good Minister in the seventies than it is in the eighties.  It is imperative that this Government, once and for all, make up their minds on the direction in which the country is going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of his contribution the Minister mentioned the National Enterprise Agency.  We did not hear one word on the Programme of Government of these two parties, which included the National Development Corporation &mdash; the song that I have heard sung since the mid-seventies. I have been involved in some of these debates going back over quite a number of years when the Minister was Junior Minister, or Parliamentary Secretary as it was called then, in this Department.  The same approach was adopted then as now.  No Coalition Government have ever been able to handle unemployment when it rears its head. It is now rearing its head in an unprecedented way.  Deputy Reynolds has trotted <Col N="809" /> out the figures.  We have a very fast growing population and the age of our work force is a problem.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House, however, of some of the commitments of this Government. The Fine Gael Programme for Government of December 1982 states:</P>
    <P>As an immediate measure a sum of £100m from the Contingency Fund in the recently published Public Capital Programme will be set aside to finance works of this kind during 1983. </P>
    <P>What has happended?  Where has this money gone?</P>
    <P>There are a number of cases involving, we believe, up to a further £100m of projects in which infrastructural work can be usefully undertaken on a joint public-private basis, drawing in additional private capital for employment creation.  Arrangements will be made to mount such joint ventures with relevant financial institutions or other private interests. </P>
    <P>What has happened to that money? Let us be honest about it.  That was the price paid in Limerick for Labour Party support.  They were pure window-dressing operations.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Cabinet Task Force will consult with the Youth Employment Agency with a view to removing any obstacles that may exist to its effective operation and will ensure that the resources allocated to the Agency are used fully and effectively with particular emphasis on actual job creation. </P>
    <P>What happened?  They have appointed advisers in all those Departments and no new jobs have emanated.  There may be no unemployment among our advisers, but there is certainly unemployment in every other category.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Reynolds has said, there is no hope.

I am long enough here to understand that one will always have that problem to contend with, particularly when no positive contribution can be made.  I have no time to waste.  If I were satisfied that his Taoiseach agreed, I would accept the Minister's philosophy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to go into some depth on some of the differences which are being seen at present.  The Minister did try to say that more efforts than ever before were being made to rescue jobs.  Remember that there was never a day before this when 890 jobs in various companies were lost in one day. I referred to the £100 million promised with rapid action.  Six months later, where is that rapid action?  You can ask the building construction industry in Cork, Clare and throughout the country. What have they got?  They have got promises from the Tánaiste, from the Government, but they did not get any money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A figure was mentioned down the country of 50 per cent unemployment in <Col N="811" /> the construction industry.  In my own city and county &mdash; and the Minister of State knows this well &mdash; even with the promised starts indicated to take effect from now until the year's end, the unemployment figure by the year's end will be 50 per cent in the building construction industry, or one in every two.  That is the actual position, even taking into account the actual scheduled starts.  It is time we asked what this Government intend to do with the £100 million about which they spoke, particularly when they cut our capital programme back by £260 million.</P>
    <P>The motion was avoided completely by the Minister and the amendment was avoided by the Minister.  We have seen a frightening succession of factory closures and there is no doubt about the necessity for this motion, rendered more urgent by, as Deputy Reynolds stated, Black Thursday of last week.  We have the closures of Telectron and Black and Decker and the threatened closure of Dunlop's. We have the cutting back of employment in Jury's Hotel, Paul and Vincents, Arnotts, Semperit &mdash; I could go on and on with the litany.  This is what made it so urgent.  The hastening of those closures, of those setbacks, can be laid fairly and squarely on the most difficult budget ever introduced from an industrial development viewpoint.  Instead of assisting, it hindered industry in every possible way.  One can say our industrial base is being seriously eroded while the rundown and threatened closures of State industries have now established here the same pattern that monetarist policies created elsewhere, and I refer particularly to the Thatcher policies in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The motion related specifically to closures, company closures and feared and threatened closures.  Despite the pleas of Deputy Reynolds, the Minister ignored them completely.  I want to refer now to a page in last Friday's <i>Cork Examiner</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is doing well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which referred to the serious job problem on the Cork scene particularly.  They were talking about Dunlop's.  Let me take Dunlop's <Col N="812" /> as an example of Government going in two clearly different directions.  Dunlop's is an old traditional Cork Industry. Time was when probably they had 1,500 people: time was when it was looked on as a gilt-edged, secure job in Cork city. For various reasons there were different rationalisation programmes &mdash; people made redundant with a consequent reduction in its present workforce to slightly under 700.  During that period of retrenchment, if you like, it also became a most efficient unit.  New equipment was installed, they had a good work force, a tightly-knit unit, undoubtedly the best and most efficient Dunlop plant in these islands.  But political pressures from across the water could mean that Dunlop's here might have to suffer.  This Government have a clear-cut obligation in this regard.  Despite the Taoiseach's remarks on Saturday &mdash; and nobody is quite sure what he said &mdash; I want to quote from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of yesterday morning, an article on the front page bearing the caption &ldquo;Dunlop: Spring backs State aid&rdquo; which said:</P>
      <P>Tánaiste Mr. Dick Spring last evening pledged Labour Party support in Government for State aid, if required, for the troubled Dunlop plant in Cork.</P>
      <P>The assurance, transmitted through Cork TD Mr. Toddy O'Sullivan, is in direct conflict with the Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, who on Friday ruled out any idea of State intervention to save the 680-job tyre manufacturing plant. </P>
      <P>That is an example of what I have been talking about: two people going in entirely different directions.  I sincerely hope it is the Tánaiste who is correct here.  I put down a question today to the Minister we have just had in the House asking if the Government would provide funds, if necessary, to keep that plant going.  This is the type of thing we are talking about on this motion.  Of course the problem arises of where the money is to be raised if the 680 jobs are lost, plus the other service jobs that would suffer as a result.  There is a good efficient unit in Cork and there is an obligation on the Government to have it saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> Let me move downwards on that same page of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of May 6 1983 to the heading &ldquo;Target Survival&rdquo; dealing with the very hard-hit Cork scene at present.  There is a further heading to the left of the former one &ldquo;Can dockyard be ship-shape again?&rdquo; We all know the history of Cork Dockyard.  We all know that Fianna Fáil over the years were committed to it.  We all know also that on those benches opposite it was regarded as one of the trivial industries of Cork harbour.  Small wonder that the present Government's commitment is not as great as that of the Fianna Fáil Government. From whoever speaks after the Minister on this motion the first thing I want is an undertaking with regard to repair work that there will not be a repeat of the recent B &amp; I performance when a job could have been placed in that yard and when the reason advanced that it could not be placed was that they could not meet the deadline.  Of course, that was an excuse.  That was not the correct position, because the yard could have beaten the deadline by which the repair job was actually completed by the British yard, that did the job eventually.  My first request to the Government is to ensure that there will not be a repeat of what happened in the case of the B &amp; I with regard to the repair job.</P>
    <P>There were some exchanges across the House a few weeks ago about the placing of the ESB's order, about which Deputy Reynolds and I know so much&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in Japan, for the second time.  In the mid-1970s we had a similar experience with bulk carriers. Now an order for a coal carrier was placed in Japan and we were told it could not be done here.  Of course there were problems about having it done here.  I refer to the Belfast yard because obviously Verolme would not have had the capacity to do the job.  But the spin-off by way of work to the Haulbowline yard, to the Rushbrooke yard, would have been tremendous.  Again it was lack of commitment on the part of Ministers <Col N="814" /> of this Government, lack of commitment by State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy could say the same about Moneypoint&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact it would have been drawing coal to Moneypoint whereas now we will have a Japanese ship drawing that coal into Deputy Carey's constituency with Deputy Carey delighted that this ship is being built in Japan.  Shame on Deputy Carey if that is his attitude to what I am saying here. Deputy Reynolds referred already to the necessity for buying Irish as far as possible. Surely at times of deep recession like this, with a growing young population, with huge numbers of young unemployed and of school-leavers coming onto the books in a couple of weeks time, we must be a little less careful, a little more ruthless in respect of our own, and be committed to ensure that our people are employed as far as possible.</P>
      <P>Where Verolme is concerned probably we have the most highly professional, skilled work force in this country.  Their expertise is well known.  We have had already a number of redundancies.  May I quote a few other instances because, God knows, these poor old Government Deputies in Cork are obviously having a tough time getting messages across to their Ministers.  That article entitled &ldquo;Can dockyard be ship-shape again?&rdquo; starts by saying:</P>
      <P>The Government has yet to be convinced that Verolme Cork Dockyard will be viable, even if the work force is reduced in line with the current rationalisation proposals.  This was the opinion of some sources in Leinster House last night&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That would have been last Thursday night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>after the future of the Cork shipbuilding plant was discussed at yesterday's Cabinet meeting.  The Government will focus its attention on the problems of the yard again next Tuesday.  Fine Gael and Labour TDs from Cork are urging the Cabinet to advise the company <Col N="815" /> to substantially increase the financial terms on offer for the 400 workers willing to accept voluntary redundancy. </P>
    <P>There are 1,100 there at present, 400 are threatened and, unless the Government give them orders fast, the other 700 will be threatened just as quickly.  Deputy Reynolds has asked that the orders for the fisheries research and patrol vessels be placed with them.  If they are not I fear for the future of that yard.  This Government have one urgent obligation: to outline their policy with regard to the future of the yard, to rid the yard of the danger of aimlessness because of lack of Government commitment or of conviction about the future of that yard.  There was the tragedy of placing that order in Japan, that big order that could have been placed in Belfast.  I have not even time to go into all the goodwill that could have been created by this order being placed there, all the cross-Border relations that could have been built up because of it, not to mention the spin-off effect which would have been a great bonus for the workers of the Verolme Cork Dockyard.  But there was not one reply from the Minister who answered across the House.  Surely there was an obligation to give the House some indication as to what has been discussed in Cabinet because, according to our best information, we are told that on two occasions on last Tuesday and Thursday the Cabinet have been discussing the future of Verolme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Minister for allowing this matter to be raised. I have agreed to allow Deputy Tunney five minutes of the 20 minutes available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The urgency of this debate comes about because of a decision communicated to the school last month by the <Col N="816" /> Department of Education that a longpromised extension to cater for up to 600 was not going ahead and that the school was now to be confined to a numerical strength of 350, that despite the fact that the school currently holds and caters for 435.  The decision was one which greatly disappointed the board members of which I happen to be chairperson who have been waiting anxiously for this extension to go ahead as promised five years ago and as intended when the school was established in 1967.</P>
    <P>In 1967 the school was opened in a temporary prefabricated building catering for 240 pupils with the intention that this would be followed by a double phase development which would gradually upgrade to 600, with a potential for future development to 800.  Throughout the years of the seventies additional classrooms were provided in the form of prefabricated island units of varying qualities intended to tide the school over until the new building would be built and the promised replacement extension building would materialise.  The kind of accommodation that has now accumulated is essentially temporary and of very poor quality.  Fifteen classrooms of that nature were added on between 1967 and 1981.</P>
    <P>The planning for the school proper began in the middle seventies and in 1977 the commitment was made: the advisory council for the Dublin area agreed that permanent accommodation for 600 pupils should be provided with a provision for an extension for 800 in the future if needed.  This was agreed back in 1977 but for some reason the implementation of this decision was delayed beyond the normal two to three-year time span and we reached 1973 without any sign of a building, this despite the fact that in 1978 a letter from the Department of Education made a formal commitment.  I am sure Deputy Tunney will be referring to the fact that he, in his time in the Ministry, renewed that commitment in 1981.</P>
    <P>The situation is such that the school operates on a temporary planning permission and that planning permission runs out in 1985.  The school has to go back to the corporation every so many <Col N="817" /> years for an extension of that planning permission.</P>
    <P>This is all leading to the very surprising letter the school got in April of this year indicating that the Department were now prepared to approve the upgrading of the existing permanent accommodation, permanent accommodation which does not exist in any of the buildings of Scoil Íde, and that they would be upgraded to a satisfactory level.  The only way this can be done, the school argues, is by replacement of the building particularly with regard to specialist facilities.  The number of pupils being talked about is 350 when at present the school caters for 435 in a slightly expanded building which was originally intended for 240.</P>
    <P>There are two elements in this which are very disappointing and a major blow to the hopes of the school for development. One is the size allocation.  I accept that the Department has a certain problem there.  We accept the statistics for the area which indicate that there is a significant fall in primary school numbers which will eventually flow through to the second level area.  Quite apart from any further expansion the current development would indicate that the numbers there at present are going to be maintained because the school provides certain unique services in the area in terms of the kind of courses it offers which are not repeated by any of the other schools in the area and which are attracting students from a very wide catchment area.</P>
    <P>The other great disappointment was the description suddenly of buildings which had been built as temporary units as permanent.  We are very concerned to straighten both of these problems out with the Department as a matter of urgency.  The school is catering for 435 girls.  It operates as a twin school with Coláiste Eoin, which is a boys' vocational school with 700 pupils in a very fine permanent premises within about 100 yards. At senior level boys and girls combine their classes, so the girls are occasionally able to see the luxury in which the boys are educated.  Within that environment the teachers and pupils of Scoil Íde have developed a full range of successful courses from junior level right through to <Col N="818" /> secretarial courses and work experience courses.  They have initiated a number of new ventures in links with AnCO.  The first pharmacy aid course has been developed and run successfully in the school with AnCO's support.  An exceptional relationship with the businesses in the area has been developed.  Students benefit from that unique relationship and are often at a very high level of placement. Finglas is a highly industrialised area, so the kind of business courses that are being run by a school like this are something that deserve maximum support and encouragement rather than the treatment they are currently receiving.</P>
    <P>The school has achieved outstanding success in inter-school debating competitions. There is a tremendous outward bound programme common to the VEC schools in Dublin.  The career-orientated courses are fairly exceptional.  Because they were waiting for the permanent building the staff have operated very peaceably and calmly in inadequate accommodation.  I do not think this will continue unless the Department can assure the school that the accommodation will now be upgraded immediately even if it must be at a reduced size and that there will not be the kind of delay that we have had, from 1977 to 1983, with nothing but a lot of money being spent on plans.  The Department of Education may be well known for its delays but a delay of that length is unpardonable and it is something that we will not tolerate again.</P>
    <P>The particular problem with the school is the complete lack of facilities.  The school is totally inadequate because it was never planned on a permanent basis. The lay-out is temporary.  The school needs a complete upgrading.  There are no facilities for interviews.  The toilet facilities are wholly inadequate.  There is inadequate storage space.  There are no proper boundaries and the grounds provide a right-of-way for wandering horses. They have never been adequately secured because the idea was that building would go ahead.  The heating is utterly inadequate and the unfortunate students spend the winter with their coats on in the classrooms.  Lighting facilities are <Col N="819" /> either non-existent or inadequate.  There is need for some form of exercise facilities for the 430 girls ranging in age from 14 to 19 in the senior school.  It is totally unsatisfactory that both they and the staff should be without any sort of facilities. The hotchpotch arrangement of prefabs means that students and staff are running in and out from one prefab to another in all sorts of inclement weather.  The temporary nature of the buildings is one of our biggest headaches.  None of the arrangements there could be described as permanent.</P>
    <P>Our main request to the Department is that it should accept and acknowledge the magnificent work done in this school. The service offered is unique.  The courses do not compete with the secondary schools and so there is no way the Department should feel they are wasting or misdirecting resources.  The schools are unique in that they are complementary, so complementary that after the senior cycle secretarial level they draw recruits from the secondary schools with which they might seem to be in competition at an earlier stage.  They have an exceptional staff who have developed very forward thinking and imaginative courses suited to the needs of the students.</P>
    <P>Talking about the area briefly, it has got some publicity in the past for many of the wrong reasons.  I do not want to dwell on that because this school is an outstanding example of the creative work that is going ahead there.  The adverse publicity is particularly sad in the context of the pressures on an area like Finglas, because this kind of work is being hindered rather than supported by the Department, by Government Departments generally, which should be helping rather than hindering the good work being done.  It should be a priority development area.</P>
    <P>The students are given an opportunity of travelling abroad.  In many of the domestic situations in which they live this kind of experience would not be easily available to them.  Yet a large number of the students take part in a variety of mixed cost outings with the support of <Col N="820" /> parents and voluntary fund raising in the area.  This provides them with an opportunity of travelling abroad.  These fund raising activities are supported by the business community in the area.  This kind of exceptional activity is a feature of the school and it is one of the reasons we wish to see the Department now honour to the full the commitment given in this letter of April last where the Department commit themselves to upgrading the school to an adequate level, supplying all specialist facilities.  We want a commitment from the Minister now that this will happen in the very near future.  Would the Minister be so good within the next month to meet a deputation from the area to consider developments?  The main demand is that there should be no delay in an adequate level of staffing, in the provision of basic facilities and ancillary facilities, basic minimum facilities for adequate schooling at second level in the Ireland of the eighties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank Deputy Flaherty for allowing me the next five minutes in an endeavour to confirm and endorse the case she has made in respect of this great school.  My concern arises from the fact that in this school there are roughly 430 girls, all intelligent, all charged with the same ambition and resolve in the matter of education, all with the same entitlements in regard to what the State is obliged to do for them from the point of view of education.  That is not being done.  That, I suggest, is a very serious charge to make against the Department.  Not alone is it a serious charge but it is a very important omission on the part of the Department and it is not that the Department do not know what the situation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty referred to the history of the school and to the fact that I had some involvement.  At the time when I was a junior Minister I went out to the school to present certificates and I had confirmation at the time given to me that it was in order for me to announce publicly that the new school was being proceeded with, and the records of the Department will show that.  I did not do that lightly because I knew that, apart <Col N="821" /> from other considerations, I would have to meet the students, the staff and the parents so long as I lived in the area or close to it.  To think now that the Department are waiting for reminders and that the people, the public representatives and the staff and I have to assert the rights of the students is something which does not do justice to any of us or to the Department.</P>
    <P>Those girls must, and here we look upon education unfortunately as it is today, compete with their peers.  We only have to look around the city and the country to see the facilities enjoyed by other girls as of entitlement.  One has to have some regard for the indelicacy of the situation when making the case. There are over 400 girls in the school and they have not even the normal basic minimum requirements to which they are entitled.  We talk about trying to inculcate in them certain standards and certain values. It amazes me that despite the adversity, the students with the co-operation of their parents and the magnificent guidance given by the principal and his staff have been able to achieve what has been achieved.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Education today speaking on some programme about her great interest in her own sex. It was agreed the day had come when girls were allowed to do what &mdash; and this was regarded as a great landmark in the advances in education &mdash; hitherto they had been prevented from doing.  She said how concerned she was about education. I suggest she should take a trip out to Scoil Íde and then move into the adjoining boys' school and see if she is happy with the respective standards that exist. I am quite sure she would not be happy. I am quite sure too she will not accept the invitation I extend because her visit will not be one about which she can boast.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State and the Minister are not on the scene all that long and what I say to them is not directed personally at them.  They are the inheritors of a system that has been operating and I am very mindful of the lack of power I possibly had in that Department since I was not able during my term there to guarantee that the work would be proceeded <Col N="822" /> with, but I did at least, or so I thought, bring it to the stage where the Department could not move back but would have to go forward.</P>
    <P>With the assistance of the statisticians in the Department the Minister will be in a position to tell me that in a certain number of years what I am asking for will not be justified in terms of the number of students who will be attending the school; but I am putting the case on behalf of the students who are there this year, as well as on behalf of the 400 or so who will come next year and the year after.  I am not concerned with projections now of what might be the position in the year 2000.  Such projections do not justify an injustice to the students and the staff in question.  I marvel at the staff remaining there, but if they are asked to continue to carry this burden they may be enticed away from Finglas and that would only compound the difficulties that are there now.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that I do not have the opportunity in the course of this brief contribution to convince the Minister that history is no longer relevant in this situation.

      <P>I have followed the contributions of Deputy Flaherty and Deputy Tunney with interest.  I am aware of the inadequacy of the accommodation at Scoil Íde but I cannot give any explanation to Deputy Tunney as to why a commitment <Col N="823" /> he gave to teachers and pupils was not honoured, not being aware of that commitment and not having any information with me that would enable me to give him an explanation.

      <P>I am not questioning the validity of the statement.  All I am saying is that I do not have in my possession any information that would enable me to give the Deputy an explanation as to why the commitment he gave was not honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not disagree about that.  The Deputy referred to the availability of statistics in the Department but I am sure Deputies generally will accept that one of the prime considerations in the provision of any kind of educational accommodation, whether it be an extension or whether new buildings be involved, is to determine in advance of any State resources being invested the future needs of the area concerned.  Consequently, it is of prime importance that statistical information be available to the Minister of the day.  In this way accommodation is provided on the basis of projections <Col N="824" /> that can be made.  It is very important to have such information in terms of the initial cost and also of the running cost of the school in question.</P>
      <P>I understand the frustration of the Deputies concerned with the long delay but, having been on the scene only for the past four or five months, it is necessary for me to indicate the attitude of my Department and the contribution they have made as well as the investigations that have been carried out and the difficulties that have arisen.</P>
      <P>It was considered some years ago, on the basis of the then pattern of enrolment in the area, that accommodation would be required in the school for 600 pupils with provision for expansion, should that be found necessary.  Architectural planning for the project was begun and had reached the stage where working drawings had been prepared.</P>
      <P>However, at that stage it became clear that enrolment in post-primary schools in the Finglas area in general had peaked and all the up-to-date statistical information led to the conclusion that enrolments would continue to fall.  Let me give the House some figures of enrolment at that school.  In 1977-78 the number of new entrants was 170.  Six years later, in 1982-83, the number of new entrants had fallen to 90.  By 1990-91 it is projected on the basis of enrolments in primary schools that the annual intake will have fallen to a figure of the order of 60.  The Finglas area is not unique in this phenomenon. It epitomises a problem which has occurred and is occurring elsewhere in the Greater Dublin area.  It raises the question of what should be done in the context of scarce resources.  I am sure that Deputy Flaherty and Deputy Tunney do not suggest that, irrespective of enrolment trends, once a decision has been made to provide a certain level of accommodation this decision should be adhered to for all time.  Such a course, leading to a waste of public money, could not be condoned at any time but particularly now in the present financial difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I proceed to the positive side of my reply, I want to give a further statistic for the overall Finglas area.  On the basis <Col N="825" /> of my Department's projections, which essentially are based on the enrolment in national schools in the area, it is estimated that enrolments at post-primary schools in the greater Finglas area will, by 1989-90, have fallen by some 1,000 pupils.  Surely at a difficult time like the present, the Deputies will agree that it would be a criminal waste of resources to expand the school accommodation in the area.</P>
    <P>I said I wanted to come to the positive side of my reply.  Of course, I am aware of the unsatisfactory accommodation at Scoil Íde and I intend to ensure that, as far as it lies within my power, full and satisfactory facilities will be provided for the numbers needed &mdash; and I emphasise the words &ldquo;the numbers needed&rdquo;&mdash; at the earliest possible date.  Scoil Íde does not require accommodation for 600 plus pupils.  It requires and will get full accommodation &mdash; general classrooms, laboratories and workshops and other ancillary facilities &mdash; for a number of the order of 350 to 400.  It will get all the specialist rooms it needs for these numbers.</P>
    <P>As I had arranged some time ago, a senior architect and a senior inspector visited the school within the last few days to assess the full accommodation requirements. I emphasise that that visit was as a result of representations made to me by Deputy Flaherty.  I had arranged also for a meeting between senior officers of my Department and the chief executive officer of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee with a view to finalising the schedule of accommodation. This meeting will take place tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I would be failing in my duty as Minister if I were to allow the project proceed on the basis of accommodation for 600 pupils with provision for expansion when all the facts point to the need for a school for 350 to 400 pupils.  I could not stand <Col N="826" /> over such a measure with its cost implications to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the needs of the Finglas area.  I can assure the House that the revised project, providing for full satisfactory accommodation including all necessary specialist rooms, will be processed without delay by my Department and that as soon as the project is ready for tender it will be proceeded with, without delay and in so far as possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a few brief comments on points raised by Deputy Flaherty.  I can understand her difficulty and anxiety in relation to the expiration of the planning permission by 1985 but I hope that before that date the extension to the school will be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised also the question of my receiving a deputation.  I have no problem in regard to receiving deputations. It is not my practice to refuse Deputies in relation to receiving deputations but in that regard the Minister must have some information available to him.  Once reports of the meetings that are taking place tomorrow are available I will be in a position to give more information to Deputies but no purpose would be served by my saying anything further until such information is available.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise again that it would be ludicrous, especially in these difficult times, to provide buildings that would become white elephants in the future.  At a time when resources are so scarce, it is necessary to take into account future needs.  I hope that the building of the extension in question will proceed in a normal way if that is what the reports, when available, will indicate is necessary. I assure both Deputies that there will not be any undue delay so far as I am concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at present examining the question of protection accorded to part-time workers under existing labour legislation. Part-time workers are already covered by the provisions of the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 to 1944, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act, 1977 and the Payment of Wages Act, 1979.  The legislation pertaining to health, safety and welfare at work also applies to part-time workers.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the eligibility threshold in certain areas of legislation, such as that dealing with unfair dismissal, minimum notice, holidays, redundancy and maternity protection, excludes employees who work for shorter periods than the prescribed minima.  The question of extending eligibility of part-time workers under such legislation will be considered as part of the current review.  My Department are also taking part in discussions on EEC Commission proposals to extend protective legislation to part-time workers.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have made a comprehensive submission to me in this matter and the subject was discussed at a recent meeting which I had with members of the Executive Council of Congress.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in addition to a retirement pension the taxpayer is also in receipt of a social welfare old age pension. Both pensions are chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with practice the taxpayer's tax-free allowances are set-off, in the first instance, against the amount of the social welfare pension to enable it be paid without deduction of income tax, leaving the balance of the allowances available against the retirement pension.</P>
      <P>However, on the basis of details of income for the year 1982-83 furnished by the taxpayer on 6 July 1982 it was discovered by the inspector of taxes that allowances to which the taxpayer was not entitled had been granted in the tax-free allowances originally issued for that year. A revised certificate was, therefore, issued on a non-cumulative basis which has resulted in tax liability under PAYE.</P>

      <P>Consultant obstetrician-gynaecologists from St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny, hold a weekly out-patient clinic in the Maternity Hospital, Carlow.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board have plans for the development of St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, to provide consultant obstetric, paediatric, gynaecological, medical and surgical services together with consultant radiological and pathological services for a catchment area which includes County Carlow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal have laid down certain requirements for the development of maternity units.  Included among these requirements are, firstly, that such units should not be developed in isolation but should form part of a general hospital campus so that the fullest use could be made of the medical expertise and the diagnostic services available in such a hospital.  Secondly, at consultant level, obstetric services should be concentrated into viable units catering for, at a minimum 1,500 to 2,000 deliveries per year.  These requirements have been <Col N="678" /> laid down to ensure that mothers and babies obtain the best possible care available. The Maternity Hospital in Carlow does not fulfil either of these requirements.</P>
    <P>The number of deliveries at Carlow Maternity Hospital has been declining steadily from 547 in 1976 to 206 in 1982. Even if all County Carlow mothers opted to have their confinements at Carlow Maternity Hospital, the number of deliveries would be considerably below the minimum guidelines set down by Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>
    <P>Substantial expenditure would be involved in bringing the Maternity Hospital in Carlow to the level required for a consultant staffed maternity unit.  Even if the unit in Carlow were equipped and staffed to the required level, it is quite likely that some mothers from County Carlow would continue to prefer to have their babies delivered in either St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, or the Dublin maternity hospitals.  With the number of births falling well below the level recommended by Comhairle na nOspidéal for a viable maternity unit, this would make the Carlow unit uneconomic, and possibly unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the services of consultant staff.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the development of a consultant staffed maternity unit at Carlow would not be justified.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed retirement pension at age 65 on 13 March 1979.  He did not satisfy the contribution conditions for that pension. When he was being informed of this he was also advised to submit a claim for old age contributory pension when he was approaching his 66th birthday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On reaching age 66, however, he submitted a claim for non-contributory old <Col N="681" /> age pension.  This was awarded to himself and his wife and they have each been receiving £26.45 a week at current rates.</P>
    <P>It has now been decided to treat the non-contributory pension claim as if it had originally been a claim for old age contributory pension and to award him this latter pension with effect from 14 March 1980.  This award is at the rate appropriate to a person with a yearly average of 24 contributions from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1979, the end of the last contribution year before he reached age 66.  The rate of pension payable to him in respect of this average contribution record is £67.85 a week at present, made up of a personal rate of £37.80 plus an increase of £30.05 in respect of his wife.  He would need to have a yearly average of at least 48 contributions in order to qualify for the maximum personal rate of £40.25.</P>
    <P>He has been informed of the new award and requested to return his own and his wife's non-contributory pension books.  An old age contributory pension book will then be issued to him.  The arrears of old age contributory pension from 14 March 1980, less the amounts of the non-contributory pensions paid to himself and his wife, will be issued by means of a payable order.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, in view of the details supplied by the Deputy, an investigation has also been initiated in relation to the overall means of the couple at present with a view to determining whether the wife might be entitled as an alternative at this stage to a non-contributory pension in her own right at a rate in excess of £30.05, adult dependant's increase on her husband's contributory pension.  She will be informed of the outcome in due course.</P>

    <P>The claimant has been paid pay-related benefit at a rate of £6.20 a week from 24 January 1983, thirteenth day of unemployment, reduced to £3.87 a week from 4 April 1983, in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1983. That Act provides that where the amount paid by way of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit would exceed 80 per cent of the claimant's average reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year then the rate of pay-related benefit payable is limited to the amount which, when added to the flat-rate benefit, restricts the total weekly rate of benefit payable to 80 per cent of those earnings.</P>
