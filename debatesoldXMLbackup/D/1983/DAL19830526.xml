      <P>It was suggested on Tuesday that if we were running into difficulty with any part of the Finance Bill we would look for additional time or to alter the time on the various parts shown in the order.  I give notice that we wish to go from Part I to Part 30 inclusive today and that, subject to discussions with the Government Whip, we either cut back on the other part or look for an extension from 12 midnight on.</P>

Is it agreed that sections 1 to 46, inclusive, be dealt with not later than 2.30 p.m. today&mdash;in other words, is it agreed unanimously that we substitute <Col N="2396" /> 2.30 p.m. for 11.30 a.m. where it appears in the order?</P>

      <P>When we reported progress last night, I had made a brief number of responses to points raised by Deputy O'Kennedy.  I want now to refer very briefly to a suggestion which he made last night in connection with this section, to the effect that since Deputy O'Kennedy expects that total tax revenue this year will be higher than forecast and that the current budget deficit this year will be lower than my forecast &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the first part of that statement, but did not make the second part.  Also, I did not say the total tax revenue.  The Minister should not <Col N="2397" /> misquote me.  I said from income tax and VAT.  I do not want to be misquoted.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair suggests that we do not have any interruptions today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for that greater precision in his thoughts. On the basis of what he is saying now, no particular conclusion can be drawn as to the amount of leeway which might or might not exist over and above the room which is there in terms of the budgetary targets which we have fixed.  He is now saying that it is only a partial forecast and says nothing about the current deficit. That means that he is making a much more restrictive point than I had understood him to make yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section with which we are dealing gives statutory effect to the announcement made in the Budget Statement that the overriding limits for interest relief allowable under section 496 of the Income Tax Act of 1967 will be reduced for 1983, 1984 and subsequent years of assessment from £4,800 to £4,000 for a married couple, from £3,500 to £2,900 for a widowed person and from £2,400 to £2,000 for a single person.  These reduced limits cover a loan of approximately £30,000 in the case of a married couple at current interest rates, about £22,000 for a widowed person and about £15,000 for a single person.  These are approximate figures and would vary with interest rates fluctuations.  The yield from this measure is estimated at £2 million in 1983 and £3,500,000 in a full year.  The number of people who will be affected by the section&mdash;they are the people whose interest payments are in excess of the reduced limits and who subsequently pay more tax&mdash;is estimated at about 32,000.  On the other hand it is estimated that there are some 243,000 other persons who claim income tax relief on their interest payments and who will not be affected by the section because the total amount they claim is within the limit that would <Col N="2398" /> emerge from the operation of this section.</P>
    <P>I would just make the point that the total cost of interest relief in 1983-1984 is estimated at £81 million.  That will be after the effect of this section is taken into account.  That means that were there no interest reliefs on the kinds of loans we are talking of, tax revenue to the State would be £81 million greater than it will be this year.  In other words, because of the operation of this system, the State is foregoing the collection of £81 million and that, in any terms, is a substantial sum and, consequently, a substantial relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not follow that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the operation of this section the cost of interest relief this year will be £81 million.  In other words, were there no interest reliefs of the kinds now allowed, the State would be collecting £81 million more in taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are suggesting would mean only £2 million in 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the total amount.  To put the Deputy's figure into context, it would represent 2½ per cent of the total amount of interest relief.  The measures being taken here were begun last year.  It might be useful to consider some of the background to the steps that have been taken so far in this direction. Interest reliefs have been criticised in a number of quarters on grounds of equity. It is suggested, for example, that they bring about a certain inequity in the tax system because the better-off taxpayers are able to take substantial advantage of available relief by being in a position to set their allowable interest against high marginal rates of tax.  Clearly, an interest allowance of £4,000 is of far greater value to somebody paying tax at the 55 per cent rate rather than to somebody paying at the 35 per cent rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested also that tax liabilities of non-borrowers are often higher than those of borrowers so that we can have situations in which two individuals of similar marital status and similar <Col N="2399" /> incomes would pay very different amounts of taxation because of the way they choose to dispose of their income and because partly of the liabilities they choose to take on.</P>
    <P>Following from these considerations, major changes in interest reliefs were announced in the Budget Statement of January last year and were confirmed in the Budget Statement of March 1983. The proposals that were in mind then would have had the effect, first, of terminating income tax reliefs for personal borrowings and ensuring that relief would have been available only where the funds borrowed were for the purchase, repair or improvement of the borrower's principal private residence, that is, on mortgages and, secondly, the measures proposed at that time would have provided that mortgage interest relief would be allowed only at the 25 and 35 per cent rates and that a capital limit of £35,000 would apply to them.  The point I am making is that in both the Budget Statements to which I have referred there was expressed a clear intention to reduce the scope of interest relief measures that are the subject of this section.</P>
    <P>Those proposed changes were not proceeded with because they would have given rise to very substantial difficulties in the administration of the PAYE system. Indeed, it is an aspect of the proposals that I looked at again in the preparation of the budget this year.  Without other substantial changes in the tax system I would conclude that it would be extremely difficult, for example, to limit the rate of relief to the 25 and the 35 per cent tax rates and that an attempt to do so would cause so much complication in the tax affairs of many individuals and families that while we might bring about some more apparent equity in the operation of the reliefs we would probably give rise also to a great deal of dissatisfaction and frustration on the part of people trying to claim those reliefs.</P>
    <P>The conclusion I would draw from all that is that while the House made it clear on two occasions last year that it was of a mind to proceed in this general direction the method chosen then was neither <Col N="2400" /> appropriate nor practical.  I am now proposing what I consider to be a more appropriate and more practical method of achieving the same objective.  For that reason I urge the House to accept this section.</P>
    <P>I would recall also to the House the views of the Commission on Taxation in this connection.  In their first report, the Commission said they were conscious of the important role played by the deduction for mortgage interest in helping people to acquire their own homes but they went on to say that the system was defective as constituted because it provided the greatest help to those in the higher income groups.  The commission added, though, that the total abolition of the relief would disrupt the housing market and would be particularly severe on first-time house purchasers and that consequently there was a need for an alternative.</P>
    <P>That confirms the line initiated in January of last year, carried through in the following March and now included in the Bill before us.  The measures put forward in the budget were a little more comprehensive than those referred to by the Commission on Taxation.  These measures proposed that no relief be allowed for 1983-1984 or for subsequent years of assessment &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister is as concerned as I am regarding the opportunity to debate the Bill within the constraints laid down but I would suggest that if he is quoting from his Budget Statement he would give the reference. I say this in fairness both to him and to us.  If the Minister proceeds to repeat everything that is in the budget we will not have the opportunity of discussing the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the Deputy's concern and I am anxious to facilitate him but at the same time I wish to be sure that we have all the issues on the table, so to speak.  However, I will be as brief as possible.  What we proposed was that relief would not be allowed for 1983-1984 or for subsequent years of assessment in respect of interest on loans <Col N="2401" /> taken out after budget day other than mortgages in respect of a borrower's private residence.  In the case of non-mortgage loans taken out before budget day, or existing mortgages on second homes, no relief will be allowed after 5 April 1985.  In respect of new and old loans, the overriding interest limit for allowable relief will be reduced with effect from the commencement of the 1983-84 tax year to the figures I have mentioned: £4,000 for a married couple, £2,900 for a widowed person, and £2,000 for a single person. That is the overall measure proposed and the background to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief point which applies to many of the amendments.  The Minister suggests that the Opposition, or for that matter The Workers' Party&mdash;but he is applying it in particular to us&mdash;are making proposals to increase charges in revenue.  The implication may be that he is the only one who is being responsible.  I want to remind him of the order of the House and the constraints on the Opposition, The Workers' Party, or the Labour Party, if they were so minded, which I do not believe they are.</P>
      <P>We are precluded from putting down amendments which involve an extra charge on revenue or a tax on the people. The Ceann Comhairle confirmed that to me in respect of a number of amendments I put down.  Some of our proposals were out of order because only the Government can introduce proposals involving extra revenue.  I repudiate the implication that the Minister is the only one concerned about revenue.  The Ceann Comhairle quite properly adheres to the rules of the House and I have had to accept his ruling, as others have, that amendments I put down in this connection were out of order.  The Minister alone has the authority to raise revenue and impose new tax charges.  That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given us the figures. The cost now is £81 million.  Additional costs would be £2 million.  That puts in focus what we are trying to achieve.  We are concerned about first-time house purchasers. <Col N="2402" /> The Commission on Taxation said we should have a composite tax system. They do not want to see the system replaced unless and until there is an alternative. They recognise the problems of first-time house purchasers.  The Minister said we are talking about mortgages of up to £30,000 or something over that.  I think it would be less.  In my view the figure would be £28,000 or thereabouts. A young married couple could provide very little for themselves at that price at this stage.</P>
    <P>Surely we should encourage rather than discourage them by an action of this sort to provide a house for themselves. The Minister may find that there may be greater cost to the State by way of the entitlement many of them have to local authority housing which, of course, is subsidised at a much higher rate and a greater cost to the Exchequer and the taxpayer generally.  Therefore, this move by the State is damaging to their interests and that is a matter of great social and economic concern.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the housing industry.  This is another element in undermining the housing industry.  Anything which discourages potential house purchasers or owners from acquiring property affects the building industry.  This clearly does. I am not saying it is a major factor, but it is another factor in line with all the others in this Bill.  This extra action is a further damaging blow to the building industry.  Have we lost all concern for employment?  Are we really going to take measures on every front which in this case will raise a net extra £1½ million this year?  Are we determined to take those measures in the face of the reality of growing unemployment to the point where we have reached a chronic state in the building industry?</P>
    <P>The Minister said last night we were presenting this as if the building industry were the motor of the economy.  We are making no such case.  We are saying it reflects the condition of unemployment in the economy.  We all know the economy is fairly sick at the moment. The building industry is nearing its last gasp.  If the Minister is disposed to accept any amendment we put down, this one <Col N="2403" /> which affects young married couples, employment and industry should be accepted by him, particularly as we are asking only for the maintenance of the <i>status quo.</i>  Incidentally, it also applies to widows, and that is important.  As Minister for Finance I introduced special exemptions for widows in this category. They too are being hit in this area.  If that is to be the price of the Minister's action, let it be seen to be the price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy presents me as being the most obdurate of men.  What I am saying about this measure partly is that it is in line with and consistent with a measure which the Deputy's party initiated while in Government. They initiated it in a form which proved to be not capable of application. That is one point.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I said the interest relief this year in total will be worth about £81 million.  I have here the figures from the Public Capital Programme on other assistance through the State mechanisms for the building industry.  For example, there is an allocation of £130 million this year for house purchase and improvement loans and supplementary grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>For local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, for house purchase and improvement loans.  We have the Housing Finance Agency, other house purchase loans made by local authorities and there is a figure of £0.8 million for supplementary local authority housing grants.  We will leave that aside for the moment.  There is roughly £130 million altogether there.  I have not got the figure to hand at the moment, but we have also the total amount of expenditure on the mortgage interest subsidy payments. When we take all of that together there is a very substantial amount of State assistance available for the housing industry for the provision of new housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer back to a problem rather similar to one raised yesterday by Deputy Haughey in relation to our income tax system and the administration thereof. Over the years we have brought in a <Col N="2404" /> series of different measures to assist people who are buying their houses.  We have the SDA loan scheme.  We have the Housing Finance Agency scheme.  We have the mortgage interest subsidy scheme and we have these interest reliefs. Although we are not in a position to do anything concrete about it at the moment, I suggest there is a need to look at how all of these schemes operate together.  The point I am making is that to concentrate in the discussion of this section on interest reliefs only runs the risk of distorting the discussion and putting it into an excessively narrow context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De. Rossa Mr. De. Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De. Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of providing housing subsidy through this kind of mechanism is not the best way to assist people to provide accommodation for themselves or to improve their accommodation. It is fairly well understood that as it operates at present it benefits those on higher incomes more than it benefits those on lower incomes.  It brings in the whole question as to why we allow housing to be subject to the open market. Why is it that some people need assistance to pay interest rates on loans which they need to provide their own homes? There is also the question of land speculation and the fact that house prices are set by the market rather than by the actual value of the houses.  If a system of subsidies has to be provided I would prefer a system of direct subsidies to people who need them rather than subsidies which operate through the tax system. However, the Minister is not offering any alternative to the present system and for that reason I would not agree to the reduction proposed.  Presumably widowed persons have the same mortgage commitments as if they had a spouse and why is it that they do not get the same level of relief as a couple living together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting the question: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa asked a question to which I would like to reply. As I said yesterday in the context of a <Col N="2405" /> different discussion, I can appreciate that a widowed person does not find that mortgage payments are reduced when a spouse dies.  If we were to give the same relief to widowed persons in this connection we would create further anomalies that would discriminate against other people and we have not yet found a way of dealing with that problem.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Deputy De Rossa's point, there is some inequity in the levels that are struck.  There is the problem that single people may have dependants also and they will be on the £2,000 level while the widow with dependants will be on the £2,900 level.  I would suggest one possibility which would evade the difficulties brought about by the Murphy case.  Such allowances could in future be based on the head of household and dependants because it is after all an attempt to reduce the cost of a head of household of providing a place for his family.  I do not think it would be a breach of the principle established in the <Col N="2407" /> Supreme Court to base such a relief on the head of household and the number of adult and child dependants in that household.</P>
      <P>In our tax system there is a continuing special position for owner occupation as opposed to renting.  Rents are not tax allowable whereas mortgage outgoings are.  In the previous budget there was an attempt to bring in an allowance against rent for older people and that principle should not be lost sight of.  It probably is especially equitable to talk about bringing in allowances for rents when at the top end of the scale we are talking about residential property taxes for owner occupiers.  We will have a consistent package if in a number of years' time we have a residential property tax and a tax credit covering both rents and mortgages. That is the most equitable way of dealing with housing subsidies and I would recommend it to the Minister in future budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The first suggestion, that we should base allowances on the head of household and the number of adult and child dependants, is an interesting concept but we would need to consider it in some further detail. What would be the result in a case where the head of household did not have an adult dependant in that the spouse was not fully dependent on the head of household?  I leave it to Deputy Bruton to sort out his own salvation in trying to decide who the head of household would be in those circumstances. There could be some difficulty in such a case and its comparison with the case of a single person.  Would we, for example, give two allowances to a household where there were two income earners?  I take the principle that the operation of the system at present <Col N="2408" /> does not take account of certain changes in circumstances with which people can be faced during the life of their mortgage.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 18, before section 11, but in Chapter 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>11.&mdash;Section 5 of the Finance Act, 1982, is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (2) (a) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>(i)  at any time during the year of assessment he was the age of 65 years or upwards or if under the age of 65 years he was at any time during the year of assessment in receipt of a taxable income (after deductions of normal allowances) of less than £2,500 per annum, and,'.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide income tax concessions for tenants of private dwellings, who are on a low income, in respect of the rent they pay.  There is already provision in last year's Finance Act for tax deductions in respect of rents for tenants over the age of 65.  The intention of the amendment is to extend that provision to tenants under the age of 65; but not to all such tenants, only to those tenants with a taxable income of less than £2,500 per annum.  In other words, the intention is to allow a tax deduction in the case of a very vulnerable section of the community, in the case of those people in very poor circumstances who cannot afford the ever-increasing rents imposed on them by unscrupulous landlords.</P>
      <P>This is a clearly a desirable amendment, all the more so because the State expenditure involved could be recouped by the consequent returns from the previously undeclared incomes of many of the landlords involved.  I was hoping this combined approach of subsidising tenants in poor circumstances and recouping from the landlords involved would, in fact, be a significant step and a significant move towards social equity.  If we put this proposal in the context of the public financing of local authority housing, which is all the more relevant this year under the present Government when the housing lists of the various local authorities are growing and the amount of money allocated to such housing has been reduced with the result that the number of houses which will be built will be reduced, then the number of people forced into private rented accommodation will correspondingly be increased.</P>
      <P>Quite substantial rents are being paid in this city and in other cities throughout the country for rooms in very substandard accommodation.  People in very poor circumstances can least afford such rents but they have little alternative but to pay them and surely they deserve income tax reductions in respect of these rents. Equally, landlords who supply the needs of people in this way and evade tax on a widespread scale should be made pay their fair share of tax.  There will never be a fair and equitable taxation system unless effective steps are taken against those who evade tax and refuse to pay their just share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this amendment, if accepted, will go a little way in the direction of greater social equity by subsidising those in need and taxing those who are guilty in many instances of tax evasion.  The only possible objection to the amendment would be that of cost.  If, however, <Col N="2413" /> this amendment were accepted it could be implemented on the basis that a claimant, in order to prove entitlement to a tax reduction, must refer to the identity and address of the landlord who would then be taxed on the rent he receives.  This process will provide an effective register of landlords which all other efforts to date have failed to achieve.  The cost of the amendment could thus be offset by the income accruing to the Exchequer from the previously undisclosed income of many landlords.  I would hope when the Minister is replying to this suggestion that he will indicate not just the cost of implementing this amendment but the actual amounts that would accrue from landlords if such a register were compiled and if the landlords were taxed consequently on the rents they received.</P>
    <P>I should point out that in last year's Finance Bill I moved a similar amendment though a more costly one, because it referred to a higher income bracket and would have taken in more tenants.  At that time the principle was the same and the amendment was later amended by the Labour Party to precisely the same wording that I have now tabled for precisely the same income bracket.  In the debate last year the Opposition spokesman on Finance, Deputy John Bruton, when speaking on the same amendment said that he very much supported the principle of the amendment.  I quote from column 316, volume 337 of the Official Report of 30 June 1982:</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, since June 1981 it has been the policy of my party to introduce a tax allowance for rent payments.  We believe it is necessary to introduce a degree of fairness as between people who are buying their own houses and can claim interest as a deduction against income tax on the loan they take out for that purpose, and people who have chosen not to buy their own houses but to rent them and can get no tax allowance of any description for the rent payment they make. </P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton then went on to say that there was a strong economic case as well <Col N="2414" /> as a social case for encouraging the use of rented accommodation.  He said:</P>
    <P>Any encouragement towards the use of rented accommodation as distinct from owner occupancy, or at least putting it on an equal footing in the terms of tax advantage, would lead to better utilisation of our housing stock. </P>
    <P>Spokespersons for the Labour Party equally on that occasion welcomed this amendment and supported it.  Deputy Mervyn Taylor said, and I quote from the Official Report at column 320:</P>
    <P>The substance of this section highlights a very serious inequity in our taxation system, the basic unfairness that arises as a result of the positive discrimination which our taxation system as at present constituted accords in favour of house owners as against house tenants. </P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond, speaking in the same debate said:</P>
    <P>Giving a rent concession to persons on low income who pay a relatively high rent is a progressive step and is socially equitable. </P>
    <P>He did not think, at the time, that what was involved would be very expensive. He went on to say that the Labour Party favoured the amendment on balance.  He said:</P>
    <P>The kind of amendment I would favour would be that anyone with a taxable income of £2,500 should get this relief... An amendment along the lines of £2,500 would be entirely reasonable and that is what I would table.  Deputy Gregory and I would have common ground on that and we would not destroy the integrity of the budget. </P>
    <P>Last year there was agreement from the Fine Gael and Labour Parties that this amendment was socially desirable and justifiable and that the cost involved did not take away from that fact.  I hope the principle of the amendment will command their support today.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister even if, as I suspect is inevitable, he is not prepared <Col N="2415" /> to accept this amendment at this stage, whether he intends in the long term to move forward in this direction and whether he can give any indication as to what his intentions are in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a great lot of merit in this amendment.  It is an idea I put forward a number of years ago.  However, things should be put in perspective and with respect to Deputy Gregory his entire case seems to be spearheaded against those who are providing accommodation to tenants.  This is running contrary to the provision of alternative housing accommodation in the city which is very badly needed.  There are landlords who are providing a tremendous housing service.  There are people who are forced into a situation whereby they have to sublet part of their home to derive a certain amount of income from it to have maybe a lodger or tenant or two staying there.  This can be deemed to be a great social service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than doing this in one fell swoop, because I do not think the economics can stand up to that, the Minister should take a look at this area.  He should look at the forgotten mass of people who are living in flats in large cities, principally in Dublin, and are burdened with enormous rent increases.  Recent legislation has done that to them too.  Some relief should be given there.  I do not think it can be introduced like this unfortunately, but if the Minister could give some assurance that he will move in that direction I personally would accept that in good faith.  It would have the effect of encouraging people to even purchase flats.  There is a complete change in the living accommodation pattern of people in Dublin at present.  If they can afford the heavy crippling mortgages of homes, then a valid case can be made for the purchase of a flat.  This is one way of encouraging people in that area. I would be very interested to hear the Minister's comments in reply.  If the Minister has the statistics perhaps he could let us know how many tenants would be affected and what the cost to the Exchequer would be in line with the threshold put forward by <Col N="2416" /> Deputy Gregory.  I should like to get information as to what the figure would be if the threshold was quartered so as to make it a realistic proposition.  That would enable a start to be made in a smaller way.  I agree there is a lot of merit in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De. Rossa Mr. De. Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De. Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment with the proviso that in introducing such a scheme the Minister would ensure that people in receipt of the relief would benefit by it and that it would not find its way to the landlords to whom they are paying the rent.  Most Deputies in Dublin know that there are many flats in the city whose rents are increased nearly every other week.  Such landlords do not do anything to improve the standard of accommodation.  In some cases these flats are fire traps and the entire standard of the accommodation is unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I suggest the Minister should seriously consider the setting up of rent tribunals with a view to bringing about security of tenure.  It is not enough that the benefits of such relief would wind up in landlords' pockets.  At the moment rents are governed by the market rather than any criterion of fairness and justice.  Therefore, a tribunal should be set up to regulate the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government or Fine Gael have not changed our position since last year: in the sense that we are still aware of the problem and anxious to move in the direction the three Deputies have been speaking of.  It is for that reason that the provision now in the Income Tax Act was inserted in the Finance Act last year.  When that measure was being brought forward the point was made in January, and subsequently in March, that it was recognised that there is a need for a measure that would have wider application, but the budgetary circumstances did not allow that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to say that is still the situation. Deputy Gregory asked if I would give details of the cost involved and the amounts that would accrue in tax receipts if a register was established.  The cost would be about £6.5 million in 1983, rising <Col N="2417" /> to £10 million in a full year.  He asked how much tax revenue would accrue to the Exchequer if all the property owners not now covered were to register.  I cannot say, I have no idea.  The only further light I can throw on it is that under the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, about 10,000 landlords registered. I do not know what the proportion of the total number who would be covered by this scheme would be in relation to the 10,000.  It is clear that the operation of that Act and a number of other provisions to ensure we will get complete reporting by taxpayers of their incomes should move in the direction Deputy Gregory has in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady asked how many people would be affected.  The amendment would provide relief for 49,000 persons approximately.  It is difficult to be precise about any of these figures, considering the nature of the problem.  The intention of the proposed amendment is to extend the scope of the relief that exists following the amendment of the Income Tax Act which gives relief to persons with taxable incomes of £2,500.  It is intended that this relief would apply to persons of under 65 years of age whose practical income is less than £2,500.</P>
    <P>The terms of the scheme proposed in the amendment would create a number of difficulties in relation to the PAYE system.  A scheme would have to be worked out to assess a person's eligibility depending on how his income moved during a year and there would be a number of problems in that respect.</P>
    <P>I oppose the amendment for reasons basically of the cost involved at this time, but partly because of the problems created by the form of the amendment.  The intention of the amendment is something I should like to see progressing further in future years because we are dealing with a group of people who are in a difficult situation.  I would point out that some of the people who would be expected to benefit under a scheme of this kind would be those who will benefit from the family income supplement scheme later in the year.  Though we cannot implement this amendment now, we would be anxious to move in this direction, and in the <Col N="2418" /> meantime some measure of assistance will be offered to the people affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>When he is examining this matter in the future will the Minister make it mandatory on all landlords to be registered, as well as tenants, so that there will be a correlation of information available.  That would provide the groundwork for an improvement in next year's budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Even before the provisions in this Finance Bill came about, anyone who has an income from sources other than employment is requested to return all such income.  What the Deputy is suggesting is very realistic and departs somewhat from the tenor of the remarks that have been made here over the last day or two from that side of the House.  He is suggesting that there are some people who do not make that return.  Some of the provisions in this Bill are of a nature that would put a greater degree of pressure on people to disclose other sources of income, perhaps including sources of income which would be covered by this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I was not speaking along those lines.  I was making things easier for the Minister.  Dublin Corporation, the largest local authority have no register of landlords.  It may be said that this information should be submitted to the Department but a strong case can be made for a register to be compiled as a separate entity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am with the Deputy in spirit.  What I am saying is that there is already provision in our tax law requiring people to disclose that kind of income. We have established that some people do not disclose this information and we have to find more effective ways of making them do so.  There are several ways of doing that: some have to do with tax and others will come under different legislation.</P>

      <P>Section 11 is intended to extend the charge to income tax on farming profits to those farmers who up to now were excluded because the valuations of their holdings were below the exemption threshold of £40 poor law valuation. This measure is affected by this section by substituting a revised version of section 15 of the Finance Act, 1974, the effect of which would be to treat all farming in the State as a single trade, the profits or gains from which will be chargeable to tax under Case 1 of Schedule D. The exemption threshold is therefore abolished for 1983-84 and all subsequent years of assessment, and farmers for those years will be chargeable to income tax on the basis of their actual profits.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that an additional 90,000 farmers will be brought within the scope of the tax charge consequent on the abolition of the threshold of £40 rateable valuation.  It is difficult to give an estimate of the actual yield of taxation from this measure because we do not have that kind of information about the incomes of farmers who will be brought into the tax charges as a result of this.  As I said in my Budget Statement, we have a tentative estimate that the removal of the threshold will increase the yield from farm taxation by approximately £2½ million and that, together with other factors, would bring the total yield from farm taxation up to £47 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if at this stage Deputies wish to have a detailed examination of each subsection, but perhaps not.  There are some points to which I would like to draw attention.  In bringing a large number of farmers within the tax net for the first time we have to find an effective and convenient system for dealing with these extra people, about 90,000.  It is clear that a substantial proportion of those people will not have a taxable income but some <Col N="2420" /> will.  It becomes necessary&mdash;and this applies for a number of different reasons &mdash; to find a way of indentifying those farmers who would have a taxable income which would not put those people or the Revenue Commissioners to a great deal of obair in aisce.  For that reason, I have made provision for a new procedure for assessing, in the first instance, who is likely to have a taxable income.</P>
    <P>We have drawn up what is called a farm profile form which will be sent to farmers who come into the tax net for the first time and which would allow the tax inspector to get an idea whether the person sending in the profile form would be likely to have a taxable income.  The farm profile form is a fairly simple, straightforward document and should be capable of being filled in by the farmer without requiring him to engage the services of an accountant or consultant.  This is particularly important because I have a great deal of sympathy for people who object to paying several hundred pounds to prove they do not have a taxable income.  I must say in passing that that situation is not peculiar to the farming sector.  There are a great many companies who are required to produce audited accounts which may show at the end of the day that they do not have a tax liability. There is a particular difficulty in that regard in relation to many people in the farming community.  That is why we have introduced this form.</P>
    <P>The information on that form is designed to assist the local tax inspector in forming an idea whether the farmer in question is likely to have a tax liability. In the event that the inspector decides the farmer is not likely to have a tax liability in that year, there will be no further communication with him but the inspector would obviously come back to review that case at intervals depending on how the situation was evolving in the farming sector.  In the event that the inspector feels that there might be a tax liability a form of declaration will be required of the farmer and he would be required to produce a return based on the simplified form of farm accounts.  We found that the simplified form of farm accounts works well and that it would be <Col N="2421" /> an appropriate means for dealing with people coming into the tax charge for the first time in this new system.  There is no point in going into every detail because the outline of the scheme is the most important part of it.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the farm profile with the main farming organisations.  There has been mostly agreement on the whole but there is a subsisting amount of disagreement. To the extent that there is disagreement, it appears to be based on the proposition that the farm profile should be used to determine tax liabilities. I do not find that that would be an appropriate method of dealing with the problem because what that would amount to would be the introduction of a new notional system with all the disadvantages that that would have, directly in terms of the taxation of the farming community and indirectly in the context of the view of taxpayers in general of our tax system.</P>
    <P>As far as the farming community are concerned the operation of a notional system of that kind would result in a situation where people whose incomes are below the average would be systematically overtaxed and people whose incomes were above the average would be systematically undertaxed.  There are not many people who would wish to see a system with that effect brought into operation.  Those who are now opposing the farm profile approach seem to be taking a very short-sighted view of the problem and to be running the risk of creating unnecessary divisions not only in the farming community but between the farming community and other groups. The system proposed there should not be an excessive burden on the people concerned; it allows us to get a fairer result in terms of the application of our tax system to the farming community and it allows the amount of leeway required to take account of the circumstances of the farming community just as we take account of the circumstances of other kinds of productive enterprise in applying the tax system to them.  Those are the main points in relation to these sections.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with the treatment and <Col N="2422" /> the consequences of the optional basis of assessment in previous years for farmers brought into a charge of tax on their profits for the first time this year.  It provides that farmers who wish to elect for the treatment that is provided for in this section may do so by notifying the inspector of taxes to that effect within 30 days after the date of the notice of the assessment.  The primary purpose of the option being given is to make provision for farmers who are being brought into a charge for tax for the first time this year and who have not been keeping accounts up to now.</P>
    <P>Section 13 makes provision relating to relief in respect of increases in stock values.  It continues the existing provision and puts it into a form where we will not have to make a specific provision in the Finance Bill every year provided that this will continue for as long as stock relief provisions are applicable in other years.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the question of relief for losses under section 307 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  The effect of this section would be that relief for losses under section 307 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, would continue not to be available in respect of a farm loss in any case where the individual who sustained the loss is not chargeable to tax in respect of his farming profits for the year of assessment in which the loss was sustained because of the operation of the exemption limit based on rateable valuation.</P>
    <P>Section 15 amends the provisions of section 22 of the Finance Act, 1974, in relation to farm buildings.  Essentially it would prevent the carrying forward of the allowance for set-off against the profits or gains chargeable for any subsequent year of assessment.</P>
    <P>The sections all together are designed to make the first step which I described as far as section 11 is concerned and then to make consequential provisions on that, plus the provision in relation to capital allowances, so that these four sections will make the proper provision for those who will be coming into the tax net for the first time this year.  Our intention has been to do it in a way that will mean that we will have effective application of the tax and a system of application <Col N="2423" /> that will be efficient without being excessively onerous on the taxpayers concerned or on the tax collection system.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Minister has said that this is the best system to avoid divisions among the farming organisations and between the farming sector and other sectors.  The reverse is the situation and the Minister's approach is dishonest.  The Minister has criticised part of the Fine Gael-Labour Policy for Government.  I will refer to Fine Gael policy as outlined in their programme for economic recovery.  The Minister rightly pointed out that the poor law valuation system as a basis for assessing farmers for income tax and for other purposes is not constitutional or is being waived at present.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael policy document goes on to say:</P>
      <P>We propose that it be replaced by a system based on standard results per enterprise and per region taken from the Farm Management Surveys carried out by An Foras Talúntais.  We propose also that farmers should have the option of having their liability and eligibility assessed either on this basis or on the basis of factual assessment. </P>
      <P>If that was right when that document was published surely it is right now so far as Fine Gael are concerned.  I cannot see why they have changed their minds.  This is the dishonest aspect that I see not alone in relation to that document but also in relation to the Programme for Government published in December where that principle was repeated.  Fine Gael went to the people and looked for farming votes on a certain proposition which the electorate thought they would implement if returned to office.  Now they have made a completely reverse decision. They have not implemented the commitment they made.  This is gross dishonesty. Far from obviating division, the Government have added to the division among farming organisations and between the farming sector and other sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has referred to a simplified form of accounts for farmers who are assessed by the local inspector of taxes as having taxable income.  Will such simplified <Col N="2424" /> form of accounts be accepted by the Revenue Commissioners for tax assessment purposes without the farmers having to employ an accountant?  I would ask the Minister to reply to that question when he is replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned that there will be approximately 90,000 farmers brought into the tax net for the first time on this occasion and has suggested that the yield from income tax will be £2½ million.  I hope that the production of that yield will not cost the farming community an amount far in excess of that, in other words that the farming community will not be put in the situation that they have to prove that they have not, in fact, a taxable income where such is the case.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sections of the Finance Bill which affect the farming community I would point out that there is no incentive for increased production. The proposals now being implemented would tend to decrease production. There should be a system of taxation of farmers that will create an incentive for increased production.  This is what the country needs.  I am not saying that the farming community should not pay their fair share of income tax.  I do say that there should be built into the system an incentive for increased production, in other words that the producer will not be penalised by the taxation system for an increase in production.  I would ask the Minister to consider that aspect seriously. These are the two points I would emphasise, that farmers should not be penalised for increasing production and should not have to prove, at their own expense, that they have not in fact, taxable income.</P>
    <P>I would ask if the Minister would give the legal definition of &ldquo;simplified accounts&rdquo;, if there is such a legal definition. Would the Minister be prepared to produce a sample set of accounts that would be acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners?  This would be important.</P>

      <P>I would like to support what my party colleague has said. Farmers are the backbone of our community and are the backbone of the <Col N="2425" /> economy.  Lifestock production is essential if the country is to survive and to get out of its present crisis.  Agriculture is our largest industry and accounts for 19 per cent of the national income.  Over 20 per cent of the country's workforce are employed on the land.  There are 50,000 employed in the agricultural industry and all this employment is outside the city of Dublin.  This year there are 90,000 more farmers being brought into the tax net for the first time.  Many of these farmers have not even got pocket money.  It is hard to believe that the Government would have brought this number of farmers within the tax net.</P>

      <P>I come from a different type of constituency than that represented by the Minister.  If the Minister lived in my constituency he would realise that livestock is the backbone of our economy and is the only way forward for the country.  Schedule B is an impossible system of assessment of farmers in livestock production.  It is impossible to compare one section of agriculture with another.  I think the Minister spent his early working days working in a very influential farming organisation.  He has made a lot of progress.  How, for instance, could one compare a dairy farmer with a grain farmer?  We all know what farming is like.  We farmers have had to get out of our beds in the small hours of the night and early hours of the morning to help a cow to calve.  If we failed to do that, we knew the risks involved.  Many young farmers have to call on their children at the tender age of seven to help.  It is completely unjust to put farmers in livestock production into that category.  I appeal to the Minister not to allow the Shergar owners and other stallion owners to influence him in changing taxation on farmers.</P>

      <P>The Minister's party gave a commitment. Their programme in connection with jobs in the eighties stated, under the heading of measures that can be taken at national level:</P>
      <P>The Poor Law Valuation (PLV) system currently used as a basis for assessing many farmers' eligibility for certain benefits and liability for certain contributions must be replaced.  It will be replaced by a system based on standard results per enterprise and per region taken from the Farm Management surveys carried out by An Foras Talúntais. These gross results would be adjusted to take account of capital depreciation, interest payments and other factors, in order to calculate taxable income. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2427" /> An Foras Talúntais are an independent body for whom I have the greatest admiration and who have done an excellent job in improving the standards of farming and of farm incomes.  The joint programme continues:</P>
    <P>We propose also that farmers should have the option &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>&mdash;&mdash; of having their liability assessed either on this basis or on the basis of factual assessment. </P>

      <P>I had noticed that as well.  If we are serious about keeping people on our land, we must give them an incentive to stay on the land.  We can look at our EEC partners and see that the Dutch who have a system similar to what is now proposed by the Minister, have lost many thousands of farmers from the land in the last 25 years because of that system.  We can look at our French counterparts who have an alternative system. I would be afraid of what would happen if the French expanded their agriculture because theirs is a vast country with vast farming resources.  They have a separate assessment and their agriculture is thriving.  This is because of the incentives given to them.  We have seen one sector of our community from whom the incentive to work has been taken.  I refer to the PAYE sector where a man's overtime is taxed as if he were working an ordinary day.  That is where the incentive to work has been killed.  I appeal to the Minister not to let himself <Col N="2428" /> be carried away by an accounts system. As a man who looks forward, he should think again about Schedule B and give the Irish farmers a separate system of assessment.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to the Minister outlining this new farm profile form which will be sent out to the 90,000 farmers who are coming into the tax net.  I wonder were the members on the Opposition benches talking to different groups of farmers from those to whom I was talking over the last few months since this system has been proposed. The major farm organisations and a large percentage of farmers involved agree with the system proposed here of the form being sent out to these people.</P>
      <P>This system could be extended to apply to farmers of up to £80 valuation rather than be limited to the 90,000 who are coming into the net.  These people over the last number of years have had to engage accountants to let the Revenue Commissioners know that they are not liable to tax on their incomes.  We have built pyramids for accountants throughout the length and breadth of the country. These farmers have up to now had to pay up to £400 or £500 each year to show their non-liability for tax.  The Revenue Commissioners should accept the simplified form in their case as in the case of the 90,000 farmers.  These people would then not have to be contacted again, as the Minister has stated, if their income is not taxable.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with some Opposition bench speakers.  I do not know what sort of farming Deputy O'Keeffe carries on, but when I was working on my farm I used to spend about 15 hours a day looking after it.  We must accept a system of taxation on the basis of income, if that income is taxable.  In this year of 1983 no-one will disagree that if one has a taxable income one should pay a fair share of tax, in fairness to our working class.  It is only right that farmers and small businessmen should be on the same basis of taxation as workers.  That is a step in the right direction and is making the entire system more equitable.  It will bridge a gap that existed for years.</P>

      <P>For too long there has been a division as between the workers generally and the farmers.  People who had any property were almost told by others that they had no right to such property &mdash; in other words, that they were not paying their fair share of taxation. The fact that 90,000 farmers with valuations of less than £40 are being brought into the tax net in accordance with the farm profile form which the Minister outlined today is going a long way towards bringing about equity in the situation. People not having taxable incomes will have nothing to fear because they will not be asked to pay taxes.  This is a far better system than the one proposed by Fianna Fáil in Government, that was, the imposition of a 2 per cent levy and a resource tax regardless of ability to pay.  I am asking the Minister to extend the farm profile form system to people with valuations of up to £80.  I do <Col N="2432" /> not want to see a continuation of pyramids being built up and down the country by accountants when they are assessing farmers' incomes for the Revenue.  Many farmers who have not got taxable incomes would prefer to pay to the State the few hundred pounds they pay to their accountants.  The State would be much better off.  I hope the Minister will keep that in mind.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed that the Government are bringing farmers with valuations under £40 into the tax net.  This involves 90,000 extra farmers, who are the hardest worked people.  They work about 80 to 84 hours a week and the majority of them do not employ labour.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Deputy, but I should like to remind all Deputies that this is not a Second Stage debate.  It is a Committee Stage debate.  We cannot have a broad general debate.  If we do, some Deputies who wish to speak will not get an opportunity to speak.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us that bringing 90,000 extra farmers into the tax net will bring in about £2½ million. If these 90,000 farmers were charged £200 by their accountants &mdash; and I am sure the charge would be much higher &mdash; that would be £18 million going to the accountants and the Government would collect only about £2½ million in tax.  The Minister mentioned the farm profile form which will be sent out to farmers.  The Revenue Commissioners will then make an assessment of their liability to tax.  The Minister has not explained to us how simplified this form will be and how acceptable it will be to the Revenue Commissioners.  We will have to wait and see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have reneged on their promises to the farmers, promises made before the last election and promises made by the two parties when formulating their policies to form a Government. The farmers are very disappointed at the way they have been let down. Bringing 90,000 small farmers into the <Col N="2433" /> tax net is a disincentive to increased production. Many small farmers will not think it worth their while to farm, now that they are being brought into the tax net.  The Minister should reconsider this. Farmers with valuations under £40 should not be brought into the tax net. They have a difficult job.  They are on the job 365 days a year with no holidays and no hired labour to relieve them at any time.  This is the death knell of the small farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputies on the opposite site of the House putting forward various views on what they would have done had they been in the Minister's position.  We are all concerned about the level of productivity from farming and how it should be encouraged and improved.  Any form of taxation which tends to decrease that level of productivity is a serious disadvantage to the economy in the long term.</P>
      <P>Farmers are to get farm profile forms and an assessment will be carried out by the Revenue Commissioners.  It will then be seen whether they are liable for taxation. They may have to have audited accounts.  This cost is causing concern to a number of farmers, but there are a number of people outside farming and inside farming who have not been paying the level of taxation to which they would normally be liable.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the livestock and milk industry, in which he is very much involved.  Farmers with 80 milch cows have a gross income somewhere in the region of £20,000 to £30,000 if their business is reasonably well managed. These figures are there to be inspected.  The taxation level is quite low. If we pursue the level of taxation envisaged for other sectors a very serious disincentive may be created.  I am concerned about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our programme we mentioned the farm management survey.  I see a good deal of use and value in that.  It has been seen by various farming organisations as a big advantage to the bigger operations. It does not take account of the 90,000 people we are talking about in this case. The great majority of those people will <Col N="2434" /> not be affected by any form of taxation because their incomes are low enough not to be considered for taxation.  I do not understand the concern of the Opposition. Let us see how it works over a period of time and then we can have a further look at it in the light of developments.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government introduced resource taxes and levies which were a far greater imposition and also a disincentive to productivity.  Rather than creating an air of hysteria with regard to the whole area of farming taxation, we should be giving farmers a lead and asking them to produce more.  There will be a market for it, if it is produced.  We all recognise that to a large extent the economy is dependent on what is produced. If we continue to tell farmers that they are going to pay and more, that the system the Government are introducing will in the long-term extract a greater share from them, that will be counterproductive. What we are concerned about is the creation of income for accountants.  All farmers have expressed this concern and we should like to see a way devised to get around that.  There is undoubted value in farmers keeping accounts, because in that way they can identify exactly where is their level of productivity.  A great number of farmers have not kept accounts over the years and their land had been totally underutilised. In the restructuring of land an attempt should be made to make better use of it so that a greater level of productivity will derive therefrom.  I do not think we should create a scare in the minds of these 90,000 small farmers, because they will pay only a very small amount.</P>

      <P>There is a very thin line between Second and Committee Stages, but I would appeal to Deputies not to make Second Stage speeches. Because of the nature of the section with which we are dealing it is difficult to draw a line between what would normally be <Col N="2435" /> a Second Stage debate and a Committee Stage one, but the Deputy should be fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point, a Cheann Comhairle.  It was not my intention to revert to a Second Stage debate.</P>
      <P>I shall dwell on the taxation measures incorporated in this section.  A simplified form of account, rendering it less expensive to the many farmers who will eventually be forced to produce accounts, is of vital importance here.  We gave that commitment to the farming community and I am confident that we can deliver on it.  The greater the certainty with which farmers can move towards keeping accounts the greater level of productivity they will achieve, not alone for the economy at large but for their own bank balances.  The farm management survey had undoubted advantages for a certain section of the farming community; but I do not think &mdash; and I emphasise this &mdash; it will have the advantage some people feel it should have for the 90,000 small farmers now being brought into the tax net.  There is a degree of concern being felt among the farming community. Rates have been abolished and in some cases land is lying grossly underutilised. Farmers tend to make no effort to utilise that land because they do not have to pay rates on it.  In order that the overall economy will benefit it must be ensured that accounts are reasonable and accurate. The method by which such can be achieved has to be seriously considered and implemented in so far as it affects our economy.</P>
      <P>I might say that the concern being expressed about this section is not at all justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about <Col N="2436" /> this section.  I want to make a few brief points.  Ninety thousand farmers have now been brought into the tax net, which is of major concern to us here today.  This is our only concern in regard to this section. The Minister tells us that he expects that £2,500,000 will be the yield as a result of these 90,000 extra farmers being brought into the tax net.  Does the Minister still believe that £2,500,000 will be the yield from these people this year in the light of the fact that it has been a very bad year in farming to date?</P>
      <P>I was amused to read the statement by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, that, even with the bad weather, he expected that it would be a good year for farming.  I wonder is the Minister for Agriculture aware that about 50 per cent of the sugar beet of the country is still not sown, that the cereals that are sown are yellowing and that there are many acres of cereal still not sown.  Furthermore, dairying farmers find that their yield has dropped by about 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>In the light of those facts I would predict there is no way that the Minister could expect to receive £2,500,000 from these new people being brought into the net.  I might add also that the administrative costs involved will definitely underwrite most, if any, of the money that will be yielded here.  I might ask politely if any consideration has been given to the fact that the administration costs will be severe.  We talk about the farm profile, that it is a very simple form.  To date I have yet to see a form emanating from any Department that could be regarded as simple.  I do not believe it is as simple as the Minister says.  I feel also that he does not believe it himself, because any form that has ever emanated, particularly having any connection with the Revenue Commissioners, has never been simple. I am certain that in the heel of the hunt farmers will be forced to go to an accountant and this constitutes my greatest fear. I am not trying to scare anybody, I know how farmers think and I feel the people opposite do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested earlier that accountants would get £20 million from this whole exercise.  Perhaps that figure is exaggerated, perhaps it will be £10 million <Col N="2437" /> only.  But the point is: who will gain? Will it be the Government?  In my opinion the whole exercise should have been considered in greater depth.  What is its purpose?  Is it to pander to the whims of the Labour Party?  If the Exchequer is to receive money from it there must be a rethink because it is my opinion that the Government will lose out on the exercise through administration costs and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister drew a comparison between companies and farmers.  I think he said that this would not be confined to farmers only but would apply to companies as well.  Can the Minister honestly compare a five or a ten-acre farmer with a company director?  Surely this shows how far removed the Minister is from the small farm scene.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can reply afterwards.  I think the Minister is falling into the trap himself, that he has not a full grasp of the scene at small farm level.</P>
      <P>I support my colleagues here in the call for equity.  One hundred and twenty hours a week may be put in on a family farm.  Deputy Farrelly talked of putting in 15 hours a day himself, that is 105 hours a week.  Is there any comparison to be drawn between him and the PAYE worker who puts in 40 hours a week; or those on the family farm putting in 120 hours, with the PAYE worker again on 40 hours per week?  I should like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel this proposal will drive people off the land and further depopulate rural areas.  This is wrong.  I should like to comment also on the incentives.  Taxation in farming should encourage farm production and I have no doubt but that the Minister's proposal will do the exact opposite, because there is no incentive given to produce more.  If there was an incentive to produce more that would create extra jobs as well.  Indeed, I often wonder do those people who cry loudest for farmers to be taxed take that into consideration.  For example, do they take into consideration&mdash;as Deputy E. O'Keeffe has said&mdash;that encouragement <Col N="2438" /> and incentive on the agricultural scene will create jobs and could be the salvation of the economy.  The Minister has fallen into this trap and has been taken over by people who are crying &ldquo;tax the farmer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider using the figures put forward by the Agricultural Institute, an independent body, as a base.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Much concern is being expressed on the other side of the House about an alleged inconsistency in the way we have prepared and enunciated our policies and what we are actually doing, but the time of Deputies opposite would be better spent in comparing past statements and pious platitudes by their party with their record while in office.  I see no contradiction between what we have said we will do and what we are doing.  The idea of presenting a document to achieve a farm profile on which decisions can be taken as to whether or not farmers are liable for tax is completely consistent with what we have been saying, that every farmer who has a taxable income should have to pay on his disposable taxable income.  We will not force each individual farmer to go to an accountant in order to prove that he has not a taxable income.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the legislation before us arises in part because of the politics of envy, jealousy and misunderstanding. The pressure would be on any Minister for Finance to introduce this kind of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that this provision will cover an extra 90,000 farmers.  Does anybody know how many farmers there are, what size of farms we are talking about or whether we are talking about farmers as defined under the farm development programme, those who spend more than half their time and earn more than half their money from agriculture? I have never yet been able to establish how many farmers we are talking about. How many of these 90,000 farmers have valuations of under £20 and are already in the PAYE net?  Very few of them have a taxable income and according to the farm management survey carried out by the Agricultural Institute in the west <Col N="2439" /> more than 50 per cent have incomes of less than £60.</P>
    <P>It is entirely regrettable that economic difficulties and political thinking should have created a climate in which those people are seen as polluting the environment and refusing to pay their taxes.  It is a shame that in a small country there is such gross misunderstanding about the standards of living and the difficulties of life experienced by people who live in relatively close proximity to the towns and cities.  The agricultural community are genuinely willing to pay their share of tax on the disposable income they earn. We should not force them to pay tax on their entire profits because that would lead to a situation in which they would not be able to invest.</P>
    <P>There are people who think that agriculture is a wonderful opportunity to make a tax-free income.  I have experience of politicians on the other side of the House telling people in Dublin that the amount of tax being collected from agriculture is derisory and their colleagues in country areas warned people about the danger of a Coalition Government taxing them out of existence.  I have known it to happen among my own party as well.  It is very sad.  That is the kind of politics that has created the atmosphere in which it is so poorly understood&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have been making an important <Col N="2440" /> point in the context of a section which introduces large numbers of people to the income tax net for the first time.</P>
      <P>The point which worries me most is that our tax collection system is already overburdened and the Revenue section must be entangled still further with legislation that compels them to examine the accounts of another 90,000 people. This is being done to collect only £3 million, an amount which will be greatly exceeded by the fees paid to accountants. Only a couple of years ago we abolished a system of rates with which farmers were happy.  It was yielding ten times this amount and was seen by farmers as a tax levied on their farms in order to give them a service in return in the form of roads, water facilities and so on.  We applauded ourselves for getting rid of that system and now in order to please people who do not understand we must bring into the tax net all these people from whom we cannot hope to get any money.  I do not believe it will be a disincentive because I believe there will be increased agricultural production on the part of those farmers already keeping accounts.  In the highly competitive world of agriculture in Europe increased production will have to be sought from those who are already extremely efficient and, remember, we are in surplus in practically all commodities in the Community and so we must impress on our farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have been working in this industry all my life for hours equal to those worked by any Deputy from Cork or anywhere else.  As I said, I do not believe it will be a disincentive.  The industry has been growing for the last 15 years or more.  The pressure to keep accounts and understand fully the effects of their financial circumstances will be a help to farmers and I rely on the good sense of the Minister, who is experienced in this particular area, not to take the paperwork any further than is absolutely necessary.  Like everyone else he knows there is no oil well and no gold mine there to be tapped.  What we are doing is a purely political exercise.

      <P>I am interested in the determination of the farmers' income and I have some questions to put in this respect.  Will account be taken in the disadvantaged areas of the special position of those in these severely handicapped regions?  Will the assessment include items like headage grants and unemployment assistance?  Will some provision be made to exempt those who fall into these categories?  I am sure the Minister is aware of the resentment felt about the farm profile.  There are reports of the farm profile being burnt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be burned when it is issued.  A large section of the farming community will be reluctant to complete the profile until they get some assurances in regard to the methods which will be used in assessing their incomes.  It is unlikely that the profile will be completed. It possibly will not be returned by many farmers unless there is some indication of the method of assessment. Again, a large section of the farming community are anxious to have an option <Col N="2442" /> in the accounting system used in the determination of income.  The case has been made very forcibly by one of the organisations in my constituency that the production unit accounting system should be used or an option should be given to the farmer.  Can the Minister say if that will be the case?  Secondly, will any allowance be made in the treatment of those in severely handicapped areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been attempts over the past few weeks to generate a certain amount of hysteria and confusion about this farm profile document.  In the part of the country I represent the surveys carried out over the past number of years indicate that the vast majority would not be eligible or liable for any income tax even under very, very low guidelines. The system of issuing profiles to farmers is designed in a way to filter people out of the system rather that into the system because the Revenue Commissioners have already indicated they simply could not cater for the 90,000 extra were they all liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to indicate who decides the criteria for a judgment by the inspector of taxes as to whether a farmer who fills up a farm profile is or is not liable to taxation.  Are the criteria laid down by the Department of Finance, by the Revenue Commissioners or by individual tax inspectors?  Would it mean that on the instructions of a tax inspector a subordinate could decide whether a particular farmer might be liable for a second assessment?  If that were to happen there might be a substantial number of borderline cases paying a very small amount of taxation.  I should like some clarification as to whether those people would be expected to go to the expense of paying an accountant when the end result might be liability for a very small amount of taxation.  Overall, the implications of the farming profile will be acceptable provided we have an assurance from the Minister that the information will not be designed to switch people into the system.  The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are probably aware now that the majority of farmers accept that this must <Col N="2443" /> go ahead but they do not like too many questions asked about the development of their farms over the last five or ten years.  If the information sought on the profile document is merely to form a background picture of development up to the moment, that will be all right.  Most importantly, who will set the criteria for sending out a second assessment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>A figure of 90,000 farmers has been mentioned.  The situation is that out of the 269,000 holdings we have 63,000 from one to 15 acres and another 61,000 between 15 and 30 acres.  It would be very hard to visualise a farmer with 30 acres in the category of tax liability.  Will any consideration be given to those in receipt of supplementary benefit or those who have been assessed for medical cards?  You have a farm profile there which has to be completed by the health boards.  Will the situation be that the Revenue Commissioners will spend a great deal of time and considerable expense examining the financial position of recipients of supplementary benefit? To me there would appear to be duplication here.  We are told about simplified farm accounts.  I never yet saw a simplified form emanate from the Revenue Commissioners.  They are all invariably very complicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned the fact that we would be looking to those who keep farm accounts for increased agricultural production.  I come from an area similar to his.  We must look to the smaller farmers.  This Government have disregarded them.  They have curtailed and withdrawn grant aids to them.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether they are just looking to the most efficient farmers, who represent only 25 or 30 per cent of the entire farming population, for increased production and are forgetting about the other 75 per cent of farmers who were in the process of development? When we have a fall-off in employment, in manufacturing production and such severe competition in the world markets for our products we should be turning towards agriculture.  It is the area which is crying out for development.  It is the <Col N="2444" /> area which has the potential.  We have only to look at the massive imports of practically everything that is down in the restaurant today to know how agriculture is crying out for development.  It has the potential to increase the jobs and the Minister should be looking at that.  The farming organisations and every person in this House agrees that if we are to have a fair system of taxation each one will have to pay his due amount.  When one looks at the figures and the administrative costs I would ask the Minister to take cognisance of the need for development when he is examing the system of taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the moves the Minister is making in the direction of bringing many farmers into the tax net. I have reservations about section 13 in relation to the 110 per cent stock relief and so on.  Those of us who have argued for years that farmers should be brought into the tax net are simply arguing that everyone should pay in accordance with their means.  If these sections bring about some equity in the tax system, then they are to be welcomed.  I might contrast the practically total unanimity there was last year between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil in relation to the resource tax when they were seeking to do away with a tax which farmers were paying and the disunity there is today in relation to attempts to bring farmers into the tax net.  I have argued a number of times that agriculture is in complete disarray and disorder.  It is completely underdeveloped.  I do not accept that leaving the farming sector outside of the tax net will be an incentive to them to improve their position in any way.  They have been outside the tax net for many years and the situation is deteriorating, not getting better, apart from the fact that there are hundreds of millions of pounds paid by way of incentives to the farming sector every year.  It is argued that the PAYE sector work a 40 hour week.  I would make the point that no one, whether he is in the PAYE sector, farming or any other sector should have to work 80 hours a week to survive. That is utterly disgraceful.</P>

That is a disincentive.  Nobody wants to see a situation where anybody has to work an 80 hour week in order to survive and where all of his effort goes to the tax man.  Everyone should pay his share and where incentives are provided they should be directed towards production and not simply towards allowing off the hook those who can afford to pay.</P>
      <P>Somebody mentioned nationalisation of farms.  It is not the tax system that is causing the fragmentation of farms or the continuation of a situation where small farmers are ekeing out a living.  Farmers have been leaving the land for years.  For as long as they decide that they want to hold on to their few acres, live in isolation from the rest of the community and not co-operate with their neighbours in developing their farms, then certainly they will continue to go off the land and will continue to be unproductive and inefficient. We want equity and we do not want to allow off the hook those who can afford to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether all farmers regardless of their valuations will be liable to pay tax.  If small farmers were given the chance to do the accounts system, perhaps in two years' time they could be asked to pay tax.  It is ludicrous to tax all small farmers, particularly those with valuations between £5 and £20.  The small farmers have been penalised enough in this budget.  They have no incentive to modernise their farms because the grants under the farm modernisation scheme have been withdrawn.  We were getting pound for pound from Europe and still the grants have been withdrawn.  A farmer cannot develop his farm now <Col N="2446" /> because there are no grants there at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the very great hardship being caused to many tenants who have been subjected to very substantial rent increases following the passing of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982; and the steps he intends to take to protect the livelihood of those tenants many of whom are elderly and unable to pay the increases being granted by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>A rent allowance scheme is in operation in my Department since July 1982 when the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, became law.  The scheme is designed to assist those on low incomes who are tenants of dwellings which were formerly controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts and whose rents have been increased by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of allowance payable under the scheme depends on the person's means and the amount of the increased rent.  The maximum allowance is the difference between the old and the new rent, if the old rent was £3 a week or more.  Otherwise, it is the difference between £3 and the new rent.  In virtually all cases, therefore, the maximum allowance will cover the full rent increase. <Col N="2449" /> Nearly everyone who is dependent on social welfare payments or whose income is at that level, will qualify for the maximum allowance.  Persons on higher incomes will not receive full compensation for a rent increase.</P>
    <P>When the means of a tenant who is a married person exceeds £70 a week, £40 if single, there are graded reductions in the allowance.  The allowance will ensure that nobody will suffer hardship as a result of high rent increases granted by the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the initial intention was that the courts would be conducted on an informal basis and is he aware that these courts are operated in a manner which I regard as a national scandal?  Elderly people are being intimidated and being confronted with reports by architects and surveyors with which they are not able to cope.  I am sure the Minister knows that some of these rents have been increased from £1 per month to £30 per week in some cases. Some of those people are in their 70s and 80s.  Will the Minister ensure that action will be taken to alleviate this appalling scandal that is occurring throughout Dublin?

      <P>She continued to sign the unemployed register but her claim was again disallowed on similar grounds as she had informed the local office that she was only interested in getting work in her own locality.

Does the indication that one is interested in a certain type of work mean that one is not available for work?  Does the existance of a child automatically preclude a woman from benefit?  In this case details of possible arrangements were given at various times.  Is there an automatic negative presumed in case of a woman with a child unless she has been sacked?</P>

If this man seeks a demountable dwelling, which he will, from the local authority, at further expense to the State, he will be entitled to full social welfare assistance.  In view of that I would ask the Minister to have a further look at the case and to direct this social welfare officer, in view of the number of persons in similar circumstances in the area who are benefiting under the scheme, to examine this case further in the light of the evidence that has been adduced over a long period.

      <P>The person concerned does not qualify for a contributory old <Col N="2463" /> age pension because he does not satisfy the contribution condition which requires a minimum yearly average of 20 contributions.

      <P>Incidentally, I have received the letter referred to, dated 16 May.  My representations were made in February.  Would the Minister not consider that there is an anomaly in this case? It is obvious that a person who is aged 74 years, who does not now qualify will never qualify for social welfare benefit under the present system.  Is it not anomalous that such a person, who is in receipt of part-time earnings, should have PRSI contributions deducted without there being any possibility of his gaining from those contributions?</P>

      <P>I should like to ask a question in connection with the reply the Minister gave to the last part of Deputy Brady's question when he said <Col N="2464" /> that because of an oversight a detailed reply did not issue.  I would like to ask the Minister if he is aware of the number of oversights of this kind that have occurred in the Department and is it not indicative of the situation which has arisen that because detailed replies are not sent to Deputies within a reasonable time, so many parliamentary questions are directed to the Minister in relation to delays in processing claims?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regret that Deputies would not get detailed replies. I am taking the matter up to ensure that when a Deputy writes to the Department he will get a detailed reply.  I am sure that will happen.  If there are delays in replies, if the matter is brought to my attention and if I am given factual information, I will take the matter up with the Department.</P>

      <P>If it is possible for a Deputy to gain the complete information within a very short period of time as a result of a parliamentary question to the Minister, I suggest it should also be possible for a Deputy to gain the same information by way of detailed reply from the Department.  I would ask the Minister to investigate the possibility of having this done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to say that it is not possible.  As the Deputy is well aware, the fact that questions have to be replied to in a given time makes it incumbent on the Department to reply. As a result of these questions being put down there are often delays in other areas of the Department because intense pressure has been put on.  As regards the ordinary, mundane question, I would prefer that Deputies would direct them in the normal way.  If they would take them up with me I would ensure that delays would be cut to a minimum.  The fact that questions are put down and have to be answered puts tremendous pressure on the Department which I believe is not in the best interest of social welfare beneficiaries.</P>

My reason for doing so on this occasion was to try to get information on representations made six months ago. It is most unreasonable for any Minister or any Department to indicate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Would the Minister not agree, in the light of the information which he has just now given the House, that this would confirm the view that there is widespread confusion over the operation of this rent assistance?  Would he give consideration to engaging in some way in a publicity campaign to alert elderly people of their rights in this respect?

The amount allocated this year in this respect is probably far too much.  The <Col N="2472" /> scheme is being totally abused and is feathering the nests of certain sections of the community who are abusing the legislation. The Minister should use his position to put an end to that abuse.  The interested people in this city, and I do not have to name them, will co-operate to ensure that the £10 million is used. This is a scandal and is totally discriminatory so far as old people are concerned.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare when a person (details supplied) in County Monaghan first appealed against the amount of means assessed against him; the number of days in respect of which he did not apply for unemployment assistance; and the reason for the delay in processing his case.</P>

      <P>An appeal was made by the person concerned against the assessment of means in his case and the appeal was received in the headquarters of my Department on 7 April 1983.  The case was determined by an appeals officer on 12 May 1983 and he upheld the assessment of means at £11.50 weekly.</P>
      <P>During the last two years the person concerned did not apply for unemployment assistance on 165 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An examination of the appeal papers <Col N="2474" /> shows that the person concerned lodged the appeal at his local office in January last.  It is not possible at this stage to say how the delay arose between the time the appeal form was despatched from the local office and the time it was received in the headquarters of the Department. The volume of correspondence received in the Department is so great that it is not possible to trace what precisely happened in this case.</P>
    <P>This particular case was also the subject of a written question put down by the Deputy for answer on 10 May 1983. I should like the Deputy to know that when the reply to that question was prepared the appeal papers were not readily available and it was assumed that the appeal had been received and dealt with in the normal course.  It was not known that there had been a delay in transmission of the appeal and the reply was prepared accordingly.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, could I ask very briefly for your co-operaction? I suppose I am speaking more to my own colleagues than to anybody else. We worked out an agreement on the seven parts of the Bill.  I should like to remind the House &mdash; and I am sure you have been doing it for the past few days &mdash; that in Part I of the Bill there are 46 sections.  After 15 or 16 hours we are on section 11 of Part I.  There are some major sections in the first part of the Bill, really vital ones about which people outside the House have been speaking, and on which there has been a good deal of debate outside the House.</P>
      <P>It would be terrible if we were to spend over 30 hours discussing the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, sitting late at night and spending an inordinate amount of time on some of the early sections, without reaching the major ones.  I should like to ask my own colleagues more than anyone else to use the Committee Stage as it should be used, and not to make long repetitious speeches about things which are not as important as some of the other sections which may not be reached. The first Part of the Bill is a major part. At 4.30 p.m. all amendments in the name of the Government which have not yet been debated will be taken and will form part of the Bill.  I do not want us to be prohibited from debating sections which might be totally objectionable to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the farm modernisation scheme.  Farmers are no longer entitled to grants for farm buildings or any type of concrete works or silage pits.  This has hit farmers in the west of Ireland who have bad, wet land more than any other farmer.  It is a shame that these grants are no longer available, in particular when half the money was coming £1 for £1 from the EEC.  In disadvantaged areas in Northern Ireland farmers qualified for 70 per cent of the grant, when we were qualifying for only 30 per cent of the grant.  Now that small 30 per cent has been done away with in the budget.</P>
      <P>Another thing which has hit the farmers in the west, and especially the small farmers with off-farm incomes, is the discontinuation of headage payments.  The income limit was reduced from over £5,000 to £3,500.  Anybody who is working now will not qualify for a subsidy under that scheme.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to take up any more time. It will cost each and every one of the small farmers in the tax net at least £200 to get their accounts done by an accountant. That amount of money is ridiculous. It is rates by the back door.  They are being penalised too much if they have to pay £200 to an accountant to have their accounts done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>How far will farmers have to go to prove their tax liability?  They should not be put to unnecessary expense.  The present proposals are not <Col N="2496" /> attractive to the farming community.  In the event of extra production or any other initiative, will the farmer be penalised, or will the Minister give concessions in those circumstances?  Now 90,000 farmers are to be brought into the tax net. The vast majority of them will not be liable for tax.  The Minister's projection of £2½ million is not correct, and that figure would not cover even the administration of farming taxation.</P>
      <P>If we are to keep our people on the land we must be prepared to show some appreciation of the long and unsocial hours they have to work.  Farmers are afraid of this proposed new tax form which they will receive shortly.  They should get every help from the Revenue Commissioners.  There is no such thing as a simplified tax form.  I appeal to the Minister to assure the farming community that he will introduce a simplified system of taxation, and that the personnel of the Revenue Commissioners will be available to give them every assistance so that they will not be forced to go to accountants unless they are liable to tax.</P>

      <P>A number of remarks have been made on the other side of the House about reality. I should like to ask the Deputies who raised that question, and particularly Deputy O'Keeffe and one or two others, to reflect on who is in touch with reality. They all seem to have forgotten the main proximate reason why we are having this debate here today.  The reason is that a case was taken by representatives of the farming community&mdash;and they have achieved part of the objective&mdash;designed to show that the PLV system is unconstitutional in certain aspects.  Because that case was taken and because they got that verdict in the courts &mdash; now on appeal &mdash; we can no longer use a threshold of PLV as a means of deciding who is or who is not within the tax system.  It is as a direct result of an action taken by and on behalf of the farming community that we are having this discussion.  I ask Deputies on the other side of the House to remember that reality before they start making the points they are making.</P>

      <P>I said it is on appeal.  A number of people, including myself, have been saying for a number of years that we should have a better system.  Deputy O'Keeffe is in a good position to know that because he was involved for many years with people who were making that point &mdash; and I have been at it myself in one way or another for the past 15 years &mdash; without making a great deal of progress in suggesting a system which would meet the problem.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will restrict my remarks on these sections to the minimum number possible.  If Deputies opposite want to make an issue of it, I am afraid I might respond to it.  But the reality of it is that we need now to have a replacement system because we can no longer use the PLV as being a threshold for deciding who is and who is not in the tax net.  It is because we are in that position that 90,000 farmers with valuations of £40 or under are now automatically in the tax system.  What we are doing here is finding a convenient, practical method of dealing with that problem that will not be excessively onerous either on the farmers themselves or on the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe and one or two others had the good sense and discrimination obviously to read a Fine Gael policy document issued last summer.  They also had the good sense to read the Government's programme.  They picked <Col N="2498" /> out a particular passage in both of those documents &mdash; drafted, might I add, by myself with the agreement of people in those two parties &mdash; which was an approach to dealing with this problem. On further examination we have found that there is a better way of doing that job than we had set out there.  I am very happy that we have found a better way, because in any notional system adopted there will be discrepancies and injustices. We have found a better way of dealing with that problem and that better way is incorporated in these sections.</P>
    <P>If Deputies on the opposite side of the House are saying that we should stop thinking at a certain point, again I wonder who is in touch with reality and who is out of touch with reality.  Deputies opposite are trying to pretend that we should freeze our thinking at a given moment in time and forget about trying to find even better ways of doing what we propose than have already been set out. I was disappointed to hear the remarks made on the other side because a number of them had more to do with propanganda and slogans than with an analysis of the provisions of these sections.</P>
    <P>The question was asked: Would the simplified form of accounts be accepted? I made the point in my opening remarks on these sections that we will accept the simplified form of accounts.  There are two stages in the operation for those who are coming into the tax system this year for the first time &mdash; 90,000 of them.  A number of them this year will, first of all, be asked to fill in the farm profile which will be issued towards the end of this month or early next month.  It is a very simple document.  The operative part of it consists of four pages, one of them being a series of guidelines on how to fill in the form.  The sharp end of it &mdash; apart from the front page which gives reference numbers and addresses and the back page which gives guidance &mdash; has two pages on the inside where fairly straightforward type information is requested.  The contents and presentation of that form have been agreed with the farming organisations.</P>

      <P>Tax inspectors will make their own judgment as to who are the people who are most likely, or more likely than others, to be in a position of having a taxable income.  When they receive the information on this profile they will then decide, on the basis of that information, how many of those who have received and returned the farm profile might be in a position to have a taxable income and will then follow the rest of the procedure for assessment of tax on farming profits, which includes the simplified form of accounts.  I would remind Deputies that only a couple of weeks ago I announced that I had set up an interdepartmental working group, as indeed had been foreshadowed in the Government's programme and in my Budget Statement, a group that will examine the further simplification of accounts, where that is possible, for small businesses and farmers.  I have taken a particular approach to that.  We have invited all of the interested organisations to make known their views on how we can further simplify the kinds of accounts that have to be presented by small businesses and farmers.  When we have those views I shall be very concerned to ensure that, where possible, we will further simplify the accounts so as to reduce the burden on people who have to provide this information to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked if there is a legal definition of simplified accounts.  We do not need a legal definition of simplified accounts. <Col N="2500" /> We already have a simplified accounts form for agriculture and we have invited submissions on further simplification of those forms.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate Deputy Mac Giolla's concern.  I also have a concern to answer the points made by Deputies on the other side.  I have undertaken that I will do so as briefly as I can, and the fewer interruptions there are the quicker I will be able to do so.</P>
      <P>It was suggested by Deputy E. O'Keeffe that we should have in effect a notional system.  I must ask Deputies on the other side of the House to put to themselves the question: are they making a case for a notional system the result of which will be that the people whose incomes are below the average level will pay more tax than they should pay?  I do not think that is a proposal that Deputies on the other side would seriously put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested by Deputy McEllistrim that the 90,000 farmers coming into the tax net would pay £18 million to accountants and £2,500,000 to the Revenue. <Col N="2502" /> I must say to Deputy McEllistrim that I have had representations from accountants &mdash; friendly ones from people I know &mdash; since the proposals were mooted.  They asked me was I trying to put them out of business because we were taking action that would mean that all these farmers would not be obliged to go to accountants to produce their returns. Of course, it is not the case that 90,000 farmers will be paying accountants.  We have designed the system to avoid the necessity of farmers going to accountants. The farm profile requires information that can normally be provided without any great difficulty by the farmer himself.  On the related point, it is not at all the case that the cost of administering the system would exceed the revenue we would get from it.  That is a popular, rather unreflecting remark made by people about a new system of this kind. It is not true to any extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartin raised a number of questions about the definitions of income that would be taken into account in assessing farmers' liability to taxation. Smallholders' employment assistance is not included in the definition of income, so this would not create a problem.  In any case the vast majority of people who are in receipt of this assistance would not have a taxable income so there is not a difficulty in relation to those people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section but because of the time limit I will be brief.  We are opposing the section and <Col N="2505" /> we have adopted this stance after full consideration of the issues involved. There may have been some misunderstanding as a result of consultations which we and others had with the ITGWU.  We had already decided our position in respect of this section and had drafted an amendment which we proposed to put down to delete this section.  In the course of those discussions the trade union representatives indicated that they were seeking support for opposition to this section and we indicated that their views on this income levy coincided with ours. There seems to have been some misunderstanding &mdash; I am not saying it was deliberate &mdash; in press reports which suggested that our position on this levy was adopted simply by way of support for the views of the trade union and that we did not have a position of our own.  I made our position quite clear long before those consultations during the course of the Second Sage debate.</P>
      <P>I will briefly reiterate our reasons for opposing this section.  When the 1 per cent levy was first introduced by a previous Government it was designed for a particular purpose.  We are not satisfied that it has achieved what it was meant to achieve; but at least it had the virtue of being attributable to a particular purpose &mdash; always a good principle in taxation &mdash; namely, the training of young people and the generation of employment for them.  We opposed it then and we oppose it even more vigorously now because this provision is not specified as being for employment purposes.  It is an instrument of further taxation which will raise very considerable sums for the Revenue this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition the impact of this measure will fall most strongly on the PAYE sector who are already bearing a very heavy share of the burden of taxation.  While the levy applies to all income it can be deducted at source from the income of the PAYE sector which is immediately identifiable.  I have already given the figures for the growth of taxation in recent times, particularly the growth in income tax.  With the addition of this 1 per cent income tax will certainly have gone to <Col N="2506" /> almost 40 per cent of total taxation.  That is a very considerable sum.  Income tax is growing at a very rapid rate.  It is a 9 per cent increase on the percentage of total taxation over the last couple of years. The levy will aggravate the position still further.  That is something to which we must register our strong disapproval.</P>
    <P>This is an extra burden on those immediately liable.  If I may anticipate his arguments the Minister will understandably say he will not accept the amendment. Deputy Mac Giolla and I have suffered a certain amount of frustration because our amendments were ruled out of order.  Now I do not question the Chair's ruling but we had in mind particularly those engaged in smuggling and, perhaps, in the drug traffic in relation to whom bona fide traders are at a considerable disadvantage.  Had the amendment been allowed there would have been some contribution for alleviating the cost on the Exchequer.  I do not think this needs any further argument from me. It is a case of a revenue instrument being contrived solely for the purpose of adding to the Exchequer intake without regard to whether that is proper or fair or equitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Very little time is available now to deal with important sections of this Bill.  This section is a particularly important one.  Everyone must agree it is the most inequitable in the Bill. It goes against the grain of the tax code, a code to which we are supposed to bring some degree of equity and justice.  The code is being eroded by this 1 per cent levy on incomes varying from £4,000 and £5,000 to £20,000.  This levy is wholly retrogressive.  It was introduced last year for a specific purpose, namely, youth employment, and for that reason it was accepted.  I do not think there was any opposition to the youth employment levy of 1 per cent last year.  It was to serve a very good purpose.  Unfortunately two things have happened now.  First the youth employment levy has gone off in all sorts of different directions.  It is now going into the maw of the Exchequer.  To what extent it is funding youth employment it would be difficult to say.  The <Col N="2507" /> whole purpose of the levy is being eroded.</P>
      <P>Secondly, nobody paid the levy except those in the PAYE system.  It was not paid by the self-employed or the farmers. Because it was so meekly accepted last year the Minister apparently now regards the levy as a simple method of garnering more taxation by putting on another 1 per cent this year.  It would be very easy and very simple for a Minister for Finance next year to get rid of the entire income tax code and clap on another 30 per cent or 35 per cent by way of levy on everybody. That would completely erode the income tax code but it would save a great deal of money in collection and tax personnel.</P>
      <P>Why is there all this alleged anxiety to make the code progressively equitable when the Minister comes in here with another 1 per cent levy?  This erodes the whole principle of equity.  Not alone that but it will dramatically increase the resistance of workers to the deductions of tax at source.  That has been very valuable for the Ministers for Finance over the last 30 years.  There was no objection to paying. Now because of this levy the whole system is being questioned and people are thinking again about their rights. Landlords got rid of rent restriction and farmers got rid of the PLV and the rates. Why should workers not wish to rid themselves of this deduction of 1 per cent every week from their pay packets?  Having worked for the money they are entitled to get it into their own hands.  The Minister should think seriously about what might happen if this were made a constitutional issue in our courts.  Next year's Minister for Finance could increase the levy to 2 per cent.  Where will we go from there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our aim should be to remove inequity from the tax system.  This levy is regressive and totally inequitable.  When the Social Welfare Bill was going through I was under the impression that PRSI was a form of social insurance.  The Minister could not understand why I could not see that it is really a tax and has no relation to social insurance.  This levy will be used in precisely the same way.  The crunch <Col N="2508" /> will come when it is questioned by the workers.  I do not think the Minister has yet understood what is happening in the current PAYE protest.  They are not worrying about marching.  They are not going to bother marching any more.  Do not get the impression from that that there is only a small number involved in any of these campaigns.  Never has the attitude been so bitter, following each deduction from their wage packet.</P>
    <P>This 1 per cent levy will create even more problems than all the other taxation systems in this Bill.  I would ask the Minister to look at it again.  I do not know exactly how much it will bring in, but even if it had been put into the income tax code it would not have caused half the uproar.  This year it is 1 per cent. Everybody is expecting that next year it will be 2 per cent, then 3 per cent and then 5 per cent.  The inequity of it is what is raising everybody's hackles.  To someone on £14,000, £15,000 or £20,000 a year a pound on every £100 is nothing; but for the man on £100 a week a pound is quite a lot.  He needs a pound or two at the end of the week to put into his ESB bill or something else when he is keeping a family.  To him a pound is a big sum.  It is the difference between just making it and just not making it.</P>

      <P>We should resist easy options which perhaps do not affect people in the public service so much as people outside that they do not understand the effect that these easy options can have.  The PAYE people are being very badly fleeced and we must ensure that this does not continue.  We must give some indication that this whole area will be reformed.  I am satisfied that the funds from this will be channelled to youth employment.  That certainly is something positive in this section.  The sooner funds are channelled into youth employment the better because of the vast number we have unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2509" /> What worries me about this is the use of the word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;.  Income tax was introduce to fund the Napoleonic Wars temporarily and it has been with us ever since.  I want the Minister to give us an assurance that this will be temporary and will not go on <i>saecula saeculorum</i> and that it will not be increased next year. I am concerned about the whole question of levies because I doubt very much if they are equitable.  The income tax code at least allows for certain stages of taxation in relation to people's ability to pay; but levies do not and there may be people whose income is so low that they should not be asked to pay a levy at all.  If this were to be a permanent feature we would have very serious reservations about it.</P>
    <P>It is very disheartening to hear people talking about this being most important and the need to do this and the need to do that.  All we have heard from Deputy Mac Giolla on all the sections is totally anti everything.  He wants to give everything to everybody and is not prepared to take on himself the responsibility for raising the funds to pay for that.  It is people like Deputy Mac Giolla who have this country the way it is.</P>

I want the Minister to really take a look at this whole area because people in the public service are not the best people to advise on levies since they do not have experience of what people outside have to suffer from these levies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth pointing out that it was the trade union movement which very much favoured and campaigned for the PAYE system.  That is important.  I might be put into the same category as my colleague, Deputy Mac Giolla.  It might be thought that the trade union movement are against everything.  The trade union movement also were prepared to support the youth employment levy on the basis that it would create employment, but this has not happened. Workers generally feel very sore about this, and if opposition is being put up by the trade union movement it is reflecting the views of all the people who have to pay this.  A youth levy of 1 per cent on all income earners, whether workers, self-employed or farmers, was introduced in April 1982 and the Minister for Labour told the Dáil on 16 March that a total of £38 million had been collected from the PAYE sector in respect of 1982.  But, according to the Minister's own statement, <Col N="2511" /> absolutely nothing had been collected from either the self-employed or farmers.  There are farmers in County Louth, too, and they have to live.  Here is a levy that is not collected at all.  The Minister said that demands for payment in respect of 1982-83 will be issued to these categories in conjunction with the 1983-84 demands.  The Minister did not indicate how much was outstanding in money terms from the self-employed and the farmers.  It is interesting to note that it was costing the PAYE category £73 million, the self-employed £3.5 million and the farmers £1 million &mdash; a total of £77.5 million.  I assume the same ratio would apply to this.  It is the people who already were paying the lion's share who are being asked to contribute the additional levy.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to appreciate that workers who earn small industrial pensions who have got medical cards at the moment, because their incomes may exceed £77 after next July, will be liable for this levy.  Already, out of their small industrial pensions they are paying 4 per cent and as they are not holders of medical cards they will have to pay the additional levy.  Some old age pensioners may also have small industrial pensions of £15 or £16 per week and they will have to pay the additional 1 per cent.  It is a further milking of the PAYE class, as my colleague said.</P>
      <P>Take the health contribution.  On 24 March the Minister for Health told the Dáil that at the end of 1982 a sum of £8.4 million was outstanding in health contributions by farmers.  We have the same story all over.  Other groups can negotiate and bargain but those in the PAYE sector who have their levies deducted once a week have no redress.  This complaint by the unions will not go away and if it cannot be remedied by democratic means the trade unions will have to find some other way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has not been one extra job created by the youth employment levy and next year we will be back with unemployment still continuing to rise.  The money being used for youth employment is being wasted.  Those of us who are members of <Col N="2512" /> local authorities can see how it can be wasted in badly organised environmental schemes.  This proposal is not on behalf of the ITGWU who have sponsored resolutions. It reflects the view of the entire trade union movement.  This 1 per cent levy was supposed to be temporary when it was introduced by the previous Government and the people should be told when it will be abolished.  Trade unionists have to carry additional burdens as well as the 1 per cent levy and I ask the Minister when the levy will be taken away.  The proposal now being discussed represents the views of the entire trade union movement, and the Dáil had better listen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this levy was supposed to be a purely temporary measure when it was introduced and we should be told when it will be taken away. I agree that the 1 per cent which was designed for youth employment activities was supposed to yield £77 million, but only £12 million can be accounted for. People have been asking about the other £65 million.  The committees in the youth employment area were in existence already so that must be some advantage to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be seen as bashing farmers but a farmer with 80 acres of land and 165 cattle legitimately can hand the land over to his son and qualify for a medical card at the expense of the State while old age pensioners who are paying the 1 per cent levy cannot get medical cards.  These are the complaints I am getting in my clinics.  People are saying that equity must be restored, but this year the Minister is concentrating on closing the gap in regard to tax avoidance and tax evasion and we have been told that next year an attempt will be made to restore equity in the tax system.  The protests have been by PAYE workers to remedy what they see as an inequity.</P>
      <P>In 1979 the farmers threatened to take illegal action rather than pay the 2 per cent resource levy.  I listened to farmers' leaders urging their members not to pay the 2 per cent levy but rather to take illegal action.  Now we want to know how long this levy will be continued.</P>

      <P>The yield from the levy this year will be £47 million and in a full year it will be £80 million.  If that revenue were to be raised by other means it would mean a 5 per cent surcharge on the present standard and higher rates of income tax, or 4.5 per cent on all rates, or a reduction in personal allowances of £360 for married people, £237 for a widowed person and £158 for a single person, or some combination of all.  It is my intention on Report Stage to table amendments to sections 17, 18 and 46.</P>

      <P>That is not very reassuring. On section 47, we have a whole range of them that we will deal with quickly.  I am not opposing any of these. I want information.  Section 47 is the section that imposes new fees in relation to foreign travel.  The point I want to make may not be immediately relevant but I would like some information because it will affect our tourism trade in so far as we are voting very small increases by way of tariffs on foreign travel.  It will be nothing by comparison with the impact of the actions taken by the French Government recently to restrict travel out of France to other member states of the European Community which will be damaging to this country and others like it, as has been proved already, but also may well be contrary to the terms of the Treaty of Rome.  I would ask the Minister, <Col N="2520" /> arising out of what we are doing here, what actions, if any, what consultations, if any, and what proposals, if any, the Government have taken up with the French Government or the EEC authorities to minimise the impact of what the French Government propose.</P>

      <P>Briefly, I would ask the Minister to consider exempting persons who travel to places of pilgrimage, especially persons who are invalided and who through no fault of their own cannot pay their own expenses.  There are many people who travel to such places and special consideration should be given to that kind of case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be a problem in defining who was helping whom in this situation.  One would need to be very careful in defining the exemptions if one were not to find oneself in an inoperable situation.  In view of Deputy Doyle's representations in the matter here I will ask the Minister for Finance to examine this matter carefully.  I could say with almost certitude that it will not be possible for him to do anything about Deputy Doyle's representations in this Finance Bill.  It is something which could be looked at next year but I would not like to hold out any hope in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised a question in regard to our attitude to the decisions taken by the French Government.  I would say that those decisions are highly regrettable as one of the essential elements of the European Community and, indeed, of the movement towards European unity is the free movement of persons as Deputy O'Kennedy, in particular, in this House, will appreciate and, naturally, <Col N="2521" /> any monetary restriction on free movement is regrettable.</P>
    <P>However, one must at the same time appreciate the context within which these measures were taken.  The French Government introduced these measures as part of an austerity programme designed to bring the performance of their economy more in line with that of the other partner members of the European Monetary System and indeed it is clear that the French authorities have a commitment to remain within the European Monetary System and to continue to work with their partners in Europe towards the improved joint performance of the European Community and in that context given that the object of the austerity programme of which this is just a part, one would perhaps look somewhat less criticially on these measures than one would look at them if they were taken entirely in isolation from the programme of economic austerity adopted in France to enable the French economy to converge more fully in its performance with the other partner members of the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to my question.  If we were to adopt the precedent adopted by the French Government we might here in section 47 be taking very much more stringent actions than we are taking now.  Our currency too has, in fact been subjected to a lot of pressure to the extent that we had to devalue within the EMS.  We have been hearing from the Minister's colleague, who has left us for the moment, of the need for very strong actions here, more stringent actions, giving rise to unprecedented tax impositions such as the extra 1 per cent levy we have just voted on.  That being so, the Government might have considered taking similar actions.  I really want to ask the Minister if, in view <Col N="2522" /> of the regret he has expressed about the French action, he is advocating that the end justifies the means in so far as the French economy needs to be corrected for so many reasons?  If I have not misunderstood him, the Minister appears to accept that what would otherwise be unacceptable may now be acceptable. Have the Government made any specific approach, protest or request to the French Government or the EEC authorities to ensure that the actions taken by the French Government, which will have a very damaging effect on our tourism, are not contrary to the EEC treaty?  Has the Minister taken any such action, or does he propose to take any such action?</P>

      <P>In support of Deputy Doyle's plea for pilgrims, I have also written to the Minister, about this and an allied problem which is that the passport fee for these pilgrims has been raised to £30.  This is a very substantial imposition on these people, some of whom are travelling for the last time with terminal illnesses.  Without loss to the Exchequer, a passport could be made available in such cases for one year for £6, which would be less of a burden on these people.</P>

      <P>Could I make a brief point about some people who are perhaps not as numerous as pilgrims &mdash; people who must travel abroad in order to get jobs and link up with ships and so forth? I have received a number of representations in this connection.  These people also have to pay the travel levy and does the Minister intend offering any relief or refund for this category of traveller?</P>

      <P>The travel levy itself is not very significant financially, given the overall cost of travel.  Serious administrative problems would result from the introduction of exemptions of the type mentioned by the Deputy.  One would have to inquire as to the motivation for a trip.  Nothing would be immediately obvious from the appearance of the person presenting himself to buy the ticket <Col N="2523" /> or from any other external sign as to the motive in making the trip.  However, we should seek more employment in the type of industry which the Deputy has in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make some comments on this section and also on <Col N="2525" /> section 49, even though the sections will have to be put separately.  Here we are dealing with something of considerable interest.  Firstly, the traders engaged in electrical and allied activities in this State with regard to television sets and video players will, as a result in particular of the increased licence fees proposed here, suffer a serious impact on their business. The licences range from £78 for colour television sets not exceeding 17 inches to £121 for those exceeding 24 inches and similarly for video players.  In fact, the fee for the videos has increased by 100 per cent, from £20 to £40.  In addition the levels of VAT are such as almost to wipe out the electrical and allied trades here in Dublin, certainly between Dublin and the Border.  I have received direct representations over a period of months in this regard.  The Minister will probably know that many of the traders engaged in this business in the city of Dublin are now on a three-day week.  Most have shed staff and, significantly, this is happening despite recent devaluation and the advantage which that would normally give to shoppers to come South from the North, as distinct from what is happening at the moment, people going northwards from the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About two years ago Deputies travelled North on the occasion of a by-election unfortunately and sadly called because of the death of our colleague, the late Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Joe Brennan, and ironically one noted the difference when one went back during the by-election caused recently by the unfortunate death of another esteemed colleague, Deputy Clement Coughlan. Over two years ago, the towns on this side of the Border were enjoying what even they recognised as a bonanza. Almost all the trade across the Border was from North to South in those days. The Ceann Comhairle, being himself from a Border county, will recall that period.  The ratio between our pound and sterling is almost exactly the same now as then, but what has happened in the meantime? Allowing that the depreciation in our currency against sterling should normally be a major impetus to shoppers to come South, the level of increase in the <Col N="2526" /> licence fees, together with VAT and, of course, the price of petrol which we may or may not get to in this debate, are such as to make it much more attractive to go North for one's shopping.  Our newspapers have been advertising what they up to recently called spring fever.  We were talking on the last section about full pages in the newspapers urging shoppers to go North and buy, in Jonesboro, Newry, Belfast and elsewhere, items which otherwise might have been purchased in this jurisdiction.  This is money lost to the Revenue.  But the spring fever has developed a stage further and we now have a situation of summer madness.  The madness is on the part of the Government who have brought about a situation in which the differences between the levels of taxes &mdash; VAT, licence fees and so on &mdash; are such that, even allowing for the differential in currencies, it is still worthwhile to go North and to buy in a big way.  The tragedy is that this is causing great damage to the traders down here and to the employees, many of whom have been let off.  I am sure the Minister will be aware of this as a result of representations made to him.  Approximately 30 per cent of the staffs in these trades in Dublin have been laid off.</P>
    <P>We were talking a moment ago about pilgrimages.  We now have a new type of pilgrimage but it is not to Knock or to Lourdes or any other holy place.  This new pilgrimage is to the various shopping centres in the North.  If there is one growth area at the moment it is in the transportation of bus loads of shoppers every day of the week to the North.  We asked the Government long ago to recognise the impact their actions are having on Border traders particularly.  Deputy Wilson, who represents a Border area, is very conscious of that impact.  The items that are being purchased there mostly are televisions and videos.  There is another side to this.  Because of the increasing unemployment here people are getting lump sums and have the means of buying colour televisions or videos.  They are in a position to shop around for the best bargains.  If they can buy a colour television in Northern Ireland for £100 less than the price here there is bound to be <Col N="2527" /> a great temptation for them to buy in the North.  Any dealer in this line between here and the Border can verify this.  The only customers these dealers have are those who can buy only on long-term credit facilities.  I do not wish to appear to be saying that what the people with cash in their fists are doing is commendable. It is not.  But there is a great incentive for them to travel North to make their purchases.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly this section, too, will be passed.  There is no point in our opposing it.  The numbers are against us.  The Minister present, who is concerned particularly with employment and with industrial activity, should make every effort to impress on the Minister for Finance the seriousness of the situation and to make him realise that he has gone too far.  But the Minister for Finance may well recognise that the bouyancy that most of us as Ministers for Finance looked to has been cancelled in areas such as the one we are speaking of.  The level of revenue expected from these provisions is likely to be less than the level the Minister budgeted for at the beginning.  This is simply because the trade cannot take any more.  The customer is not interested and Her Majesty's Revenue, about which presumably we are not too concerned, are getting the benefit.  It is time we began to review our position.</P>

      <P>Regarding section 48, there is a lot of difficulty in this area.  It is regrettable that instead of putting excise duty on videos we are not licensing them.  Both sections 48 and 49 could be taken together.  If the levy were used as a licence fee there would be greater control in regard to pirate videos, a practice that is taking from people in genuine employment in the entertainment industry. In addition this might go some way towards preventing the number of break-ins to houses for the purpose of stealing videos.  It would contribute significantly to stabilising employment in the entertainment industry, particularly <Col N="2529" /> in cinemas &mdash; an area in which, I am glad to say, there has been some pick up &mdash; but there is a big black market in pirate videos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to stress the problems that the increased excise duty on televisions, radios and videos has caused in so far as traders in the Border areas are concerned.  I know that the Chair is rootless and without nation but, if I might extract him from his office as Ceann Comhairle, he knows that what I am saying is true.  It is very serious from the employment point of view.  It is also very serious from the point of view of people who have invested heavily in their businesses. This has happened right along the Border from the studies we have made, from the information we have got and from the representations made to us.</P>
      <P>This, coupled with what is happening in the construction industry in the area, has brought a degree of economic distress. I suggested in the House as a remedy that some financial mechanism should be developed.  I suggested to the Minister for Finance that some form of MCA could be brought into play in the area which would help to balance it up. He said the monetary compensatory amounts were brought to bear on wholesale prices and this would be difficult.</P>
      <P>It would not be beyond the wit of the officials of the Department of Finance to think up some mechanism whereby the inequities of the present system could be ironed out in some way.  Admittedly some people say that at one stage the advantage was in the South and nobody was complaining.  Now the advantage is in the North and people are going into the markets, some of them ad hoc markets set up along the side of the road which I saw myself recently between Swanlinbar and Enniskillen.  We are a little too pacific in that whole area.  We are not shouting enough.  If we had the push and drive of the Corkmen, more attention would be paid to us along the Border.</P>

It is there, and we have to live with it.  It is impacting on our business people and on our employment situation and carries with it, as the House knows, other difficulties.</P>
      <P>I was looking at the May <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> casually today and I noticed that excise is down.  What the Minister has done has damaged himself as well.  It may be because of the drink or because of the objects we are talking about here.  I put it to the House and to the Minister that there is a need for a special study of the economic problems of that area.  I have spoken about this already in the House &mdash; not the problems of the whole of the Six Counties <i>vis-à-vis</i> the whole of the Twenty-six Counties, but the actual problems of the actual trader or construction man on the ground in the crescent from Dundalk to Lifford.</P>

The Government should make an all-out effort to provide customs officials, and amount of money allowed to be spent on purchases in the North should be strictly adhered to.  In the Border counties, around Meath, north Meath and Drogheda, I get complaints about bus loads of people going across the Border to shop.  The Government should take action.

I would be interested to hear the views of any Deputy in the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party on the introduction of a wealth tax.</P>
      <P>In a reply to a parliamentary question on 1 March 1983 it was pointed out that the amount of tax paid on inheritances and gifts had fallen in constant prices from £8.6 million in 1972-73 to £2.1 million in 1982.  As a percentage of total capital taxes, taxes on inheritances and gifts had fallen from 1.9 per cent in 1972-73 to .3 per cent in 1982.  There is a significant drop in the amount of tax being collected from those who have wealth.  We put down an amendment seeking to have wealth tax introduced which, in our estimate, could bring in in the region of £80 million?</P>

      <P>To be quite honest I am not sure which of these sections relating to value-added tax I should be making my comments on.  But I would ask the Minister to consider the situation relating to VAT as paid by local authorities to contractors for the supply of materials which, under this new Bill, will be 5 per cent.  I understand that if the council buy material to carry out the work themselves they pay 25 per cent.  As I understand it anyway this results in work by local authorities &mdash; carried out by direct labour &mdash; being more expensive than if they had it done by private contractors.  I have been told that in some cases this can result &mdash; as, say, in the building of houses by direct labour &mdash; a difference of £3,000, that it can cost a local authority £3,000 <Col N="2537" /> more to build by direct labour because of the VAT difference than if they hired a contractor to do it.  I understand that up to 1978 it was possible for local authorities to reclaim the VAT involved but that, since then, they have not been able to do so.  Could the Minister comment on that anomaly and say whether he intends doing something about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the value-added-tax is levied on a different commodity in the case of something being purchased from a contractor.  In that case the value-added-tax is being levied both on the labour content and the materials content of the service provided by the external building contractor to the local authority, whereas, in the case of the local authority buying materials which they use direct labour to turn into a service &mdash; a building service or roadbuilding service &mdash; the value-added-tax is levied only on the material part of the total cost, not on the labour and material cost.  Therefore, while there is a different rate, as the Deputy said, one must realise that one is not comparing exactly like with like.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which reduces the annual turnover limits for registration, as far as I can see, for deepsea fishermen from £15,000 to £12,000 &mdash; this is compulsory registration for value-added-tax.  For businesses consisting of not less than 90 per cent of sale of taxable goods from £30,000 to £25,000; for a general trader and professional it is reduced from £15,000 to £12,000 and in respect of horse trainer and farmer from £15,000 to £12,000.  We are opposed to this section.  I would hope the Minister would be able to indicate to us why it is felt necessary to introduce it at this stage. Most of us here will have had experience of small traders who, even now, are registered <Col N="2538" /> for value-added-tax of the order of £15,000.  Many of them find it next to impossible to cope with the complexities of the value-added system, as it applies to them.  Of course it will become more complex with the higher rates of VAT that will apply after the passage of this Bill, which we are also opposing in the next section.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that many Deputies here really have had direct experience of small traders in every town and village of the country getting into a situation of nervous tension.  I have met some cases that went way beyond nervous tension because they were unable to cope with the system.  Many of them are small, corner shopkeepers, widows and people like that &mdash; without getting too emotive about it &mdash; who are very conscientious types, who want to be able to cope with the complexities and discharge their responsibilities.  Some of them who have been included hitherto have found it impossible to do so.  I can think immediately of two people who have gone out of business rather than face the tension and complexities of it because they are small traders.  Let me say also &mdash; so that this will not seem to be political; although I suppose it is understandable that we do make political points from time to time &mdash; this happened during our time in Government, as I am quite sure it happens now, and some of these representations were made to me during that time. This is why I ask the Minister to resist the temptation to reduce further the liability for compulsory registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider a trader who has a turnover of £12,000.  The markup in some sectors such as the grocery trade is only about 10 per cent because small traders are trying to compete with supermarkets. To retain their customers they have to give credit facilities.  I have personal experience in this matter because I come from such a background.  I am not making a personal case for my mother but I know the scene fairly well.  Many of these traders are staying in business for the sake of being gainfully occupied and perhaps in order to maintain a level of social contact. The small shopkeeper is an important social element in our cities and towns. <Col N="2539" /> We are proposing to make people with a turnover of £12,000 liable for compulsory registration, thus reducing the figure from £15,000.  A turnover of £12,000 would mean a gross profit of about £1,200 which, having regard to the provision of the income tax code, puts them well below the exemption limit for tax.</P>
    <P>I would ask whether there is any reason for distinguishing between those who must register and those who need not. What kind of business would have a turnover of less than £12,000?  Who could run a business of that kind?  I would have thought that £15,000 was the smallest possible.  Are we seriously implying that there is fraud because some of these people are not registered?  There was a good reason at the time for not having compulsory registration.  They paid VAT at source.  To oblige traders like this to keep accounts for registration purposes will cause intolerable hardship to many. If the Minister can give a good reason for this measure we will listen.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for the introduction of a simplified form for small traders, as for farmers who are being brought into the tax net for the first time. There is also much to be said for showing a special degree of tolerance and understanding for old ladies behind their counters who live in dread of anyone coming to them from any establishment, particularly the Revenue Commissioners. They may not always be precise and give accurate information and they may not always be able to satisfy an inspector from the VAT division.  I hope that none of them would come under the section dealing with late appeals because if they were assessed on such a basis they could not cope.</P>
    <P>We are reducing the already low figure of £15,000 to £12,000 but I would have thought that because of inflation it should have been increased somewhat to ensure that we are applying the obligation of compulsory registration to the same category of people as we originally had in mind when introducing the regulation.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The same would apply regarding deep <Col N="2540" /> sea fishermen, although I have not had the same experience in this matter as others.  I would think that turnover in that business is not an accurate reflection of income and I would imagine that a deep sea fisherman with a turnover of £12,000 would not be engaged in a very major operation.</P>

      <P>There are not too many deep sea fishermen in Dublin <Col N="2541" /> South-Central but there are a few deep Liffey and deep Grand Canal fishermen. I appreciate the difficulties nevertheless, because this not only affects deep sea fishermen but quite a lot of other people as well.  I do not know the purpose of this section and perhaps the Minister could give some explanation as to why it is felt necessary to introduce it.  In terms of revenue it will mean to the State the difference between the sales tax and the input of purchase tax.  It will be a tax on the value added and I do not think that will bring in a great amount of money.  It will assist in defeating tax evasion because if people are registered for VAT there is a record of their turnover and their incomes can be more accurately estimated.  It might be of some benefit in regard to tax evasion.  I cannot see what other benefits there can be.  If the attraction is the record of income, perhaps the Minister would give some thought to zero rating of small traders or traders under a certain limit as outlined here.</P>
      <P>Before I came into this House I made a good living from looking after small business people who could not manage their books.  Some people may find it very difficult to believe but there are people who get positively into bad health when they get these demands.  Some become almost suicidal.  If you are a small trader turning over £15,000 in a year, you have purchases out of that, you have overheads out of that, you have very little income and very little to spare to make your business viable and make a living after a hard day's work without having to worry about all the paper work.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I discovered there were at least a dozen different documents a person could get.  I agree everybody should contribute but a great deal of what may look good on paper is really only giving a great many people unnecessary headaches. I do not know how many have a turnover of £100,000.  Even with that turnover their income or profit must be very small indeed.  It is nonsense to ask those people to sit down and make VAT returns when they do not know how to fill in these returns and must employ someone to do it for them and, having done that, they get no compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2542" /> This is an additional burden and many of them are so small they cannot afford to shoulder the burden.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should consider making arrangements in the VAT office to enable small traders who cannot afford to employ tax consultants or accountants to get assistance in making out these returns.  Everyone who thinks of business people immediately visualises accountants and staff at their disposal, but there are many who would not have facilities of that kind.  The small shopkeeper would not have such a facility; neither would the carpenter or the tradesman.  Those do not know the first thing about bookkeeping or advice notes or anything else. People simply do not understand these things and unfortunately those responsible for bringing about this situation are apparently ignorant of the facts.  Many of these people work seven days a week. They do not have pensions, or sickness benefit, or unemployment benefit, or anything like that.  They are on the lowest rung as it were.  Even if they have 30 per cent of the market they have less than £100 a week.  It may be only £90 a week. Could there be any PAYE contributor in that category?  Nobody wants to be unfair or unreasonable but before introducing a draconian section like this we should be absolutely certain there are good sound reasons for its introduction.  Those below a certain income should be zero-rated.</P>

      <P>We are opposed to this section.  I have had experience of dealing with traders in the £15,000 and £30,000 turnover bracket.  The vast majority with groceries would be zero-rated.  They do not work a five-day week from nine to five.  They keep open until 10 o'clock at night and they do not have time to make out returns.  Reducing the limit from £15,000 to £12,000 is a retrograde step. Instead of reducing the limit we should be raising it.  These people are giving a good service and they cannot achieve a decent standard of living.  I cannot see any reason for this section.  What will the anticipated return be?  It is inconceivable that the Minister should even think of putting an extra burden on these people. <Col N="2543" /> I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to see any justice in this section.  Small shopkeepers are diminishing in numbers.  They are being submerged by the conglomerates and the supermarkets.  Those that remain are barely eking out a living.  Indeed, they live in very frugal circumstances.  It is only a few years ago when our shopkeepers kept the country going during the bank strikes.  They could not give today the service they gave then because they could not cash cheques having no real turnover.  I know the Minister is called &ldquo;Iron Dukes&rdquo; and, if he had any compassion, he would not introduce this section. In the circumstances credence is given to the sobriquet.  Why should this group be so harassed?  In my constituency some time ago two very small shopkeepers, widows, were prosecuted by the Department for overcharging by ½p on a particular item.  Here it is proposed to put yet another imposition on their backs.  We shall certainly have to oppose this section.</P>

In the last few weeks we have had the situation of the repossession of the fishermens' boats. Over the past number of years people have been aware of the difficulties experienced by the industry generally. The difficulties have been highlighted on occasions.  This further imposition will add to the existing difficulties.  There are threats to fishing stocks.  There are threats from foreign fleets invading our shores.  Our fishermen have enough worries without being saddled with this additional burden.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell about the amount of documentation and paperwork involved.  Fishermen have not the time to be involved in paperwork like this.  They must be out involved in their business.  I would like to know the kind of revenue the Minister is talking about here.  What kind of revenue did he <Col N="2544" /> get last year?  The Minister should keep in mind the very critical situation of the industry.</P>

      <P>It seems extraordinary that the Minister would go to so much trouble to include a section such as this.  He must have very compelling reasons.  Of course he is not at all concerned with the business with a turnover of £12,000.  He is concerned to include a few extra traders. We are talking about a turnover of about £33 a day which would yield a profit of about £3 a day.  This will certainly not provide the Minister with any extra revenue and unless he has a very convincing argument it would be hard to give him this provision without a struggle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you bring people into the tax net you condemn them to seek outside help. Most of these people do their buying on a cash basis in the cash and carries.  They pay their VAT at that point and then proceed to make a very small profit.  If they must see an accountant it will cost them some hundreds per year so the Minister is virtually condemning them to be put out of business.  Most of the goods disposed of throughout these outlets are zero-rated anyhow so there is a very small amount of money to accrue to the Exchequer but a very big outlay for the person who will be making the return because he will have to have the services of an accountant or some trained person. I cannot see what great advantage there is in this except that the Minister wants to get the last penny from the last trader. He seems to have brought about a situation where everybody will have to register for tax irrespective of turnover.  If he <Col N="2545" /> had stated that we could have opposed it straightaway.</P>

      <P>I want to bring something to the Minister's attention.  I am not blaming the Minister but I certainly am blaming some of the officials in the Department of Finance.  I represent a county which has a good number of small traders and as a TD and a councillor I have been dealing with some of these small traders who got what I would call lunatic tax bills.  Some people get into Government jobs and then look down their noses at the ordinary public.  I know the Department of Finance and not the Minister put small traders out of business in my county because of their arrogant approach in regard to VAT returns and tax returns.  That is a statement of fact and the Minister had better be aware that I am letting him know publicly in this House.  I am also disgusted because some small business people come to me because people in the Department of Finance close their eyes, think of a figure and send that out as an assessment.  They should not be allowed to get away with it.  I see some of the officials smiling but they are Government officials paid by the taxpayers of this country.  They should not set themselves up as high kings of Ireland and look down their noses at the ordinary taxpayer.  The Department of Finance and particularly the tax office leave a lot to be desired.  I must have sent hundreds of tax-free allowance certificates back this year which had to go through the Minister because if I wrote direct to the tax office it would take months to get a reply.  Some of them had no PAYE allowance on them.  Some of them had no PRSI allowance on them. There are 310,000 people in the public sector.  We have a very large civil service. The press say that we are paid to legislate but there are a lot of people who, if they did not come to a TD when they found that their tax free allowances were down £12 and £15 a week, would not know the reasons for it.  It is time the Minister was made aware of this.  There are friends of mine who had a small busines.  They just closed it up because of the arrogant attitude of tax officials and inspectors.</P>

      <P>The Opposition seem to be so concerned with making this kind of noise that very little attention is being given to another part of the problem which I am sure they must have met. Kildare is quite an exceptional place but it cannot be that exceptional.  I am referring to the problem of traders and business people who are encountering serious difficulty in the running of their businesses because they are suffering from competition from people who are not registered for VAT.  There is a problem. I would invite the Deputies opposite to think about that.  I would mention the motor sector, for example.  We have taken specific action there to deal with the problem.  In the hotels section we have again taken action.  A substantial part of the difficulty arises from the fact that we have people registered for VAT and they are competing with people who are not registered.  It is very difficult to find a perfect solution to the problem of setting annual turnover threshold limits for VAT registration.  If the limits are set too low we will be using scarce resources chasing very small tax payments and very small businesses will be brought into the net and will have to comply with the requirement to keep accounts.  If the limit is set too high, medium sized businesses will find themselves increasingly unable to compete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is running a very effective interference but he is paying so much attention to running the interference that he is not thinking about the problems.  We could lose the security that arises from the operation of this system. The thresholds were introduced in <Col N="2547" /> 1981 and since then VAT rates have increased, and that means that the amount of tax that does not come into the system because of the fixing of the limits has increased in amount.  The limits are now too high because of the absolute amount involved here.</P>
      <P>I have had representations from all sorts of businesses, hairdressers, dental mechanics, garages and others who made the point that people who are over the existing limit are finding it difficult to compete.  That is why I put forward the provision which restores the real level of tax to what it was in 1981.  Deputies have been jumping in at the deep end and have overlooked that there are the £12,000 limit applying to services and the £25,000 limit applying to people selling goods. Service businesses are not buying inputs so they have no substantial amounts of VAT on inputs and the VAT on their output is fairly level.  Most of those who are selling goods pay VAT when they are buying them.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances registration is a means of insuring that the business itself does not bear a net amount of VAT, which is a consumer tax, and that is why we offset outputs and inputs.  Our limits at the moment are among the highest in Europe.  That should indicate to Deputy M. Ahern why we have those provisions. We have a responsibility to the people who are now suffering.  Many traders all over the country are not registered and that is why we should be very conscious about the people who are suffering from that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should have another look.  There are many people in trades and professions to whom registration would be a benefit.  Deep-sea fishermen are among them.  People in agriculture would find registration an advantage.  No fisherman is obliged to register unless he has turnover from other activities.  Deputy Flynn asked why we have not brought everyone in.  He came <Col N="2548" /> near to expressing the ideal position and perhaps he is to be congratulated on it.</P>
      <P>The effect of the measure that is being proposed would be to bring about 300 traders into the register and the revenue will not be of great budgetary advantage this year because the time when the revenue will come in will be in July, August, September and October.  The November-December VAT will not come until early next year.  Therefore, the revenue income this year will be negligible but the effect on the competitiveness of a number of businesses will be fairly substantial.</P>

I remember very clearly a visit I had some weeks ago from a deputation of hairdressers whose only concern was to impress upon me the absolute necessity of ensuring that the nine or ten other hairdressers in their town who were below the current VAT registration limit should be brought into the system so that they could all compete on an equal basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an amendment down and I want clarification on the categories affected in the subparagraphs.  As I understand it, category one refers to deep-sea fishermen; category two refers to business consisting of not less than 90 per cent of sale of taxable goods, reduced from £30,000 to £25,000; and category three refers to general traders and professionals, reduced from £15,000 to £12,000.  It is category three that many of us are making an argument on.  I presume &ldquo;general trader&rdquo; covers what might be loosely called the small shopkeeper.  If I am wrong perhaps the Minister would say who precisely is covered by that definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to special cases, such as hairdressers.  Hairdressers are obviously in a different category from small traders.  If it is necessary to make an amendment to include such services, it should be possible to do that without affecting all other categories.  There may be, as the Minister pointed out, a valid case for dealing with special categories, <Col N="2550" /> but I cannot imagine hairdressers and small traders in the same category for VAT registration purposes.  If that is the case, why should the Minister not reduce the compulsory registration limit in the case of small traders.</P>
    <P>Most small traders pay their VAT at the cash-and-carry and I do not think they have any competitive advantage over those who are registered whether they are supermarkets or other concerns which might have a higher level of turnover. I realise the Minister would not want to be misunderstood as implying that small traders who are not registered but who pay their VAT at the wholesale outlet level have a competitive advantage. They conform with all the standards and meet the requirements of the law.  I would like clarification of that point.</P>
    <P>For once it seems we are not caught in a straitjacket in discussing this amendment. The Minister has indicated that the revenue involved this year will be virtually nil and that next year it will not even be quantifiable.  One can understand this.  In this case the Minister will be concerned with equity and balanced treatment for the people in the same category. One can support him in that.  If that is the case, why is it necessary to extend this to small traders?  Many of these small traders, single people or widows, are not able to cope with this kind of thing and registration will pose terrible problems for them.  Anything the Minister can do to alleviate that burden will be appreciated.  We are not anxious to give any group an advantage over another group providing the same service.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on another point.  We had an amendment down to section 18 to include those engaged in smuggling, especially drugs.  Smugglers have a very definite competitive advantage over bona fide traders against whom they are competing. Has the Minister considered applying VAT as well as income tax and corporation profits tax to those engaged in smuggling?  He will not find anyone bleeding with sympathy for that group.  If he could do anything in this area he will have our support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order: I <Col N="2551" /> thought Deputy O'Kennedy wanted to ask a brief question and I yielded to him. The point I wanted to make was as important as the point he made.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the small trader. Some time ago I made representations to the Minister to increase this figure to keep it in line with inflation.  I made those representations as a result of the pleadings by many small traders and people who felt particularly vulnerable because of the demand to keep these accounts and have the figures available for the inspectors.  If the Minister could not do better than his predecessors so far as the rate of inflation is concerned, he could have left it alone and time would have looked after it.</P>
      <P>What happened is the Department advised him to respond to pressures from people who have to make returns while others do not.  Surely the people who cannot get their interest above this limit do not present a significant threat.  In my view we are responding to the politics of jealousy and cut-throat competition by people who have no regard for the social consequences of what they are doing. Even if it were only for the sake of a few vulnerable and ageing small traders who want to live out their lives as they have always done, he should have left things as they were.</P>
      <P>These pressure groups asked me to do something about the hawkers because the hawkers had advantages.  We brought in legislation and restricted the hawkers. Then they wanted the supermarkets restricted through various mechanisms. Before we introduce legislation we must be convinced that those advantages are real and that complaints made are well founded.  We should not introduce legislation in response to imagined grievances. I accept the Minister's point in relation to the services area, particularly in relation to hairdressing, but as far as the small traders are concerned the Minister might have waited and allowed inflation to take care of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not intend letting the Minister off the hook in relation to deep-sea fishermen.  The Minister <Col N="2552" /> feels that this will assist the fishermen. The Minister may take it from me that this will create hardships and problems for fishermen and that group between the £12,000 and £15,000 brackets who were not familiar with this system.  They are being thrown in at the deep end.  I would ask the Minister to be magnanimous in this and not to look for an outright victory through the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Many fishermen are in dire straits at the moment.  We are trying to encourage people to stay in the industry but this provision will act as a disincentive to fishermen. Will the Minister explain how this will help the fishermen?  If the Minister would exempt the fishermen it would be of help to them and the Minister could perhaps introduce this provision at some later stage.  The 1 per cent which operated in the past and which the fishermen could claim back on their turnover as a result of not being registered for VAT compensated them and they were satisfied with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how to put across the point about the public service without it being seen as an attack on them.  This is meant to be only a constructive criticism.  The difference between the public service and the people with a small turnover to whom I refer is one of security.  Insecurity is a great pressure and people involved in a small business are pressurised into working long hours to keep the job going without having the additional pressures of having to keep books and register for turnover. That total insecurity of people outside of the public service is not recognised by people in secure jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is right in saying that we tended to deal with the £15,000 limit reduced to £12,000 for services rather than dealing with the £35,000 limit reduced to £25,000 for the sale of goods. The fishermen referred to by Deputy Gallagher in the £12,000 to £15,000 limit will not be affected by the reduction in the services limit.  However, some people who would come under this new £12,000 services limit could end up with less than £90 per week even though their turnover would be £12,000.  By the time they paid <Col N="2553" /> their overheads it is conceivable that these people would have less than 40 per cent of the total for income.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a good point with regard to people who are not registered and who carry on trades as against the difficulties experienced by legitimate traders.  I would ask that this be reviewed because if this provision does not function as it is intended to function we might at a future date have to repeal it.</P>

      <P>For those who are providing services there is a smaller input in regard to their items subject to VAT than there is for those who are selling goods because their purchases would normally relate to labour.  Most of their bills would <Col N="2554" /> be labour bills.  The person selling goods is paying VAT as an input tax on a bigger proportion of the value of his total turnover than somebody providing a service. That is the distinction between the two categories.  Deputy O'Kennedy has accepted the point I made in relation to the competition aspect.</P>

Apart from the fact that we have customs law to deal with illegal traders, the question of taxing illegal profits is a different one from collecting VAT on the illegal sale of goods. Almost by definition one will not get the kind of accounts from those people that would allow us to get the VAT.  If we could get the VAT they would not be involved in illegal activity because they would be under control and by definition the application of VAT to the system would take away a lot of the incentive to trade illegally.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gallagher made a point about fishermen.  Fishermen are not obliged to register for purely fishing activities. To the extent that they are paying VAT on equipment or input, we have arrangements for repayment of the VAT which they pay on their equipment.  Their greatest problem will be with fuel oil and we have an arrangement to meet that problem.  There is no obligation on fishermen, whatever their turnover on fishing activities, to register unless they have another activity which brings them into the registration limit.  However, that is a different matter.  Only if they had a turnover from another activity which came up to the limit for that activity would they be obliged to register, not for the fishing activities <i>per se.</i>  There is a difference between those activities and the other economic activities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell asked, in view of what I said earlier, if the limit could be reviewed at a future point.  Limits obviously, of their nature, should be reviewed from time to time.  We have reviewed them this year for a particular reason and I could not exclude for a moment the possibility of their being reviewed in the future, depending on what we find to the the effect of the new limits and the effect of the operation of the VAT rates on different kinds of activity, as we move on through time.</P>
      <P>The change in VAT rates since 1981, given our limits, has perhaps exacerbated a number of existing problems.  That is why we are making this change.</P>

      <P>Anything which he has to say in this connection has not been with a view to hurting the public services <Col N="2557" /> but, as we are trying to do here, representing the interests of small traders.  The Minister has understandably, by definition, said that if we knew the turnover of these people, meaning those engaged in illegal trading, they would not be illegal. The question of trying to impose VAT on illegal trade has a certain anomaly. If we knew what these people were earning, they would be in business and would probably not be illegally trading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is happy enough to smile, but he would not know enough about them to assess their liability for income tax and corporation tax, as the case may be.  I can see certain problems arising there.  Can one do it on the one hand in respect of income tax and corporation tax, but not in respect of VAT?  The Minister might explain that to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this discussion has come up.  I know that Deputy O'Kennedy had been anxious to say a word or two on section 18, as I was indeed myself.  There is a difficulty in knowing the extent of illegal profits.  The purpose of section 18 is to make it possible for us to make an assessment on the basis of what may be illegal profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>May be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Consider in section 18 how <Col N="2558" /> we approach that definition.  We have the concept of other miscellaneous income there, also.  It is for the very reason that the Deputy is talking about.  Section 18 is concerned with giving us statutory powers to do that, once we find that somebody has an illegal income or an unexplainable income.  In order to succeed we need some of the other provisions in this Bill which give certain powers to the revenue authorities to inquire from people where they got the income.  That poses a separate kind of question.  That is one kind of operation.  The charging and assessment of people for VAT is a different kind of operation.  That system is for the most part based on self-assessment and it works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Self-assessment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It works on the whole because for somebody who is dealing in goods which are subject to VAT there is an interest for that person in accounting for the VAT which he pays on his inputs and for the VAT which he charges on his outputs so that he, as a trader, will not have to bear any of the weight of the tax, VAT being a consumer tax at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>My point about illegal trading is that much illegal trading arises through people bringing goods illegally into the country in order to avoid paying VAT, for example in order to avoid paying VAT at point of entry, which is one of the legacies which the Fianna Fáil Government have unfortunately left with us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy O'Kennedy, people bring in goods illegally in order to avoid paying VAT.  If we were charging them VAT on the goods they were bringing in, the activity would not be illegal.  The problem of the taxation of illegal profits is totally different from the problem of getting VAT in respect of goods imported.  In most cases, anyway, by the time we detect the existence of illegal profits the goods have been sold.  But it is a matter that I would consider.  If we were to go down that road I wonder, for example, what rate of VAT we would put on heroin but in the nature of the system that does not arise in the same way as the problem of the taxation of illegal profits arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that we are engaging in a battle of one over the other in this case.  On that last admission that the Minister would go down that road if it were feasible, if the Revenue reach the stage of determining the <Col N="2561" /> incomes of people engaged in illegal activities, and that is what is hoped for under section 18&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>And in other sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the selling of illegally imported videos, televisions and so on, they would know also that if these commodities had been disposed of through proper legal channels they would have attracted VAT.  At least this might discourage such people who obviously would have a competitive advantage over bona fide traders.  I am acknowledging that there could be anomalies but in any event we are moving into an anomalous situation.  Basically, we are aiming to discourage illegal activities, to stop them at source and to that end we must take actions that are rather unusual but I do not see why we should dismiss the possibility of applying a VAT charge once the income of the person smuggling videos and televisions and then selling them has been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we should not spend too much time on this.  I would make the point, though, that it is one matter to establish that someone had a given amount of income apparently from illegal sources but it is another matter to establish the amount of business involved.  If we catch them with the goods, the point of the operation is to prevent them from selling them.  There are provisions in the customs laws for fines and for the confiscation of goods brought in illegally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that in order to have made an income they must have made a sale and having made a sale, they could be liable to VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, the Minister said that this provision will assist fishermen but then went on to say that it will not affect them. Also, in the case, say, of a fisherman who earned £12,000 last year from another business and prior to registration and who earns £12,000 this year, how will the <Col N="2562" /> Minister assist that person if he must become registered?  There seems to be some ambiguity here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is ambiguity.  I made the general remark that in some circumstances registration could be of benefit to a fisherman.  That would be, for example, in the case of making it easier for him to have VAT repaid on his income.  There are people who are not obliged now to register in respect of fishing or farming but who, if operating on an intensive basis, could find that it would be to their advantage to register.  That was the only point I was making in that connection.  I was not saying that the provisions are designed to be of benefit to fishermen in relation to the operation of the VAT system.  My comment was very general and was not meant to be taken as putting pressure on such people to register.</P>
      <P>The second part of the question relates to whether a fisherman has another business, the turnover from which exceeds the new VAT registration limit. That is a different problem.  A business other than fishing to which the £12,000 limit would apply would be totally separate from the fishing activity.  Should that same person have another business to which the £25,000 limit would apply, that too, would be separate from the fishing activity.  The point is that as a fisherman he would not be obliged to register for VAT.  Therefore, the change in the limit would not affect him.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 65:</P>
      <P>In page 58, line 20, to delete &ldquo;23 per cent.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;20 per cent.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>These amendments are designed to propose to the House that the level of increase, as announced by the Minister in the budget, on VAT rates of 5 per cent would be reduced by 3 per cent to allow for an increase of 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>Before we start, might I clear one point again, not wishing to anticipate the Minister's reply but, as has been demonstrated, we are under a disability on this side of the House that we have to accept. We cannot propose to the House &mdash; because of your rulings, a Cheann Comhairle, and not just yours but those of your predecessors &mdash; that we will raise revenue in another direction to compensate for the loss of revenue in this area.  I have to accept your ruling that anything that involves a charge on the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy has addressed that assertion to me a number of times today.  This is in accordance with Standing Orders.  However, if it would be helpful to the Deputy, there is nothing to prevent him making a speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different matter.  I appreciate that.  I had proposals down to raise extra revenue in some places, as had The Workers' Party in regard to other places.  They, like us, have been obliged by the rules of the House to accept that, while we might have ideas as to where extra revenue should be raised and could propose to the House where this should happen to compensate for a loss of revenue in other <Col N="2567" /> sectors, we are not free to do so.  One can say all kinds of things after that but the fact is that, not having the power, the words do not count for very much.  On that basis I simply made a preliminary point that I know that the Minister will be tempted, as he has been already in the debate, in reply to our proposal here to make the point that the Revenue cannot afford the loss which would follow as a consequence of the reductions in the VAT levels we are proposing.  We will not know until the end of the year whose estimates are right in respect of value-added tax receipts.  I have suggested already &mdash; and we do not need to get into a terrible hassle about it now; the end of the year will determine who has been right and who has been wrong in this &mdash; that the Minister's budget estimate for VAT receipts is an underestimation.  I suggest also that this is borne out by the quarterly returns which show, it has to be said, not a buoyancy in VAT revenue &mdash; far from it &mdash; but demonstrate that the Minister's estimate was an underestimation. I am not saying this was deliberate but we disagreed on this from day one in regard to the Minister's Budget Statement and in discussions afterwards.  That being so, the yield to the Revenue which the Minister is estimating is less than it will turn out to be.</P>
      <P>In reply to a written question by me last Tuesday the Minister said that the cost of the reductions I am proposing would be of the order of £100 million in 1983, £80 million by the substitution of 20 per cent for 23 per cent, £12.1 million by the substitution of 32 per cent for 35 per cent and £9 million by the substitution of 18.75 per cent for 21.74 per cent.  These are gross estimates and there would be a level of buoyancy which would emerge as a result of the increase in sales of articles in these categories.  It would be compensated for to a considerable extent by the buoyancy which would emerge with a VAT increase of 2 per cent as against 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give one practical example.  Some time ago during the term of the Minister's predecessor it emerged that domestic pots, pans and teapots which cannot be <Col N="2568" /> categorised as luxury goods were at the highest VAT level.  I made representations to the then Minister to take these items out of that category and the reply I received was that if they were taken out there would also have to be an exemption for items such as knives and forks.  I would support their exemption as well because they are not luxury items in any home.  It also happens that some native industry is very much concerned.  I made a statement of personal interest earlier when I said that I happened to have a very small shareholding worth a couple of hundred pounds in a company in my home place, the aluminium company in Nenagh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>The Deputy should move up country to Newbridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Those records will be on the Minister's files and his advisers will have been aware of the representations I made last year.  I received a promise that this matter would be looked at in the context of this year's budget and Finance Bill.  It touched a chord with the Minister and his officials but I am not aware that anything has been achieved.</P>
      <P>The level of VAT will affect net sales. One would come to the conclusion when listening to Border traders who have come to meet me and the Minister in connection with the impact of VAT on their business that the Revenue were losing a very substantial sum of money.  I do not question their bona fides but on the other hand I cannot give the figures they suggest as being absolutely reliable.  In their view there is a loss to the Revenue of about £25 million.  I cannot vouch for this but it is quite clear that we are losing significantly to our Northern counterparts and to the Minister's counterpart, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain. Sir Geoffrey must be very pleased with us these days in that we are giving a considerable incentive to cross-Border trade.  That would reduce to a considerable extent the global figure of £100 million which the Minister has given but I do not think he has taken it into account in producing these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important element is that <Col N="2569" /> these have an impact on the CPI and the Minister has acknowledged that the impact of indirect tax increases, including VAT, on the CPI will be 3.5 per cent. We have said, with some support from other authorities, that with the roll-on effect it will be about 4 per cent.  That, too, can act in ease of what the Minister is trying to achieve, a reduction of inflation in line with what his predecessors in Government managed to achieve.  From November 1981 to November 1982 there was a reduction from 24 per cent to 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>The level of indirect taxation is such that we have almost reached the point of diminishing returns.  I recall that during my period as Minister for Finance one of the points always borne in mind was that in introducing any increase it was at least as important to bear in mind the point at which one lost the increase in terms of the inflationary impact and the little extra revenue that would accrue.  We have very carefully measured the amounts we feel should be reduced in the Minister's proposals. These amounts were considered in Government by the Minister's predecessors, having regard to what we saw as the needs of the Revenue and the need to keep down inflation.  The Minister may feel he was constrained to take certain actions and if he had been free to take his own decisions he might have acted more on the side of the control of public expenditure than by increasing the level of indirect taxation, which has an undesirable effect on the CPI and shows itself in a range of ways such as high interest rates.  The Taoiseach has said that if interest rates do not come down he will want to know the reason and I wonder if he has inquired as yet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made my point.  In acceding to this request the Minister will not just be giving something away.  I do not expect <Col N="2570" /> as much loss to the Revenue as he suggests. I believe the loss will be considerably less while the return on the other side will be of considerable benefit.  I strongly commend the amendment to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Outside this House there are numbers of business people valiantly striving for survival and I want to bring that home to the Minister.  I know he has the capacity to cope with the situation &mdash; I mean this in all sincerity &mdash; provided he focuses his thoughts in the proper direction.  There are two sides to all this.  The VAT is like a tap one turns on at will.  All the provisions in this Bill are an admission that the taxation system is beginning to creak and we have reached the point where it is just a question of trying to find more money without taking a proper look at the massive public spending that is going on on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister sounds like a long-playing record.  This is a stone-walling exercise.  There is absolutely nothing in it for private enterprise and the Minister's intention is to steamroll through all these provisions without any regard to their consequences on business and on the public generally who have to struggle to keep going.  Business is in a crippled state at the moment.  If the Minister would even give some incentive we might be able to find ourselves in accord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment is designed to alleviate the situation and reduce the burden. The Minister tells me to preach that <Col N="2571" /> philosophy to my colleagues.  I have a democratic right to make my point and the Minister's is a glib response which does not add anything to this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to refrain from advising me.  I am arguing my case as I shall argue it on every available opportunity because I have some concern for private enterprise.  I am arguing the case for private enterprise.  I am arguing on behalf of the construction industry and every other enterprise. Every facet of our industrial arm is under attack.  There is literally no enterprise which can afford to pay these penal impositions.  According to the Minister's statement today we have borrowed within the last five months £650 million in foreign currency, in Deutschemarks and Swiss Francs.  I appeal to the Minister to take a look inwards and try to put our own house in order and then give incentives to the people to expand the economy.  I do not appear to be getting through to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>I emphasise that business must be given a breathing space.  I know the Minister has to take certain steps and I realise some impositions were necessary but I cannot understand why not one single incentive was given.  All that is done is to impose more and more taxation.  No effort is made to lessen the burdens.  I suggest the system is running out of control.  The system is like the headless hen running frenetically in all directions before she collapses.  There is no real direction at the moment.  We are half-way through the Bill at the moment. Before the end of the Bill I hope I shall be able to impress on the Minister my point that private enterprise should be given a chance.  I appreciate the enormity of the Minister's task.  I trust the Minister will list for me a few of the incentives he intends as an input into the economy <Col N="2572" /> before it is run into the ground.  That is literally what is happening at the moment.  I am not just speaking for myself.  This is the Minister's opportunity. He can make adequate provision for incentives without loss of face.  The matter is too serious for political point scoring or anything of that nature.  I appeal earnestly to the Minister to take my advice.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom labhairt ar an chuid seo den Bhille chomh maith.  I ndhiaidh an chéad chuid den Bhille a bhí ag plé le cáin ioncaim, sílimid gurb é seo an chuid is measa den Bhille ar fad.  Táimid in éadan na gcánacha indíreacha agus ní dóigh liom gur féidir linn a rá go bhfuil morán maitheasa sna leasuithe atá curtha síos ag Fianna Fáil. Tá siad ag lorg lagdú 3 faoin gcéad, ó 23 faoin gcéad go dtí 20 faoin gcéad, agus ó 35 faoin gcéad go dtí 32 faoin gcéad. Dúirt an Teachta Kennedy cén fath go raibh air na leasuithe eile a chur síos ach ina dhiaidh sin tá Fianna Fáil ag moladh meadú sa chuid eile de na leasuithe.</P>
      <P>We oppose this section generally because of the huge increase in indirect taxes which it means.  Already from figures given by the Minister for Finance we have a figure of indirect taxes in 1981 of 44.7 per cent of taxation.  The equivalent figure in the UK was 27.5 per cent.  Going right through the EEC countries none of them exceeds 30 per cent.  In our case 44.7 per cent of taxation is indirect taxation. It is a regressive tax.  Indirect taxation bears heaviest on those with lowest incomes.  Those with the lowest incomes spend all their income and it is a spending tax.  Those on higher incomes have some savings.  Indirect taxes in many cases are a tax on life itself.  There are taxes on food.  In this section we have the introduction of a tax on fuel which was zero-rated up to this.  This is a very miserable tax to put on when inflation is so high. To put a tax on coal, turf, gas and central heating oils is a tax on the elderly and on life itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in VAT here will bear heaviest on those with lower incomes, mainly the PAYE workers.  Others who pay VAT can manage to escape paying, <Col N="2573" /> like income tax.  All the discussion on the crock of gold and tax outstanding has so far been in the realm of income tax. There has been little discussion on the amount of VAT outstanding.  It is not the consumer who does not pay the VAT, so who is refusing to pay it over?  At 31 December 1982 the balance outstanding for the account year 1979-80 was £223 million and of that £16.27 million was VAT outstanding.  The amount outstanding for the year 1980-81 last December was £30.76 million VAT outstanding. That is a total of almost £47 million VAT outstanding last December.  That is the area of delay in payments, but there is a whole other area of evasion and avoidance of VAT payments just as in the case of income tax.  It is a tax that is simple to collect from the consumer.  It is rather difficult when you go into the area of traders, self-employed and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa earlier raised an anomaly in VAT payments by local authorities and contractors.  It apparently comes under this section 70.  I see here that the terrible mistake of putting VAT on candles has suddenly been discovered by the Minister and he has very kindly zero-rated candles, thus presumably costing the Exchequer an enormous number of shillings and pence.  I suppose it will be useful when the price of electricity goes up again.  Nobody will be able to have electricity so there could be a huge increase in the sale of candles.</P>
    <P>However, I want to deal with the next sentence, which deals with the liability to tax of the supply of buildings, building work and certain services connected with agriculture which is being increased from 3 per cent to 5 per cent with effect from 1 March 1983.  I would ask the Minister to look at this.  My information on this has come mainly from County Wicklow. It is to the effect that if the local authority buys materials to do a job by direct labour, it must pay VAT of 23 per cent on them.  On the other hand, if a contractor does a job for the local authority VAT is charged at only 5 per cent.  If Wicklow County Council buy a ton of bitumen from a company called Coltex it is charged to them at £164 plus VAT bringing the total charge for a ton of <Col N="2574" /> bitumen to £201.70 whereas if they ask Coltex to lay the ton of bitumen they only have to charge 5 per cent and the total cost of the job is only £199.  The council officials estimate that this anomaly adds £3,000 to the cost of each house built by direct labour which means they build 13 houses less in a year for the amount given by the Department of the Environment. The history of this apparently is that up to 1978 local authorities could reclaim the VAT they pay on certain materials purchased for use by direct labour in the area of roads, water services, sewerage, housing etc.  That was abolished by the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978.  From the beginning of 1979 they had to pay in the normal way without the right to reclaim.  At that time the standard rate was only 10 per cent.  It seemed a lot at that time but now it seems very little. The contractors' rate was 3 per cent, the difference between them being only 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>However, following the recent budget the normal rate went up to 23 per cent and the contractors' rate has gone up to 5 per cent, meaning an 18 per cent difference. This has caused enormous problems for local authorities.  The Minister should deal with the anomaly by restoring the pre-1979 situation when local authorities could reclaim that, or he could allow local authorities to purchase materials for direct labour purposes at the 5 per cent rate.  In one way or another it would give help to the local authorities, not just in the area of houses, roads, sewerage and water services, in respect of which they have to pay the 23 per cent.  Local authorities need all the help they can get at this time because there is no money coming from the Department of the Environment to assist them.  The Minister could help out enormously by a small change in the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister realises that paying VAT nowadays is a big talking point when he goes to buy anything. That includes more than the manufacturers and big business: it includes every housewife and consumer in the country. It is the one kind of tax that is resented greatly by the vast majority of citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2575" /> When it was introduced initially at the lower level, and indeed after some subsequent increases, it was tolerated.  It was accepted as a means of getting huge sums of money in the easiest way possible when a Government needed the revenue.</P>
    <P>However, this last imposition has attracted more than normal objections by the consumers.  They have shown that rejection in their lack of spending.  There are other reasons for that, like lack of disposable income, but the main objection is at the level of tax.  VAT is an everyday experience, unlike income tax. Many retailers, by way of advertisements and shop notices, point to the percentage of commodity prices going to the Exchequer. I am sure the Minister will agree that he has overstepped the limit.  The reason for our amendment is to show that it might be possible to get some of the money in other ways.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Brady in saying that the general opinion outside on this Bill is that its general thrust is to attract more money to the Exchequer without any give whatsoever.  It is the lack of give that is causing such disharmony throughout the economy.  The matter of incentive is important.  Perhaps the odium of the people might not have been so enormous if the Minister had included, either in the budget, in this Bill or in the Social Welfare Bill, some provision to reduce the impact on the people.</P>
    <P>The business community are particularly concerned, and the Minister should appreciate it.  There is no incentive in the Bill to enable them to continue investing risk capital.  There is no incentive for shareholders.  Their big complaint is that they see this as a further example of the lack of concern of the Government to protect what is traditionally an open economy.  Apart from the concern of the housewives, the consumer, young people do not see any way forward because this Bill does not provide any hope of employment for them.  On the contrary, they see this and other sections as not holding out any hope in the matter of job creation.</P>
    <P>One has only to talk to people in the main street of any provincial town to know precisely what is happening in the <Col N="2576" /> retail business.  You often get a better indication in the main street of towns with populations of 5,000 to 8,000 than in the capital city.  They are not selling their goods.  The banks are carrying the vast majority of small and medium businesses. This will not improve and this section and its VAT impositions are probably the main reason for that.  There does not seem to be any redress whatsoever.</P>
    <P>It is the easiest thing in the world to say that competitiveness has been lost because of all the increases, corporation tax and all the other kinds of taxes the Minister has included here.  We have become accustomed to have a whole range of taxes included in one Bill but not so many years ago a Finance Bill that would include one or two of these taxes would have been voted down in this House.  It is dreadful to contemplate what the total impact of this Bill will be at the end of the year on ordinary living standards. We can talk about economics, fiscal policies and all the rest, but it comes down to the fact that these measures will have to be met by the vast majority of the people, ordinary people trying to pay their way.</P>
    <P>The Minister must recognise that people cannot match up to this.  We are not offering the incentives or the opportunities for employment for the community. I cannot imagine why the Minister would go to the trouble to place the new 5 per cent VAT on consumer goods. I do not know the amount of money that will come from this but it indicates to me that it is only a starting figure.  It has been the pattern and tradition in regard to other VAT ratings to start at a low rate and increase it the following year.  The biggest impact will be on those on meagre earnings.  A sum of 30p seems very small these days but an imposition of 30p on a cylinder of gas for somebody on £34.25p a week is a hefty increase if they are to try to provide heat.  There is no relief from that.  I thought it would have been the Minister's attitude in hard times not to create new taxes on commodities which would be regarded as essential.  We all thought the Coalition had learned <Col N="2577" /> their lesson when they introduced VAT on clothes and shoes, which was a cause of a major upset.  Now they are starting a new VAT scale.  We cannot support this because the money could have been gathered in other areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister might ask where they could find that kind of money.  I will make one suggestion &mdash; I go back again to the question of smuggling.  The Minister commented on that in his Budget Statement but very little has been done, apart from a few weekend efforts which, I presume, it was hoped would dissuade people from smuggling.  We have created an industry in cross-Border smuggling. This is threatening the fabric of communities on this side of the Border.  The increased incidence of smuggling has not been tackled by the Government.  Let us take one simple item, spirits.  The extent of smuggling in this commodity is enormous. Distributors of spirits in the Border areas have had their sales reduced by over 50 per cent in the last 12 months.  It is estimated that the quantity involved is about 100,000 cases per year.  Even if the figure is only close to that, this means there is a loss to the Exchequer of over £58 million not including VAT which would be about £2 million, and there would be other taxes as well.  If this money were collected, and it could be done if the Minister and his officials put their minds to it, it could relieve the impact of VAT on bottled gas for old aged pensioners.</P>
    <P>Irish Distillers have admitted that their exports north of the Border have increased dramatically.  The amount of spirits legally exported free of excise duty to the North and coming back South and being sold over the counter, without VAT or excise duty being paid, must run into an enormous amount of money.  If there is a gap to be plugged the Minister has an obligation to plug it.  As I said this has created a new kind of industry and a new way of life.  Because some people are making enormous illicit profits, communities are being affected and business people are moving to other areas and their investments are going for naught. Now is the time to do something about this.  Several ways have been suggested <Col N="2578" /> to tackle this problem.  If we had the goodwill of Irish Distillers a lot could be done by way of identification to make it more difficult to sell illicit spirits.  Publicans' licences, if they were convicted as being receivers &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is a great deal of bootlegging going on in the Republic.  This liquor is manufactured but is exported to the North and is on sale in the South and no duty or VAT has been paid on it.  This means there is an enormous loss of revenue.  To dispose of this commodity new businesses are being formed.  There are no VAT returns from this area either.  This is a contributory factor in the reduction of VAT returns from that trade.  I believe a great deal of those smuggled spirits are stolen.  This is an area where much needed revenue can be harvested and the Minister will be doing a service to the Exchequer and the taxpayer if he puts a stop to this smuggling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he had to take considerable measures to deal with the hotel and related industries as far as the VAT situation is concerned.  VAT as applied to the hotel industry and tourism generally is more than just a contributory factor to the state of crisis that exists in that industry at present.  For the past few years tourism has been a second string earner in the minds of certain individuals and it was never that way.  At one time it was our biggest earner.  In my view this industry has been neglected.  The turnover of £760 million is a sizeable figure and it generates a lot of money for the Exchequer &mdash; in 1981 approximately £91 million &mdash; and this is an area which can be worked on to provide more money.  Foreign currency earnings must have a significant bearing on our Exchequer returns.  More concern will have to be shown in this area.  One reason for the present crisis in this industry is VAT.  The Minister will say that this year VAT is at the same rate as last year, but the Government increased it to 23 per cent, and bringing it down to 18 per cent is not really making any concessions.  The Minister should <Col N="2579" /> take a bold initiative sooner or later so far as VAT on the hotel industry is concerned and see how VAT is applied in other EEC countries.  The Minister knows the average VAT rate is around 9 per cent.  Our VAT rate is 18 per cent. This means we are at a disadvantage and this must bear heavily against tourists bringing foreign currency here.  We will have to reduce our VAT rate.  People may ask if it will cost a great deal.  It is estimated that if the VAT rating of 18 per cent were reduced to the European average of 10 per cent, it would mean a loss of revenue to the Exchequer of about £4 million.  If the price structure could be controlled properly, with the business that the new VAT rate would generate, it could have the opposite effect so that the £4 million could be offset and we could bring back an industry which should be of primary importance to us.</P>
    <P>The whole question of reducing VAT on hotels and accommodations is not new. There is precedent for it in Belgium, where VAT was reduced from 16 per cent to 6 per cent.  I know that because of EEC regulations we cannot go any further than that.  To cut the VAT rate back to 10 per cent would provide a much needed boost to the industry which would generate more growth.  This would be taking the type of initiative that we must take to maintain our market share in that area. This would also have an impact on employment.  Every night people are raising questions here about industries going to the wall.  It is not whitewash to say that 26,000 people are working in the hotel industry.  Fresh thinking will have to be applied to maintain this level of employment here.  Such a concession would put the hotel industry on an even keel.  The hotel industry is the only export industry which is penalised.  Every other export industry is given enormous cash incentives. In relation to the export content of the hotel industry about 50 per cent of bed nights last year were accounted for by foreign visitors.  In 1981 out of the seven million bed nights here, VAT was only attached to two million of them. That puts the hotel industry at a disadvantage and it is discriminatory.</P>

      <P>A lot of people in the other type of operations feel they are being discriminated against and feel that fair play should apply across the board.  They want to know why their two million bed nights attract even the 18 per cent when so many have no VAT rating at all.  I am not asking the Minister to apply VAT rating to those not affected.  I am asking the Minister to lower the 18 per cent VAT rate to the average European level of about 9 per cent.  The VAT aspect is a very significant element in relation to the hotel and tourist industries.  This industry has been killed off by prices which the foreign visitor cannot afford. The VAT rate will have to be reduced to give a better deal.  I hope the Minister will give this suggestion his favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>This situation has existed for years but, the rules being as they are, many of us cannot discuss certain sections one by one.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to antagonise the Minister because I am a business man too as well as being a public representative.  However, this proposal is anti-investment.  I admit that the Minister has a difficult financial problem.  I recall that when myself and Deputy Flynn moved a motion in regard to VAT on hotels the Minister explained that he could not accede to our request but I was glad to note that eventually the Minister came around to our way of thinking.  We must create an incentive to invest and expand. I regret that some people depend on the State to do everything.  The State is not in a position to give the type of investment we need to boost employment because the resources are not available to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much in favour of small industries.  These industries with under 30 employees have served the country well and should be made attractive.  Some political commentators and also some political parties think that the State can do everything, that the State is a vehicle to take on the major task of employment. It goes part of the way, but was never asked to take on that complete role.  We depend on private investment, which should be encouraged.  There seems to be a swing away, whether intentional or otherwise from encouraging wealthy people to invest their money.  I would go into more detail on the subject, but time is against me and I want to allow the Minister to speak.  I look forward to hearing <Col N="2582" /> his views on amendment No. 73. Unfortunately, this matter must be concluded by 8.30 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider the amendment in the name of Deputy O'Kennedy.  Would he consider especially Border counties such as Donegal which have suffered as a result of these increases?  Because of these latest increases the returns to the Exchequer has been reduced and that is a fact.  The Minister's officials will bear me out on that.  As the Minister well knows from his visits to Donegal, small businesses have closed down, particularly public houses. One is fortunate to get a look into a bar door now and have a look at a pint, let alone be able to drink one.  Business, not alone along the Border but throughout that county, is suffering.  I am speaking not only on behalf of the people of Donegal, but of all the Border counties. Even at this late stage the Minister should consider this reasonable amendment, which could increase revenue to the Exchequer rather than reduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one point and will be very brief.  There are tax rates of 23 per cent and 35 per cent and quite often many goods could go into one rate or the other but because of the state of the revenue they automatically find themselves in the 35 per cent category. In a future budget the Minister might consider the feasibility, particularly with regard to items connected with tourism, of introducing a rate which would fall between these two percentages. It may be possible to bring selected items into such an interim rate.  The argument may be put forward that this would be difficult from an administration point of view but, after all, we have already a zero, a 5 per cent, a 23 per cent and a 35 per cent rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that candles have been derated from 5 per cent down to zero, which will help us to see the light more clearly.  There have been, can be and should be adjustments, particularly in connection with tourism.  The recent adjustments have been a great boost to the tourist trade with regard to hotels and <Col N="2583" /> the Minister might be able to consider sympathetically Deputy Gallagher's plea with regard to the Border counties.  It might mean too great a loss to the Exchequer to reduce the 35 per cent rate back to 23 per cent but an interim percentage might be of benefit, without much loss to the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief on the points which I am making.  Predictably, I must begin with Deputy O'Kennedy's question on the revenue position.  The proposal made in this amendment would reduce revenue this year by a gross figure of approximately £100 million.  Deputy O'Kennedy referred to my reply to a recent question, but that concerned a gross estimate.  He has said that the net cost would not be so great.  Taken in isolation that probably would be true and there would be some resultant buoyancy as the Deputy says.  On the other hand, in order to replace that revenue it would be necessary either to raise taxation elsewhere or to reduce expenditure.  In either of those cases there would be a negative buoyancy factor in the opposite direction. It does not add a great deal to the argument in the present circumstances to make great play of the difference between the gross and the net position.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties met with in Border areas regarding trading.  I must observe that there are two ways of dealing with that problem: one is to reduce our tax rates so that they are comparable with those in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, neither of those seems to be a realistic prospect.  We must therefore seek other ways of dealing with that problem.  Deputy Flynn has referred to a number of suggestions in that connection.  The amendment put forward, <Col N="2584" /> of itself, would not solve our problem, nor do I think that it is being represented in that light.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been quite a deal of discussion on the incidence of our VAT rates.  If we were to take the full theoretical VAT base of all consumer goods and services and if we spread the burden over the whole volume of consumer expenditure on goods and services we would end up with an effective VAT rate of about 14 per cent.  In those terms, when compared with the rates which apply in other member states of the EEC, we are not so high up the scale as one might think.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>I am speaking about all the VAT rates.  Deputy Mitchell mentioned the gap between the 23 per cent and 35 per cent rate and a possible interim rate. There is a wider problem there.  We could look at rationalising categories of goods without necessarily creating extra rates. What I have said on this and other measures which we have previously discussed will have to suffice, because of the time limitation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address myself to two of them.  In relation to the levy on the banks, this issue arose with the Minister and his predecessors.  It was referred by me to the Commission on Taxation as a matter for appropriate consideration. As yet they have not yet made a recommendation on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence of the proposals which the Minister has been making, notably the proposals he has been making in section 17 in respect of deposits from people resident outside the State, the information is that very considerable sums have already been withdrawn from the banks.  The indications are that the level of inquiries in the external branches of the Irish banks in the United States, in Britain and elsewhere &mdash; countries with whom we have dual taxation agreements and where our Revenue Commissioners have arrangements with their Revenue Commissioners &mdash; is causing considerable concern to the banking institutions. Whatever view one takes on an ideological basis of the banking institutions, it is quite clear that the last thing we need is to see a run on our banks.  The last thing the Minister needs from the point of view of revenue is to see a run on our banks, because then there would be precious little on which he could make his levy in <Col N="2589" /> accordance with his proposals in section 79.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, at the moment roughly about £1.4 billion is on deposit in our banks from people who are domiciled outside the country.  People like these who are making a very substantial contribution to the deposit base in our banks &mdash; which I am sure helps to achieve the level of profitability on which the Minister proposes under this section to impose a levy &mdash; will be discouraged, to say the least of it, from leaving their deposits in a banking system which requires them to swear an affidavit that in fact they have accounts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this on the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes, it is definitely. If the Minister is going to deal with the banks by way of levy, if he wants to get something from them by way of levy, I presume he will be very anxious to ensure that their deposits and, consequently their profits on which he proposes to impose the levy, will at least be capable of sustaining a levy.  It is for that reason that we are very strongly opposed and have moved to delete the extraordinary proposal the Minister introduced to require non-residents, or citizens outside the country to swear affidavits that they have accounts in banks outside their own jurisdiction.  Obviously it is a matter of concern for them but it is even more important as far as we are concerned for the banks and their role and that of other financial institutions in this area.  I believe the Minister will have learned from all sources since he took this decision that it constitutes a very damaging blow to the liquid position of our banking institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister thinks people will readily swear affidavits which will enable them to be identified by the Revenue Commissioners here, which from their point of view, rightly or wrongly &mdash; and I would not suggest for a moment that our Revenue Commissioners would disclose that fact to the Revenue Commissioners, say, in Britain, a country with which we have a dual taxation agreement, <Col N="2590" /> or, similarly, in the United States &mdash; he is under a gross misapprehension. I would not suggest for a moment that they would but, whether or not they would, in the mind of the person depositing in our banking system the reality is that he will be apprehensive.  If he is apprehensive the last thing he wants to do, if he is depositing what may be even hot money from his own jurisdiction in our banking system, is to run any risk whatever of having the existence of those moneys and accounts disclosed to the Revenue Commissioners or the equivalent, inland revenue or otherwise, in another country.</P>
    <P>In that sense section 79 becomes only a detail if the Minister is determined to proceed with that proposal, which we strongly advise him not to do and have actually proposed be deleted from this Bill.  Otherwise we will not have any profits on which to impose the levies and section 79, about which we are now concerned, will be of academic interest only.</P>
    <P>Whatever view one takes those £1.4 billion or thereabouts now available to our banking institutions make a considerable contribution to our economic development and are of vital importance in maintaining the liquidity of the banks and even the strength of our currency.  In this instance I hope the Minister will see that in his zeal he has moved too quickly. In the light of what he hopes to achieve in section 79 &mdash; which we could support &mdash; I hope he will reconsider what he is proposing in section 17 because, if he does not, he will have no profits on which to impose the levy under section 79, when a very important element of our economic development will have been undermined.</P>

      <P>I forgot to mention that we are opposing section 81.  That is the section which proposes to delete the exemption from stamp duty on consideration of marriage.  We feel this is a very important element in the encouragement to transfer farms, particularly in rural areas, from older farmers to their sons on consideration of marriage.  There are good reasons why this particular exemption has been included in the tax code. We shall not have much time to argue it now but, for all the good reasons it is there &mdash; namely as a special inducement for transfers of farms in consideration of marriage, particularly in rural areas &mdash; the Minister should very seriously reconsider that position.  I do not know how much money he expects to get as a consequence of including section 81 but it would want to be a very considerable sum before introducing a section which will have a very undesirable socio-economic impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make a few comments on that section.  I should like to express my disappointment at the provision in this Bill &mdash; I think £250,000 is the estimated revenue yield therefrom &mdash; which will do a considerable amount of damage to the transfer of farms by older farmers to members of their families.</P>
      <P>I might refer the Minister to the Inter-Departmental Committee on Land Structure Reform, Final Report of May 1978, paragraph 3.5 under the heading &ldquo;Farm Inheritance and Succession&rdquo; which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late transfer of the family holding has long been regarded as a problem in Irish farming.  The ages of farmers at the stage of transfer and succession vary with farm size, being lower on the bigger farms.  Over 23 per cent of the active agricultural population <Col N="2592" /> is over 65 years, compared with a 4 per cent to 9 per cent range in Continental countries.... </P>
    <P>This measure will compound that situation further.  Everything should be done to encourage the transfer of farms to younger farmers.  Indeed I might say that Fianna Fáil, in section 93 of the Finance Act, 1982, introduced a provision which allowed exemption from stamp duty where transfers were made to young farmers under 35 years of age who had acquired farm training qualifications. That was a step in the right direction.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider this proposal for the sake of the estimated £250,000 involved.  Sufficient damage has been done already to the morale of the farming community by the suspension of the farm modernisation scheme, the introduction of the other taxation measures and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies J. Walsh and O'Kennedy have pointed out the desirability of farmers transferring their land to their sons rather than holding on to it until they are at an advanced age or willing it to their sons.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Minister that the scheme of gift and inheritance tax introduced by a previous Coalition Government in 1976 was designed to encourage just that by imposing a lower levy of transfer tax on transfers <i>inter vivos</i> rather than on transfers on death.  I think it is 25 per cent lower.  Therefore, this section runs contrary to the entire scheme in that respect.  I agree with a former Minister for Finance, Deputy Richie Ryan, in his proposal, incorporated in legislation, to encourage such transfers at an earlier stage.  I would appeal to the Minister to act in a way which is consistent with what a previous Fine Gael Minister has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On this point of transfers <i>inter vivos</i> and transfers on marriage, I would think that what was done in the Finance Act of last year &mdash; indeed initiated by the previous Coalition Government at that stage &mdash; is something that will have a far more beneficial effect on transfers than the measure about which <Col N="2593" /> we are talking here.  A wide range of relatives qualify already for lower rates of stamp duty on these transfers and, in most cases, consideration of marriage will qualify here anyway.  Transfers on marriage, up to now, enjoyed a privileged position, as compared with the situation of couples who were buying property when they got married.</P>
      <P>That element is one to which we should pay attention.  I regret that we have had two or three people saying much the same thing on the other side.  I would oppose the amendment Deputy O'Kennedy is putting forward.  I reject in very large part the substance of what he has said about the provisions of section 17, which I have already said I intend to amend.  I take it from what he is saying that he supports the provision in relation to bank rate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the amendments to this part of the Bill are drafting amendments which are designed to remove any doubts as to the meaning of certain phrases used in the section.  Amendments Nos. 78 and 80 are designed to ensure that the knowing or negligent furnishing to an inspector of taxes of incorrect accounts of a business or profession or assisting in furnishing such incorrect accounts would be an offence <Col N="2594" /> under this section.  I am not happy that the existing phrase as the section is drafted, that is &ldquo;return or statement&rdquo;, would cover accounts also and it is for that reason that these two amendments have been put down, in order to make it clear what the intention and the scope of the section are.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 79:</P>
      <P>In page 65, subsection (2) (b), line 17, to delete &ldquo;negligently&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>It is part of the code already in relation to income tax that a person negligently furnishing or failing to furnish accounts or information is liable to penalty.  We are concerned that an accountant would not be culpable under this section if he furnished accounts or made a return on behalf of a client based on incorrect information supplied to him.  The purpose of the amendment is to secure that. Subsection (2) (d) would clearly apply to an accountant but we have not put down an amendment dealing with that subsection. I do not think the Minister would wish that bona fide accountants would be caught under the section.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about the extension into a new area of the principle of delegated criminality.  An officer of a company may deliberately or otherwise present false accounts.  The company directors could under this section be held to be liable personally or as a corporation for something of which they individually or collectively were not aware.  When drafting legislation of this kind there are two tendencies.  First one looks to see where there are similar kinds of legislation and we normally look across the water and copy similar British legislation, especially if there is a degree of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was engaged recently in consultations with the trade union movement. Such consultations with any group, no matter how representative, between the budget and the Finance Bill are <Col N="2595" /> unprecedented.  Never hitherto has any Minister worked so closely with any group in the course of preparation of his Bill and perhaps that explains why the Minister put down so many amendments after the Bill was presented.  After reconsideration of some of the things to which we agreed in the course of these consultations the Minister more prudently decided to qualify in some way or other. For that reason on this particular amendment, dealing with the deletion of the word &ldquo;negligently&rdquo; we are anxious to make it quite clear &mdash; as it is quite clear to the Minister &mdash; that where anyone has been found guilty under this or any previous legislation of defrauding the Revenue, an offence under the appropriate legislation, our approach in this party is far from seeming in any way to condone that kind of activity.  Negligence in law has been distinguished as a tort, as the Minister may well know, from criminal activity and if we have in a sense moved into an area in this Bill where one can be liable to negligence we are anxious to ensure it cannot at least happen on the basis of something you had no knowledge of in the case of a company or something you had no knowledge of in the case of a company director.  I believe the Minister would be as anxious to ensure that would not happen; and if the Minister thinks some formula other than our amendment would be more appropriate to achieve what is necessary, we will be quite happy to withdraw our amendment and listen to whatever observations he may have to make in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should point out about this section is that it does not create any new offence.  Every act or omission which can be prosecuted under this section already attracts a penalty under existing legislation and offences committed up to the date of the passing of the Act will continue to be subject to existing penalties and after that they will be subject to proceedings for penalties described in the section.  It does not create any new offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just making the point. Subsection (2), which is the one to which amendment No. 79 refers, sets out a number of cases where offences will be deemed to be or held to be committed under the section.  I would just draw to the Deputy's attention the fact that in paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; appears before &ldquo;negligently&rdquo; also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is rather anxious to get to the point, I want to get to the point.  In that connection on paragraph (e) of that subsection I propose on Report Stage to introduce an amendment to add the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; at the beginning of that.  Now the amendment proposes to confine the offences provided for in subsection 2 (b) to one of knowingly aiding and abetting, et cetera, or inducing another &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; to make or deliver an incorrect return, statement or account.  The genesis of the section consists in the knowingly or negligent delivery of such documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make the point that negligence in the context of a Revenue offence should not be talked of as being no more than carelessness or oversight and the question of what constitutes neglect for tax purposes is something that was discussed here during the debate on the Finance Bill, 1971.  On that occasion, in response to an amendment moved by Deputy O'Higgins, the then Minister, Deputy Colley, pointed out that the definition of neglect was not what the normal lay man would think of in terms of neglect.  He pointed out that where a taxpayer appeals against an assessment on the grounds that he has not been guilty of neglect in the case of an incorrect return the inspector would have to show this <Col N="2597" /> was not the result of an innocent mistake but rather that the taxpayer was guilty of negligence in making the return.  He further ventured the opinion that it might not be taken that the appeal commissioners or the Circuit Court, to whom the taxpayer had recourse, would not be likely satisfied on a point of this kind. Therefore, the notion of negligence in this connection is not a new one and, in fact, has been considered before in this House.</P>
    <P>I should also like to make a point that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;negligently&rdquo; in this part of the section is something which should help to ensure that high standards are maintained by those who are involved in making, assisting or advising in the making of returns.  For those reasons I prefer to maintain the drafting as it stands because it will point more clearly to the need for proper attention to be paid to the preparation and making of returns both in the interests of the taxpayer, whether it be a person or a company, and in the interests of the officials and in the interests of the effectiveness of the collection system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from being reassuring what the Minister has just said has the very opposite effect particularly when he says this will be an encouragement, if not a threat, to people who are engaged in their professional capacity &mdash; they could be anything from solicitors to accountants to anybody else &mdash; an inducement or encouragement to them to ensure they do not act negligently in getting all the relevant facts from their client.  That may be, but that is the very last thing that should be introduced into any criminal code.  If by chance one has an unworthy client the onus may actually rest on one, be he an accountant or a solicitor, to ensure that he is furnished with every last detail.  That is moving into a most dangerous minefield.  It is one thing to talk about high standards being encouraged but let us recognise the fact that professionally qualified people have by definition their own professional etiquette and, if they have not, they have their own disciplinary authority.  If by <Col N="2598" /> chance someone goes beyond the scope of their own disciplinary authority then that someone can be prosecuted by the courts for criminal activity.  Here we have the situation where someone can find himself actually guilty of a criminal offence and liable to very considerable penalties &mdash; five years or £10,000 or both. That is moving into a most explosive minefield and the reasons given by the Minister are quite inadequate.  This is a very complex Bill.</P>
      <P>In talking about the Bill to the press the very first day the Minister described the Bill as a Bill with revolutionary changes.  Those are the Minister's very words.  We can now see that it is indeed revolutionary.  Perhaps he did not have an opportunity of examining all the aspects of it or even of consulting the legal advisers from the Attorney General's office and others.  While I and others will obviously respect the reasons given by any Minister here, the fact is that what is said in this House would not be regarded in the law courts as being the binding interpretation of the law.  They read the Act as it is drafted.  They apply the judgment on the basis of the interpretation of the terms as they see it.  We have to ensure that when it leaves our hands here there can be no doubt.  They may consider, but very seldom be influenced by, an assurance from any Minister, however well intentioned that assurance may be and however well informed it may be.  If the Minister will agree to correct this we will not insist on our particular deletion in that line but in every case where &ldquo;negligently&rdquo; occurs it occurs on this basis &ldquo;knowingly or negligently&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 83 (2) reads:</P>
      <P> (a)  knowingly or negligently delivers any incorrect return or statement or knowingly or negligently furnishes any incorrect information in connection with any tax.</P>
      <P>(b)  knowingly aids, abets, assists, incites or induces another person to make or deliver knowingly or negligently any incorrect return or statement in connection with any tax ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  knowingly or negligently issues or produces any incorrect invoice, <Col N="2599" /> receipt, instrument or other document in connection with any tax.  </P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;or other document&rdquo; covers a multitude.  One would not have to be a lawyer, much less a Supreme Court judge to see that ironically one of those who was making the point that the Minister referred to of concern in 1971 is now in the very position of being Chief Justice. Nothing the Minister has said reassures me; it does quite the opposite.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the words &ldquo;innocent mistake&rdquo;.  He is moving into totally different territory there.  The law is quite clear &mdash; and this is even in tort. Leaving aside the criminal imputations, it distinguishes very clearly between &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; and &ldquo;negligence&rdquo;.  The two are in no way related.  They are not of the same order at all.  There is hardly any distinction in the law as clear as that between mistake, even deliberate mistake, and negligence.  For the Minister to talk of &ldquo;innocent mistake&rdquo; in the same context as &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; is demonstrating that perhaps somebody did not have adequate time to advise him or he did not have adequate time to consider the advice he received.  Before we move into this territory we believe that we owe it to the citizens out there, particularly those who have professional competence and obligations, to ensure that they will not be caught up in criminal actions which the judges will have to interpret on the basis of what we put through here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>All the amendments in Deputy O'Kennedy's name deal with the question of negligence in the making of returns to the Revenue Commissioners. It seems to me to be perfectly obvious that what Deputy O'Kennedy says in relation to accountants, for example, is correct and also I would think in relation to solicitors.  It certainly is in relation to accountants.</P>
      <P>If you look at subsection (5), line 12, there is reference to &ldquo;secretary or other officer of a body corporate&rdquo;.  Under the Companies Act, 1963, an auditor is an officer of a body corporate.  Therefore, an auditor of a company who is acting in his professional capacity comes within subsection (5) and is liable, if he is negligent, to the penalties set out in this section, including five years imprisonment, for negligence.</P>
      <P>I practised a profession for a number of years and I was aware, and availed of the opportunity from the very start, of the necessity to insure myself against negligence, because in the practice of any profession, whether medicine, law, accountancy or anything else, the best practitioner in the world is liable to be found negligent from time to time because of sheer pressure of work.  Here we have written into our law for the first time &mdash; Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment is an effort to avoid it &mdash; a concept that when somebody is not liable to civil damages he is liable in criminal law and may get five years imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will explain for the Minister what negligence is.  Negligence is a civil tort; it is not a crime.  Therefore it is, on the civil side of the law, only a breach which gives rise to damages.  If a motor car is driven out of a narrow laneway on to a main <Col N="2602" /> road and crashes into another car and injures somebody in the car on the main road, the driver of the car that came out of the narrow laneway is negligent.  He may or may not be guilty of an offence under the Road Traffic Act, but as far as the driver of the car on the main road is concerned, he has suffered a civil wrong and he is entitled to damages, and damages only.</P>
    <P>Here we have a whole new concept brought into the law whereby accountants, if they make a mistake, although they can insure themselves civilly, will get up to five years in jail as a result of this section, if it is passed without Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment.  In my view that is monstrous and anyone who understands the situation knows it is monstrous. It should not and could not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Look at the situation we are in here tonight.  We have passed in the House today far-reaching, revolutionary changes in our tax law and we have not ever discussed them.  I spent a couple of days preparing remarks I intended to make on advance corporation tax, the effect of which will be quite appalling on our economy for the sake of a few million pounds.  I found that on the 20 sections or so that imposed that tax neither I nor any other Member of the House could say a word.  Here we are changing the whole fundamentals of our criminal law in relation to professional people and officers of companies and we have an hour left in which to talk about it.</P>
    <P>If the reality of what this section means were understood, every Member of the House would want to talk about it.  Why we have to put up with the farce that this House sits week after week talking about nonsense and here we have the most important legislative measure of the year and we have been given four days in which to discuss its details, and no other opportunity.  We are an irrelevant body when we make these rules for ourselves and decide to obey them, because this Bill, the penal sanctions of which are contained in this section, is more important than the sum total of every other piece of legislation that has been or will be brought into this House this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2603" /> This Bill has a profound effect on our economy and on innumerable people in it, but we get only four days in which to talk about it.  Literally whole drafts of it, loads of it, 20 sections at a time, introducing totally new concepts of taxation, go through without any discussion.  This House is not in a position to amend this legislation.  In so far as it will be amended at all it is being amended behind closed doors by business and other pressure groups.  I think that is deplorable.  The amendments should come from the free flow of debate in this House, if this House is to mean anything, but the amendments are not flowing from that.  They are flowing from people scurrying into offices in Merrion Street making bargains with civil servants behind closed doors.  That is not democracy.  That is what is making this House irrelevant.</P>
    <P>We have been told by the Minister in his intervention that this section does not create any new offence.  The Minister should read his section, with all due respect to him, because subsection (2) provided that a person, without prejudice to any other penalty to which he may be liable &mdash; in other words, without prejudice to any other offence he has committed &mdash; shall be guilty of an offence under this section, after the passing of this Act.  In other words, if he does it today he is not guilty, but if this Act is passed next week or next month he will be guilty.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is a new offence.  There are a whole series of new offences, a long all-embracing list of them, all new offences, without prejudice to existing penalties to which he is liable.  It is a different way of bringing in a new criminal offence to our law because it does not specify exactly what it is &mdash; it refers to any infringement at all.  You are liable if you neglect to pay something.  They all bear the same penalty.  If you are tried on indictment you will get five years and a fine of £10,000 if you are a day late with a VAT return.</P>
    <P>The House will think of the equity with which we are faced here if we rush this thing through now.  If I am a small shopkeeper and I am one day late with my VAT returns and I owe the VAT people <Col N="2604" /> £50, I commit an offence under subsection (2) and I am liable to prosecution under subsection (3) and I may get five years for it.  As somebody pointed out to me recently in this connection, you can get five years for being late by one day in producing your returns to the inspector of taxes, but if you conspire with four others, all shopkeepers, to kick the inspector of taxes to death, you will get the Probation Act.</P>
    <P>What sense of proportion have we in the country and in the House with this section?  Even at this stage the House should say we have enough, that we will have to look at these provisions and that we cannot and will not deprive ourselves and those who elected us of the right to examine legislation and to amend it where it is seen to be necessary, appropriate, or in the public interest.  This House has given away the right to examine and amend legislation to anonymous men in Merrion Street to whom businessmen and other pressure groups are surreptitously running in order to get their amendments accepted.</P>
    <P>This House can never debate those amendments.  That does not do any service to democracy and in particular to our economy which will be so profoundly affected by what the Minister himself has called &ldquo;revolutionary provisions&rdquo;. Because they are revolutionary they need a lot more time than might otherwise be normal to debate them.  It was frightening to hear the Minister say &mdash; I am sure it will be frightening to professional institutions &mdash; that the use of the word &ldquo;negligently&rdquo; here means to enforce high standards in the making of returns and in the carrying out of professional work. That is a very ominous sentiment.  In other words, if a person does not do his work satisfactorily as an accountant &mdash; and not necessarily to his client's satisfaction but to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; he has a sanction hanging over him of five years in jail.  Is this going to be extended to doctors?  If a patient dies through a mistake is it no longer just a question of claiming damages? Are high standards in medicine going to be enforced by five years in jail?</P>
    <P>This section and the parts of it we are <Col N="2605" /> trying to get deleted are much more important than the efforts of the Minister, the Department of Finance or the Government to put them across as something almost unimportant would make them appear.  If ever I read a misleading explanatory memorandum it is the one which has been issued with this Bill.  One would think section 83 dealt with a minor matter because it says more stringent penalties will now be imposed for tax offences where there were only monetary sanctions before.  That is misleading, but I hope it was not intentional.</P>
    <P>For too long we have seen the most important Bill of the year put on the Statute Book without the agreement of this House other than in the most formal fashion.  It was always wrong but it was never as wrong as it is this year, because this year is fundamentally different.  Look at the length of the amendments.  This is the first book of amendments which came out Tuesday morning.  We now have two or three sheets of additional amendments and amendments to the additional amendments.  The first volume was 33 pages long, longer than the majority of Bills which go through this House, and half the length of the Bill.  We got these amendments on Tuesday morning and the debate started at 3.30 p.m. the same day, and we have been getting supplementary amendments since.  There were originally 177 amendments and there are now about 190, and we may get more tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I am objecting, this party are objecting, and I suggest everybody in this House should be objecting to the enactment of enormous new offences with enormous new penalties without any proper examination.  The unfortunate Minister, who I am sure is an honourable man, stood up in all innocence tonight and said this section created no new offences. It creates more criminal offences than any section I have seen in my 15 years in this House.  It is a measure of the innocence and naivete of the man that he believed that.  It is not his fault, because he is not experienced in this area.  It is monstrous that this is the case.</P>
    <P>It is particularly so because we have two sets of taxation which are new to our <Col N="2606" /> laws: one has been passed into law without being examined and another will come after this.  That is the one to which there are the most serious objections, not on ideological or economic grounds but on the grounds of the most obvious equity.  Now somebody can own a house with a short lease and an enormous mortgage but have no equity of redemption. In other words, he has no real property. He has nothing to own because the shortness of the lease and the existence of a huge mortgage mean that what otherwise would be a redemption to him is valueless. He has to make returns to the Revenue Commissioners in which he will have to return that house at what would have been the value if he held it unencumbered fee simple without any mortgage. If he does not make his returns spot on to the satisfaction of the inspector of taxes, he can get up to five years in jail. That may well happen because the climate has been created over the last six or 12 months to have everybody who is the subject of this kind of criticism branded as a criminal or a leech on society &mdash; businessmen, employers, farmers, manufacturers, professional men, anyone who creates wealth.  This popular public feeling that has been generated in recent times may influence the thinking in our courts and they may come to the conclusion that somebody who is deficient in one of these extraordinary new taxes and makes a mistake in relation to it is worthy of a jail sentence.</P>
    <P>I have the gravest doubts about this and I ask the Minister in all seriousness to realise that there is not just much more to this section than he believes but that there is infinitely more to it and that it has enormous consequences &mdash; legal, social and economic.  It is a section in a Bill called the Finance Bill, 1983, but for many people who matter to this country and who this country needs it might be described as the Emigration Bill, 1983, because that may be its effect on some of the most valuable people in this country.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the commitment of Deputy O'Malley to those people in our community &mdash; and there are many &mdash; whose intention and effort is to create <Col N="2607" /> wealth, to build new wealth and to create employment.  We are concerned about all these people who deserve the consideration and assistance the machinery of State can give them.  But to make the point as Deputy O'Malley has done starts off from the assumption that all those people, in one way or another, will come into a condition in which they would be under threat from the provisions of this Bill. That is simply not the case.  The majority of these people &mdash; indeed, the majority of our taxpayers &mdash; act in a proper and conscientious way and fulfil their obligations. In return they get whatever services the State provides to support or foster the activities they are involved in.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke about the effects of this Bill on our economy, and I am glad he did.  There are far wider considerations about which we are speaking in this section.  I wish that more of our discussion had had more direct relevance to the condition of our economy than we have seen so far in this debate.  There are fundamental problems with which we must deal and fundamental objectives which we must attain in relation to our economy for the sake of our people that have not been properly dealt with here. Perhaps it is in the nature of the Bill which we are discussing that we have to be restricted to the relevant sections.  Perhaps we should have had that debate earlier and, having fixed our objectives on the budget itself, we could then give those objectives legislative expression, where that is needed, in framing our Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has made a very vigorous attack on the sections under discussion and on the way in which this Bill was discussed.  We have endeavoured to carry out this discussion ensuring a proper allocation of time between the different sections of the Bill.  It may be that we could have done with more time overall to discuss the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am responding to points made with a degree of passion and conviction by Deputy O'Kennedy's colleague. I would like the opportunity to respond to them in the way in which they deserve.  In this matter I am prepared to listen on this section, as on the others, to any points made by Deputies this evening and to reflect on them.  If I do not find that I can agree with them this evening, I can still reflect on them and come back on Report Stage.  I will not put up with the accusation of surreptitious activity when we are discussing amendments here in this House.  I have no intention of branding anybody as a leech.  There are many in our community whose efforts and success we need in order to gain our objectives.  On the other hand, we have a great degree of concern that, where companies or individuals default on their obligations in the tax field there are very few sanctions which can be attached to those who can be held most responsible. Nobody can deny that there is disquiet on that score, and it is to respond to that disquiet that we have the measure which Deputy O'Malley is complaining about. There are provisions here for penalties in relation to officers of companies in particular circumstances.  I make the point that it is not an innovation to provide for penalties on the secretary of any company where an offence has been committed by the company, through fraud or negligence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of statutes have provisions dealing with neglect by directors and other officers.  There is the Consumer Information Act of 1978 with which Deputy O'Malley should be familiar and the Casual Trading Act of 1980 and the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, as regards publication of unauthorised matter.  In those cases, we have provision for penalties on an officer of a company as a result of an offence committed by fraud or negligence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley made the point that in the section that we are discussing an auditor of a company becomes liable for <Col N="2611" /> these penalties on the basis that the Companies Act, 1963, makes him an officer of the company.  Section 162 (3) of the Companies Act states:</P>
    <P>None of the following persons shall be qualified for appointment as auditor of a company:</P>
    <P>(a)  an officer or servant of the company. </P>
    <P>I would conclude, subject to further discussion if the Deputies have different ideas about it, that that means that an auditor cannot be an officer of the company. Perhaps some of Deputy O'Malley's fears are not entirely justified in that respect.</P>
    <P>Before a charge arising from the provisions of this Bill can be brought against a director or any officer of the company, it must be proved that an offence was committed by the company and it must be shown to the satisfaction of the court that the person concerned consented to the offence or connived at it, or that it was attributable to neglect on his part.</P>
    <P>Therefore a particular degree of culpability must be in evidence before a charge in respect of negligence and complicity in the offence could be sustained. I would make the further point that the matters which are offences under the provisions of this Bill are already offences under the existing legislation.  I submit that all of that puts a different complexion on the points made by Deputies O'Malley and O'Kennedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I put down these amendments it was as a consequence of very deep consideration and of the clear evidence that we were moving into a new minefield.  It was clear from the Minister's failure to reply to the points made by Deputy O'Malley and me that he is now conscious of having overlooked the dangers involved.  He is moving into a territory where there can be criminal liability for acts for which one had no responsibility and of which one had no knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister very carefully avoided <Col N="2612" /> taking up the points I mentioned but the explanatory memorandum is somewhat more precise than he has been because it tells us that the offences which are covered by the section include refusal to make statutory returns knowingly or to negligently furnish incorrect returns. Obviously, that can apply to accountants. I could read the section but having regard to the time constraint I shall leave it for the moment.</P>
    <P>We go on to find reference in this context to failing to make PAYE and VAT remittances.  That, too, is an offence under the section.  Incidentally, this new provision will mean that the courts who normally have jurisdiction and discretion to apply the Probation of Offenders Act will not be allowed to do so in this case even in respect of a conviction for what is now to be a new offence of delegated criminal negligence.</P>
    <P>When I moved the amendments I pointed out that not in Great Britain or elsewhere so far as I am aware and certainly not in this country is there any provision which makes it an offence on the part, for instance, of professional persons such as as an accountant or a solicitor to furnish accounts which to their knowledge are full and complete returns but which may not be such.  That is covered under the section.  Such persons will now be guilty of an offence by reason of information supplied to them by clients.  If it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the officer of a company was guilty of negligence or of a deliberate omission, the director of the company is responsible although he may have no knowledge of the offence.  The Minister chose his words carefully but he was aware that he was deliberately avoiding the issues raised in these amendments. He said that there are provisions in the legislation already whereby directors and other officers of a company are liable for criminal sanction.  There is no question about that.  The Minister said also that there are provisions whereby officers of a company can be found guilty of fraud or negligence.  I agree with that too but it is not what we are questioning here. We are not saying that in no circumstances can directors or officers be liable <Col N="2613" /> under the criminal law or any other law but we are saying that the law cannot tolerate a situation where a director can be liable without his knowledge for the failure, whether wilful or otherwise, of an officer to provide the returns that he should have provided for the Revenue.</P>
    <P>Our amendments are framed carefully and unless the Minister adopts them, a director in the circumstances I have outlined will be liable to be convicted of a criminal offence and in that case the court would have no discretion even to apply the benefit of the Probation Act.  That is an extraordinary situation.  I do not believe that the courts should be applying the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act because in no sense is a person in those circumstances an offender.  The Minister must know that the provision covers the case also of accountants or solicitors but he has been careful not to answer the points we raised in that respect.  He cannot answer them.  This provision is monstrous by any standards and must not be allowed to become law.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley is right.  We have introduced many new provisions.  For instance, we have had the provision in respect of the small trader.  Many of these people may not be able to cope with the responsibility being placed on them. Anyone who is guilty of negligence in failing to present the necessary returns is now to be liable for a £10,000 fine or for imprisonment of up to five years without there being any chance of his having the benefit of the Probation Act applied to him.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again to the amendments and to the reasons for them because the Minister has not directed his attention to these amendments.  I have asked that the word &ldquo;negligently&rdquo; in specific cases be deleted.  From page 66 we are asking to have deleted the words, &ldquo;or to have been attributable to the neglect on the part of&rdquo;.  Subsection (5) provides that where an offence under this section is committed by a body corporate, where the offence is shown to have been committed with the consent or with the connivance of, or to have been attributable to neglect on the part of, any person who when the offence was committed was a director, <Col N="2614" /> manager or secretary or other officer of the body corporate or a member of the committee of management or other controlling authority of the body corporate, that person shall also be deemed to be guilty of the offence and may be proceeded against and punished accordingly. Under this section each one of them can be guilty of the offence which is attributable properly to the neglect, wilful or otherwise, of the officer concerned.</P>
    <P>A number of us have been on that side of the House.  It is not easy to acknowledge: &ldquo;I was wrong.  I was not fully advised for one reason or another.  There was too much pressure on me.  I did not see the legal implications of what I am asking the House to do.&rdquo;  After what we have pointed out to the Minister this evening, I cannot imagine that he does not now see the legal implications.  Had he read his own explanatory memorandum in detail he would realise that it says:</P>
    <P>Where an offence committed by a company is shown to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to have been attributable to the neglect of, a director or other officer of the company, that person also is deemed to be guilty of the offence and may be prosecuted accordingly. </P>
    <P>It goes on to tell us the range of offences covered.</P>
    <P>The Minister said no new offence is being created here.  We should have convinced him by now that we are moving into uncharted territory when we are talking about liability for the negligence of others as a criminal offence.  I want to invite the Minister to refer us to the statute which makes it an offence under the terms described in section 83(2).  If the Minister can produce to me now the section of any existing legislation which sets out, as they are set out here, the elements of an offence under the existing law.  I will accept that there are grounds for his contention that no new offence is being created.  If he cannot, he should acknowledge that what he said is misleading, even if it was not deliberately misleading, and he has an obligation to withdraw this section from the Bill until <Col N="2615" /> such time as he can correct it to achieve whatever his intention is.</P>
    <P>If there is wilful withholding, if there is deliberate misleading, if there is negligence on the part of an officer, that officer should be liable as he is under existing legislation.  If we are dealing with a new principle which does not exist in the criminal law and someone who had no knowledge or responsibility and innocently presented to the Revenue Commissioners returns which were furnished to him by somebody else is to be liable for criminal negligence and liable for conviction and a penalty of five years or £10,000 without the benefit of the Probation Act, I do not think the Minister would wish to achieve that result.  He will have achieved something which would not be the kind of <i>monumentum aere perennius</i> which he would like to achieve. I invite him before we finish at 10.30 p.m. on these sections &mdash; and he has the benefit of his advisers &mdash; to produce evidence of that terminology in existing legislation to confirm that these offences already exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express reservations about this section of the Bill. I regret having to do it on the floor of the House but, as a Member of the House, I feel obliged to voice my opinion and, since this is the only opportunity I will have, while I regret that I have to do it publicly I feel it should be done here.  I want to go back to where all this great panic about tax evasion came from.  It can be related back directly to an incorrect statement issued by the Revenue Commissioners which overstated the amount of tax outstanding and caused an almighty panic and an almighty critical upheaval and all sorts of protests and marches on the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably the same office produced these amendments, coming under the Department of Finance.  At the same time certain inspectors of taxes are using, politically, information confidentially obtained, and appearing on public programmes. The number of instances has weakened my faith in the bona-fides of <Col N="2617" /> this section.  The Minister should give very careful consideration to the section before it is implemented.</P>
    <P>This Bill has not been duly considered by the legislators.  It has not been given due criticism and examination.  Unfortunately, we are now working against a time table.  The Bill must be passed by next week.  This section of the Bill should not have to be passed by next week. Perhaps the Minister would consider referring it to an all-party committee of the House.</P>
    <P>If the people in the civil service who are advising on this were equally as concerned about the abuse of the Official Secrets Act, legislation would come forward from that source to deal with civil servants and inspectors of taxes who are using information and leaking information every day of the week.  This House should sit up and take notice.  The State is no longer being run by political representatives. It is being run by a permanent government who are by-passing at every turn this House and the Executive.  There is no doubt about that.  If this Bill is a product of that type of thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;all parties in the House who are genuinely interested in democracy will have to take them on. This is not a criticism of the Minister.  I am trying to be honest and I am not being political.  I hope Deputy O'Malley will not be offended if I say that when he was Minister he was not in any way different. A great deal of legislation which was introduced was brought in in a similar way.  We must express very serious concern about this.  For instance, if an inspector of taxes overassesses somebody, or if he places an assessment on somebody which they are not in a position, because of an earlier amendment passed, to appeal, is that inspector of taxes liable for negligence?  Can a taxpayer in that case take similar action?  Where is the equity in that?  Subparagraph (g) talks about anybody who:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>obstructs, delays or interferes with any <Col N="2618" /> officer of the Revenue Commissioners, or any other person, in the exercise or performance of powers or duties under the Acts for the purposes of any tax. </P>
    <P>What is meant by &ldquo;delays&rdquo;?  What happens in an office of a practitioner of tax consultancy when somebody is out sick, or absent from his office or on some other business or some other activity?  Does that constitute a delay?  That type of provision would not be passed for any other section of the community.  I have the strongest reservations about it which should be expresed here and discussed by the House before this section is passed.</P>
    <P>I accept entirely&mdash;and this position has obtained for too long&mdash;that there are people in this State who are not paying their way, that there are people in this State who have not been making proper returns.  In an earlier debate I suggested that another way to approach this, particularly for business people whose returns are submitted by accountants, would be to create a State register of accountants. In that way if any accountant knowingly or wilfully submits accounts to an inspector of taxes which have been knowingly, wilfully and improperly prepared then, like any other professional person &mdash; say a doctor &mdash; that accountant should be struck off the register.  I believe that would be consistent with what is done in respect of abuses by other professions and would equally serve the end the Minister is seeking to achieve.  I really believe that those in this House who view totalitariansim as the end for which we should be aiming would be very happy with this provision.  I believe this is a dangerous provision which should not be nodded through.  Rather it should be given careful consideration because it will affect not only well-off-business men but also the liberties of very many other people.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point in regard to auditors not being officers.  Anybody who had studied company law will know that an auditor is not an officer.  There are many companies that do not have the services of a fulltime accountant whose auditor acts as accountant as well and in that role can act as an officer of the company. <Col N="2619" /> Presumably if he presents weekly or monthly figures, or if he deals with the tax affairs of the company, in addition to auditing its balance sheet, then he is acting in a controlling and management capacity.  In that case an auditor could, despite the advice the Minister has been given, find himself in difficulties under the provisions of this section.  This section warrants particular examination by legislators. It has been subjected to examination by everybody else.  I do not know from where it emanated but I believe the Minister would be doing a genuine service &mdash; and one which would not cause anybody to lose any face &mdash; if this section were referred to an all-party committee of this House to consider its implications because it really is a provision that warrants serious consideration before being passed.</P>

      <P>As the amendment is in my name, I just want to support what Deputy G. Mitchell has said.  You are aware of the fact, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that by agreement we had 30 hours to discuss 109 sections.  I just want to tell the House, the Minister and Deputy G. Mitchell in particular, that it was no accident that of those 30 hours for 109 sections I requested our Whip to provide three to discuss this one section, to provide one-tenth of the time to discuss one section in a Bill of 109 sections.  I clearly saw that this section is a minefield, as I have already described it.  But although we have had more time on this section than on any other, as Deputy G. Mitchell said, even three hours is not sufficient. Unless the Minister is prepared to withdraw it or accept our amendment, I want to support what Deputy Mitchell has said.</P>

      <P>Yes, I am speaking on Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment if I cannot move my own.  All I want to say is that we have witnessed the accountants' lobby screaming their heads off for the last hour and a half.  This is the first effort ever made to tackle the question of tax evaders and avoiders.  Tax evasion means children not receiving a proper education, people with medical cards unable to get drugs, elderly people unable to get medical treatment, people being put out of jobs, young people having no future &mdash; in fact the State being brought to the brink of financial ruin. That is what this is all about.  There is now an attempt being made to tackle these questions.  The people who are telling the Minister how to do it are the accountants and the legal people, who tell him how to get through these loopholes, how to avoid these taxes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The motion in my name and which I should have been allowed to move here was in fact endeavouring to strengthen that action.  I might add that if negligence is not incorporated these people will plead professional incompetence rather than be a party to the particular crime.</P>

The only decent elements in this dreadful Finance Bill are the attempts to get at the evaders.  It is a dreadful thing that it is being pushed to such an extent, that the only thing in this Bill on which the Minister is really being pilloried is the attempt to tackle the tax evaders, who have brought us to the state in which we find ourselves, who have PAYE workers screaming on the streets because they see them evading taxes.  This is one effort being made to deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion we have had here this evening has served extremely well the purpose of having a debate of this kind because it has brought out clearly the concern of Members on both sides of the House about the provisions that we have had for dealing with Revenue offences, about the extent to which we should sanction such offences and the degree to which we should attach culpability to those who are involved in the commission of those offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for that reason, and because of the concern that has been expressed, that I will undertake now to reconsider this section before Report Stage.  I am not sure what further procedures might be envisaged to deal with the concern that has been expressed here this evening, and in the minute and a half or so remaining, I would not be in a position to go into detail on all of the points that have <Col N="2622" /> been made here.  But what I want to assure the House of is that the concern that has been expressed here will be fully considered by me.  On the basis of that further reflection I will consider what is the most appropriate way of going about tackling the matters that are dealt with in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my appreciation to the Minister for his readiness to recognise the validity of the arguments we presented.  It vindicates the approach we have taken in asking that three hours be devoted to one section in a debate of 30 hours on 109 sections.  I want to express our genuine appreciation on the part of myself and my party.  In the light of that I hope the Minister will not now ask us to pass this section as it is because I am afraid we cannot.  I hope our opposition to it will be seen on the basis of the arguments that we have made but that we will have the opportunity of consultation on the basis that the Minister is suggesting also.</P>

That is very sincerely said because it is not every Minister who will accept points made in this way and in these circumstances. Although we will be opposing the section, if it were passed the proper procedure would be for the Minister on Report Stage to move to have it recommitted to a Committee of the full House and that would enable procedurally the kind of discussion that needs to take place.  That can be done by agreement without any difficulty and procedurally it would be the appropriate thing to do.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;child&rdquo; includes a stepchild and an illegitimate child whose parents have married each other after his birth and a child in respect of whom an adoption order under the Adoption Act, 1952, is in force; </P>

      <P>I am glad that I raised the question then.  We have an amendment down in any event to limit the income which is relevant in this case to the income of husband and wife as distinct from the aggregate of anybody else who may be residing in the house.  While normally the Minister would find every support for an extension of the definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo; to include step-child, adopted child and particularly illegitimate child, in this case we could not agree to support the Minister's proposal.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 90:</P>
      <P>In page 66, line 45, after &ldquo;Acts&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;as reduced by the provisions of section 137 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 and section 34 of the Finance Act, 1974, section 8 of the Finance Act, 1978, and section 23 of this Bill&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>To put it simply, we are talking about net taxable income.  We feel strongly that the aggregate income which the Minister has now indicated can include not just the aggregate income of husband and wife but the aggregate income of children, step-children, adopted children and illegitimate children who might have very little obligation or rights in terms of the family property.  If one aggregates all those incomes without coming into the wealthy class one could have an income in excess of £20,000.  We are anxious to achieve the confinement of the definition of income to net taxable income and as I have said that of husband and wife.  We wanted it to be not gross income but net taxable income.  That should commend itself to the Minister even if he is not prepared subsequently to agree to adopting our amendment which will confine the aggregate income to that of husband and wife.  He is thinking in terms of including the whole extended family and granny incidentally.  Surely it should be the net taxable income?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy has raised several different questions and I will not anticipate discussion of the later amendments by talking about some of the difficulties that would arise.  In regard to the aggregate income of husband and wife, I would point out what the particular sections of the various Acts mean in terms of the deduction that Deputy O'Kennedy proposes we make from the income in this case.  The allowances that are provided for in section 137 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 are the married allowance £2,900; the widowed allowance £1,950; the single allowance £1,450; the single parent allowance £1,450; the PAYE allowance £600; the child allowance £100; the incapacitated child allowance £500; dependant relative allowance £110; life insurance relief; medical insurance relief; health expenses relief; allowance for care of incapacitated person; the blind allowance and the age allowance. Under section 34 of the Finance Act, 1978, the allowances in question there are the relief to individuals on loans applied in acquiring an interest in companies and the allowance in question in section 23 of the present Bill is the relief for loan interest paid.  Those are the deductions which the Deputy is proposing to make from the income that would fall to be considered under the provisions of this part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The effect of this proposal would be to take a large number of people out of the scope of this tax and it would bring about considerable complication in the administration of the tax by requiring as large a number of factors to be taken into account to determine whether the extension granted by section 91 would apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection the Government's intention is that the tax would be collected by self-assessment without having too many bureaucratic elements involved.  In that connection it is necessary that the test for the applicability of the tax should be as simple as possible and that it should be based on a figure that would be easily computed and identified by the taxpayer.  If we introduce a complicated formula and a requirement to take account of all the different allowances, <Col N="2630" /> it is possible that many taxpayers would find self-assessment difficult and therefore would be inclined to leave the assessment to the Revenue Commissioners. I would not want that in relation to this tax.</P>
    <P>The intention behind this provision is to secure a contribution from those who have better than average houses but to exempt those whose taxable capacity, when measured by their incomes, would not be great enough to bear such a tax. A gross income level as defined in this part of the Bill of £20,000 is reasonable in regard to taxable capacity, having regard to the level of income and of the tax.  Therefore I hold with the view that it would be unnecessary and undesirable to introduce this level of complication into the formula required to determine whether the income level of the potential taxpayer would be such as to give rise to liability for tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said a moment ago that the object was to extract a contribution from the owners of better than average houses.  That leads me to wish that the rules of procedure of the House were such that we could discuss the section first and then the amendment, rather than the other way around.  What worries me is the philosophy, if it can be called that, behind this tax, the principle on which it is proposed to levy it, and from the way we arrange our affairs here it appears that we will get one shot only at discussing this matter, namely, when the amendments have been disposed of and the section has been dealt with, although the interest that has brought about 30 Deputies into the House centred not on the nuts and bolts of the individual amendments but on the principle behind this proposed system of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would make it easier for us in dealing with these amendments to outline briefly now, even if only in his own words, what exactly has moved the Government, other than the political exigencies which led to their formation &mdash; I wish Deputies on the far side would not laugh, because they are caught in exactly the same jam as Deputies on this <Col N="2631" /> side are caught in: it is not a subject for laughter and any Deputy over there who thinks it is is in the wrong building.</P>
    <P>At this stage of the debate I should like to know how the Minister justifies a levy on this type of property but on no other &mdash; I say that as somebody who has consistently, in good times and in bad, advocated a wealth tax &mdash; a levy on what he calls better than average residences. Without holding the Minister up, I wish the Minister would indicate that now so that in the course of any discussion that follows we will know exactly what the Government have in mind and how they propose to defend it, possibly in court.</P>

I should like to speak to the section and the amendments, including the Minister's amendment dealing with wrong evidence being given as part of evasion or avoidance. I should like to get clarification on what the distinction is.  I understand that tax evasion is when I owe tax to the State and do not pay it and that avoidance is when I manage through some devious, albeit clever or legitimate device not to pay tax.  We all know professional people &mdash; this is no reflection on their integrity &mdash; who advise people about how they may avoid paying tax.  Is that a crime? This is happening.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant to the provisions we are discussing and to each of the amendments we are going to discuss. Deputy Kelly asked the reason for having this tax and why it figures in this Finance Bill.  In broad terms the reason for that tax could be outlined as follows.</P>
      <P>The level of capital taxation is now less than it was some years ago for a number of different reasons, particularly because of changes made in the tax system.  The main property most people own, their residence, is not directly subject to tax, again as a result of particular decisions made on taxation in recent years, and where the value of that property can be taken as one indicator among many, but an indicator nevertheless, of that person's material well-being, wealth, or a reflection of his income, there is a case to be made for saying that the contribution a taxpayer would make to the general Exchequer, the public purse, should bear some relation to the value of that property. It is, broadly speaking, for those reasons that that tax was proposed in the first place.  The rest of the section and the amendments deal with the method of application of that tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a capital tax.  In the normal way, <Col N="2633" /> the principal asset of any taxpayer is the biggest piece of capital he owns, and in most cases his residence is his wealth, his well-being or his income.  Therefore it can be regarded as a measure of his ability to contribute to the public purse and to participate in providing the necessary resources for the State to carry out their activities.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his enunciation and broad outline of the purport of this tax, but I do not think he is meeting the innuendo cast on this issue by Deputy Kelly, and he did not give the answer for which Deputy Kelly was hoping.  I can give Deputy Kelly an answer, if I may be so bold.  The answer is yes, the purport of this tax was the result of pressure by the Labour Party, and rightly so.  If that was his innuendo then the Labour Party willingly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy did not say it plainly.  It was done by innuendo to the accompaniment of some mild amusement on the Fianna Fáil front bench.  Let us be clear about this.  What is wrong with this tax?  Why the complaints?  Why this series of amendments from the Opposition to cut down what is, even in the form proposed, a very modest tax which will affect very few people who will be well able to pay?  Those who occupy a dwelling house worth about £65,000 and upwards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What is the extent of this tax?  On a house worth £75,000 there is an excess of £10,000, and this means they will have to pay £150 a year.</P>

      <P>It certainly is to many people, but to people living in a £75,000 house with an income of £20,000 a year, £150 is a very modest sum.  Even that is regarded as a subject of chipping away by way of amendments put down by Deputy O'Kennedy.  There could be, and there has been, criticism levelled at this tax because it does not go far enough, but I find it remarkable that the thrust of objections to the tax should be put on the basis that people living in a £75,000 house with an income of £20,000 would object to paying the modest tax provided for here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say this in all friendship to Deputy Taylor whom I respect and value as a colleague.  I know him too well to suppose that he misunderstands me but I am not whinging nor is anybody else I represent inside or outside my constituency about the sums they are likely to have to pay under this tax.  I live in a very good house and I would be paying under this tax, as I work it out, a good deal less than I would now be paying if the rates system still existed. I am not whinging about it, but complaining about its lack of reason, the defective rationality which underlies it, the fact that it was cooked up in the back room of a party other than my own, whom I respect and admire in many ways, and sold as part of a package.  It is something which no Deputy in my party sold at the doorstep of any voter whose vote and support was invited.  Had I been asked on the doorstep about this tax I would have found it hard to explain to many in my constituency who are not millionaires and who in these times are put to the pin of their collars to maintain a standard of living to which they always supposed that they were entitled to aspire, not by cheating or tax evasion but by hard work, prudence and thrift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know the rational philosophy which underlies this measure because I am afraid the Minister has not satisfied me in his attempt to explain.  I say sincerely and with no undertone, and hope that it will not be accepted as sarcasm, <Col N="2635" /> that the Minister has had a hellish day.  He has been on his feet literally &mdash; or certainly figuratively, because his mind must be at work &mdash; for over 12 hours with only a short break.  Nobody is at his best at this hour of night.  I would far prefer to argue this matter out in the morning, if it is possible to argue it out in the time constraints confronting us.  I do not mean to torment the Minister, a colleague whom I deeply respect and admire.  I know he will accept that without my saying any more about it.</P>
    <P>Let me make a few comments on his defence of a tax which I have heard him for the first time today defend and which he was never asked to defend in County Kildare last November.  He said that the level of capital taxation was now somewhat less &mdash; I wrote down as fast as I could his exact words &mdash; than it was some years ago.  That is an amazing litotes, making something little which should really be big.  The truth is that the contribution made by capital taxation in any shape or form to State revenue in 1983 is little more than a quarter of what it was in 1973.  That is an amazing fact.  It is hard to believe that in 1973 almost four times more was being contributed, as I understand it, to the national revenue by capital taxation than is now being contributed.  To that extent, I am completely in the camp not alone of Deputies Taylor and McLoughlin, but in the camp of The Workers' Party.</P>

      <P>I regard it as scandalous that in ten years we should have changed the equilibrium of our tax system in a way so regressive and burdensome to ordinary wage earners.  Although I believe that Deputies MacGiolla and De Rossa and those who like them talk nonsense when advocating economic salvation through enhanced State investment, they are absolutely right to complain about that tax.  The way that came about was this.  The 1973 Coalition &mdash; one of the best Governments that this State ever had, in spite of many mistakes <Col N="2636" /> and a lot of bad luck, and for which it is my enduring pride to have worked and sweated for four years &mdash; came to power on a pre-election programme agreed beforehand in which one of the items was the abolition of death duties, which was a great boost.  Of that there is no doubt. The value of land had risen here with enormous rapidity due to our appearing to be going to join and then in effect joining the European Community.  Families with a sudden unforeseen death found themselves faced with enormous, crushing bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I have hauled out into deep waters to reply to the Minister's couple of simple sentences on the reduced level of the contribution made by capital taxation.  The Minister, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party are right to point that out.  The only people who have not complained and pointed it out are my friends in the Fianna Fáil Party who seem able to live with the fact that we are now contributing that much less in capital taxation than we were ten years ago.  That is obviously wrong. If the Minister's case could be made by that alone, I would support him with a full heart.  But I cannot do that because he is not doing what he should be doing and what this House ought to be able to achieve a consensus about some rational, non-punitive, non-ideological, nondestructive system of bringing people's substance into contribution towards the State's expenses, not in a sense of vindictiveness or a spirit of doing them down because they are rich, but bringing their substance into contribution because God gave them what it takes to amass substance. He denied it to others and to their <Col N="2637" /> children and their grandchildren in the kind of State in which we live.  I hope it will not be always so, but it is so far. Nobody has been able to think of a cure for it which combines civil liberty with social justice.</P>
      <P>If the Minister had said he would reintroduce not just what the Labour Party demanded last November and December but the old 1975 wealth tax &mdash; reformed, civilised, refined in this and that way, made more flexible and with perhaps better allowances, the level of inflation taken into account, allowances made for investment in productive industry or agriculture &mdash; that would have been something I would have cheered on.  However, he has not done that.  He knows that I am not speaking to him personally or to the rest of my party personally, but what he has found himself landed with is producing a package behind which there is no thought.  It simply spun off the top of the head of somebody who probably never sought election to this House and never would get elected if he sought it.</P>

      <P>I will not say that my heart bled for the Minister &mdash; one throws out expressions like that so often that they become demonetised and worthless.  I really felt sorry for him putting up the two points which he did put up.  His first expression was &ldquo;the property which most people&rdquo; and he corrected that then to &ldquo;many people&rdquo;.  He said that the main property which most or many people own was their residence and it was not now subject to tax.  The entire farming population, unless they live on farms of less than seven or eight acres are in a category which his definition does not include. Their main wealth is not in the bricks and mortar above their heads, but in the acres around them.  That entire community is laughing over this residential property tax.  For the most part, unless they live in gentlemen's residences with easy access to cities and airports, to schools and buses, they live in houses which do not come anywhere near the value of the holdings out of which they make their living.  That entire area has to be <Col N="2638" /> excluded, as the Minister in front of me, who was Minister for Agriculture, must know perfectly well.  Anyone who is a bit of an investor, who believes in buying house property &mdash; and many people have strings of house property &mdash; could live modestly, and be caught for nothing. They are not caught on their own residence because it is under the threshold and not caught either on the property which they own and in which other people live, because they do not occupy and own it simultaneously.  Where is the reason for that?</P>
      <P>Another point which I would like to mention and I do not need to hammer it home is that this form of property is not taxed as Deputy Lenihan would say if he were here, &ldquo;at this moment in time,&rdquo; but that will not be the case once the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill goes through entitling local authorities to charge for the provision of services, for refuse collection, for the supply of water and even for library services.  I might add that I had an agonising appeal today about that from a library society.  Therefore, where is the philosophical, the rationale or even the ideological basis in this that would make sense either to Fianna Fáil or to Fine Gael and to a good number of the Labour Deputies, too? Pathetically, the Minister said that it was an indicator of wealth but that was what was said, too, in the days of George II when there was a window tax, when the amount of light a man could afford to let into his house was taken as a rough index of the amount of wall space he had and that in turn was a crude indicator of the cubic content of the house.  There was a tax on the number of windows in a house because they could be seen easily and controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are talking about here is an index of wealth but it is about as crude and primitive an index of wealth as could possibly occur to the mind of a man who does not have to stand for election but who can sit, I will not say in the Labour Party headquarters but in some back room of a back house in some back suburb and think up such a plan to foist on a Coalition Government who have enough problems to contend with without <Col N="2639" /> having to digest this place of irrational ideology.</P>

      <P>I have been trying to pay attention to Deputy Kelly to detect how near or how far he was from the amendment before the House. When I was in the Chair last I stated that I would give some latitude but we cannot have a Second Stage debate on capital taxation nor can we treat this Bill as if it were a White Paper on taxation.  I hope Deputies will bear that in mind and that we can deal now with the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It suits me personally and also my party that you have made that ruling because, first, I would not have the capacity, the conviction or the flow of oratory that Deputy Kelly has just displayed.  In your absence we were anxious to allow the Minister reply to Deputy Kelly's request, so that before we come to individual sections we would have some notion from the Minister as to why a provision of this sort should have been proposed.  We have had a very interesting analysis from both Deputy Taylor who takes the view that the provision does not go far enough and from Deputy Kelly who clearly opposes it.  I do not intend repeating his reasons for opposing it because Deputy Kelly's capacity to express himself cannot be measured up to by anyone else.  However, we are in sympathy with many of the points he made.  When this tax was proposed we said that, while in the circumstances in which we find ourselves we were not opposed in principle to the tax, it did contain many injustices, inequities and anomalies and that we would be introducing amendments at this stage.  We have agreed to allow four or five hours for discussion of the provision because we regard it as important to rectify the situation.  It is for that reason that we tabled the amendment before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks to have the income qualification taken as the net taxable income but the Minister has pointed out that included in the qualification are the allowances under the income tax code.  He went on to list the <Col N="2640" /> whole range of allowances &mdash; blind persons' allowances, children's allowances, disability benefits, pensions and so on. That is the very point we agree with.  We know that these allowances are all there under the income tax code but we do not think that any one person or any two or three persons could claim the benefits simultaneously of all of them.  We are anxious to ensure that old age pensions will not be included as income for the purposes of this section.  We are anxious to ensure that blind allowances will not be included either for this purpose and that children's allowances will be allowed before assessing income.  In other words, we are anxious to ensure that all the allowances mentioned in the amendment will be allowed before assessing income for the purpose of the provision.  If there is some miracle person or persons who can claim the benefit of all these allowances at the one time we are not dealing with a new kind of tax but with a new kind of person.  It never occurred to me that we would find such a person.</P>
    <P>The Minister said also that one of the reasons for not accepting the amendment is that it would lead to too many bureaucratic elements being involved.  One of the strong reservations we have about the provision is that it will be a treasure hunt for bureaucracy but I will come back to that point later.  If the Minister has problems in regard to this tax he has caused them himself.  We are told that people would find self-assessment difficult. People know what their tax liability is. PAYE payers are certainly aware of their liabilities in this area and others who may not know will know after this Bill has been passed, having regard to the increased powers being provided for the investigation of accounts and so on. Therefore, I regard it as a spurious argument for the Minister to reject our proposal on the basis that people would have difficulty in knowing what their taxable income is.</P>
    <P>It is proper that the allowances we list should be allowed for in computing liability, especially if the Minister is persisting in including subsequently the combined income of the extended family, of husband, wife, grandma, grandpa, step-children, <Col N="2641" /> adopted children, illegitimate children or any others who happen to be living in the home.  Surely if we are to proceed on those lines in terms of the assessment of income we should at least be talking about taxable income.  If the Minister cannot accept my amendment, we should vote on it now.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy is allowing himself to be carried away on this matter.  He refers to the question of pensions in the context of this provision but is he not aware that any old age pensioner who is in receipt of a second pension has his tax-free allowance reduced by the amount of his old age pension?  When the Deputy was Minister for Finance I do not recall his shedding any tears for people in that situation.  We know what the Deputy's record is on captial taxation.  We know what he did on his return to office in 1978.  He merely wrote off millions of pounds with one stroke of the pen.  Of course he is concerned and agrees with Deputy Kelly. Neither of them wants this tax but the Labour Party would have sold this much easier to the people on the doorsteps than they would have sold the 1 per cent levy or the reduction in tax-free allowances. In a full year the 1 per cent levy will yield £77 million from the PAYE sector.  Let us not forget that of the total tax paid, 90 per cent comes from the PAYE sector while the amount accruing by way of capital taxation is a farce.  Neither of the main conservative parties have the guts to introduce proper capital taxation.</P>

      <P>On those specific questions, the anticipated yield of the tax in the form in which it is proposed in the Bill will be less than £10 million and probably somewhere in the region of £6 million.  The effect of Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment on that is difficult to estimate, but it would reduce the yield to a very small proportion of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a caricature of the debate for Deputy O'Kennedy to claim that I expected to find a taxpayer who benefited from all these allowances.  I want to make clear which allowances he was speaking of in his amendment.  It is a wholesale exaggeration for Deputy O'Kennedy to refer to an old age pensioner in the context of this tax as being a person who would be immediately liable for it.  The income qualification I mentioned of £20,000 would not be met by an old age pensioner in the sense in which we all understand that term.  As the tax is defined here, an old age pensioner could be a member of a family and therefore fail to be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a completely different situation.  The reason I am opposing this amendment and resisting the idea of taking account of the various allowances specified in Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment is that the figure for income is not in itself a measure of the tax payable. The income figure here represents a threshold level.  The tax payable becomes payable if the total income of the household exceeds that threshold level and if, in addition to that, the value of the house in question exceeds £65,000. Since the income itself is not a basis for the tax to be paid, and since we are breaking new ground in terms of taxation in this respect, I do not believe it is appropriate to make the kind of deductions which the Deputy wishes to make in this amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Seán Walsh has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment a matter relating to people who had difficulty signing the unemployment register in Tallaght on Tuesday last.  He has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter.  I do not intend to take my full time.  On Tuesday last the unemployed people of Tallaght were denied the opportunity of signing the register in the normal way.  Perhaps I should say that they were delayed rather than denied.  Public representatives in the area have on many occasions raised the matter of the totally inadequate facilities at Tallaght Garda station.  Approximately 3,000 people normally sign the unemployment register there and the gardaí decided on a go slow, as a result of which there was total chaos.  Towards evening the unemployed decided to block the road because they felt they might be deprived of the opportunity of signing the register.  As a result of the intervention of other people the matter was resolved and the unemployed were able to sign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise the matter because I am concerned about what will happen next Tuesday. The problem of inadequate facilities has existed for some time and has not arisen during the past few months.  All public representatives in the area have made representations regarding Tallaght Garda station and I hope the Minister will be able to give us some information <Col N="2647" /> on the matter.  Tallaght New Town is an area which is hard hit by unemployment. We were told that extra accommodation would be provided at the Garda station but we were subsequently told that it would take some time.  I would ask the Minister to listen to what I have to say.</P>

      <P>The gardaí in Tallaght are totally dissatisfied with their accommodation and the inadequate facilities for those signing the register.  The problem has existed under successive Governments and has been exacerbated in recent months by the increase in the numbers of unemployed. There are no politics in this matter and we must work together to solve the problem.  I have no objection to members of other parties joining in this debate and I appreciate the opportunity of raising the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the remarks of Deputy Walsh in highlighting the terrible dilemma and the awful humiliation of the unemployed in Tallaght last Tuesday.  It is bad enough to be unemployed but it is even worse when one has to queue in the rain on the street in order to sign for one's entitlements. On Tuesday last thousands of people in Tallaght had to queue throughout the day, some until 7.30 p.m.  I find that an appalling situation.  It is a situation which <Col N="2648" /> we cannot allow to continue.  I hope that as a result of Deputy Walsh raising this matter here tonight the Minister can give us some assurance that this will not continue in any area and particularly in Tallaght.</P>
      <P>I have said for some time that a Garda station is not the right place for an unemployed person to have to sign on for benefit.  It is taking up the time of gardaí who would be more usefully employed fighting the very high crime rate which unfortunately has developed in many of our new towns, and Tallaght is no exception. Every Tuesday it takes almost five gardaí the whole day to go through the procedure of witnessing signing on. Given that there are never more than 16 gardaí on duty at any one time in the Tallaght Garda station this is taking up an undue amount of manpower and of the time of the gardaí.</P>
      <P>I can quite understand why the gardaí decided to make some kind of formal protest to the Government.  It is not their responsibility, it should not be their duty and until such time as Tallaght and places like it have properly equipped labour exchanges where the unemployed people can come along and sign on in the proper dignified way, this problem will not be solved.  The people, humiliated as they were, in their despair decided to block the roads in order to highlight the situation.  They did it not only to highlight the humiliation they have to endure in order to get their unemployment benefit but also to bring home to the people of Tallaght the unemployment level which now exists there.  Given the recent closure of Telectron and the very poor job prospects that exist in the area there will be many hundreds of people, particularly young people, adding to the unemployment figure in the area over the next few months.  The time has come for the Government to find some venue in Tallaght where unemployed people can go and, under the proper supervision, sign on for their payment and at the same time their job prospects can be investigated. This is how unemployed people should be treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Walsh for raising this matter and I hope that as a result <Col N="2649" /> some good will come to the unfortunate people who have to sign on and that they will not have to endure this humiliation any longer.  There is no point in the Minister telling us that he hopes this will not occur again.  He may hope that it will not but unless some assurance can be given to the gardaí I can well understand the dilemma which they face because continuously, in the Tallaght area, they are being accused of not fulfilling their obligations to the public in not fighting the crime rate and yet, week in week out, four of the gardaí have to spend the whole day simply watching people sign on for unemployment benefit.  That should not be the job of a garda and it is time it was put in the hands of people who are qualified to look after the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can give us a commitment on when we may expect a properly equipped labour exchange in Tallaght, an area of over 60,000 people, which is, in itself, a city well worthy of such a service, a city which should not have to see its unemployed people queue along the side of the street to sign on.  It is no wonder that many of them hold newspapers to their faces, so ashamed are they to have to queue in that way.  It gives the impression that they are in some way begging for an existence.  That should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation to Deputy Walsh for allowing me to say a few words on the matter which he so properly raised on the Adjournment.  I concur with the remarks of my two constituency colleagues on this matter.  It is a scandalous situation that Garda stations have been used and have come to be accepted by the Department of Social Welfare as appropriate venues for people to go to sign the register.  I want to protest about this.  It is entirely inappropriate and a scandalous situation that the forces of law and order are being used for an entirely different Government service namely the work of the Department of Social Welfare.  Huge numbers of people have to attend to the paper work and documentation necessary each week.  The Department of Social Welfare must provide the premises and their own civil service staff should <Col N="2650" /> see to this work which is entirely separate from the work of the Gardaí, who come under the Department of Justice.  As Deputy Walsh said, this is not a party political matter.  The criticism is directed not against this Government but against all the Governments that have gone past in quick succession and have failed to do anything about this problem.  The Minister has been in office for some months. There was a Fianna Fáil Government before that, the previous Coalition before that and so on.  All of them in succession have failed to do anything about this problem.  It is not confined to Tallaght.  No doubt it exists in Clondalkin and many other places.  I have seen people in the most appalling weather queuing for many hours.  The Garda Síochána is a highly responsible force and they would not indulge in a protest of this nature unless an extreme situation existed.  It would appear that the Gardaí organised a deliberate go-slow operation with this work.  That in itself is an indication of how strongly they feel about the situation that has been allowed to develop in Tallaght.  This matter is now urgent and must not be allowed to continue. The Department of Social Welfare must find their own premises and have their own staff and take this work out of the hands of servants of the Department of Justice, the law enforcement agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret the entirely unacceptable delay which occurred in Tallaght last Tuesday and I and my Department will do our utmost to ensure that it will not happen again.  There are some 3,600 unemployed persons in Tallaght who are claiming unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance. All the claim forms have been certified; all the payments will be made this week at the normal times.  Therefore, nobody will be at a loss.  Nobody was denied the opportunity to sign on; though there was an excessive delay, because members of the Garda, who are entitled to so ask, decided to ask claimants orally the questions which are usually put, namely, whether persons were unemployed and unable to obtain suitable <Col N="2651" /> employment, whether they were capable of work and available for employment and questions relating thereto, whether they were in receipt of disability or injury benefit or invalidity or retirement pensions. The putting of these questions resulted in excessive delay.  Questions about whether persons were unemployed or not and whether they were in receipt of invalidity or retirement pensions are not usually put, but on this occasion they were put.  I do not think this delay should have occurred, and even if the Garda have a particular grievance in relation to Tallaght, they should not take it out on the unemployed.  I strongly hold that view.</P>
      <P>The procedure of certification carried out in the Garda station is a temporary arrangement pending the provision of an employment exchange in the area.  My Department propose to erect a new exchange in the Tallaght New Town centre when the centre has been built; but, as Deputies know, that could be some time away.  It is proposed to provide a temporary employment exchange as soon as possible and my Department actively have been seeking premises for that purpose.</P>
      <P>We had intended to open a temporary exchange in the post office premises in the main street which had been expected to be vacated on the opening of a new post office on the Old Bawn Road, but it is now understood that the post office will not be vacated in the main street.  Therefore, the Department are arranging with the Office of Public Works to have the premises at Old Bawn Road made available for use as an employment exchange. The acquisition of these premises is being dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, however, is likely to take about a year.  My Department, therefore, are seeking to provide alternative arrangements for claim certification in the meantime. This will involve the setting up of a temporary centre and negotiations are taking place with the Eastern Health Board for the provision of a suitable site for a temporary office which would be staffed by the Department.  The Department have a site in mind at present and <Col N="2652" /> its preparation will be arranged as a matter of urgency.  I am satisfied that this arrangement will provide a satisfactory short-term solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor made the point, with which I agree, that in recent years we have had similar situations in Blanchardstown and Clondalkin.  The Department of Justice have made strong representations to be relieved of Garda certification. The setting up of the Navan Road exchange to cater for the Blanchardstown area solved the problem there.  We are endeavouring to set up a signing center, to be staffed by the Department, at Clondalkin in a scouts' hall which is suitable for the purpose.  However, the OPW have been unable to agree on the rent to be charged and progress is held up on that account.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies that it would be a tremendous advantage to have a signing centre at Tallaght, staffed by the Department. Then we could spread the signing over several days, thus reducing the numbers who attend daily.  We could have pre-computed dockets which could be handed to applicants for cashing in the post office the following day.  This would reduce security risk at the post office and would eliminate the need for postal delivery of the pay vouchers.</P>
    <P>I am extremely anxious to have an office staffed by the Department in Tallaght as quickly as possible.  Next Tuesday I have no reason to doubt that the Garda will provide sufficient staff to carry out certification.  Last Tuesday one extra garda was provided, and I hope these arrangements will be continued until we can establish our own temporary arrangements.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for having brought the matter directly to my attention.  I have had correspondence with a number of Deputies on the matter in the past few days and they may be assured that I am taking an active interest in it.  I will do my utmost to ensure there will not be undue inconvenience or delays in the certification of claims in the area.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit for 52 weeks from 9 July 1981 to 10 July 1982.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts a person must have a minimum of 156 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment in order to qualify for payment of disability benefit for a period exceeding 52 weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the records of my Department the person concerned has a total of only 108 paid contributions since her entry into insurable employment in February 1978.  Her entitlement to disability benefit ceased, therefore, after 10 July 1982.  In order to requalify for payment she would need at least a further 13 weeks employment for which contributions <Col N="2477" /> at the appropriate rate have been paid.</P>

      <P>Arrears of unmarried mother's allowance in respect of the period from 3 March 1983 to 18 May 1983 have been offset against a claim for refund of supplementary welfare allowance paid to the person concerned by the North-Western Health Board during that period, and against an overpayment of unmarried mother's allowance previously incurred by her amounting to £1,286.80.  Accordingly no arrears are now payable to her.  A deduction of £5 per week from the allowance currently payable has been arranged with her towards refunding the balance of the overpayment.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the redundancies among its assembly workers proposed by Talbot Ireland Limited in February 1981, when that company ceased car assembly.  Neither the number of such redundancies, nor the terms offered to the workers concerned, required or involved the agreement of the then Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals put by the company to the Minister at that time related, not to redundancies, but to the deployment on other duties of part of the company's assembly work force and to other measures which, taken together, constituted <Col N="2482" /> the company's case for the grant of facilities for the continued importation of fully built up motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>In considering the grant of very restricted facilities to import f.b.u. vehicles the overriding consideration of the Minister was the preservation, to the fullest extent possible, of employment both in the company and in its dealer network throughout the country.</P>

      <P>He received 156 days of benefit on 29 March 1983 and as he did not satisfy the contribution condition of having 280 paid contributions in the seven years preceding his claim the personal rate of benefit was reduced from £31.65 to £26.25.

      <P>He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and following the completion of further inquiries into his means the appeals officer reduced the weekly means to £35.00.

However, in the signing docket for 19 April 1983 the person concerned had put the letter &ldquo;O&rdquo; opposite every day of that week and it was therefore assumed by the local office that she had taken up employment and they ceased to issue her with further signing dockets.</P>
      <P>She contacted the local office recently in the matter and signing dockets for the period from 13 April to 24 May 1983, have been issued to her for completion and certification by the Garda.  Arrangements have been made to pay all arrears due to her this week.</P>
