    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the number of farmers to whom payments of resource tax have been remitted under section 17 of the Finance Act, 1982; and the total moneys remitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Resource tax has been refunded to a total of 2,204 persons in accordance with the provisions of section 17 of the Finance Act, 1982.  The total amount refunded was £855,714.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this the total amount which the farmers paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the total amount refunded to those who had paid the tax under the provisions of the relevant Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this all the money which the farmers paid to this tax?  Have they returned all of the tax at this stage, or is there more to come?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There were amounts which were paid and not refunded owing to a <Col N="1164" /> number of provisions under the Act governing the operation of the tax itself. Indeed, included in the amount refunded was a sum of £14,643 in respect of interest which was paid to 134 taxpayers &mdash; 134 of those to whom tax refunds were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that the State has paid interest to the farmers for the tax paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  Those 134 were cases in which the assessments of resource tax were appealed but in which specified amounts of resource tax had been paid pending determination of the appeal.  In those cases the legislation provided for a refund to be made with interest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is a situation were people are being refunded tax which they were obliged to pay from incomes.  Yet there is no provision for workers to claim back tax which they are paying and which they were legally obliged to pay.  Could the Minister give any justification for the refund of tax in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  A decision was made to refund amounts of resource tax on foot of a Government decision based on the conviction that the tax in itself had been an unfair one to apply in the first place. This was subsequently borne out by events.  Once that decision had been made, the Government moved on to a decision to refund the amounts which had been paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance when the dog licensing fee was last increased.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the amount of money that was collected in dog licensing fees in the last financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The duty on a dog licence was last increased in 1975.</P>
      <P>The amount of duty collected in respect of dog licences in 1981, which is the latest year for which complete figures are available, was £120,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is an urgent need to review the dog licence fees by reason of the proliferation of dogs in circulation and the fact that they caused £2 million worth of damage to sheep farmers last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is a great deal of anxiety about the damage being caused by dogs and of a number of proposals to the effect that we could increase the dog licence fee and in some cases use the revenue derived from dog licence fees to assist local authorities in taking measures to control dogs.  However, the measures which are being taken by certain local authorities are funded through the normal funding arrangements of those local authorities.  The dog licences, as the House is aware, are a duty collected for the benefit of the Exchequer.  In fact, in provisions made for local authorities there is no bar to the procedure, as practised, of making provision <Col N="1166" /> for activities in which they are involved in controlling dogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept, in view of his reply to Deputy Taylor's question, that it would be very simple to introduce the necessary legislation to deal with this problem and the Government would have the sympathy of all Members of this House in that respect?  Deputy Taylor has rightly said that enormous damage has been caused by stray dogs in the south Dublin area and, indeed, the north Dublin area. Would the Minister not now consider freeing himself from the regulations and the old legislation and bringing in new legislation to deal with this problem, so that the sheep farmers in the Dublin mountains can be protected?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being quite reasonable.  I wanted to ask the Minister this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy with the case which the Deputy is making.  He may remember that when on the Opposition benches I made a similar case.  I am very anxious that we should have proper measures to assist in the control of dogs and the curbing of the amount of damage being done by them.  As I said, there are existing provisions under which local authorities can take steps to deal with this problem.  I do not consider that these are adequate and will be discussing the matter with my colleagues in the Departments of Agriculture, the Environment and Justice in order to see if we can find a better way of dealing with this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the number of foreign banks operating in the country; and if he will give an assessment of the extent of their operations.</P>

    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank are statutorily responsible for the licensing and supervision of banks.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Central Bank that there are currently 26 externally owned banks licensed to operate in the State.  These include branches and locally incorporated subsidiaries.  They hold about 34 per cent of the total gross assets of all licensed banks.</P>
      <P>Two of the associated banks are incorporated in Northern Ireland and provide a full branch banking service to personal and corporate customers.  The remaining foreign-owned banks provide facilities mainly for business and commercial customers in the public and private sector and have only a limited number of offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank have laid down supervisory requirements and standards for licensed banks.  These were last revised in 1981 and were published in the Central Bank Autumn Bulletin of that year.  They apply uniformly to all licensed banks including those which are externally <Col N="1168" /> owned.  In this regard I would point out that under EEC law, in particular the First Banking Directive 77/780/EEC, a bank incorporated in a member state is entitled to freedom of establishment in the other member states of the Community on the same basis as applies to domestic banks.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank are satisfied that their supervisory requirements and standards are adequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there has been a remarkable increase in the number of foreign banks operating in the State in recent times, many from outside the EEC area?  Can the Minister assure the House that effective control is exercised over these foreign banks in directing their lending policy towards productive industry and job creation in the same manner as would be applicable to domestic banks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are foreign banks from non-EEC countries which have some operations here.  To the extent that they carry out banking operations here they are subject to the same rules as those applicable to our banks and to banks from EEC countries that are established here.  They are subject, for all of their operations here, to the same supervisory control as that applied by the Central Bank to banks established here.</P>

      <P>The preparation of contract documents for the proposed new school at Kilclooney is nearing completion.  It has been found necessary to engage the services of a structural engineer as site conditions are likely to cause construction problems.</P>
      <P>This will mean some delay in completing the contract documents and in going to tender.  It is too early to say as yet when building work will commence.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this new school will replace two old schools at Kilclooney and Clogher?  Is he further aware that the Clogher school is over 100 years old, that it is a school of which none of us can be proud, where there are two teachers, one classroom, one pre-fab which is rat-infested?

But the planning permission for the revised scheme was received only in November 1981 so the Deputy will see that it has taken some time.  But the preparation of contract documents is nearing completion.  However, the site conditions have given rise to problems.  I have not the date on which we engaged the services of the structural engineer but he has had to be engaged.  I can assure the Deputy that everything will be completed as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that there has been an undue delay in this case.  In December 1981 the Department of Education sanctioned a grant towards the cost of re-roofing Claddagh national school, Galway, and other works.  The job is a complex one and the contract documents were not completed until July 1982.  Tenders have been received for the work and their examination has now been completed.</P>
      <P>The school manager, within the last few days, has confirmed that alternative accommodation is available for classes while the work is in progress and has also lodged the local contribution.  A contract for the works will be placed within a week.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to a report in the last issue of <i>Oibre</i>, the bulletin of the Commissioners <Col N="1173" /> of Public Works, which stated that Irish carpet layers travelled to the Irish Embassy in Peking, China, to lay carpets; and, if so, the cost of the trip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the article in <i>Oibre</i> referred to in the question. As part of the fitting out of the new embassy in Peking a contract was placed with an Irish firm in May 1980 for the supply, delivery and laying of Irish made carpets.  As the tender was a lump sum one including, <i>inter alia,</i> the cost of sending men to fit the carpets, the information sought by the Deputy is not available.  In any event, it is contrary to established practice to disclose details of an accepted tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disturbed to hear that information regarding the cost is not available.  Does the Minister of State accept that county councils and local authorities issue to the press the results of a whole range of tenders for goods and services?  Why does the Office of Public Works not do so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems strange that this was a lump sum tender.  Admittedly tenders were sought from Irish manufacturers. I take it they were competitive.  It is unreasonable to assume that because it is a comparatively simple job to lay a carpet, the carpets could have been shipped out there and laid by craftsmen in that country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>All firms are anxious to lay their own carpets.  It would remind me of somebody buying a bottle of wine and bringing it to a lounge barman and asking him to open it.  The Irish firms were competitive but the price was an all-in price for laying the carpet and bringing it out there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that we cannot get the figure.  As public representatives we are entitled to that.  Newspaper <Col N="1174" /> reports have suggested that it would cost many thousands of pounds not alone to lay the carpet but for the flights out to and back from Peking.  How does the Minister justify the cost when there would be only a few hours work involved in laying a carpet?  I take it China would have the expertise to lay a carpet since they built the atomic bomb.  I do not see any validity in the Minister of State's argument.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Any development likely to affect the solvency of insurers or impact on the level of motor insurance premiums is obviously of concern to me. I understand that the ruling in the particular case referred to by the Deputy may be the subject of appeal to the Supreme Court and any comprehensive examination of the matter must await this.</P>
      <P>The O'Connor Committee of Inquiry into the Insurance Industry in its Interim Report on Motor Insurance made a number of recommendations.  I take it the Deputy is referring in particular to the recommendation relating to the concept of liability irrespective of fault.  This concept is, of course, one which has far-reaching implications for our legal system; if it were to be introduced, it would have to be dealt with in a far wider context than that of the motor sector only.</P>
      <P>Part of the thinking behind that recommendation was the elimination of unnecessary costs and delays involved in processing cases through the courts.  As the Deputy is aware, the 1981 Courts Act provided for a substantial increase in the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts, and it is expected that this will reduce the number of cases going to higher courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also mention the Prices Advisory Committee set up in November 1981 to inquire into the cost of motor insurance. Its terms of reference included investigation of the legal liability of owners and drivers of mechanically propelled <Col N="1183" /> vehicles and the system of assessing and determining such liability and the damages or compensation in respect of such loss or damage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>These questions impinge in varying degrees on what could be described as the area of consumer credit.  A number of international institutions including the EEC have been considering different aspects for several years past.  Consumer credit features in the EEC first and second consumer programmes and a draft directive has been under discussion for some time.  However, it is not possible at this stage to say when work on this will be finally completed or indeed what shape the eventual directive is likely to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable that credit arrangements, whether in the area of HP, credit sales or cash loans from financial institutions, should put the customer in a position where he can shop around intelligently <Col N="1186" /> for the best credit bargain and make an informed decision.</P>
    <P>I also accept that there should be certain minimum safeguards and protections built into any regime of consumer credit.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific matters raised in the questions I do accept the desirability of reviewing them to see to what extent they should be subject to control; it may be possible, but this remains to be established, to deal with them to some extent by using existing legislation.</P>
    <P>In this examination we will, of course, also have to take cognisance of developments on the European front.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that where legislative reform is necessary and desirable we do not necessarily have to wait until directives are issued by the EEC for the purpose?  The point referred to by Deputy Bruton is a valid one because people are genuinely misled by rates of interest being suggested which are not altogether in accordance with the facts.  For example, suggested rates of interest may be 6 per cent while in reality they might be as high as 30 or 40 per cent. That requires urgent attention and we should not wait for the EEC to move.</P>

I am at present reviewing the capital allocation of my Department taking account of the contractual commitments entered into, the level of resource available to me, and the priorities of the health agencies.</P>
      <P>In this regard I should perhaps say that in calculating the capital to be made available to the Department of Health for the years 1983-87 for the purpose of the publication of <i>The Way Forward</i> the previous Government provided for a start in building on Ardkeen in late 1986.  Realistically, in the present economic circumstances, I cannot see that the project has any chance of starting earlier than was provided for, namely late 1986.</P>

I am also aware that the cost of the development would be £40 million, presumably at 1982 prices, and that the building would take about five years to complete.  In view of the contractual commitments for the next two or three years, and the review I am currently undertaking, I should like to reiterate that there is no prospect whatsoever of this project starting earlier than the end of 1986.  In fact, it could be well into 1987.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the capital programme agreed between the Department of Health and the Department of Finance construction is due to start on Ardkeen Hospital in late 1986. No money has been provided for 1983, 1984, 1985 and the first half of 1986.  A further revision is now being undertaken of the capital programme for the whole country, and priorities in that regard. Irrespective of the merits of the planning to date, there is no prospect as of now of the construction of that hospital starting before late 1986.  On the basis of the outcome of the review, it could will be in 1987 or much later.  Deputies should know the exact truth in those situations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to give a precise figure as to the number of children involved as it is continually fluctuating. <Col N="1189" /> The figure is quite small and is made up almost exclusively of children drawn from the travelling community. However, I am most concerned about the very serious circumstances of such children.</P>
      <P>Support and advice is provided for the most part for these children and their families by the local community care staff of the Eastern Health Board, the corporation and by field workers of various voluntary organisations working in this area, particularly the Dublin Committee for Travelling People.  This committee, which is financially supported by the Eastern Health Board, also provides overnight accommodation for the children.</P>
      <P>As a further contribution to easing the problem my predecessor made available to the board in August last a grant of £150,000 for the provision of a residential centre for young travelling girls.  The proposed centre will be run by the Dublin Committee for Travelling People and is situated a short distance from the committee's existing centre for travelling boys at Trudder House, Newtownmount-kennedy. It will provide places for ten girls, many of whom are at the moment to be found most days on the inner city streets.  Negotiations are still in progress on the purchase of the premises.  However it seems that some members of the board have reservations about this proposal and a final decision has yet to be taken by it.</P>

      <P>The question of the provision of a hostel for homeless men in Galway city is being actively pursued by the Galway Social Services Council, Galway Corporation and the Western Health Board.  A site has been provided by the Western Health Board which will also bear the capital cost.  A decision on the application for planning permission is awaited.</P>
      <P>In the meantime accommodation is being provided at De Montfort House, Upper Fairhill Road.  This facility is lent on a temporary basis by the Legion of Mary to the Simon Community.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a receiver was appointed to this company on 2 February 1983 at the instance of a major creditor.  It is for the receiver to decide in such a situation whether to maintain production and employment.  I understand the receiver has decided because of the company's financial circumstances and shortages of raw material that he has no alternative but to cease production before the end of this week and to make the workers redundant.</P>
      <P>I regret this development.  I am asking the IDA to maintain vigorous efforts to have the assets of the company taken over by a suitable purchaser with a view to the resumption of employment as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister fully aware of the gravity of the situation and the viability of the Athlone section of this company?  Further, is he aware that there is in Athlone in that company a trained workforce in the plastics industry?  Athlone has a reputation as a plastics centre for industry.  Is the Minister aware that this company has been in existence since 1970, that it employs 71 people and is a major contributor to the economic life of the town?  Can he give me an assurance that the factory will not be closed on Friday?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last point first.  As the Deputy is aware, it is not in my power to give an assurance as to what might be done in the case of a private concern of this kind.  The Deputy referred to the number employed and the date of commencement.  Actually, it is <Col N="1194" /> the other way around: the factory was founded in 1971 and has 70 employees. I accept what the Deputy has said with regard to the considerable trained workforce in Athlone in the plastics sector.  I am aware that studies have been done by the IDA on the viability of the firm on its own, independent of other features, both as to the debts it has and to its previous association with another firm that has since closed.  I can assure the Deputy that the positive features of this operation to which she has referred, and which the IDA have studied already on their own initiative and prior to this development, will be borne in mind by the IDA in the discussions they are now having with a view to having the company taken over by a suitable purchaser so that employment may be resumed as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue the interest I have already in this matter.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Government have displayed an interest in the matter. Certainly I will convey that continuing interest on my part and also the concern the Deputy has expressed.  I have just been informed that, slightly in divergence of what I have already said, the receiver is going to try to dispose of the assets as a going concern.  That news has come to me in the past ten seconds and it is a slight improvement on what I have said already.</P>

      <P>I would like to express my appreciation to the very large number of Deputies who spoke on this debate on the reform of the Dáil, particularly to draw attention to the fact that a number of newly-elected Deputies spoke in this debate for their first time in the House. That indicates, particularly in the case of new Deputies, the extent of public interest outside the House in the need to reform the way in which this House works.</P>
      <P>The central objective of the reform of the Dáil is to enable this House to take the leadership in public affairs and to set the direction in public affairs that it should be capable of doing as the elected assembly of the people.  Unfortunately our procedures are not as relevant to modern day issues as they should be.  The Dáil is in many cases unable to take the lead that it should be taking in public affairs and that role has passed instead to interest groups outside the House who bypass this House and exert pressure on Government directly to get whatever they want done.  The result of that is the situation wherein the Government come back to the House after they have made a decision, after they have either succumbed to or resisted the pressures of interest groups, and announce to the House what they have decided or what they are going to do.  As a result of that the House has not the positive input that it should have, consisting as it does of the people elected by the entire electorate into Government and national decision-making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the concern expressed on all sides of this House in seeking to reform it we are all trying to create a situation wherein the Dáil will be sufficiently efficient, expeditious and timely in its debates so that it will be able to have the input in time into the Government decision-making process and will have at least an equal &mdash; it is to be hoped greater &mdash; role as an elected assembly in the decisions that up to now it has tended in many cases only to rubber-stamp in the form of debates taking place after the decision has been made already.  We can enhance the status of the House in this regard in two major <Col N="1259" /> ways.  Firstly we can have better access by the public to the House so that they will see it as being more relevant to their concerns.  Secondly, we can make the Dáil more businesslike in the way in which it does its business and hence in the example it sets to people outside the House.  We can have better access by the public to the House in two ways, firstly and most obviously, but not necessarily most importantly, by broadcasting either by radio or television the proceedings of the House; and secondly, and more important, by providing through a committee system the taking of evidence from the public on both legislation and matters of public concern which are not at the time the subject of legislation.  In this way the public who are concerned about a problem will have a means of ensuring that their concerns are expressed to a representative group of Deputies through an evidence-taking committee system.  That will mean that a person who has something with which he is concerned will have an alternative which he has not got at the moment simply to go in to the Minister or the civil service to talk about the problem.  People will be able to go to representatives of the House to talk about their problems.  Therefore, there will be an alternative focus for public concern here in the House, broadly speaking working in public, in addition to the existing focus of governmental discussion through the civil service which in most cases takes place in a private arena. Those are the two ways in which we can improve access to the House and to democracy by the electorate and thereby strengthen the role of this House in national policy-making.</P>
    <P>We can and must also &mdash; indeed it would be wrong to proceed with greater access unless we did the second part as well because it would be counter-productive &mdash; make the House more businesslike in the way that it itself proceeds.  As many Deputies have said for the first time in this debate, we must try to reduce the tendency, which we all have become accustomed to, of making rather lengthy speeches because we know that if we do not make a long speech now we will never <Col N="1260" /> get a second chance to speak on the subject. That needs to be dealt with, by changing the method of looking at the issues in regard to parliamentary questions, how they work, how that system can be improved, by improving research facilities and by increasing the information available to Deputies about the way in which the public services operate.</P>
    <P>I would now like to go down in some greater detail through points made in the debate and respond to them.  A number of Deputies were interested &mdash; the Leader of the Opposition was today &mdash; in having Bills discussed in committee rather than having the Committee Stage in the full Chamber of the House.  I would like to express a personal view about that. I am not sure that that is a brilliant idea although I believe there are many people on both sides of the House who would disagree with me.  I believe there are even greater opportunities for delay, inattention and boring debates if the debate in committee is taking place away from the centre of attention in the House where the press are looking on.  At least here there is some brake put on the extent of obstructive tactics, if we are doing it under the watchful eye of the Chair, the Press Gallery and the people in the Public Gallery.  If the Bill-making process were passed into a committee room there is a danger that there would be even greater opportunities for repetitive and obstructive discussion.  You could have a situation where Bills were delayed even longer than they would otherwise be delayed through unnecessary and repetitive argument.</P>
    <P>That has got to be borne in mind in referring Bills to committees.  If one referred contentious Bills to committees the possibilities for delaying the legislative process would perhaps be even greatly enhanced.  That is not an overriding objection, it is just a caution I would enter in this regard, that one could find a situation that the Government simply could not get their legislation through because so much stuff could be bottled up in committee.  We know in the Congress in the United States that there are stories of committee chairmen being able to prevent legislation ever getting out of <Col N="1261" /> the committee simply by not putting it on the agenda for the committee's next meeting.  That sort of elaborate delaying tactics could be used.  Obviously that would not suit the Government.  It might at the time suit the Opposition but all Oppositions hope some time to be in Government.  Therefore, a procedure which we might adopt in this regard has to be so carefully thought through that it does not simply result in negative obstruction becoming the guiding feature of the legislative process.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies made a suggestion that there should be a system of pairs for Deputies who are involved in committee work during normal Dáil sessions so that the committee meetings will not simply break up whenever a division bell goes.  That is an eminently sensible suggestion and it is something I intend to discuss with the Whips.  This is something which could be done without any change in Standing Orders because it is simply a matter of informal agreement between the parties.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the lack of research back-up in the House.  There are three research assistants in the Library. To the best of my knowledge, in the past at least, perhaps because of three elections in 18 months when there was not much time for research, the services of the existing research services have not been over-utilised.  In fact, it is argued that they are under-utilised.  Before we simply start spending more money on hiring additional research assistants we need to find out if the type of research assistance we have is what Deputies really want and if not, how it can be restructured to ensure that it is.  I believe that when the Joint Library Committee are appointed they should give their attention to this matter.  They should advert to the fact that in this debate there was a widely expressed concern across the House that research services should be improved.  It may be that many of the Deputies who expressed that concern did not attempt to use even the services we have.  It might be well if those who have expressed that concern would try to use that service to the full over the next few months and in doing so we will find out <Col N="1262" /> what its limitations are.  Let us not decide we will add to it without finding out what is needed.</P>
    <P>I believe one area where the research services could be improved is by strengthening their expertise in the economic area. I am speaking of my experience in Opposition now when I say that many of the questions which Deputies tend to ask are related to economic matters.  It is important that there should be up to three qualified economists on the staff of the research services.  That would be immediately beneficial to Deputies.  There is the issue of whether you provide your research services through the political parties or in the House.  If you decide you will have a parallel research service in each of the political parties alongside the research services in the House there is a danger that you could have quite an amount of duplication.  The same sort of data would be prepared by different people for the same purpose without getting the best value from it.  There is a need to rationalise our provisions in this regard.  We must remember that the political parties receive quite substantial grants from the Exchequer for research work and they have tended to use it to a very great extent for election-related activities.  It can be represented as being public information but in fact a lot of the money goes alongside normal subscriptions and tends to become absorbed in the overall party activity which is not really oriented towards parliament or examination of public issues.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it might be appropriate in respect of the allocation made to political parties if a specific amount were set aside for research and they were required to spend a proportion of the money they receive from the Exchequer &mdash; some might argue that the amount received is not very generous &mdash; on Dáil-related research rather than simply on their general activities.  I believe we have reached a point in our parliamentary democracy where the parties are competing with one another to an excessive extent in the expenditure of money raised from voluntary contributors on electioneering.  I find, from my limited experience, that the amount spent on elections, particularly <Col N="1263" /> by-elections here, far exceeds the comparable expenditure in much richer countries.  In Britain, for instance, the amount spent in a general election campaign or a by-election campaign is about one-fifth of that spent in an equivalent constituency here.  That is also the case in France and other continental countries. We tend to spend vast sums on the matter.  I know as long as one party spend this sort of money the other parties feel they have to do it also.  That results in the parties spending much more of their money than they should on competitive electoral activities when they could usefully in the interests of the House and of democracy spend such money on research, helping Deputies to prepare for debates and ensuring that we are better informed in entering into debates than we have been in the past.</P>
    <P>That is something that is directly outside the activities of this House but it is something the parties should look at.  Perhaps we could consider in the very long term&mdash;I am speaking from a personal point of view here&mdash;looking at the present situation in Germany where after the last war they were very concerned to ensure that their parties were democratic and that their parties acted as agents for the preservation of democracy.  They made certain legislative provisions in this regard to ensure that parties allocated their money for purposes that were genuinely concerned with public affairs rather than having what is effectively negative competition with one another in postering campaigns.  That is a view I have expressed publicly in the past and although it is not strictly relevant to this debate, I am taking the opportunity of expressing it in the presence of representatives of most of the parties in the hope that some Deputies may think about it and respond later.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies made what I consider to be a valid point, that is, that there is not much to be gained from having a lot of committees producing very learned reports if there is not an opportunity for Deputies to discuss those reports in the House.  We all know from <Col N="1264" /> the post we receive each morning that there are committees of this House who are producing extremely valuable reports.  We are now receiving reports of committees of the third last Dáil which have been printed only recently.  Anyone who has the time to read those reports will realise the outstanding work that has been done by the various committees.  I refer in particular to the committee on State-sponsored bodies but the tragedy, as some Deputies have pointed out, is that these reports are never debated. They simply arrive through our post and are used by academics who are studying the subject in question.  It is in this House that these Dáil committee reports should be discussed.  We should have a limited time with each speaker limited to, say, five minutes, so that the reports will be given at least an hour or even half an hour's time here.  After taking perhaps 30 or 40 hours to produce the least we might do for the Deputies who spend their time on the exercise is to give some time in the House for debating the reports.  That must be a priority in terms of Dáil reform.  We must ensure that all the valuable work done by these committees is followed through and that the Deputies concerned are given some credit for the work involved.  If we fail in this regard the committee system will be self-defeating.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley and a number of others who have relatively long experience here were somewhat sceptical about our succeeding in encouraging enough Deputies to service these committees and posed the question as to whether, having regard to the pressures we are under because of the electoral situation, we would be prepared to give our time to committees.  As I said in my opening remarks, one way of solving that problem would be by having smaller committees, committees of five or six rather than of 12 or 14.  This would result in our being able to have twice as many committees sitting at the one time.  It would be likely to ensure also that individual members of the committees would be well known to be involved in such work and to get more credit in respect of the subject with which they were dealing. <Col N="1265" /> Another possible answer to this problem is the giving of special priority to committee work.  I am glad that there has been a good deal of positive response during the debate to that suggestion.  It would be helpful if we asked the broadcasting people, by way of the conditions laid down for them, to give special allocations of time to committee work.  I am glad also that there is a consensus in the House in regard to broadcasting but we should avail of the opportunity of broadcasting to upgrade the very important work of committees.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most heartening of all aspects of the debate is the consensus that there should be broadcasting of our proceedings.  We have not had such a consensus in the past.  Up to now one major political party were somewhat hesitant in that matter.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that we are one of the very few countries which do not have broadcasting of our Parliaments.  In 1976 there were only four countries in the Inter-Parliamentary Union who did not have sound broadcasting of any part of parliamentary proceedings.  We were one of those though we now allow live broadcasting of the budget.  Also in the Inter-Parliamentary Union in 1976 there were only seven countries who did not have television broadcasting of some part of the proceedings of the Houses of Parliament. For our part this is a reflection of something referred to by Deputy Kelly &mdash; because the British were slow in this regard, we are even slower.  We have a tendency always to follow whatever is introduced across the water but we do not usually act for five or six years afterwards. The point I am making is that in approaching the matter of the broadcasting of the proceedings of Parliament, we seek to do it our way rather than to follow someone else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We were the first to think about many things but we do not always act as quickly as our thoughts run. Instead of following the British example we should try to give the lead.  I hope that <Col N="1266" /> in the reform of our House we will be making changes that have not been thought of in Westminster and that in a few years' time the British will be coming here to see how we have reformed our system so that they may learn from us. Drawing from the mistakes and experiences of others, we should set about becoming one of the most efficient Parliaments in the world.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan, among others, advocated the concept of having minority reports from committees as distinct from agreed reports.  I have reservations about that proposal.  It is not that I do not think the Opposition should not have an opportunity to express reservations about any report, though the reservations might just as well come from Government backbenchers, but if we introduce the concept of minority reports we are likely to have as many such reports as we have members of the committees because no one will want to appear to agree with anyone else. Much of the value of the committee system is that it allows for consensus to be reached and that puts some pressure on us to reach a consensus about an issue.</P>
      <P>I take the point made by Deputy O'Rourke that there always has to be a creative tension between Opposition and Government and perhaps also within parties about various issues.  It is not my intention to take from that point of view but I believe that we have had too much creative tension and not enough attempts to reach consensus.  There may be other countries where the reverse is the case, but as a country we cannot be accused of having too much consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer also to some of the suggestions made regarding the type of committees we should have.  Some Members suggested that we should have a health committee, a social welfare committee, an environment committee and an agriculture committee.  In other words, the suggestion is that we should have committees relating to the various Departments.  That has tended to be the pattern in most countries.  In many cases there are committees which more or less mirror departments of State.  Personally, I would not be much in favour of that approach because all that would happen <Col N="1267" /> would be that the Agriculture Committee would become an extension of the Department of Agriculture exercising pressure on the Government to get more money for agriculture.  The type of people who would go on the Agriculture Committee &mdash; farmers &mdash; would want to express that point of view anyway.  Likewise, the type of people who would go on the Social Affairs Committee would tend to agree with the co-operative objectives of the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health, and would become an extension of the pressure group for more expenditure of that type. They would be competing with the pressure group for agriculture and the pressure groups for other Departments.  In effect, instead of this House becoming an assembly which presides over and rises above pressure group politics, we would turn this House into an extension of pressure group politics.  I do not believe that is the way we should be going; we should be going in the other direction, trying to make this House become the arbiter between the pressure groups rather than a reflection of them.</P>
    <P>A better approach would be to have a Public Expenditure Committee, looking at all public expenditure and weighing the demands of one Department against the other, in the same way as the Government do.  This would mean that if the Government came to a particular distribution, there would be another authoritative committee of elected representatives who might come to a different, but balanced view rather than a view representing one pressure group in respect of one Department's field of endeavour.</P>
    <P>We should not have too many standing committees.  We have to have the Library Committee, Restaurant Committee, Committee on Procedure and Privileges and so on, but it has been suggested that we must have a Standing Committee on, let us say, Crime, a suggestion made by Deputy Mitchell and with which I do not disagree.  The idea that we should have a Standing Committee on Crime lasting forever is not a good one.  Our aim should be to set up a committee to deal with a special subject, ask them to bring in <Col N="1268" /> reports and then they could deal with another subject, using our limited resources to do so.  It is not a good idea to have too many standing committees which go on forever, which have to justify themselves by bringing in new reports, even though they may have done all the work necessary on their subjects.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that there are a limited number of Deputies prepared to serve on committees.  If we set up Committee X there would be five, eight or ten Members with less time for other work.  I suggest that the better approach is to set up a committee to report on a particular subject within a reasonable time and then deploy those Deputies into other subjects.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly suggested that we should have published a parliamentary programme for the session wherein the Government would indicate the Bills they hoped to introduce during the session.  Governments will not be too keen on that idea because it means committing themselves to a programme of legislation, and if they do not introduce all on their programme they are open to criticism.  Deputy Kelly rightly pointed out that Governments tend to be oversensitive in that regard and we need to change that situation.  We are all fallible and I believe Deputy Kelly's suggestion is the correct one because the House would know where it is going in a session and the work in front of it and Members could commence the research they have to do in good time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly or some other Deputy referred to the possibility of our being able to publish in each day's papers an advertisement saying the business to be taken in the House and the time.  Members of the public would know that the Committee on Building Land were meeting at 11 a.m. in open session and they could come to listen.  We are responsible to the public and should publish our business. The idea that if one communicates this type of information to the Opposition Whip one is discharging one's responsibility in the matter is not accurate.  It would be more desirable if the public knew what business we would transact during the day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> Obviously that is not very easy in respect of debates of this kind because we do not know how long they will take. We do not know when the next Minister will come in.  I might speak for one hour, two hours or even five minutes and we could not advertise that in advance.  If we advertise the times of debates, we will have to agree on time limits for speeches. If a debate is not concluded by the time one is to proceed to the next business, then it could be deferred until the next day.  I realise that that could cause inconvenience but it needs to be looked at because we have to make the House more accessible to the public.  We cannot expect members of the public to come to the Gallery in the hope that there might be something of interest to them going on.  If they knew at what time something was going to happen, more people would come into the Gallery.</P>
    <P>I agree with a number of Deputies, including Deputy G. Mitchell and Deputy Manning, who referred to the need to have a debate on the budgetary options the Government are considering. That is a direction in which the Government are moving in line with their discussion document, <i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances</i> and the statement made in this debate by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly referred to having a parallel system of parliamentary questions wherein we would not just cross-question members of the Government but in respect of certain subjects of an administrative rather than a policy nature we would have the opportunity of questioning the officials administratively responsible for executing as distinct from making Government policy in certain areas. That is a revolutionary suggestion which strikes at the heart of the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, the doctrine upon which our public service have operated up to now, namely, that the Minister knows everything and is responsible for everything that happens in his Department and so must be prepared to answer in this House on anything that happens. As any Member who has been a Minister will know, there is no way the Minister <Col N="1270" /> knows everything that is going on in his Department and this doctrine is nonsense. There is a strong case for introducing something along the lines suggested by Deputy Kelly wherein the people who are executing the policy as distinct from making it should be answerable to this House for what they have been doing in their area of responsibility. That would require a complete reform of the public service, the introduction of the Devlin concept wherein officials became responsible for the execution of policy as distinct from the Minister's being responsible for its execution.  I know the Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Boland, is considering this carefully. Clearly, we could not introduce Deputy Kelly's suggestion, or anything approximating to it, unless we first made a decision about the management system in the public service along the lines I indicated. This is something this House will have an opportunity to debate at some stage.</P>
    <P>Many Members on all sides expressed the view that parliamentary questions had got out of control, that we were not able to get the Minister we wanted to answer questions on the day we wanted and that there was such a huge volume of questions down on relative minor matters, costing very considerable amounts, that the system was becoming a subject of ridicule.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the majority of Deputies felt that any interference with rights in regard to parliamentary questions could cause very great problems. That might lead to people feeling deprived of their essential rights.  We should be extremely hesitant about interfering with the parliamentary question system.  It is the one right that many Deputies have to information.  It is, however, worth recalling that we probably have the best parliamentary question system in the world with regard to Opposition and Government backbenches.  No continental country gives an answer to a parliamentary question for a month or more, if ever.  In some cases, the Government may keep on postponing a reply.  In Britain there is a longer time lapse between the date of putting down a question and it being answered and most questions are given <Col N="1271" /> written replies, very few being taken orally in the House of Commons.  We have the much greater facility of a written reply within three days.  We should look very carefully at the matter in the context of an overall package deal for reform of parliamentary questions which would give additional facilities to Deputies in return, perhaps, for removing some of the excessive administration costs under the present system.  We might be able to work out something sufficiently well balanced to be seen by all to be a fair reform removing existing abuses and giving compensating improvements.  I would be hesitant to move in the direction of any unilateral restriction in this area.  It would be a recipe for trouble and in the area of parliamentary reform the last thing which we need is trouble, if it can be avoided.</P>
    <P>A matter very frequently mentioned during the debate was that Ministers &mdash; and I am sure that Deputies were referring to Ministers of all parties &mdash; make announcements at branch or cumainn meetings or at dinners around the country or perhaps in Dublin, but not in this House.  To some extent that is an unfair criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Or in imaginary places. That has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy would never do that.  The concept of an imaginary place is something about which I would have to think.  There is no opportunity, procedurally, for a Minister to make a statement in this House unless a question has been put down to him, although there is an opportunity for a personal statement.  There is no opportunity for the Minister to make such an announcement in the House, unless an initiative has been taken in the form of legislation or of a parliamentary question, when that is possible.  There is the possibility of getting a Member of one's own party to ask a question so that one could answer it in the House, but that is not a very satisfactory method and is not very much used.  This might be a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Many Members have <Col N="1272" /> expressed concern about this and facilities should be considered for affording Ministers, if they so wish, to make announcements in the House.  There is no use complaining if Ministers have no opportunity of meeting those complaints within the existing procedures.</P>
      <P>There was a widening consensus in the House in favour of shorter speeches.  This can only happen if an opportunity is given at the same time for Members to come back a second, third or fourth time.  The system of short speeches will not work if Members feel that they must say everything in five minutes and have no comeback. A corollary to introducing much tighter limits would be to allow multiple interventions, within some limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  We must get used to that system in this House, but it needs to be studied carefully.  Certainly it is the direction in which we should go. Perhaps the best way would be to try it on an experimental basis in respect of a limited number of debates, to see how it works and Members will probably find that it is a good system.  However, if we try to introduce it right across the board in every debate we will run into problems.</P>
      <P>There was a wide level of consensus in the House &mdash; I do not know how altruistic it was &mdash; that we should not sit on Friday, if at all possible.  I would tend to agree with that.  There is no point in more sitting time just because it is a holy and wholesome thing to do, so that it will appear to the public that we are all working that little bit harder.  The old principle of bureaucracy is that work expands to fill the time available.  With more sitting time there will be longer speeches and more time wasted.  We should aim for better utilisation of the existing three days.  Having done that, we could perhaps see if we need a fourth day in the week.  However, I would not rule out at all the possibility of Friday sittings for particular types of business, if deemed necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed concern <Col N="1273" /> about the impact of by-elections on the House, when almost the whole House moves down to the constituency involved, which has a bad effect on the whole operation of parliament.  As I said already, we probably spend too much time electioneering and there could be some agreement between the parties to limit the amount of time and money spent electioneering, which would be a good day's work for democracy.  There would have to be a will on both sides to do something about this and some serious rules worked out which are seen to be respected.  People must not feel that they are abiding by the rules and keeping their Members in the House for parliamentary debates while the other party are sending many people to a constituency to take advantage of the others' absence.  This will not easily be worked out, but it is a scandal that it is extremely difficult to have serious debates in the House during the three weeks in which a by-election is taking place.  That will have to be examined carefully.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, of whom Deputy Brennan was one, suggested that during the recess there should be one day a month in which the Dáil would come back, to keep in touch with public affairs. That is not an unreasonable idea, if it can be worked without undue cost.  However, we should not allow ourselves to denigrate the notion of the parliamentary recess.  Any Deputy who wants to do serious research on a subject &mdash; and any Deputy here who has been responsible for the preparation of party policy will agree with me on this &mdash; finds that his only chance of doing serious research on political issues, the preparation of documents or any basic work of that sort is during the recess.  If we abolish Dáil recesses we will deprive Deputies of an opportunity of doing that sort of work.  I am not saying that every Member avails of the recess for research, but this needs to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>There was also a wide measure of consensus that the Order of Business is getting out of control and that there should be some way of ensuring that only strictly relevant matters should be raised.  The Ceann Comhairle is seeking to do something <Col N="1274" /> about this and I hope that he will be successful.  There was a suggestion that there should be a more real Private Members' time for individual Members who had constructive legislative proposals, for instance, to discuss these, rather than have the time taken up with motions which are largely partisan and designed to score over or embarrass the Government. That suggests the need for two types of Private Members' time, an Opposition time for motions and another time in which legislative proposals, for instance, will be given priority.  This needs to be examined carefully.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan believes that, as a matter of principle, if we have committees they should be open to the public and press at all times.  I am not sure that I would fully agree with that.  If one wants consensus, people must be able to speak reasonably freely, to toss out ideas which, if proved wrong, may be withdrawn.  If all this is happening in public, people will feel honour bound to stick by whatever they said first and not admit that they could possibly have made a mistake in their initial presentation.  If all committee business were to be in public, people might become very rigid, with very little give and take and the dialogue would not be as it should.  We should not take the rigid principle seemingly put forward by Deputy Brennan on that issue.</P>
    <P>The last point to which I should like to refer is the overall question of how we will handle broadcasting when it is introduced here.  There would be a tendency in some speeches to say that we must lay down very strict guidelines with regard to what the broadcasting media are going to report, that they must report the entire debate from beginning to end, that they cannot edit speeches, pick the highlights because, if we allow them to do so, they might do it in a slightly biased way which might give more prominence to one point of view over another.  That is not a point of view with which I would concur.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, in the reporting of our proceedings &mdash; whatever about the editorials in the media &mdash; I believe that the media have been extremely fair in their reporting of contributions made in this House.  They may not have reported <Col N="1275" /> as much as we would wish of what we say but, in so far as they do report it, they report it in a reasonably balanced way. Of course we may not agree with the comments they pass in the comment columns and in the editorials about what we are doing in here, but that is legitimate.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would tend to the view that if we are going to introduce a broadcasting system we should not be too paranoid about the fact that that would mean that broadcasting executives will have to exercise some editorial judgment about how it works.  After a year or so of its operation, if it becoming very biased, then we have the possibility of trying to do something about it.  It should be indicated to the media, when they come in in the first instance, that they are coming in on a trial basis, that we want to see how it will work.  But I do not think we should start off with a statement of basic distrust of their editorial judgment.  That would be my personal opinion, not one I have discussed with anybody yet but one that would probably command a good deal of support.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points I wanted to make.  I should like to thank Members very much again for their contributions. The Government will proceed now to consider the speeches made and, in the light of the contributions from all sides, the proposals they will proceed with. They will decide also on how they will proceed with those proposals.  We would hope, as far as possible, to reach a wide measure of consensus in the House on what is necessary.  It may not be possible to reach a total consensus and it may be necessary for decisions to be reached by a majority in the House.  But we should aim as far as possible to get a fair measure of consensus so long as a search for total consensus does not halt the march of progress unduly.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question in relation to the committee system.  He spoke of his reservations and indeed of those of many people about the success of committees in view of the fact that many Members of the House have not been in a position to give of their time <Col N="1276" /> to such committees.  Seeing that the Minister did not deal with this problem in his remarks, might I suggest that perhaps it could be solved if he were in some way to examine the role of the Deputy so that we would have more time to become involved in committee work when our administrative role would be reduced. This would mean we would be able to spend less time in our offices, more time in this Chamber and in the committee rooms.</P>
      <P>My view is &mdash; and I should like the Minister to comment on this &mdash; that radical steps must be taken in an endeavour to reduce the administrative workload of Deputies and which, unfortunately, for many people constitutes a waste of time, or time that could be better spent in the consideration of legislation in the House and in committee.</P>

However, I would not like the cause of the reform of the Dáil to become entangled in a constitutional referendum, when we would run the risk of the matter becoming unduly difficult.  However, short of that, the Deputy has made a valid point.  It is something we shall have to look at.  I should be very glad to have the Deputy's views as to how he feels it should be done.  I have an open mind on it myself.</P>

I compliment the Minister and his Department or the Statute Law Revision and Consolidation Office &mdash; I am not sure which is to be thanked &mdash; not so much for the Bill or the work that lies behind it but for the explanatory memorandum which accompanies it.  I have had reason to complain about the expense of printing explanatory memoranda and the uselessness of them because very often they did not tell one what the Bill was about, the reasons which lead to its introduction or the reasons behind a particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing a Deputy or a member of the public wants to know about new law is the reason for it.  In the past, explanatory memoranda have all too often been silent on that point.  The present memorandum explains the purpose of the Bill.  Not only does it do that but it provides in a concise and readable form in about four pages a perfect history of <Col N="1280" /> Irish legislation or legislation bearing on Ireland over the last 800 years.  I am not aware that such information is to be found in a readily accessible form anywhere else let alone with the authority of the State behind it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department deserve the thanks of everyone interested in such matters.  They have taken the trouble to provide this.  I am not a legal historian and I am not competent to say whether their account of Irish legislative history is correct.  For all I know there may be points with which a scholar trained in this area might disagree but assuming it is correct it seems to be an excellent, readable and concise account.  It ought to be given wider circulation and made available in a form which would make it appropriate as teaching material in introductory courses in our law schools.  It may be difficult for a layman to understand this but a great deal of our law is pre-1937. Statute law continued globally in force here subject to consistency with the two successive Constitutions we had but exactly what kind of statute goes into that law is something that even a trained lawyer might find hard to state with exactness. This memorandum attempts to state these matters with exactness.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am not competent to judge whether the statement is accurate but I am willing to assume that it is.  I thank the Minister, his Department and the Statute Law Revision and Consolidation Office and everybody who was involved in providing such an excellent explanatory memorandum, a very rare occurrence in the public life of the State.</P>

    <P>`73.&mdash;Proceedings in the District Court for an offence under this Act may be brought only by the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Commission or an officer of the Commission or a <Col N="1282" /> member of the Garda Síochána and not by any other person.'</P>
    <P>The reason for putting down this amendment is that I have been advised by the Attorney General that it is necessary to include in the Bill a provision to make it clear that section 73 does not preclude the bringing of prosecutions in the District Court by the general prosecuting authority, that is the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The amendment proposed provides that proceedings in the District Court for an offence under the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952 may be brought only by the DPP or the commission or an officer of the commission or a member of the Garda Síochána and not by any other person.</P>
    <P>The reason for this amendment is that, as the section stood, it would have been necessary for the DPP to seek the permission of the commission, in other words he came under the &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; category.  He is now specifically included and named as a person who can initiate a prosecution just as can the Garda Síochána, the commissioners or officers acting on their behalf.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is more than a year since the Second Stage of this Bill, it is appropriate that we should have a short discussion on it.  I take this opportunity, as a former Minister for Fisheries, to compliment the Foyle Fisheries Commission, the staff and all concerned on the magnificent management of the Foyle fisheries since the establishment of the commission.  As Minister I was fortunate in having the opportunity to have a very useful exchange of views with the Northern Minister responsible for fisheries and to visit the Foyle.  I was impressed with the commitment and dedication, not only of the members of the commission whom I had the privilege and honour to meet, but also of the staff who have done such tremendous work in the protection of this valuable national fishery and who have made such a great effort in enforcing fisheries laws in what is at times a very difficult and dangerous situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all deeply concerned about the decline in salmon fisheries and it was my wish when Minister that every effort should be made during my term to ensure the necessary strengthening of legislation which would enable conservation staff in the Foyle and other fishery areas to deal with illegal activities which were damaging stocks and putting salmon fisheries in jeopardy.  My sole interest and commitment was to ensure as far as possible that every effort would be made and every <Col N="1284" /> opportunity taken to stamp out illegal activities, recognising at all times the limitations of staff, personnel and equipment of the boards and of the Foyle Fisheries Commission which made it more difficult for them to do the job.  One of the major ways in which we can offer assistance is by introducing legislation such as this and giving the commission and the boards the power under the law to deal out very heavy penalties where illegal activities are taking place.  For that reason we do not oppose this Bill and we support the general principle that our legislation should be strengthened.  We would advocate the introduction of further legislation if that were necessary to deal with these illegal activities.</P>
    <P>It is important to consider the position in relation to the Foyle and the whole area of salmon conservation.  As Minister I was totally committed to the stamping out of illegal activities.  We also endeavoured to control the issue of driftnet licences.  There has been recent controversy about some of the measures taken but they were taken in the interests of conservation and to ensure that permission would be given to those who were entitled through tradition or because they earned their livelihood from fishing.  I appeal to the fisheries boards, the commission and anyone who has responsibility in this area to make sure that the orders which have been made are fully complied with and that the conditions and criteria laid down by Ministers are fully adhered to in the issue of licences.</P>
    <P>The orders made by me before I left office reduce overall the number of licences which can be issued within our jurisdiction.  This is very important because in recent times certain individuals who should know better have tried to misrepresent the position.  Those in the Department and previous Ministers, including the present Ceann Comhairle, will be aware that we were always conscious that orders should reduce and limit the number of licences issued and should as far as possible spread those licences in a more favourable way.  I refute absolutely any suggestion that before I left office I issued licences indiscriminately without recognising <Col N="1285" /> the serious conservation problem in regard to salmon fishing.  This is totally untrue and inaccurate and misrepresents the position.  The orders made by me and previous Ministers were to enable boards to issue licences.  The actual issue is not made by the Minister.  Licences are issued by the various boards who have authority from the Minister to do so.  I am referring to this because of the recent controversy about the issuing of licences and I am anxious to put it on record that the Minister does not issue licences&mdash;it is the responsibility of the various boards. Some members of those boards have been very vocal about this matter recently but they would be well advised to examine their own responsibilities.</P>

      <P>I will do so, but the points I have made are relevant.  The legislation seeks to increase the penalties in a move to stamp out illegal activities which are damaging our fish stock.  The preservation and conservation of our fish stock are related to this legislation.  I hope the legislation will strengthen the hand of those engaged in stamping out illegal activities which are damaging our stock.  The Foyle is a valuable national resource and it is important that every effort be made to preserve the fish stocks there.  I should like to congratulate those who have been endeavouring under difficult circumstances to enforce existing legislation in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to this important post.  We all appreciate that the Foyle Commission is a unique body which was set up in 1952.  Since then cross-border co-operation has existed in regard to the preservation of the stock of that river and there has been cross-border co-operation to deal with the affairs of Lough Foyle which separates the Twenty-six Counties from the Six Counties. The Foyle was always considered to be a good salmon river and at the time the board was established there was an extensive stock there.  Since then stock has diminished and it is necessary to make the fines for illegal fishing there equal to those in operation on the other side of the river.  While it is important to increase the fines the question of conservation deserves greater consideration.  If we are serious about conservation we must ensure that those who are trying to stamp out illegal fishing have the necessary back-up services.  I have heard many complaints that the commission do not have the proper equipment or boats to deal with poachers.  We do not condone poaching or illegal fishing because those <Col N="1287" /> engaged in that activity are destroying fish stocks.  They are depriving the traditional fishermen, who have derived a livelihood from that river for generations, of a reasonable income from salmon fishing. The law must be upheld and we must ensure that the commission are backed up by the Garda and the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consult with the commission about this matter.  The Foyle Commission when it was established had three aims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill originated two Governments ago.  Effectively it was drafted and put together during the period of office of the previous Government.  It is now my task to introduce its Second Stage into the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to enable the Local Appointments Commissioners to resume their practice of awarding credit for a knowledge of Irish when selecting or recommending candidates for posts in local authorities, health boards and other bodies.  The Bill <Col N="1289" /> will also clarify and confirm the commissioners' powers in relation to the selection of candidates, the type of competition and the short listing of candidates and will provide a statutory basis for the making of regulations by the commissioners in connection with competitions to be conducted by them.  The Bill will make statutory provision for the non-application of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, as amended, to posts of town clerk in smaller urban district councils.</P>
    <P>The need for this Bill arises from a finding of the Supreme Court in December 1979 that the commissioners had acted beyond their powers in granting extra credit for a knowledge of Irish to candidates being selected and recommended by them for appointment.  This finding arises from a case decided by the High Court and appealed to the Supreme Court by the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Since 1974 it has been Government policy that, although Irish is no longer obligatory for entry to the public service, Irish and English are of equal value and candidates showing proficiency in both languages get credit for this.  The commissioners were implementing that policy by awarding credit to candidates for proficiency in both languages.  This was in line with the policy and practice in relation to competitions conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.  As a result of the court decision, the Local Appointments Commissioners had no option but to suspend the award of such credit.  This Bill is essential to enable the commissioners to resume implementation of Government policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill will enable the commissioners to award credit to candidates who have proficiency in both official languages and to take into consideration training, knowledge and experience over and above the minimum qualifications for the particular post being filled.</P>
    <P>Up to the time of the Supreme Court finding the commissioners had in the normal process of selection given regard to such additional attainments.  This is necessary to ensure that the best qualified and most suitable candidate is selected, <Col N="1290" /> as the basic qualifications for an office are, by definition, minimum qualifications. However, the Supreme Court finding requires that the commissioners' practice in this regard be covered by enabling legislation.</P>
    <P>The commissioners' powers to select candidates are set out under sections 8 and 9 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, and section 29 of the Local Government Act, 1955. These provide that selection shall be by competitive examination which has been interpreted as meaning written examination. When this is not feasible, as happens in practically every case, selection may, with the consent of the appropriate Minister, be in such manner as the commissioners think proper.  Effectively the commissioners use the services of interview boards to assist them in their selection of candidates.</P>
    <P>In their finding the Supreme Court ruled that the powers of selection of the commissioners were limited and did no more than vest in the commissioners discretion as to the manner of selection to be employed as an alternative to competitive examination.  In view of the Supreme Court finding it is considered desirable to spell out beyond doubt the exact powers of the commissioners in the area of selecting candidates.</P>
    <P>It is felt that the procedure adopted by the Civil Service Commissioners is the most appropriate and sections 3 and 4 of the Bill have been modelled on corresponding provisions in the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956.  Briefly, these provide that selection shall be by competition consisting of one or more specified types of tests.  They cover also the short-listing of candidates and the making of regulations by the commissioners in relation to the holding of such competitions.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing proposals, which arise out of the Supreme Court findings already mentioned, problems have existed for some time in relation to posts of town clerk in the smaller urban district councils, selection for the filling of all of which are, by virtue of the provisions of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, made by the <Col N="1291" /> Local Appointments Commissioners. Experience has shown that there is a very high turnover in these posts.  Over the years, however, representations have been made by public representatives and others to have these posts in the smaller urban district councils filled by local competition which would also be open to all qualified candidates.  It has been represented that this would reduce somewhat the degree of turnover in such posts.</P>
    <P>This issue was raised in the course of discussions between management and staff side interests under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for local authorities and health services on the grading, salaries and other matters related to town clerks generally.  Under the agreement reached between the management and staff sides in the matter, it was agreed that when a suitable opportunity arose proposals would be formulated for incorporation in legislation whereby town clerk posts in urban district councils with a population of less than 9,000 would no longer be filled on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides for this by excluding the town clerk posts from the scope of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926.  Town clerks in these urban districts will in future be recruited by the local authority concerned in accordance with the Local Government (Appointment of Officers) Regulations, 1974, which govern the filling of all local authority offices except those filled on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners. While this proposal does not arise because of the Supreme Court finding, it is felt that the opportunity presented by the present legislative proposals to implement the commitment made under the conciliation and arbitration scheme in relation to the filling of town clerk posts should be availed of.</P>
    <P>The Local Appointments Commissioners have established an unrivalled record for fairness in making selection for posts in the period of over 50 years since they were established.  The legislative provisions under which they operate <Col N="1292" /> do, however, require up-dating to ensure that the statutory framework under which they operate is absolutely clearcut. This is the aim of the present porposals.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Aontaím leis an mBille atá os ár gcomhair anois.  I compliment the Minister on his appointment and wish him every success during his term of office.  As he said, this Bill was prepared during the periods of office of a few Governments.  Having been brought so far by his predecessor, Deputy Ray Burke, it is understandable that on behalf of my party I support the terms of the Bill as introduced.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to enable the Local Appointments Commission to resume the practice of awarding credits, which practice was discontinued because of a Supreme Court decision.  In fact, that decision involved a medical person from my city.  All sides of the House agree on the necessity for the Bill and Fianna Fáil assured the Minister of State of their co-operation in giving it an expeditious passage through the House.  We are maintaining the approach that has existed this afternoon with regard to measures before the House.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a growing volume of legislation as a result of decisions by the courts and this is another such example.  The Bill enables the Local Appointments Commission to resume a practice they were forced to suspend because of the Supreme Court decision. The Bill, as was outlined by the Minister of State, also allows some other changes to be made in the whole operations of the Local Appointments Commission and the duties they perform.  The Minister stated that section 2 of the Bill will enable the commissioners to award credit to candidates who have proficiency in both official languages and to take into consideration training, knowledge and experience over and above the minimum qualifications, for the post being filled. Tá mé ana-shásta leis seo.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an cás anois mar a bhí sé roimh beartas na cúirte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important point has been raised by <Col N="1293" /> the Minister of State and one that I welcome. I am referring to the appointment of town clerks in small urban areas.  I should qualify what I am saying by stating I am well aware that some of our best county managers came up through the local authority system.  However, in recent years I do not think the high turnover of town clerks in small towns has been of any help to the areas concerned. It has happened frequently that people have left the position of town clerk and the new appointment might not be made for a period of nine or 12 months.  That pattern might well continue with the next appointment and so on.  To some extent small urban areas have suffered and I am glad that the local administration will be in a position to make what will obviously be more permanent appointments.</P>
    <P>If possible, I should like the Minister in his reply to give us a list of the number of towns that will come under the new arrangement.  What has been proposed here is an important step forward and it will have our support.  Obviously local people will have the opportunity of qualifying on a more permanent basis and will become involved in the municipal affairs of the town in question.  Some of our best administrators have come through the system.  Many of them started their careers in small towns.  Operating in small areas gives them an intimate knowledge of local problems and is a most useful apprenticeship.  I agree with the Minister that this move was necessary because the smaller urban areas suffered to some extent.</P>
    <P>This matter was raised by public representatives for many years but it was also raised in the course of discussions between management and staff sides under the C&amp;A scheme for local authorities and health services.  These discussions related to the grading, salaries and other matters with reference to town clerks.  The Minister has stated that under the agreement reached between the management and staff sides in the matter it was agreed that when a suitable opportunity arose proposals would be formulated for incorporation in legislation relating to small towns.  It is good that such agreement has been reached.  This <Col N="1294" /> legislation was prepared by a number of Governments and it will put into practice what is regarded as the right way forward.</P>
    <P>Other changes are being made to give the Local Appointments Commission the same opportunities presently available to the Civil Service Commission.  I support this approach.  The Minister has stated that the Local Appointments Commissioners have established an unrivalled record for fairness in making selection for posts and I agree with him.  It is very important that appointments be completely independent.  I have no doubt that the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission are absolutely fair and independent.  There are times of difficulty.  When I was Minister for the Public Service I remember there was a major row in this House.  I was endeavouring not to interfere with the normal workings of the Civil Service Commission but Deputies on all sides of the House brought to my notice a problem which arose one summer, namely, that coming close to examination times people were being forced to take up appointments.  This happened four or six weeks before the leaving certificate examination and naturally parents were anxious that their children should get that time.  This was granted reluctantly in some cases and was refused in other cases.  I felt it was time to talk to these people.  Unfortunately some people leaked to the newspapers the story that this awful Minister for the Public Service was trying to interfere with the selection procedure.</P>
    <P>That was far from my intention, but bodies such as the Local Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commission must be aware of the democratic system and must remember that we, as Members of this House elected by the people, should have no say in the selection of candidates.  If difficulties arise for the people we represent it is only right that we as representatives, through the Minister of the day, should bring them to their attention and express our views on what we think is a fairer system.  As I said last week when speaking on Dáil reform, we as Members of the House attending at our clinics each week are alerted to <Col N="1295" /> problems in areas of civil service administration, and if in a week we hear of a few problems of a similar nature, obviously something is wrong.  When Deputies of different political affiliations and from different parts of the country make representations in such regard, then obviously problems are arising.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister of State on this Bill.  He is very wise in availing of the opportunity of updating the variety of choices available to the Local Appointments Commission in line with the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956.  I say on behalf of all of us in this House to the administrative section of the public service that we as elected Members are entitled to be listened to in regard to such problems.  At times there appears to be a fear or suspicion among people in public service administration that we politicians are always trying to interfere in regard to appointments.  Our integrity is defensible, whatever shade of political opinion we may hold.  It is wise that I should say to the Minister of State here, and I have no objection to it being conveyed back to the Local Appointments Commission, that while we appreciate the fairness of their appointments at times the appointees have not been suitable for the posts to which they were appointed, whoever may have been on the interview board.</P>
    <P>I have availed of the opportunity to make these few points, while dealing with what I think is an important step forward. The principal purpose of the Bill is to enable the Local Appointments Commission to resume what they had been doing prior to the Supreme Court decision.  The Minister of State is making very desirable changes in respect of the operations of the commission themselves, in particular in regard to the appointments of town clerks in towns of less than 9,000 population. It is wise to do that.  My comments refer to very few of the appointments made.  The vast majority of appointments made by the Civil Service Commission, who do not come under this, or the Local Appointments Commission are excellent, but the few are not always above reproach.  If we in this House, realising <Col N="1296" /> the problems of our constituencies, bring some of these problems to their notice, then they should listen.</P>
    <P>I repeat my good wishes to the Minister of State on his appointment and wish him every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I would like to be associated with the remarks of Deputy Fitzgerald in extending congratulations to the Minister of State on his first prime function in the House in moving the Second Stage of this Bill, which all sides of the House will welcome.  Those Members of the House who also have served on local authorities for long have known and been aware of the very high calibre of officers and employees and the very high standard of service of local authorities up and down the country.  We rely on those people to carry out very many and wide-ranging functions and tasks of great and supreme importance to the lives of ordinary people.  In particular those officials who work in the planning departments of the big local authorities have a key role to play.  It is vital that the selected procedures dealt with in the Bill should be objective and fair and ensure that the men and women coming forward are well fitted to meet the arduous, diverse and in many cases complex cases that face them, but it is also important to ensure that they are provided in sufficient numbers to enable them to have a reasonable opportunity to carry out those tasks efficiently.  In many cases that has not happened and many big local authorities, as a result of cutbacks and constraints in making appointments of officers and employees to them, face a serious situation and in many areas that situation is ongoing, particularly where development of estates of houses is taking place intensively. My area of County Dublin is one example and it is by no means unique. There are such areas throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of planning officers are varied and it is very important that sufficient staff be provided in the planning departments to enable them to do their job not in a perfunctory manner but very thoroughly.  For the examination of foundations of estates of new houses in the <Col N="1297" /> course of construction inspectors in sufficient numbers should be appointed to enable detailed examination to take place.  I fear that in many areas where development is taking place extensively that does not happen.</P>

      <P>The Chair is not satisfied that this is within the scope of the Bill.  I do not think that the Local Appointments Commission have any control over the number of people employed.  They simply make appointments as requested by various Departments. Perhaps the Deputy will bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I will, but I would make the point that they are concerned with the calibre of the candidates appointed to these posts.  I am making the point that it is unfair and unreasonable that people of that calibre who are appointed to these posts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; should not be enabled to carry out those tasks in a detailed, comprehensive manner.  It is unfair to the members of the public also. There have been developments by judicial decision in recent years, quite apart from the Supreme Court decision dealt with in the Minister's speech, which would tend now to make local authorities liable in the event of a house purchaser, for example, suffering as a result of an inadequate inspection having been carried out.  There have been such cases particularly in the UK, which very likely would be followed here, where local authorities face consequent loss of substantial sums of public money in the event of that happening.  Therefore, it is important that adequate staff, not only in the planning inspection side but also in the planning enforcement side, be made available to the local authorities.  I am afraid that that has not happened.  In many cases the staff there is altogether inadequate, and that throws an unfair burden on those first class officials who strive in the enforcement section of the <Col N="1298" /> local authorities to do the tasks appointed to them.</P>
      <P>Likewise an altogether unfair burden is placed on the officers who work in the legal section of many local authorities. Members of the public find now that they are held up very often for many months waiting for their loan application to be processed and their loan cheques to come through.  That places a very unfair burden particularly on young couples who are waiting for these loans to come through and are burdened with very heavy bridging finance.  It places an altogether intolerable burden on the unfortunate officials in the legal departments of the local authorities who are trying to cope &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the magnificent quality that those officials have, the burdens placed upon them are altogether beyond their capacity to deal with them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I worked in a local authority for 20 years until recently and I would like to welcome section 6 of the Bill which allows for the appointment of town clerks locally.  I would like to elaborate on why I am very happy with this decision.  I want to compliment the Minister of State for bringing this Bill before the House to allow for this.  A town clerk in any town, particularly in a town of 4,000 to 9,000 people, is a very important officer.  I have seen changes of town clerks in many of those towns on a regular basis, as you will know from being a member of Cavan County Council.  A town clerk's job is almost as important as the job of a county secretary.  In a county council a staff officer for roads deals specifically with roads, a staff officer for <Col N="1299" /> housing deals specifically with housing and a man in charge of rates deals with rates.  A town clerk has to have a knowledge of water, sewerage, housing, planning and rents.  He deals with all aspects of a local authority.  It is very important to a town, particularly a large one, to have a good town clerk, a man who is interested in that town, interested in working with the local urban councillors, interested in seeing that town develop, that the Department allow finance for housing, roads, sewerage, water and that when there are building projects coming from that town houses can be served by water and sewerage schemes.  I welcome that aspect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I know that Deputy Fitzgerald spoke about fair appointments and he mentioned the appointment of town clerks. As long as I was a member of Meath County Council &mdash; I say this without any fear of contradiction &mdash; I did not know of any case where there was political pull in the appointment of a town clerk or a clerical officer.  Politicians should not interfere in the appointment of staff in local authorities.  A person should get a job on his or her ability.  The recommendations of politicians should not be accepted.  When in relation to a civil service post it says &ldquo;canvassing disqualifies&rdquo; the civil service should strictly adhere to that aspect of it.</P>

      <P>No.  I will always welcome the appointment of a local man as town clerk, a man who possibly was reared in the town, brought up in the town and has an interest in it.  I remember in Trim on numerous occasions seeing a town clerk leaving and getting promotion to another town.  I have seen a person appointed to act in his place and then the Local Appointments Commission improperly appointed a person from outside. That person only stayed three or four months in the job.  The acting man was then back again.  This happened time <Col N="1300" /> and time again until he finally got the post.  It takes a person in any Government job &mdash; the same is true of Dáil Deputies &mdash; six months to get into the running of a job.  When this Bill is passed and in small towns we can get town clerks appointed who will stay a long time in the job, this will be for the betterment of the towns as a whole.</P>
      <P>This is my first time speaking in the Dáil and I would like to compliment Deputy Ruairí Quinn on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.  I wish him the best of luck because as a Deputy he has always been very good to councillors of my party.  I know he will be a very able Minister of State in the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies from all sides of the House for the congratulations and best wishes they have given to me in my position as Minister of State.  As the speaker for the Opposition, Deputy Fitzgerald indicated that this Bill has passed through a number of administrations. It is fair to say that it has received the support of all the Members of the House.  The legislation is fairly clear and self-evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of questions arose from the contributions of the Deputies who spoke and I will try to deal with them as they arose.  The first was raised by Deputy Fitzgerald in relation to the number of towns that will be affected.  There are 44 towns with a population of less than 9,000 which will now, as a result of this enabling <Col N="1302" /> legislation, be able to appoint town clerks in such a way as to avoid the problems that Deputy McLoughlin referred to. Eight of the towns are in Deputy Fitzgerald's county so the Deputy is more than represented in his concern of how necessary this Bill is in relation to section 6.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald referred to representations. In fairness to the Deputy, and to Deputy McLoughlin, the Deputy was not suggesting that intervention should be made by political parties but that the political experience accumulated by public representatives should not be discarded but should have some input into the system.  Deputy Fitzgerald, as a former Minister for the Public Service, must be aware that from time to time the Civil Service Commissioners and the Local Appointments Commissioners receive deputations and complaints from the managers' associations, various staff unions and groups.  It would be quite appropriate for the political parties, as corporate bodies, to make known their representations in a general form to the Local Appointments Commissioners and the Civil Service Commissioners to bring forward the points.  There may be other areas where amendments to the procedure could be made with a view to improving the quality of local democracy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor raised the question of the quality of staff in local authorities.  As a result of this Bill, as well as proficiency in both languages relevant and direct experience will be taken into account. This will be the case in relation to how large local authorities can take on themselves the staff needed to do all the work involved.  The Ceann Comhairle was anxious that Deputy Taylor would not go too far down the road in respect of the difficulties of staffing in Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  This administration have inherited an extremely difficult position in relation to staffing levels in certain sections of the overall system and while I cannot deal with that in the context of this legislation, it is my hope that the whole question of local government reform, particularly in areas that are experiencing rapid urban growth, will be dealt with within the four-to-five year <Col N="1303" /> term of this administration and that under that umbrella it will be possible for each local authority at the appropriate levels to have the necessary qualified staff.</P>
    <P>Deputy McLoughlin in his maiden speech indicated clearly that he understands the problems of a small town. I support the idea that the town clerk should be able to make a career of his position as town clerk in a particular place.  Working very much with the urban district council, he would see his task as being that of the development and the promotion of his town, having the knowledge of the local authority system that either a town clerk or a county secretary has and getting to know the various groups &mdash; the trade unions, the chambers of commerce, the voluntary organisations and so on.  We are into an era in which we must make a reality of the proposal that small is beautiful and that a small town working with a career-orientated town clerk, can promote the welfare of that town in a way in which, because of the limitation of the legislation we have had up to now, was not possible. I trust that Members on all sides of the House will try to ensure that local authority posts will be filled in the way that is most effective and beneficial for the towns and for the communities concerned.</P>
    <P>I support also Deputy McLoughlin's remarks about people getting jobs on merit.  Part of the problem that all politicians experience is the persistent belief among many of the public that in some way we can fix jobs for everyone irrespective of what the post or the terms of reference of the job may happen to be. It is incumbent on all Members of the House to ensure that fairness prevails, that there is no canvassing and that people best qualified for a post get that post in a fair and objective manner.  This must be underlined especially for young people leaving second or third level education at a time when job prospects are very bad.  The whole fabric of our democratic structures would be put at <Col N="1304" /> risk if these people believed that support for a political party or for a political individual would be repaid by way of favour in respect of a post to which someone would not be entitled otherwise.  At a time of such great social change we should all have regard to what Deputy McLoughlin has had to say on this matter.</P>
    <P>Tá náire orm nach bhfuil Gaeilge mhaith agam agus nach bhfuil mé in ann an Teachta Prendergast a fhreagairt as Gaeilge.  However, I support the Deputy's contention that people should be able to do business in both languages so far as the local authorities are concerned.  Now that the legal cloud has been lifted, Bord na Gaeilge should be encouraged to promote the idea that people wishing to do business with local authorities either in Irish or in English should have that facility.  Perhaps local authorities in conjunction with Bord na Gaeilge and the Minister for the Gaeltacht would consider the whole question of bilingualism within the local authority system.</P>
    <P>At a time of extraordinary cultural invasion by way of multi-channel television and so on, it is incumbent on all of us to maintain a sense of our culture and identity.  Undoubtedly, the Irish language is part of that culture.  As Deputy Prendergast emphasised, this is an area in which the local authorities could do a great deal.  I thank the various Deputies for their remarks during the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment briefly lest I did not make myself sufficiently clear when speaking earlier. I was suggesting the adoption by local authorities who have not already done so of a recommendation that emerged from a Bord na Gaeilge seminar for officials and elected representatives of local authorities in Carraroe a couple of years ago.  This was that in areas where the local place names had the same sound in Irish as in English, the Irish version of the name be adopted as the official version for purposes of correspondence, road signs and so on.  A brief example of what I have in mind might be helpful.  I was responsible for proposing this policy <Col N="1305" /> in Limerick and I am glad that it was adopted unanimously by Limerick Corporation.  There was set up a group of officers and public representatives for the promotion of Irish within the local authority.  That was on foot of another proposal that had come from the seminar in Carraroe.  Since then Limerick Corporation have adopted the proposal that places such as Corbally, Garryowen and Ballinacurra appear in the Irish version of the names for official purposes.  A good example in this respect has been shown by CIE in terms of the indication of bus destinations.  Perhaps the lead given by Limerick Corporation in this matter could be adopted by the Department at national level.  It would be one useful way of indicating to those of us who are interested in and love the Irish language, that there is official dedication to the promotion and use of the language in every way possible.  This policy has been followed extensively in Wales.</P>

      <P>I support strongly these proposals by the Deputy but I am tempered by the realisation that as a nation we have not been very successful generally in this area in the past 50 years.  Therefore, as the Department have urged in the past, I would urge that voluntary support from the local authorities is the most valuable factor in this whole matter.  Where a local authority wish to promote this, they will get the encouragement of the Department. I will look at the Deputies' proposal to see how we in the Custom House can follow this.</P>

      <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to support what Deputy Taylor said about the quality of the person appointed.  The Minister of State is keenly interested in planning and development generally, and is aware of the necessity for efficiency in planning and development at local level.  In times of high unemployment we should proceed as quickly and as efficiently as possible and not allow bureaucratic arguments to delay planning approvals.  I say that in the interest of employment, realising the importance of ensuring that no slipshod planning approvals are let through.</P>
      <P>Because of the environmental development of our community it is important that the right type of person be appointed by the Local Appointments Commission. We have all seen the mistakes made in the past in Dublin, Cork and other cities. Community development should be geared to the needs of the area and there should not be any undue delay because rising costs might mean that the project might not be realised, thus causing unemployment or not creating employment.  I know the Minister is committed to this idea but I am using this opportunity to remind him that he will have our support in any steps he takes in that direction.</P>

      <P>I support what Deputy Gene Fitzgerald has said regarding the importance of ensuring that there will be a minimum of delay at all stages of planning procedures.  Where officials are dealing with planning permissions, particularly on large scale developments, great care is required to ensure the public get the protection they need.  That has not always happened.  We see now that large firms of builders and developers have gone into liquidation or receivership leaving estates in a half or partly finished state, with roads unfinished and these estates not in charge.  We find the attention that would have provided protection for the public at the planning stage has <Col N="1307" /> not been given and the bonding that should have been provided for ade-quartely at that stage is not there.  These unfortunate people may have to stay for years in their houses in estates that have not been put in charge of the local authorities. I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald that reasonable speed is necessary, but at the same time the essential care local authority officials must take should not be overlooked.</P>

      <P>I welcome the offer of support from the Opposition in relation to any reasonable measures we may take to speed up the planning process and to ensure that no unreasonable delays occur.  I recognise that the central problem is not so much the delays for existing work, although that is a great difficulty for the building industry, but because of the rate of growth and change in certain parts of the country local authorities have found themselves left with unsatisfactory developments after the builder has either gone bankrupt or gone into voluntary liquidation simply to avoid his obligations.</P>
      <P>So far as these matters relate to this Bill, the Local Appointments Commission will be able to ensure that the local authorities which want them can get people who have the extra special qualifications which may be necessary to do the kind of work Deputy Taylor referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the Bill is to consolidate and amend the law relating to bankruptcy, which is contained in the Irish Bankrupt and Insolvent Act, 1857, the Bankruptcy (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1872 and the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy (Ireland) Act, 1889.  These very old statutes were supplemented by Bankruptcy Court Rules which are now incorporated in the Rules of the Superior <Col N="1308" /> Courts, 1962, as amended, as well as by a number of statutory provisions relating to bankruptcy which are contained in legislation concerned primarily with other matters.</P>
    <P>The Bill is based in the main on recommendations contained in the 1972 Report of the Bankruptcy Law Committee. The report, to which the committee appended a draft Bankruptcy Bill and Rules, was published in 1973 and circulated to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas at that time.  The delay in preparing a Bill on the lines suggested by the committee was due largely to the fact that publication of the report coincided with our entry into the European Economic Community.  That required us, among other things, to enter into immediate negotiations with the other member states with a view to adopting an EEC Bankruptcy Convention.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the proposed convention, which was already in draft form and being negotiated by the original Six, was to ensure that a bankruptcy or company liquidation once begun in one member state would be recognised and enforced throughout the Community with the minimum of formality.  These negotiations have been continuing to date and have now reached Council level.  While the negotiations were at an early stage it was considered inappropriate to proceed with the introduction of domestic bankruptcy legislation.  However, when it became apparent that the draft convention would not prejudice or be prejudiced by the enactment of new national bankruptcy laws, it was decided to prepare a Bill on the basis of the committee's recommendations. The very complex and technical nature of the subject necessitated a detailed examination and revision of the Bill proposed by the committee before an acceptable text could be arrived at.</P>
    <P>This is the first bankruptcy legislation which has been put before the Oireachtas since the foundation of the State.  Since it consolidates and amends the main bankruptcy statutes which have governed the law over the past century-and-a-half, it is an extremely complex measure.  An explanatory memorandum giving some brief information about the principal <Col N="1309" /> changes which are being effected has been circulated to Deputies and I trust that they will find it useful.  If any further information of a more detailed nature is required I shall be glad to provide it during the Committee Stage.  In what follows I propose to mention only some of the major provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are three main features.  First of all, the Bill proposes to alter, in the interests of speed and efficiency, the existing methods of proving a bankrupt's debts, distributing his property, and discharging and annulling bankruptcies.  Second, it proposes to give the official assignee, subject to the general control of the court, sole responsibility in bankruptcy matters with specific powers and functions similar to those of a liquidator in the winding up of a company by the court.  Third, it proposes to align more closely the law governing the bankruptcy of individuals with the law relating to the winding up of companies.  I should like to refer in somewhat more detail to these and other changes being effected in our law.</P>
    <P>The conditions necessary to commence bankruptcy proceedings have continued with little or no change up to the present day.  For example, a condition precedent to bankruptcy is that the debtor shall have made himself liable to be proceeded against by committing what is termed an &ldquo;act of bankruptcy&rdquo;, that is, any one of a number of specified acts which are regarded as indicating the precarious state of his financial position so as to justify the commencement of proceedings which may lead to his being adjudicated bankrupt.  These acts of bankruptcy or implications of insolvency have been reduced in number and set out in modern form in section 7.</P>
    <P>One of the most criticised aspects of the law at present is that the expensive machinery of the Bankruptcy Court can be set in motion for a debt of as little as £40.  The committee regarded this situation as untenable.  Accordingly section 11, in laying down the requirements which in future must be fulfilled in order to found a petition to adjudicate, provides that the debt owing to the petitioning creditor must not be less than £500. In addition, the time during which an act <Col N="1310" /> of bankruptcy will be available to a creditor for adjudication of a debtor has been reduced from six months to three months since the committee considered it unfair that a debtor should be at risk for such a long period.  Once this period expires, the particular act of bankruptcy in question ceases to be available as a basis for the court to adjudicate.</P>
    <P>Section 16 re-enacts in substance the procedure whereby a bankruptcy is entitled to show cause against the validity of his adjudication.  Pending the outcome of his application to the court to this effect, advertisement of the adjudication is deferred.  Over the years, and more particularly since the committee reported, a practice has developed of making successive adjournments in these &ldquo;show cause&rdquo; applications, frequently for long periods, even where the validity of the adjudication is not in dispute.  Such adjournments are granted in exercise of the court's equitable jurisdiction.  While they are justified in so far as they enable the bankrupt to enter into a composition with his creditors, the fact that the adjudication is not advertised puts at risk persons who continue to give credit to the bankrupt in total ignorance of his bankruptcy.  This is particularly the case where the show cause application ultimately fails.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not disturb this &ldquo;extra-statutory&rdquo; procedure but it formally recognises its existence and endeavours to ensure that it is only invoked in circumstances where it does not involve risk for potential creditors.  Subsection (2) of section 16 therefore provides that where the court adjourns a show cause application it shall be under a specific duty to have regard to the interests of the bankrupt, his creditors and any person who might advance further credit to him.  In addition, subsection (4) of section 17 gives the court power, when granting an adjournment, to dispense with publication of the notice of the adjudication on security being given by the bankrupt or on such conditions as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals also with the fixing by the court of a statutory sitting which the bankrupt must attend and at which he must make a full disclosure of his property. <Col N="1311" /> This replaces the two such sittings required under the present law and reflects the intent of the Bill and of the committee to expedite proceedings and to reduce the number of formal sittings, not only in bankruptcy proper but also in compositions after bankruptcy&mdash;section 39&mdash;and arrangements under the control of the court&mdash;section 90(b).</P>
    <P>Under existing law bankruptcy administration may be said to be divided between the assignees, that is, the official assignee and the creditors' assignee, and the court examiner.  The committee considered that this system was archaic and cumbersome and lent itself to unnecessary duplication, in particular as regards the division of functions between the official assignee and the examiner.  They recommended that the minimal role of the creditors' assignee should be reduced still further and that the examiner's functions in bankruptcy should cease.</P>
    <P>Under section 44, where a person is adjudicated, all property belonging to him will on adjudication vest in the official assignee alone and not as hitherto jointly in the official assignee and the creditors' assignee.  Section 61 sets out the official assignee's duties and functions and implements the committee's view that the official assignee should have complete freedom in administering bankruptcies subject to the overriding control of the court and the right of a creditor or other person to apply to the court in relation to the exercise or proposed exercise of the official assignee's powers.  The specific powers and functions of the official assignee will be similar to those of a liquidator in the winding up of a company by the court.</P>
    <P>Section 76 and the First Schedule provide a new procedure for the proof and admission of debts under the supervision of the official assignee, the underlying basis of which is that creditors will normally prove their debts by sending the required evidence by post to the official assignee and by attending at his office where necessary.</P>
    <P>A major recommendation of the committee was that the system of preferential payments in bankruptcy should be abolished. <Col N="1312" /> Under this system certain debts, including arrears of tax, wages and social welfare contributions, are payable out of the bankrupt's estate in priority to the claims of ordinary creditors.  The committee were concerned because one of the main objectives of bankruptcy law was being eroded, namely, to secure equality among creditors so that one creditor would not obtain an unfair advantage over another.  They pointed out that the State and public authorities were the main beneficiaries of the system and that there was no justification for preferring them to ordinary commercial creditors.  As regards wages and salaries, the committee thought that a preference was no longer necessary, because in modern conditions trade unions would not allow substantial arrears of pay to accumulate. As regards social welfare contributions and so on, the committee considered that, instead of making these preferential, employers should be required to keep them in a special bank account which would not vest in the official assignee.</P>
    <P>As against the committee's view, a system of preferential payments, very often more extensive than ours, is an established characteristic of bankruptcy law in most jurisdictions.  It is also a feature of company law here and elsewhere.  If preferences were to be abolished in bankruptcy it would be difficult to justify the retention of the provisions in the Companies Act, 1963, relating to preferential payments on the winding up of companies, and it is in that area rather than in a bankruptcy that the effect on State revenue would be more significant.  As regards wages and salaries, bankruptcies involving arrears of these still arise, while in relation to social welfare contributions it would be difficult to ensure that employers would pay them into the special bank account as recommended by the committee.  For these reasons, the view was taken that the present system of preferential payments should be retained and this is being effected by section 81. Some amendments are being made to bring the preferences into line with company legislation.</P>
    <P>In so far as arrears of pay are concerned, <Col N="1313" /> the existing ceilings of £50 for clerks and servants and £25 for workmen and labourers are being raised to £2,500. This is the same preference as that given to those employees by the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982.</P>
    <P>The list of preferences has been extended to include all accrued holiday remuneration and remuneration in respect of absence from work through good cause as well as to pension fund payments.  These preferential payments have been taken over from the Companies Acts.  The closer alignment of bankruptcy law with the law governing the winding up of companies is also reflected in sections 56, 57 and 80, which deal with the disclaimer of onerous property by the official assignee, the avoidance of fraudulent preferences and the priority of expenses.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to two further aspects of the Bill which should make for a speedier and more efficient system of administering bankruptcies. These are sections 82 and 85, which provide for a simpler method of distributing a bankrupt's property and for the early discharge or annulment of his bankruptcy. Finally, Part V implements the committee's recommendation that the estates of persons dying insolvent should be capable of being wound up in bankruptcy. This is also the position in Northern Ireland and England.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, of course, a consolidation as well as an amending measure and it contains many provisions which simply repeat existing requirements with little or no change.  In accordance with the major recommendations of the committee it re-enacts those elements of existing law which are still relevant, while it discards provisions which have become obsolete or have fallen into disuse.  The latter category includes the provisions in the 1872 Act known as the trustee clauses.  These allow a bankrupt's estate to be wound up by a trustee and committee of inspection rather than by the assignees.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Bill does not reenact the Local Bankruptcy Ireland Act, 1888, from which the bankruptcy jurisdiction of the Cork Circuit Court originally derived.  In future the High Court <Col N="1314" />&mdash; subject to appeal to the Supreme Court &mdash; will alone have bankruptcy jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, this is the first Bankruptcy Bill ever to be introduced into the Oireachtas.  Therefore, not simply because of that but because of its very complex and technical nature, it might be better to refer the Committee Stage in due course to a special committee.  I am in the hands of the House in that respect. If the House agrees, I will move the necessary motion at the appropriate time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief because I want to take up immediately what I regard as a very sensible suggestion in the last paragraph of the Minister's speech, that this important Bill be referred to a special committee of the House.  I know it is urgent because the Bankruptcy Law Committee have been sitting for a long number of years now.  It is important, in order to get the whole of the bankruptcy procedures and laws updated in line with modern commercial practice, to have this Bill introduced.  The most expeditious way of doing this would be to establish a special committee and I feel that the Committee Stage should be referred to such a committee of the House.  I should be very glad if the Minister would, as he suggests himself, move the necessary motion at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>There are a few brief points I should like to make in regard to the Minister's introductory remarks.  He is very right, in my view, in stating that the expensive machinery of the bankruptcy court can be set in motion for a debt of as little as £40, which is ludicrous in this day and age.  That is an obviously untenable position. Indeed the £500 suggested by the Minister might even be raised higher than that.  Having regard to the modern depreciation of money he might consider raising that level to £1,000.  Obviously the present position is untenable, as the committee say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of successive adjournments constitutes an abuse of the whole system.  The committee themselves have helped in highlighting that aspect.  A practice has developed of making successive <Col N="1315" /> adjournments in &ldquo;show cause&rdquo; applications. These adjournments are granted as part of a court's equitable jurisdiction. Again that has given rise to a situation in which courts have been clogged and bankruptcies have dragged on over the years.  There will have to be some remedy devised in that respect.  The question of whether the equitable jurisdictional aspect is being overdone is something that should be examined.  This refers to section 16 in particular.  I should prefer to have this done on a statutory basis rather than any equitable jurisdiction giving rise to an overall freedom of action of the courts.  That is my view of the matter.  The more tightening of legislation in this area the better.  What has happened heretofore is that the legislation has been too fluid and easy and the net result has been that bankruptcies have dragged on interminably.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that this Bill is essentially one for special committee consideration I might say that I agree fully with the committee in their contention as regards the division of functions between the official assignee and the court examiner, the recommendation that the examiner's function in bankruptcy should cease and that the minimal role of the creditors' assignee should be reduced.  I feel it should be abolished and have the whole of that area vested in one office, that of the official assignee.  Of course it is a matter for the special committee to examine that aspect.</P>
    <P>I side with the Minister against the committee's recommendation that the system of preferential payments in bankruptcy should be abolished.  This would mean that the priority given to the payment of debts relating to arrears of tax, wages and social welfare contributions over claims of creditors would cease.  For practical and good reasons the Bill goes against that recommendation.  In all jurisdictions where bankruptcy law operates preferences exist and rightly so.  Revenue which is owed to the State, social welfare payments and wages owed to employees should be regarded as preferential matters. For once the old law is right and should be retained in spite of the committee's <Col N="1316" /> recommendation.  I am glad that the Bill incorporates this point of view and I am sure it is one the special committee will regard as proper.  There may be changes in the system of preferential payments, either additions or deletions, but the fundamental notion that debts owing to public authorities and the less well-off sections of the community should be acknowledged and regarded as having priority over other debts is a good principle.</P>
    <P>There are other points in the Bill which can be teased out in the special committee. This is a Bill about which there is not much conflict.  It is obviously necessary and long overdue.  The committee have been sitting for many years and there is an expectation in the business community that a Bill such as this will be passed. There is uncertainty at present because of archaic conflicting interests regarding bankruptcy procedures.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill rejects the committee's finding in regard to preferential payments. The Bill is welcomed by the Opposition and the sooner the motion to introduce and implement the special committee is made the better from our point of view.  It is necessary and important legislation which will give a sense of certainty to the business and commercial community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand why the subject of bankruptcy comes under the brief of the Minister for Justice whereas the allied subject of company law and liquidation comes under the brief of the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  Both these branches are parallel in the context of the law reform which the Dáil has been discussing.  The logical development would be that both matters would be dealt with by one Department and Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole subject of bankruptcy, as the Minister pointed out, has never received the attention of the Oireachtas since the foundation of the State.  I could go further and say it did not receive the attention of parliament for upwards of 50 years before the State was formed.  The existing system we have dates back well over 100 years.  It is entirely antiquated, <Col N="1317" /> archaic, full of anomalies and inconsistencies. It requires radical alteration.  For that reason, I am disappointed to find that after 100 years when the matter comes up for discussion the best that can be put forward is a measure largely designed to consolidate existing law.  I agree there is also an element of amendment of bankruptcy law contained in it but reading through it, it is primarily a consolidating measure.  I would have thought we could have done better than this and have had a radical review of the whole subject.  For example, the principle of the act of bankruptcy which the Minister referred to is preserved in the existing Bill.  It is an entirely archaic concept and in the modern context should be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>The procedures to adjudicate a person bankrupt are unnecessarily complex.  It requires three documents: a notice in the first instance, a bankruptcy summons and a petition to adjudicate.  I fail to understand why three documents should be necessary when one document, a simple notice of application to the intending debtor, would be perfectly adequate.  The procedure is also expensive.  Part of the expense derives from the fact that the High Court has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with bankruptcy matters other than the anomaly of the Cork Circuit Court which had a jurisdiction but this is being taken away in the Bill.  A less expensive procedure using the District Court and skilled registrars who would be trained as specialists in the field of bankruptcy would be a more appropriate procedure in the modern context.  I am disappointed that the Bill retains the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court in the matter of bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>The whole emphasis of the Bill is misplaced in the sense that it concentrates the resolving of an insolvency case in the field of bankruptcy.  That is wrong in the modern context.  I would have thought that the ultimate remedy of bankruptcy should have been confined to exceptional cases which involved serious misconduct or fraud on the part of a debtor who was obtaining assets, making away with them and avoiding payment of his debts.  In the case of fraud or misconduct I would agree <Col N="1318" /> that the ultimate remedy of bankruptcy would be appropriate, but in the more common case of a person who has failed in business through no fault of his own I would have thought that alternative procedures could have been devised which would have been simpler and less expensive. I refer to a procedure under which, without having a person actually adjudicated bankrupt, he or his creditors would be enabled to have an arrangement perhaps to defer process against him so that he would be enabled to come to an arrangement to pay off his debts out of future salary or earnings.  A simplified procedure could be brought in for the obtaining of protection orders during the making of arrangements by the debtor with his creditors.  The ultimate stigma of bankruptcy would be reserved and confined to cases of misconduct and fraud.</P>
    <P>I know there is under existing procedures a system for arranging debtors but it is an archaic procedure which is expensive and complex.  I believe it is very rarely used and perhaps the Minister could clarify this point.  A new simplified and inexpensive procedure to enable a debtor to make an arrangement with his creditors under the protection of the court would be a major step forward and one would have welcomed that sort of reforming tendency in our law of bankruptcy in the first such measure to come before the House since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that provision would have been inserted in an amending Bill on bankruptcy to provide facilities whereby a debtor who had a business and who employed people could have been enabled to preserve that business intact as a going concern, thereby preserving at least some of the jobs of those employed. The whole thrust and emphasis of the present bankruptcy procedure, as would be consolidated in this Bill, have the effect not of preserving a business as an entity but of selling it off, breaking up the entity and disposing of it for the purpose of realising assets.  A procedure which would facilitate preserving the entity would have been welcomed in what should be a reforming measure.</P>
    <P>The protection of the family home is a <Col N="1319" /> matter which is not touched on in the Bill and I had hoped it would receive some attention in such a measure.  Under the existing system a family home would fall into the assets of the bankrupt and would be liable to be seized like any other asset by the official assignee, thereby causing tremendous hardship to the family of the bankrupt, people with no responsibility for the financial difficulties in which he found himself.  The thrust in recent legislation has been to recognise the special position of the family home and to enact special measures to protect it, as in the Family Home Protection Act.  I do not suggest that a bankrupt should be left in an expensive house while his creditors are seeking money.  That would be an untenable proposition but there could be some measure which would at least give the bankrupt and his family a fixed measure of time within which he would be permitted to remain in the family home and which would enable him to make arrangements to acquire alternative accommodation.  He could be given a year or 18 months before the home would be liable to seizure by the official assignee, as the remainder of his assets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan touched on the question of preferential payments and expressed pleasure at the fact that these were preserved.  I agree so far as the preferential payments due in respect of salaries to people who have been employees are concerned but I would disagree entirely with the suggestion that debts due to the State, to say nothing of debts due to a local authority, should receive preferential treatment.  That would be entirely inconsistent in the context of equality and I can see no basis whatsoever for suggesting that a debt due to the State should be in a special position and should be paid in full before a debt lawfully and properly due to a private individual. The State in this context should receive compensation in the same manner as anybody else.  To give a State preference would mean that the amount recoverable to a private individual could be very substantially reduced, in some cases causing serious hardship to an individual owed money by a bankrupt's <Col N="1320" /> estate, whereas the benefit that would accrue to the State would be infinitesimal in proportion to the State's revenues.  To extend that even to the matter of rates due to a local authority seems to be extending the principle of preferential payment to an outrageous degree and in all seriousness I would ask the Minister to re-examine the question of preferential payments both to the State and to local authorities and to consider reverting to the recommendations made by the committee which would be in line with my thinking on this subject.  There should be equality and the State should not be in a special position but should rank the same as anybody else.  The State, if it allows its debts to accumulate over a period, is at fault in the same manner as anybody else.  It has facilities to collect its debts and very wide and extensive powers to raise its assessment and collect taxes due.  If it fails to do that and if debts are found outstanding, the State is entitled to prove its debts and be treated the same as any other creditor.</P>
    <P>I express my disappointment that we are faced here after a period of about 100 years with a largely consolidating measure. I do not object to putting this Bill into Committee but the measure I would have hoped for after 100 years during which there was no treatment of this subject by any legislature would have been altogether more radical.  I do not know whether a committee would be able to bring into effect the radical alterations of the system of bankruptcy I would wish to see.  I will certainly suggest some amendments along the lines I have outlined. The Bill does little more than trim the edges of the system rather than bring about a rethink of the concept of bankruptcy and how best an insolvent debtor should be treated in a modern context.  It builds in, cements in and consolidates the old system and all forward thinking on it is at variance in many respects with the subject matter of the Bill.</P>
    <P>An excellent committee dealt with this in England.  The Cork Report put forward excellent suggestions for a new and revised system of bankruptcy administration. I would have thought that the many valuable suggestions and recommendations <Col N="1321" /> in that report would have been drawn on and used to parallel in our own purposes.  Unfortunately, that does not seem to have been done and many of the measures incorporated in the Bill are directly at variance with the proposals in that report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the attempt in the Bill to speed up the procedure in dealing with bankruptcy. In particular, the measure which deals with proof of amounts due is an important one &mdash; to put a time limit on the period in which people must present proof of debts and a sworn affidavit to back them up.  One of the big problems in the past has been the long delay that takes place while various claims are teased out and dealt with.  That will be an important reform but I should like to see more specification of the time limit within the Bill.  It does not specify any time limit in respect of debts due, although it does specify a time limit of one month in respect of claims upon property.  A specific time limit might be appropriate in this case also.  It is also welcome to see that the procedure whereby the official assignee is consulted in dealing with bankruptcy cases.  It will speed up his ability to deal with bankruptcy as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be an argument for greater use by the official assignee of outside administrators in the case of bankruptcy. As I understand it, his office is very overloaded at present due to the fact that his role is not only in the case of bankruptcy but also in the case of the liquidation of companies.  That may to some extent be responsible for the delay, but it might be worth considering greater use by the official assignee of outside administrators. There is the argument that this may leash money from the estate to pay the fees of an outside administrator but I do not think that argument has substance since people have entered into transactions with the estate willingly.  It is hard to see why the State should pick up the tab for administration of that estate when it proves bankrupt.  I would not accept that the use of outside administration would be unduly burdensome <Col N="1322" /> on the procedure.</P>
    <P>On a broader context I have to echo some of the points raised by Deputy Taylor. He mentioned the Cork Report on bankruptcy and the conclusions of that report were quite dramatic.  The report stated:</P>
    <P>It became clear at an early stage of our deliberations that the immense social and economic changes which have taken place since the mid-Nineteenth Century, when our present insolvency laws and procedures were formulated, have rendered them at best obsolescent and at worst positively harmful.  Without radical reform they are no longer capable of meeting the requirements of a modern society and fresh legislation of a comprehensive nature is urgently required.</P>
    <P>Our legislation as I understand it &mdash; I am no expert in the area &mdash; almost entirely stems from the British legislation which was under study for the Cork Committee. There is the indication, therefore, that our legislation has also become obsolete to that disturbing degree.  It seems to me that there are three objectives which ought to be achieved by a reform of bankruptcy law.  The first is that wherever possible the bankrupt's estate should be disposed of as a going concern.  Secondly, to the greatest extent possible, ordinary creditors should get fair treatment and as large as possible a proportion of the amounts owing to them from the estate when it is wound up.  The final objective is that there should be greater speed and minimum hardship involved in the procedure.</P>
    <P>The Bill tackles those in part but it is certainly wanting in many areas.  The point of disposing of the estate as a going concern is not touched upon at all in the Bill.  There is a need to improve the law in relation to this.  The Cork Committee made a recommendation that the functions and responsibilities of administrators should be reformed so that they would have greater powers to carry on the business of the debtors and to rescue whatever possible out of the estate.  That committee recommended that the appointment of an administrator &mdash; in <Col N="1323" /> our Bill that is only at the discretion of the official assignee &mdash; could be proposed by either a debtor or any one of the creditors provided they gave grounds why they believed the business could be kept on as a going concern.  If that was adopted it would give greater opportunity to pull the business back because many of the bankruptcies we see now, or the difficulties companies get into, are due to bad management.  With reform in management it could be that a lot of the business could be rescued.</P>
    <P>The other major fear, especially in the present climate when there are so many firms getting into difficulty, is that the valuable experience of the workforce and valuable non-realisable assets of the company are completely sunk in the event of it being wound up and sold.  Every attempt should be made to go as far as possible along the way of preserving the business of the debtor as a going concern. If that proposal of the Cork Committee offers a hope in that direction it would be only appropriate that it be examined.  The special committee to be set up should look at that.</P>
    <P>The second area in which there should be reform in our Bankruptcy Acts is this. The ordinary creditors should have access to a greater portion of the estate.  This issue is ducked largely by the present Bill.  As the Minister pointed out, this Bill has adopted largely the preferential debts which are included in the Companies Acts.  In very many cases in the recent past, these preferential claims on the estate of a debtor who became insolvent have absorbed virtually all of the estate, and there has been very little pay-back to the ordinary creditors.</P>
    <P>Preferential debts fall into two main categories.  One is tax and the other is the claim of the employees.  In the case of taxation, the bankruptcy committee of 1972 dealt very comprehensively with the arguments put forward as to why tax should have a preference.  Mainly the arguments are that the State cannot control the level of its debt and, very often when a debtor gets into difficulties, the State's debt is long-fingered.  That is one <Col N="1324" /> argument offered in favour of the State's preferential debts.</P>
    <P>Another argument is that the State represents the community and the common good and should not fall victim in a bankruptcy case.  A final argument offered is that the alternative to giving the State preference is that there will be increased taxation for the rest of the community. The 1972 commission dealt very fully and adequately with those arguments.  In particular they pointed to the exceptional powers the State has to recover its debts. They also pointed out that the State is not the only one who enters into debt with a bankrupt without knowingly and voluntarily doing so.  Very many suppliers are in precisely the same position as are people who have been purchasing goods from the debtor.  Those goods were proved to be faulty and a court judgment found in favour of the consumer.</P>
    <P>I have known of cases where, when a company was wound up, people who had got a court ruling that they should be compensated were left high and dry.  I am thinking of a particular case.  The person was particularly vulnerable and had made a substantial investment of his life's savings in the goods which proved faulty.  On the winding up of the company he was not paid anything.  There is a real issue there.  There are others.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Taylor said, in very many cases the individual member of the public will be victimised to an enormous extent in terms of his purse, whereas if the general public forfeited their preferential position they would be hurt to a very small extent individually.  It would be a tiny proportion of the total tax revenue which would be collected.  That is the argument against the possible worry that tax might be increased if the State lost its preferential position.  The truth of the matter is that the sums of money are not so substantial that they would increase significantly the tax bill for the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>The only cases for which there is a strong argument for continuing the preference afforded to the State are PAYE and PRSI payments.  In those cases essentially the debtor is acting as a tax collector on behalf of the State.  It is not simply a <Col N="1325" /> tax due from the debtor to the State.  He is franchised to collect tax and what he has collected is the property of the State and should continue to get preference.</P>
    <P>The preference should be limited in time.  The preference, which dates back for as many years as one would care to mention, means that there will be a very long delay in settling up exactly what is due.  Often this can hold up the bankruptcy proceedings.  The Cork Committee in Britain recommended on this very point that the time limit for the preferential debt in respect of PAYE and PRSI payments should be limited to the last complete period for which returns were due.  That would be a relatively short period and the whole matter could be cleared up quickly.  There would not be the long delay which occurs at present.</P>
    <P>There would be other valuable spinoffs if the preferential debt position of the State were eliminated.  In particular, the Revenue Commissioners would be encouraged to be more attentive to the collection of tax due, instead of waiting until others petitioned for bankruptcy and effectively scooped the pool as they do at present.  That would be a worth-while change in the whole area of tax collection.  The other worth-while change would be that it would speed up the procedure under which long delays can arise in agreeing tax liability.</P>
    <P>The other area of preferential debt relates to employees.  On this matter I take issue with Deputy Taylor when he says he believes preferential debt to employees should be retained.  I can see the argument as to why employees are thought to be particularly vulnerable and victimised in the event of a bankruptcy. However, I do not think it is exclusively the employees who are particularly vulnerable and victimised in the case of a bankruptcy.  There are also weak creditors who may be caught, as I described in one particular case, or there may be creditors whose whole business depends on the money outstanding to them from the bankrupt.  We had examples of such occurrences in the recent past.  Therefore, I do not think the employees' claim holds universal preference in the hierarchy of what is the most desirable group <Col N="1326" /> to give preference to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better sell that to the Labour Party.  It is a bit Victorian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I beg to differ.  There are many social causes we would like to support and among them are not just the employees but also the victimised creditors.  Under EEC directive 1980/987 in the very near future it is proposed that the State should pick up that sort of liability of the employees.  In other words the employees who had forfeited their just wages through the winding up of a company would be covered under the normal social welfare code.  I am not saying they do not have a good case in social justice but it is one that should be picked up by the community at large and not by a limited group of creditors who now pick up the tab under the preferential debt procedure.</P>
      <P>The EEC directive will be most welcome to all sides of the House.  As I understand it, from the experience in Britain which already has a code like that, the cost is not enormous because, as the Minister pointed out, employees are not a group who fall into significant arrears with their employer, even in the event of bankruptcy.  However, there is an important point which the change will make if employees' preferential debt was dropped.  The present system whereby banks can use the employees' preference to get preference for their debt would be eliminated.  At present, in cases of company law, although not in the case of bankrupts, banks can claim that because they advanced money to pay wages they are entitled to the employees' preference which otherwise would have prevailed. That is a procedure which is open to abuse by banks; essentially they are able to jump the gun over other debtors.  It is hard to see why a bank supplying advances should be treated more favourably than a company who were supplying raw materials.  I cannot see why that distinction should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third area which I mentioned as the objectives of the reform of a bankruptcy Bill is in dealing with greater speed <Col N="1327" /> and with less hardship.  Deputy Taylor drew attention to one area where the Cork Committee suggested that improvements could be made.  The Bill already deals with the need to provide greater speed.  It is suggested in the Cork Committee report that less hardship could occur if there was, for example, the right of a debtor to call together the creditors at a meeting with some sort of statutory backing and discuss the possibility of coming to a voluntary agreement on the winding up of the company and that bankruptcy and all that goes with it could be avoided in that case.</P>
    <P>They are the major reforms which are not fully dealt with in this Bill.  With Deputy Taylor, I would like to see in Committee some consideration given to reforms in these directions.  I know they would, to a large extent, involve, as the Minister said, reforms that would bear just as much on the winding up of companies as on the winding up of estates. However, I do not think that is a reason for ducking the issue.  Possibly, some method could be introduced of drawing the Companies Act into our consideration in Committee to see where the overlap could involve reform in both codes. I think the intention of this Bill was to bring the two codes into agreement so I do not think it would be outside the scope of a committee to examine both Bills simultaneously.</P>
    <P>In looking at this Bill, I noticed that the bankrupt is allowed to retain articles to the value of £1,000.  Although it is a substantial improvement on what was there already it is still very low and the sort of items mentioned in the Bill, such as household effects and so on, would soon amount to £1,000.  I also echo some concern expressed about the family home.  As Deputy Taylor said, we cannot go all the way in exempting a home from a bankrupt's estate.  However, if the Family Home Protection Act protects the wife from a husband selling the property over her head, would it not equally protect her from his committing it in debt, as it were, over her head and without her permission?  Are we not, to some extent, flying in the face of that Act?  This would <Col N="1328" /> especially arise in the case of a joint ownership where the wife would have an even stronger legal claim over the family home.  There is an area there that needs to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the procedure involving the practice of relating back, whereby the official assignee is able to declare void any transactions that have occurred between the date of the first Bankruptcy Act and the signing of the petition.  The idea is to prevent bankrupts giving away large parts of their assets before creditors can get a hold of them. In this Bill that has been replaced by provisions to eliminate fraudulent preferences and also a new provision to prevent a bankrupt selling below market value in the run up to the bankruptcy proceedings.  I understand it is very difficult, in practice, to prove fraud.  One has to establish that the debtor knowingly and willingly attempted to give preference to one creditor over another.  It can be quite difficult to prove that the bankrupt did that knowingly and willingly so I have my doubts about the effectiveness of this replacement that is being provided for in the Bill and similarly in the case of any sales below market value being treated as void by the official assignee. Before he can treat them as void, it is required that the purchaser in that case knew that the person was bankrupt. Again, it would be difficult to establish that a purchaser did know that the debtor was bankrupt, that he was getting money to which he was not entitled and making a sale.  I am concerned as to whether the present procedures proposed in this Bill to replace the old relation back are foolproof. Perhaps, again in Committee, we could examine the specific clauses dealing with that situation and satisfy ourselves that that is the case.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in its attempt to simplify procedures to speed up dealing with bankrupt cases.  However, I must echo the concern expressed by the Cork Committee in Britain that our procedures established in the nineteenth century have become obsolete and are becoming increasingly irrelevant to the growing number of difficulties that companies are running into, especially during this recession <Col N="1329" /> which has brought many of them to their knees.  We should be seeking a Bill which does more towards achieving disposal of a debtor's assets as a going concern and replacing them by better management if that will solve the problem.  If the case cannot be retrieved in that way, we should give greater justice to the ordinary creditors who are often small people robbed of substantial sums.  They should not be asked to carry the conscience of the community so that employees and the taxpayers can be protected. The community should pick up those social requirements, not the individual creditors.</P>

      <P>I came to the House for the purpose of making a speech on Dáil reform but unfortunately arrangements were made by the Whips to conclude the debate.  I thought I should give the House the benefit of my long experience here and, as it was not possible for me to contribute to that debate, I decided to make a brief contribution on the Bankruptcy Bill.  When I make up my mind to make a speech I make a speech.</P>
      <P>I was interested to see that so few speakers contributed without referring to British law.  When are we going to break away from looking on British law as the example we should follow?  We are an independent, sovereign Parliament, but we are a young country.  Many of the British Acts of Parliament, such as the 1857 Act, which is incorporated in this Bill, the 1890 Act, the 1872 Act dealing with debtors and the Act of 1889 were designed at a time when circumstances were completely different from those of today.  They were prepared by the British Parliament when the master of the manor was supreme, when the debtor was the ordinary peasant who was looked on with contempt and disrespect by the lord of the manor.  Yet, here we are in 1983 and we do not design legislation to suit our own times and our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my long experience as a Member of this House I have come across numerous bankrupts and also many cases dealing with wards of court.  I would have thought that legislation in those areas should be updated and modernised in order to eliminate <Col N="1330" /> all the red tape involved.  I hope that soon we will have legislation before this House to unravel the legal knots which cause so many problems for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>This House should take a serious view of the problem of bankruptcy.  There has been a record number of bankruptcies lately and the economic forecasts do not encourage the thought that there will be a lessening in the number of unfortunate people who are likely to be declared bankrupt in the years to come.  Is it not time that we changed the word &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo;? I do not like it and this view is shared by many people.  It has the sound of the lord of the manor and the peasant. Would it not be better to call this Bill &ldquo;The Insolvency Bill, 1983&rdquo;?  Would it not be better to call the person now known as a bankrupt by the word &ldquo;insolvent&rdquo;? The word &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo; carries an extraordinary stigma.  How often do we hear in rural Ireland that a person's father, grandfather or great-grandfather was a bankrupt?  Many people use the word &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo; without knowing its meaning.  We should have Irish legislation to suit our times, conditions and our people.  We should get away from the titles imposed by alien legislation which we are continuing to this date.  I hate to refer to people as bankrupts.  There may be little difference between the title &ldquo;a bankrupt&rdquo; and &ldquo;an insolvent&rdquo; but perhaps the latter will not carry the same stigma.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will serve a purpose. If I were asked what kind of legislation is necessary to deal with this problem I would suggest it be based on a county basis with a county registrar dealing with it.  It is about time county registrars were paid a proper rate: they are working for a pittance.  I hope the Minister for Justice will improve their office conditions and assist them in their work. There must be in his office a file which would take a handcart to move from place to place dealing with the problems of county registrars.  I suggest that a county registrar should have with him a person who could be known as &ldquo;the insolvent officer&rdquo;.  These officers should be in each county to deal with the problem in <Col N="1331" /> that area, rather than attempting to deal with it on a national scale.  That officer would know the debtor and whether fraud was involved.  He would also know the creditors and many of the difficulties that exist today could be solved without any grave embarrassment to those unfortunate enough to fall into debt through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>These are the people we want to deal with, people who in all good faith have fallen on hard times, who in spite of every effort they could make with their own skill and industry, working hard from sunrise to nightfall, find because of their domestic circumstances that it is impossible to pay all the debts they incur.  Many a person through no fault of his own &mdash; for example, farmers who were advised to borrow by the State, Government Ministers, agricultural officers, county committees of agriculture and the EEC in relation to farm development and at whom various banks shovelled out money &mdash; now finds himself in a very serious plight because he accepted what could be considered wise, sound advice in order to increase his profits and make himself better off.  Are we to stand by now when we see such people with debts they cannot pay having their names published in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> and outside courthouses and on public notices and being described as bankrupts so that their children's children's children may carry the stigma attached to bankruptcy?  A person who is bankrupt through no fault of his own is given the same title and standing as the person who is bankrupt through fraud.  There must be a difference, but the law does not make any difference. For that reason steps should be taken to bring our legislation more into keeping with the prevailing circumstances.</P>
    <P>In numerous cases individuals take the responsibility for directorships of a number of companies and they can deliberately let one company go into heavy debt as a matter of central company economics and then they can transfer the assets, such as the machinery and so on from the insolvent company to the other companies which apparently are solvent.  Why have such people not been brought to <Col N="1332" /> justice?  There seems to be no law to deal with them.  In a case which comes to my mind the High Court awarded a very substantial sum by way of workman's compensation to an unfortunate worker who will never work again.  The moment the High Court made the order for compensation the company sought the protection of the court.  I am informed reliably and have gone to the trouble of informing the liquidator in writing that quite an amount of valuable machinery was removed from one area where there was industrial activity to another area. All the people concerned were directors of different companies and at the same time of the one company.  That may be rather difficult for people to understand, but there is nothing to prevent such individuals from being directors of a number of companies and having various forms of activity in progress.  The result in this case was that the unfortunate worker was informed that there was not a penny piece to meet the just award of the court.  From that day to this he never got a penny, nor is he likely to do so.  Does any Member of this House tell me that that is justice and honesty, that it is not a form of fraud to do that man out of what the law awarded him because some smart aleck could drive a coach and four through the existing bankruptcy laws?  This man and his family must suffer loss while he must suffer also the pain of never being able to work again and he must maintain his independence and keep his family.  The law which permits that must be described as nothing short of seriously defective.  In cases such as this some protection should be afforded to workers in companies which are either forced into bankruptcy or which go into voluntary liquidation.</P>
    <P>In how many cases throughout the length and breadth of this country are workers deprived of their social welfare benefits and of their contributory pensions to which the law of the land entitles them because their employers did not comply with the law in either the payment of contributions under the Social Welfare Acts or through other means of neglect? The State should provide some means of protecting people who have been victims of sharp practice of this kind.  I have seen <Col N="1333" /> too many cases of it and hardly a Deputy in this House has not come across cases of this grave form of injustice.</P>
    <P>I have often said, and it is no harm to repeat, that such people may drive a coach and four through the laws here but they will not do so through the laws that will be hereafter.  Numerous people, particularly in modern society, have very little thought about the significance of what can be described as debt.  They run wrecklessly into debt which incurs the obligation to repay when one can.  A sense of responsibility in this regard seems to be lacking.  In the repayment of debts there are numerous obligations. There is the obligation to pay one's debts and the obligation to do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.</P>
    <P>We have heard here reference to the making of affidavits.  There was a time when an affadavit meant something.  In modern times in many cases affadavits are hardly worth the paper they are written on because the quality of life has changed.  If the quality of life has changed to that extent we cannot expect much progress from this Bill particularly if it is based on incorporating Acts passed by the British House of Commons 100 years ago.  During those days debts and affidavits meant something.  There were victims of debt in those days and there were those associated with fraud.</P>
    <P>I have known many people declared bankrupt who were very decent and honourable people.  They worked hard to pay their way but because of many problems they were unable to keep their heads above water.  Some machinery should be set up on a county basis to help people like that.  Problems of this kind should be tackled in the rural and urban localities where the officers in charge will know the debtors and creditors and will also know the history of all the people involved. Every effort should be made to sort matters out before the stigma of the bankrupt is put on any family or individual.</P>
    <P>Many people have been deliberately driven into bankruptcy.  There was a motive for doing this.  Many of us are long enough in public life to know that debts were built up against one or two former Members of the House for the <Col N="1334" /> purpose of having those people silenced in Parliament.  We are also aware of cases where payments were not made on principle for some reason.  Even for a relatively small amount of money the notices were signed and issued and efforts were made to have such people who did not pay on principle declared bankrupt.  The threat of bankruptcy has hung over certain people because they would not do certain things and respond to certain requests.  How dreadful it is to live in a community where the laws of the land allow such an extraordinary state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is anything wrong in setting machinery up by legislation to make arrangements for the payment of debts by instalments over a long period so that those particular people will be saved the embarrassment of being described as bankrupt.  This would avoid having to publish notices in the usual legal form bearing the names of very decent people who through no fault of their own are declared bankrupt.  There should be a distinction between the person who is in serious debt and under pressure by creditors through no fault of his or her own and the person who is in that position through fraud.  Our bankruptcy laws have not distinguished between the genuine case of hardship and debt and the individual who is in that position because of fraud.</P>
    <P>What about the many fly-by-night industrialists who were given vast sums of money by the State for industrial purposes and to create employment and when it suited them packed up in the dead of night and flew out of the country with any profits they made and any money they could take out?  How do we get those people back?  How are their obligations met?  In recent years there have been many of those fly-by-night industrialists who deprived the State and the taxpayers of vast sums of money, who came here with the fraudulent intention, under the disguise of creating jobs, of taking what they could and disappearing when it suited them.  Many of them were there when the doors closed at 5.30 but were far from our shores by the rising of the sun the following morning.  The <Col N="1335" /> workers and the creditors had to whistle for the payment of the debts those people incurred.</P>
    <P>We have had the sad experience of people falling on hard times and we have seen too many of what can be described as sheriff sales.  I hope those days are gone.  When I became a Member of this House 40 years ago I saw farmers' livestock and the contents of their machinery sheds and haggards taken into court squares and put up for sale.  There were John Browns in those days and I suppose there are also many of them about today. They are always ready to find a bargain at the expense of unfortunate families who have fallen on hard times.  I make no apology for saying that in any bankruptcy legislation land should be excluded.  I have seen too many people in my constituency and elsewhere falling into debt through no fault of their own, who are forced to put some of their land up for sale.  I have seen orders made to have land put up for sale.  In many cases cheap land was readily available for a John Brown because of debts of a family who were born and reared and had lived for generations on that land.  There should be some law to safeguard people who are financially embarrassed.  Deputy Taylor referred to the family home.</P>
    <P>Many years ago I headed a procession of 2,000 people through the town of Tullamore after a grave injustice had been perpetrated on a family.  Acting single-handed, I had that injustice undone but today there seems to be a great lack of courage on the part of public representatives compared with those times.  Nowadays many public representatives merely cite the law and say there is nothing they can do, whereas they can do plenty.  The John Brown or the emergency man can always be prevented from taking the roof from over anyone's head. In the past 40 years I have seen the John Browns deprive many a poor person of his home because of his inability to meet his obligations.  Because of the economic position today many landowners are being forced into bankruptcy.  If not by way of legislation, I hope that steps will be taken outside this House by such <Col N="1336" /> organisations as the IFA and other right-thinking people to ensure always that the John Browns will never have the opportunity of depriving anyone of his home.  We are very likely to experience John Brown times again.  I know of one man in my constituency who borrowed £50,000 in order to buy land.  His debt in that regard is now £87,000 so we can assume safely that the land will not be paid for even in the lifetime of that man's grandchildren.  That sort of serious debt will tie up the title deeds of that property for the lifetime of three generations but that will be through no fault of the landowner. It arises from his anxiety to develop and to extend his holding and thereby to provide a better standard of living for his wife and family.  There is no better time for safeguarding the interests of such people than when we are dealing with a Bill relating to bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>There is no point in our having pious words written into the Constitution in terms of the protection of the family if we do not also have laws which ensure that families are never deprived of their homes because of debt that is artificially created.  Is it not a tragedy that people through no fault of their own should lose their homes in which generations of their ancestors were born and reared?  There is no question of any authority being set up by the State to advise people who find themselves in difficult financial situations. As legislators we have an obligation to assist such people.  Generally the people who suffer most in a case of bankruptcy are the wife and children of the bankrupt.  Too often I have seen small businesses, farmlands and houses being taken from families because of the financial difficulties in which they have found themselves.  There are times when members of the legal profession are very slow to take on cases of people who find themselves in that deplorable financial position but fortunately there are many dedicated members of the Incorporated Law Society who, without receiving any remuneration, are prepared to defend the privileges of the people I am talking about.</P>
    <P>We all know of the many small businesses that have gone to the wall in recent years.  Many family grocers and other <Col N="1337" /> shopkeepers were put out of business as a result of the big supermarket combines which, in many cases, have their headquarters outside our shores.  But there was no machinery to protect these small business people.  Even by way of this Bill, what machinery is there in that regard? The people I am referring to are those that many of us here have devoted most of our lives to helping but we need to change the law so that there can be proper legal help for those people.  We are heading for an extraordinary period for the next ten years, a period in which people will be driven from their homes and off the land and in which further small businesses will be closed to make way for the multinationals.  I have great respect for the reports on economic trends that emanate from the OECD. Judging from these reports there is little hope of economic recovery for at least ten years or maybe for 20 years.  Where, then, will all these people who are now in debt find the wherewithal to meet their obligations?  They will not be able to meet their obligations and, consequently, they will be faced with bankruptcy.  What a situation to have to hand on to their families.  The sooner the better we move away from the present system of dealing with people who find themselves in that situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is a means of keeping together the British legislation, simply including odds and ends to simplify parts of that legislation.  Can we not sit down and pool together our best resources and deal with the problems of these people as they should be dealt with rather than to leave them bankrupt?</P>
    <P>I am dealing with people who find themselves in that position through no fault of their own.  If through fraudulent activities a business is closed down or its assets are transferred elsewhere, the laws of the land should deal very severely with the person concerned. There is not very much in this Bill to cover such a situation.  I do not have any sympathy or consideration for the person who goes bankrupt because of fraudulent dealings but I have every sympathy and consideration for the person who gets <Col N="1338" /> into difficulties because of hard times or accidental mismanagement.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity of studying the economics of the family as a unit as well as financial stresses on the individual.  If the full powers of this House are not available to assist these people, what then?  Are we merely passing legislation to put laws on the Statute Book to make life more difficult for these people, or do we intend including in our legislation some way to help these people?  That would be the proper form for our legislation to take, particularly in present times.  Bankruptcy is an every day occurrence, and we sympathise with people who find themselves in that position through no fault of their own but expressions of sympathy are little use when the locks are put on the door and the curtains are drawn for the last time. Why not include in this legislation a way to help these people not just once but as often as is needed?  We seem to be forgetting our responsibility to the honest people of this country.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives us the opportunity to consider the plight of these people.  There is room on our Statute Book for new legislation to deal with Irish conditions, Irish customs and Irish tradition; our own laws for our own people, to help people who have fallen on difficult times through no fault of their own.  In this new legislation we should abolish for all time the title &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo;.  That word is detested in the country.  Families have carried that stigma to the fourth generation.  The title &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo; carries the same stigma as the old workhouse, poorhouse and county homes carried.  Thank God almost all these institutions have gone.  If we are to introduce progressive ideas we will have to consider the suggestions which have been made so far.</P>
    <P>The appointment by the courts of liquidators is being done on a national scale. We should have legislation to deal with the problems of these people area by area rather than nationally.  In this Bill we should try to help people avoid bankruptcy and so avoid the stigma of &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo;. These people who have been declared bankrupts through no fault of their own, should be able to go out at <Col N="1339" /> weekends with their heads held high.  We have an opportunity now to do something for these people.  Members should give the House the benefit of their experience in helping such people to deal with problems of this kind.  Many members of the Government are too young to know about the difficulties faced by people some years ago when they tried to keep the wolf from the door and avoid bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>Some of us have had the painful experience of sitting for hours looking through the affairs of a man titled a bankrupt to see in what way we could help and we know the fearful physical and mental strain on the families of such people.  One must have the experience of dealing with these people at very close quarters before one can adequately speak on their plight.  We cannot be coldhearted or stern, but must have sympathetic understanding.  In all legislation dealing with matters of this kind, we must safeguard the rights of the creditors who gave their goods or money in good faith and the debtors who accepted the goods or money in good faith but who through no fault of their own are unable to meet their obligations.</P>
    <P>I hope that we will have an opportunity for much serious debate on every section of this important Bill on behalf of those put in this terrible plight in recent years. Some speakers made reference to a relevant EEC directive, but, as yet, I have never seen an EEC directive for the benefit of the underdog whether farmer, small shopkeeper or businessman.  EEC directives uphold the interests of high-powered European financial institutions which seldom consider the plight of those commonly described as bankrupts.  If they are to have no voice in this Parliament, where will they find someone to speak for them?</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity of discussing this Bill and hope that it will lead to sympathetic and understanding legislation based, not on foreign opinions but framed to meet the serious difficulties of the bankrupt.  Such modern legislation must not embody the cold hand of the law, with public notices from <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i><Col N="1340" /> to the local newspapers announcing to all and sundry that Mr. X has failed to meet his obligations and bringing him into public ridicule as a bankrupt.  Our people in debt deserve better legislation which will protect and assist them in their need.</P>
    <P>I hope that this legislation will be drafted on a county basis, but I doubt that because it is extremely difficult for central organisations such as State Departments to deal with problems at local level.  There has been a call for regionalisation, but the regions are too big.  It is similar to the setting up of committees to deal with the problems of this House.  This House is too small for the committee system, which works well in the United States of America.  The British House of Commons, with 600 members, has no such system and it will not work in Ireland.  Let the problems of those in debt be discussed on a local level, in public or private as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I hope that we will have legislation for the protection of employees, whose demands must first be met.  If a solicitor gets into debt, the Incorporated Law Society ensures the payment of all debts in the event of misappropriation of funds. Why is there not a State fund for the other numerous bankrupts?  There is no reason why this should not be.  All we need is the political will.  No company should be allowed to hide behind the protection of the courts at the expense of the unfortunate workers.  I have known workers to be bled to their last penny piece, with hard-hearted company directors putting an iron bar across the gate and closing the company, leaving the unfortunate workers outside.  There is no legislation to deal with such problems.</P>
    <P>I speak from long experience of many bankruptcies in my constituency.  The one thing everyone, whether farmer, small shopkeeper or businessman, wants to avoid is the title of bankrupt.  We need modern legislation for the present situation, providing full legal support for people on the verge of bankruptcy who may eventually find their names in the columns of <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> I hope that this House will be the better and richer for this debate, at a time when so many are being declared bankrupt.  The outlook is <Col N="1341" /> not too rosy and the number of declared bankrupts will not diminish in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Let us endeavour to assist those people, their families and employees to overcome whatever difficulties are encountered.  But it must be remembered that their creditworthiness is finished, they will have lost public confidence and that of their neighbours and friends.  The moment they are declared bankrupt there will be no confidence shown in their future in so far as credit is concerned. Therefore, rather than catering for people who find themselves in that position let us endeavour to keep them out of it, helping them to live full lives in the community side by side with those more fortunate, those who have been more successful in the business, commercial and industrial lives of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great reluctance that I contribute to this debate because, not being in either the accountancy or legal professions, it is difficult to deal with a Bill which the Minister has described already as highly complex and technical and which most certainly will go to a Special Committee of the House.</P>
      <P>My opinion is that the bankruptcy procedure performs three main functions. First, it seeks to maintain fairness between creditors competing for the limited assets available, secondly, protects the bankrupt from undue pressure from different creditors and, thirdly, discharges the bankrupt from his liabilities, enabling him to start afresh.  In endeavouring to carry out those functions there must be framed within the system regulations which will protect both the commercial failure and the fraudulent tradesman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker dealt on a wide scale with the problems of bankruptcy.  I should like to avail of the opportunity to deal with a number of its aspects.  The first is the role of the Collector General, that of the Revenue Commissioners and also with the fraudulent businessman who jeopardises other business people. The problems encountered in relation to the office of the Collector General have been well documented in recent weeks <Col N="1342" /> by myself and others.  The inefficient system followed by the Collector General &mdash; even though he has the resources and manpower available to him to carry out that work &mdash; means that he is at present not only jeopardising other businesses but is placing an unfair extra burden on taxpayers who, having paid tax once, find that that has not been collected and must pay again.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the activities of certain fraudulent businessmen over a number of years cannot be investigated thoroughly.  A number of years ago there were allegations made about illegal moneylending which became the subject of a major investigation.  We can see now businesses blatantly put into liquidation, happening month after month, without any investigation of the inherent problems.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the provisions of the Bill in regard to the preferential creditor. For example, the system obtaining under which a preferential creditor can force a company into liquidation to ensure that the moneys outstanding to him are collected is nothing short of a scandal.  Here again the Revenue Commissioners are inefficient themselves initially in collecting moneys due.  Then when massive amounts of debts accumulate on the part of a specific firm, the Revenue Commissioners move in, at times so fast that they jeopardise the firm, forcing it into liquidation.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the recommendations of the Cork Report.  I suggest that the recommendations of the Cork Report whereby a secured creditor would get less than 100 per cent of his dues and an unsecured creditor get at least a minimum percentage should be examined.  The recommendations of that report warrant more investigation than they have received.  The implementation of such a recommendation would alleviate hardship on unsecured creditors and safeguard the future of many companies. There have been a number of instances recently in my constituency of companies forced into liquidation, indeed where unsecured creditors themselves went bankrupt also.  If the recommendations of the Cork Report were <Col N="1343" /> implemented even partly through the provisions of this Bill at least it would prevent a lot of unsecured creditors going into liquidation.</P>
    <P>Section 81 (1) (a) deals with the state of the preferential creditor but does not cater at all for the unsecured creditor. Under the provisions of subsection (1) (b) the preferential creditor will now receive up to £2,500 when his employer goes bankrupt.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify whether this amount is gross or net.  If net I would suggest it is inadequate especially in these times when the average industrial wage is in the region of £120 to £130.  I suggest that the minimum amount there should be raised substantially.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) (f) deals with pensions, a very important subsection the provisions of which I welcome.  Even though I have reservations about preferential creditors this subsection classifies the recipients of pensions and persons in the company who are drawing pensions and contributing to pension schemes as preferential creditors.  However, being short on legal knowledge I should like the Minister's assurance that all contingencies have been taken into account in this subsection. Here again experience has shown sadly that it is pensioners under company pension schemes who are most vulnerable.  Hopefully this subsection will take care of that problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to know also what procedures will be adopted in cases where company employees find themselves without salaries and wages.  Will the Bill contain a procedure where salaries and wages can be paid out when a receiver is appointed?  Like the previous speaker, I should like to deal with fradulent trading. The present interpretation is too loose and should be tightened up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Des mond applied for and received permis sion to raise on the Adjournment the <Col N="1344" /> subject matter of the closure of the Carrigaline factory in County Cork which has gone into liquidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. E. Desmond Mrs. E. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my gratitude to the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. It is one of particular importance to me. Unemployment is a very serious matter wherever it occurs.  When it occurs in one's own neighbourhood and affects one's neighbours and personal friends we realise more fully the tragedy of unemployment and the impact it makes on the lives of the unemployed and their families.</P>
      <P>The Carrigaline pottery was founded in 1928 and since then a tradition has been built up and skills developed. Whole families were involved &mdash; fathers, mothers, sons and daughters.  In the case of many friends of mine the total income into the household came from the Carrigaline pottery.  That company was wound up in 1980 and taken over shortly afterwards by a German owner and became known as Cork Art Pottery Limited.  That was the focal point of this expanding town.  There was great jubilation when the industry was saved and hopes were high.  However, these high hopes were not justified from an early stage.  Relations between the owner and staff were never good.  There was little consultation with workers.  They were never taken into the confidence of the owner or manager of the firm.  This practice is all too common. The involvement of the workers and the amount of information given to them was all too little.</P>
      <P>The workers were proud of their skill and of their factory.  They were only too willing to make whatever sacrifices were required of them from time to time to keep the industry going.  As difficulties arose they agreed to forego part of the national wage agreement to help the industry.  They worked diligently.  The position deteriorated and as it did rumour was rife.  From day to day they did not know where they stood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the liquidation last week the firm owed £1 million to the Inland Revenue, £235,000 to the banks and about £200,000 to other creditors.  The <Col N="1345" /> stock on hand at the factory amounted to £200,000.  The workers were owed three days' wages.  A few workers were issued with cheques which subsequently bounced.  Workers were owed holiday pay which averaged about nine days per worker for the 210 workers in the factory. They got no pay in lieu of notice and there is no money available to pay them redundancy.  This will be borne by the State.</P>
    <P>Liquidation in this case was brought about when the Revenue Commissioners got a court order for a sum of £841,000 due to them in respect of PRSI and other charges which were deducted from the workers' wages but not paid to the Revenue Commissioners.  Action by the sheriff to recover this money was imminent. For two and a half years no PRSI was returned in respect of these workers.  I am not in a position to say what steps the Revenue Commissioners took during those years to recover the money but I and the employees in the industry are amazed that this time elapsed before any action was taken.  The action taken unfortunately resulted in the closure of the factory but the workers were concerned that deductions were made from their wage packets and not returned to the Revenue Commissioners.  Such action places a burden on the State to meet the commitments of employers in respect of these payments.  Employers such as this one often used the recession and the deductions made from their workers' wages for their own advantage.</P>
    <P>When the factory closed approximately £100,000 worth of orders were incomplete.  Orders were plentiful.  The liquidation provided for the completion and delivery of these orders within a period of three weeks.  Tomorrow morning in the High Court an application will be made for money to finish and deliver these orders.  Workers in Carrigaline use the factory as a meeting place where they wait for news of their future.  This has been termed as a sit-in but they do not obstruct the work of the factory.  Nobody would be more pleased than the workers if somebody took over the factory.  They cannot easily give up their jobs.  They are trained in this skill and it is the only one <Col N="1346" /> they know.  They will do everything possible to ensure that the factory remains open.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the fact that lack of consultation was at the root of the trouble in this factory.  The workers were suspicious and their suspicions grew as the fortunes of industry declined.  One cause of suspicion which should have been investigated and which I ask the Minister to investigate now was that quite recently a shipment valued at £27,500 of unfinished products was exported from the factory to one of the owners of the other factories in Germany.  It was at a discount of 85 per cent netting Carrigaline £4,000.  I do not know much about pottery but those who do estimate that about 85 per cent of the work was done in Carrigaline.  I cannot prove that, but it is something which could be proved.  The Minister knows company law better than I do and if it is proved that 80 per cent of the work was done in Carrigaline and the company received only £4,000 there must have been fraudulent practice.  Certainly this matter should be investigated and I ask the Minister to see that this is done.</P>
    <P>There seems to have been little or no monitoring of State aid given to Carrigaline and there was no way of finding out what was happening.  State aid was given to this industralist who bought the factory for £800,000 two and a half years ago.  He was able to get the industry off the ground and employ about two-thirds of the work force.  There were about 300 people employed there before the change-over and there were 210 at the time of closure.  No accounts were kept within the industry and this obviously made those who depended on it for a livelihood very suspicious.  There has been a great deal of suspicion surrounding this whole industry.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that efforts are being made by the IDA, the workers' representatives and all concerned to save this enterprise which is the focal point in my native town.  I urge the Minister to give every possible assistance because this is what the workers deserve.  I would favour some type of co-operative effort because the necessary skills and equipment are there but I understand the difficulties that <Col N="1347" /> would be involved.  The main thing is to ensure that the industry is saved for the town of Carrigaline.  I feel confident that the Minister will give the matter every consideration and put his weight behind every effort to save those jobs.</P>
    <P>The workers in this industry, all of whom I know personally, have a total commitment to it.  They have made sacrifices in the past and they have not been treated very fairly in recent times.  Their skills are undoubted and they must be given every help.  One must look ahead in a matter like this and in case the worst happens and I am very glad that the State will safeguard their benefits, though the employer has not been paying contributions in respect of each person.  There are probably people in the same category as this employer who are taking advantage of the recession not to submit to the Revenue Commissioners the deductions they make from employees' wages.  The main concern is that there should be no undue hardship.  I do not look forward to the time when it will be necessary to draw those benefits because I believe it should not happen.  All the advice I can get &mdash; perhaps it is prejudiced or one-sided; perhaps it is the advice I am looking for &mdash; leads me to believe that with proper management and proper commitment this industry is viable and can be made to work.</P>
    <P>I know there are limits to what the Minister can do but nevertheless he has some responsibility and influence.  I know his influence will be used to save the 210 jobs in Carrigaline for which I am appealing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Eileen Desmond's concern in this matter.  I know how much the closure of Cork Art Pottery must mean to her as a person not only representing the area but living there.  It is a very great blow to Carrigaline, felt very deeply by the Deputy who has raised the matter.  She and I feel this all the more by virtue of the fact that it is the second time in two-and-a-half years that the manufacture of pottery at Carrigaline <Col N="1348" /> and the employment of the workers has been in serious jeopardy.</P>
      <P>Everybody had hoped that the package worked out in 1980 would work successfully for a time at least and this appeared to be the case.  However, the early prospect of satisfactory trading never actually materialised and was blighted by difficulties in the market place caused by the contraction in sales due to the recession and the pressure in the German market of low-cost imports from elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Some months ago when the IDA became aware for the first time of the reality of the company's financial situation, they initiated efforts to have the company's affairs put on a sound footing, either through existing management or by securing a take-over.  As regards a financial reconstruction under existing ownership, substantial loan facilities were sought by the company from Fóir Teoranta.  I understand that Fóir Teoranta were not prepared to provide money for the company in its existing circumstances.  The Deputy and the House will be aware first of all that Fóir Teoranta are not under my Ministry but under the Minister for Finance and also that in judging loan applications they must abide by strict statutory criteria.</P>
      <P>As to the IDA, they did seek in parallel to bring about a take-over of the company by other interests &mdash; in this case American &mdash; but they appear for the moment at least to have withdrawn.  The IDA are continuing in other directions to try to interest suitable purchasers in acquiring the assets of the company on a going concern basis with a view to resumption of production and employment. In the meantime I understand that it is the intention of the liquidator to meet all outstanding orders and a certain number of workers will be re-employed for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the amount which the company owed to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of PAYE, PRSI and VAT.  In their tax collection function the Revenue Commissioners have to use their own judgment as to how far and when to press companies for payment.  Obviously there has to be a question of balance between maximising <Col N="1349" /> returns and not putting the company and its employees in jeopardy.  Nevertheless the extent of the indebtedness which built up here in a relatively short time must be a cause of concern to us all and I will bring to the attention of the Minister for Finance the comments made by the Deputy.  From my experience here, more as an Opposition Deputy than as a Government Minister, the Revenue Commissioners try to assist a company, within the limits of the discretion available to them, to continue trading and they do not act hastily, prudently realising that they could be cutting their nose to spite their face because if the company were to close there would be no revenue coming in.  They are bound by statute and by the rather rigorous interpretation of statute placed by the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is a factor that the Revenue Commissioners take into account.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the shipment to other factories within the same group. As far as I know &mdash; speaking without recourse to the law books &mdash; there is nothing illegal in what the Deputy is mentioning but I can see that it is a cause for some concern particularly as we are relying to a great extent on multi-nationals with components in other parts of Europe.  We should give some attention to this.  If it was to become a pattern it could cause serious problems for our industrial strategy.  I am glad the Deputy has raised this matter and I will have it investigated.  The Deputy made a general reference to the lack of monitoring, as she saw it, by the IDA of the operation. I am sure the Deputy will have seen from what I said earlier that the IDA took action some months ago when it came to <Col N="1350" /> their notice that problems were reemerging in pottery manufacturing in Carrigaline.  I concede that there are problems here as far as the organisational structure of the IDA is concerned in regard to keeping in touch with particular industries on a regular basis.  Some proposals are being considered for the reorganisation of the IDA which will enable them to keep in close touch on a day-to-day basis with particular sectors or firms rather than having different officials dealing with the same firm for different purposes. The idea might be to have one official dealing all the time for all purposes with a firm or group of firms.  That matter is under consideration and it would go some distance to meet the type of situation referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I have noted what the Deputy has said about the efforts to restart the industry and I am sure she is aware that I will do all I can, in conjunction with the IDA, to assist any efforts to start the industry again on a financially viable basis.  We will check the position in regard to holiday pay and the other entitlements mentioned by the Deputy.  I will communicate with the Deputy about the matter and if I have to get information from the Minister for Labour or Social Welfare for this purpose I will obtain it and convey it to the Deputy.  I appreciate how serious a problem this is, particularly for Deputy Desmond.  I can assure the Deputy, and the people directly concerned in Carrigaline, that as far as we can we will do everything possible to get the industry started again.</P>

      <P>The Clondalkin area is served by two post offices, one at Main Street and the other at Neilstown.  It is proposed to establish an office at Bawnogue provided a suitable applicant is forthcoming when the position of Postmaster-Postmistress is readvertised shortly.  Most of the post office business in the area is transacted at the Main Street Office where the accommodation is adequate for normal requirements. Some queueing occurs inside the office on Fridays and children's allowance payment days but this happens at most busy post offices on those days.  A queue forms outside the office on Saturday mornings when large numbers attend together to cash unemployment pay orders.  It would not be practicable for the postmaster to provide additional staffing and accommodation for a short peak of this kind. Other ways of relieving this congestion by, for example extending the payment of unemployment orders to Neilstown Post Office and, perhaps, by staggering the days of payment, are, therefore, being considered.</P>

      <P>The appointment of nursing staff is a matter for the chief executive officer in the case of health board hospitals and for the hospital authority in the case of voluntary hospitals.  Permanent appointments to posts of staff nurse are normally made following advertisement and open competition.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice of health boards to employ nurses in a long term temporary capacity.  However, to accommodate a small number of nurses who had been employed in a long-term continuous temporary capacity, special competitions were organised in each health board area under agreements reached with the nurses' unions to enable permanent appointments to be obtained by nurses who satisfied the service criteria specified in the agreements.  These competitions have now been completed.  In the case of the special competitions for general trained nurses some appointments remain to be completed.</P>

The claim was then treated as a claim to disability benefit.

      <P>The person concerned claimed retirement pension when he attained age 65 years on 6 September 1982.  He failed to qualify as he did not satisfy the condition which required him to have contributions paid in respect of not less than 156 weeks of insurable employment since he first entered into insurance.  He has since supplied a statement from his employer which shows that he was insurably employed for a total of 59 weeks from 1936 to 1952; under the regulations this is regarded as being <Col N="1225" /> equivalent to a total of 89 such weeks. From 1953 to 1982 he was insurably employed for 42 weeks, thus bringing the overall total up to the equivalent of 131 weeks in respect of which contributions were paid.  Therefore, while his combined number of paid and credited contributions would give him a yearly average which would otherwise entitle him to retirement pension at the maximum rate, he cannot be awarded the pension because of his failure to satisfy the 156 paid contributions requirement.</P>
      <P>Contributory old age pension is payable from age 66, which the person concerned will reach on 6 September 1983, and it is a condition for receipt of this pension also that the claimant must have had not less than 156 weeks of insurable employment since entry into insurance.</P>
      <P>As explained in the previous paragraph, the person concerned does not satisfy this minimum requirement.  He is currently in receipt of unemployment assistance and he is advised to apply for a non-contributory old age pension about three months before he reaches pension age.</P>

The claimant did not return the appeal form, neither did he submit any further medical evidence of incapacity for work.</P>

      <P>The District Veterinary Offices of my Department will be paying particular attention to helping owners of restricted herds who may be facing problems during the calving season.  Everything possible will be done, for example, by ensuring that retests are carried out promptly to clear disease from these herds quickly.

      <P>Information on the numbers of full-time and part-time farmers in 1981 and 1982 is not available from official sources.  The farm management survey of An Foras Talúntais estimates the number of full-time farms in 1981 as having been 119,870 out of a total of 247,598 holdings over five acres.  The number of part-time farms in 1981 on this basis was, therefore, 127,728.  The results of the farm management survey for 1982 are not expected to be available until July 1983.  Details of definition and methodology are given in the farm management survey report, 1981, a copy of which may be consulted in the Library.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> An examination of the organisation of the Garda Síochána in Cork city and surrounding areas is nearing completion and it is expected that recommendations arising from it will shortly be submitted to me for decision. At present the Garda Division of Cork east covers the entire Cork city area and also the adjoining districts of Mallow, Blarney, Fermoy, Midleton and Cobh.  It is thought that any reorganisation may involve the creation of a division to cater exclusively for the city area and the establishment of a new division to take charge <Col N="1246" /> of a new grouping of districts in the Cork county area.

The Deputy will appreciate that all members of the Garda Síochána are regarded as being involved either directly or indirectly in the fight against crime and the allocation of manpower to particular duties at any one time depends on the availability of resources, local circumstances and the demands on Garda services.</P>

      <P>The matter has been resolved so far as my Department is concerned.  The amount of income tax deducted from the salary of the person in question in December 1982 included arrears of tax which arose as a result of the readjustment of her tax-free allowance by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>My Department is obliged to deduct tax on the basis of the most recent statement of tax-free allowances issued and any consequent arrears of tax have to be deducted accordingly.</P>
