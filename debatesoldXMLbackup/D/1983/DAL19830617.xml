      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 16, Votes Nos. 1 and 2, 6 to 17, inclusive and 28 to 33, inclusive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will accept that I am not casting any aspersions whatever on his competence to conduct the Order of Business here this morning, but is there any possibility that he might give us an explanation of where the Taoiseach is, the Deputy Leader of his party and the Tánaiste?  If we are going to have sittings on Fridays, to which we enthusiastically agreed on this side of the House, would it be too much to expect that the Government would give a reasonable performance on Fridays here?  Particularly, may I ask the Minister if he would give us some indication about the Taoiseach's programme in regard to the Summit Meeting and what the arrangements are?  Will there be any statements made and will the House be given some information about it, because it is a very important matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy answered the first part of his question in the second part by the reference to the meeting in Stuttgart.  Obviously, that explains the absence of the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Taoiseach on his return from this meeting will be in a position to discuss, through the Whips, any request that the Opposition might make for a statement by him on the outcome of the meeting.  It would be premature at this point for me to indicate any such arrangements until the Taoiseach has returned and until, as the Deputy will himself appreciate, a proper request has been made through the Whips for such time.</P>

      <P>The Chair will intervene here briefly.  It has been public property for some time that this meeting was coming on and, as the subject matter was not raised yesterday or the day before, I do not think it is in order on the Order of Business today, when the Taoiseach is not here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is completely in order. I submit that it is something which the House is entitled to hear from the Government.  I suggest that we do not have to take our information from the media on a matter of this importance. Could the Minister tell me when the Summit Meeting is taking place and when the Taoiseach is leaving to go to that Summit Meeting?  My information, garnered, as the Ceann Comhairle seems to suggest that I should take all my information, from the public media is that there is no reason why the Taoiseach could not be here this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am accepting the Chair's ruling.  If the Chair had allowed me to say more than two words he would have heard that.  This is what happened to Deputy Connolly yesterday. The Chair would not let him make his case.  However, that is yesterday's business and it is past.  As far as today is concerned I accept the Chair's ruling that because of that situation you cannot make a ruling that it is open to the Minister, <Col N="2077" /> if he so wishes and desires, to refer the matter.  I should like to ask on the Order of Business if the Government will provide time for a three hour debate on what is a very important question for the House because of the serious disquiet being raised outside the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £159,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Secretary to the President, and for certain other expenses of the President's Establishment.</P>
      <P>The total provision for the Vote as a whole represents an increase of £31,000 or 24 per cent on the 1982 out-turn.  On subhead A &mdash; salaries and wages &mdash; there is an increase of £10,000 over the 1982 provisional outturn.  This is attributable to the cost in 1983 of increases under clause 2 of the Public Service Pay Agreement and the implementation of the third phase of this pay agreement with effect from 1 January last.  On subhead B there is an increase.  The provision for this year is £27,000 compared to an actual outturn of £5,500 in 1982.  The additional provision has been made to cover the estimated cost of two state visits by the President during the course of this year.  In relation to post office services there is a small decrease on the subhead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £9,537,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the House of the Oireachtas, including certain grants-in-aid, and for certain expenses in connection with the European Assembly.</P>
      <P>The main changes in this Estimate arise on subheads B.1 and B.2, D.1, F.1, G, I, K and M.  There is a decrease on subhead F.3 in relation to office machinery and other supplies.</P>
      <P>I will mention briefly the subheads where there is an increase and indicate the reasons.  On subhead B.1 &mdash; payment in relation to secretarial assistance for comhaltaí who are not office holders &mdash; there is an increase of £332,300 over the 1982 provision.  On subhead D.1 &mdash; Payment in Respect of Secretarial Assistance for Seanadoirí who are not Office Holders &mdash; there is an increase of £17,800 compared with 1982.  The increase on these two subheads arise from the fact that it was decided in May last year to increase the number of secretarial assistants for TD's and Senators.  However, the full number of extra secretarial assistants was not recruited during last year and that explains the increase in the Vote for this year we have a full complement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On subhead B.2 &mdash; Travelling Expenses of Comhaltaí.  There is an increase of £104,390 compared with 1982. This provision covers travelling and subsistence allowances for Members of the Houses and also travelling allowances for Members of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  The outturn for 1982 was reduced because of our having had two general elections during the year.  Consequently, for two periods during the year Members were not in a position to claim travelling expenses. <Col N="2082" /> That situation will not arise this year and therefore there will be an increase in the provision.</P>
    <P>On subhead E. &mdash; Salaries, Wages, and Allowances of officers and staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; there is an increase of £299,100.  This arises from provision for the cost in 1983 of the third phase of the 1982 public service pay agreement with effect from 1 October 1982 and also provision to cover the cost of new posts in respect of committees of the House.</P>
    <P>On subhead F.1 &mdash; Post Office Services &mdash; there is an increase of £652,100.  This is to cover the cost of increased charges by the Post Office and the cost of extra facilities particularly direct telephone lines supplied to Deputies of all parties.</P>
    <P>On subhead G. which is in respect of the inter-parliamentary activities grant-in-aid, there is an increase of £16,500. Again, this reflects the fact that during 1982 activities under this heading were reduced because of the two general elections.</P>
    <P>Subhead I. relates to certain allowances to or in respect of former Members of the Houses.  We have provided for an increase of £3,750 under that heading to cover the cost of increased rates of pension arising from the terms of the 1982 public service pay agreement.</P>
    <P>On subhead K. there is a new provision of £11,000 for a pension scheme for secretarial assistants.  This new scheme has been brought in consequent to our increasing the number of secretarial assistants for Members of the Houses.</P>
    <P>There is a provision of £70,000 under subhead M. in respect of consultancy services for the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  A similar provision was made in the 1982 Estimate. However, as the Joint Committee convened for only a short period in 1982, there was no expenditure but we expect that we will need that provision during the course of this year.</P>

      <P>On Vote 2, the Minister has indicated that part of the Vote goes properly to the staff of this House in respect of the implementation of the third phase of the wage agreement.  That is in line with the situation of everybody else both in the public sector and in the private sector.  However, at a time when apparently there are views that the Government and other Members of this House are doing the opposite from what they are asking others to do, it should be pointed out that Members of this House are not getting the benefit of the third phase of the wage agreement, that they are not getting the benefit of the second phase of that agreement and that last year the payment of the first phase to them was postponed.  I do not suppose that we should ever claim virtue here but &mdash; and I am tempted to exclude myself in this sense &mdash; if there is any sense in which we are exceptional in terms of wages and salaries, it is that we are the only group in the country who have not got the benefit of any phase of the wage agreement.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that by way of defending the House but at a time when the manner in which we conduct ourselves here is said to be a matter of some concern and also when comment has been made in this instance by people who obviously did not have the full facts available to them &mdash; one person got a lot of publicity out of this &mdash; and when it was stated that we always ask others to make sacrifices while we ensure that we get every last penny, it should be made known, not so much in the interest of Members of the House but in the interest of what this House represents, that we are exceptional in being the only element within the public service not to benefit from the wage agreement.  Whether we are deserving even of what we are getting is another question.  I believe that we must deserve what we get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will all come and go as far as this place is concerned.  I have been here longer than most and I have seen some dramatic changes but we hope that what the House stands for will remain.  There <Col N="2084" /> is a special obligation on us to ensure that we avail of whatever facilities and rights are available to us whether by way of travel allowances or otherwise but in the interest of the role of the representative I reject very strongly the notion that a junior civil servant is better thought of in terms of status so far as travelling allowances and facilities are concerned than is a senior parliamentary representative. There is something wrong with our order of priorities and I urge that that situation be adjusted as quickly as possible.  It is difficult for a Member of the House to say that but there is something wrong with such a situation.  If there are cases of abuses in this House, we are bound by way of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or otherwise to ensure that we will be the masters of our own decisions and that we will be answerable for them. We must ensure that at least we will be given the same level of authority and status as is given to the most junior civil servant to whom some of us are expected to be accountable.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the points of view which Deputy O'Kennedy put forward. They are insufficiently known to the public but Deputy O'Kennedy has, perhaps, failed to grasp the reason why the public show such exasperation with people in public life generally.  It is not simply because they are paid money for what the public wrongly perceive as very little but because they can see at different points of the parliamentary and governmental structure reckless and self-indulgent waste of money in certain small ways which do not confer any benefit on the vast majority of Deputies or Senators.</P>
      <P>The question of State cars is not relevant to this debate and I will not dwell on it.  Although I object to the system and have always found it wrong, to some extent it cannot be done without except by impairing the functions of Ministers who are trying to burn the candle at both ends in meeting the demands which are legitimately made upon them in their own constituencies and throughout the country. The system has developed elephantiasis and become swollen.  There are a whole lot of vested interests now knitted into it and I do not mean the vested interests of parliamentary representatives and Ministers.  There are vested interests at other levels which are knitted into that transport system which I believe contribute to the difficulty of dismantling it.  It has become top heavy, unnecessarily extravagant and self-indulgent but there is a necessity for a transport system for office holders and no one with any sense would deny that.  The irritant represented by the sight of unnecessary, self-indulgent and improper use of State vehicles causes resentment quite out of proportion to the immediate cause and it tends to spill over into everything else, including salaries and allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be said that some Deputies do not really need any Dáil salary and would be glad to offer public service at that level if they were paid nothing at all and even if they had to carry their own expenses. There are a few very affluent Deputies whose personal dedication or, perhaps, ambition is such that the satisfaction of that dedication or ambition is worth more <Col N="2086" /> to them than the salary.  There are other Deputies of whom that cannot be said who could not afford to offer public service or to give rein to their ambition, depending on whether one is cynical about one's colleagues or not, if they were not paid for it.  It would be invidious and unworkable if Deputies were sorted out according to their characters and personal means.  The best that can be done is to pay neither an extravagant nor a mean salary but a reasonable salary to them all.</P>
    <P>Although I have a few angry constituents who write to me on these matters and will not believe me, no man ever made money out of being a Member of this House.  I have been far worse off and my overdraft has been at higher levels during the two periods when I have held office.  I hope that does not seem like a complacent effort at collective self defence.  Deputies who do not do their job properly, who are complacent about a waste of public money generally and do not mind having a bit of it wasted on themselves, cause a miasma of suspicion and resentment to rest over all of us.  That is a great pity.  The answer lies not in trying to argue with the public, because the public must pay for this whole exercise, but in trying to enforce among one's own colleagues in all parties a responsible attitude towards the waste of State money.</P>
    <P>We have been extravagant in the servicing of office and of office holders and of Members of this House junior to Members of the Government.  When I was first elected to this House and made Parliamentary Secretary in 1973 the total second row of the Government consisted of seven parliamentary secretaries.  That situation had not changed when Liam Cosgrave left office in 1977.  The establishment now consists of 15 Ministers of State.  The title has been up-graded and the explanation given at the time by Mr. Lynch&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's theme but we are under a time constraint.  We have only until 12 o'clock to discuss Finance and this really is not part of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave that point.  The joint committees which the Minister referred to as likely to absorb some public money will undoubtedly absorb a lot of public money and the Minister is probably under-estimating for them.  Although I respect and admire the passion of Deputy Bruton, Minister for Industry and Energy, to reform the way public business is done, I think his impetuous nature will be sobered by experience when he finds that it is very hard to get Deputies and Senators to attend committees, at any rate in the volume which he envisages.</P>
      <P>I can recall from my time as Government Whip that even meetings of such important committees as the Public Accounts Committee necessitated the clerk of the committee having to rush around the House as a kind of informal Whip urging Deputies to attend.  Occasionally he asked me for help and I told him that I had only one job which was to keep an eye on the Dáil and that I could not be responsible for whipping Deputies into the committee room as well.  It should not happen that the Public Accounts Committee, toothless and very nearly barkless dog that it be, should be handicapped by a reluctance or inability of Deputies to attend punctually and take an interest.  I fear that this rash of committees will suffer from that difficulty multiplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might have been more sensible, if I may say so with all respect and friendship for Deputy Bruton, if he had started with one and not with the whole raft now proposed.  The same applies in regard to the alternative committees proposed by Fianna Fáil.  I am afraid that if they are all set up there will be a very large jump in the bill for providing services of one kind or another and at the far end we will not get a great deal because Deputies, who are by no means idle and are not hung over the bar in Leinster House in <Col N="2088" /> the way that malignant popular imagination pictures them, are busy at their constituents' affairs.  It may not be what Plato or Montesquieu envisaged the role of the legislator to be, writing millions of bits of papers to councils and Departments. That itself is a money-consuming exercise.  It is difficult to get Deputies to attend committees, particularly when there is no Press Gallery.  The press are not kept out but they also suffer from budgetary constraints although they make little of them when it is the Government who suffer from them.  They simply cannot service these committees either. They cannot send observers to Oireachtas committees, particularly if they are sitting simultaneously.  Under this head we are going to get a large increase in expenditure and I am not too optimistic that we will get a good result, not for any defect in the idea but because of the human difficulties I have been talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal has been written on this and I suppose that paper will not refuse ink in this area.  I have had occasion at a number of times in the past to meet deputations of people who want some lead from what they call &ldquo;the top&rdquo;. When I explained to them that we have not had a salary increase since 1981 they expressed amazement because they were not aware of it.  When you ask, say, a group of teachers if they would like to follow suit and so help to sort out the problem in the Estimate for Education they say &ldquo;Certainly not.  We should get our increases like everybody else&rdquo;.  We have given this lead but nobody has followed. No journalist who has written articles about how well we live it up in here would work under the conditions and on the salaries of TDs.  A great deal of the nonsense which was written was hypocrisy to make the paper barons more wealthy, and it does not do the journalists any good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind coming under scrutiny for anything I say or do in this public office but in this area I ask that when people are writing about it they might take time to check out the facts.  First of all, out of the allowance we are given we <Col N="2089" /> must pay for travel within our constituencies and a number of expenses in our constituencies.  Under the rules of Schedule D, pages one and two, any business or enterprise operating under similar circumstances could charge all the expenses wholly or necessarily incurred in the execution of that enterprise.  A Dáil Deputy is no different from anyone else. He must pay all the other expenses and meet all the other commitments that anybody else has to meet before coming down to the figure that is his income.  We are supposed to have given a lead on this, but whom have we led?  Nobody.  Nobody has followed, nobody is interested in following. If we could explain to people what the situation is they would see it in a somewhat different light.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with salaries whether Deputies attend here or not.  In my constituency, for instance, all Deputies may not have attended here since the general election and those who do not attend are paid the same as those who are working here seven days a week.  That is crazy.  We should be thinking of a two-tier system whereby a person who is a full-time politician would be considered for a more full-time salary than a part-time politician who is very wealthy and has an income from other sources.  Such a Deputy might not need a salary from this House and most of it would be clawed back in taxes anyway.</P>
    <P>Taking expenses into account, the salary paid to Deputies is only a fraction of that paid to even a moderate ranking trade union official, not to mention a trade union leader or civil servant.  No self-respecting trade union middle ranking official would accept the salary and conditions given to TDs.  It is time to be able to stand up and say this.  I do not want to seem to be looking for something for ourselves and telling other people to be moderate, but we have been giving this lead for over two years now and nobody has been following and all we hear is that we are living it up.  That is not the case.  It is time that we told people, particularly trade union leaders, that if they want to get the country straight they should take the same cuts in salaries as TDs have had to take.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2090" /> The method of increases for TDs is nonsense.  If a TD is worth an income as set by the Devlin Report we should accept that it was set at a certain level at a certain time and we should have gone on to tie it to a grade in the public service so that if public servants at that level got an increase the TDs should get one also, instead of having to lay an order before the House, wait 21 days, take the increase after 21 days and then wait for some months before it is calculated and given to the TDs.  The press points out then that we got three increases, whereas we got only one increase but it is highlighted three times.  We should get our increases when everybody else gets an increase and if nobody else gets an increase we should not get an increase.  There should be no difference, no privileges for us, no exceptional route to take to get our increases.</P>
    <P>This House is changing and has changed.  There was a time when people came in here after a long day in the Law Library and worked in here in the evening. They were referred to as &ldquo;the night shift&rdquo;.  That pertains no longer.  People now are full-time politicians who come from various backgrounds.  What is not good for democracy is that it is becoming increasingly difficult for anybody from a working class or lower middle class background to come in here and function as a Deputy and compete with other people. It is said that if you pay peanuts you will get monkeys.  My contention is that if you pay peanuts you get monkey business. We are leaving it open to TDs to fall into the temptation of supplementing their income from other sources, and that is very dangerous for democracy.  TDs become dependent on sponsorship and on other people.  I do not want to see that sort of monkey business coming into politics but that will happen if TDs are not thought of in the same light as everybody else with no exceptions.  I am prepared to accept any reasoned balance or fair change.  I do not seek to be treated differently from anybody else.  The sooner we get this thing on a proper footing the better it will be for everyone.  This nonsense of having to justify the very low salary for what is &mdash; in my case anyhow &mdash; a seven-day week would not be tolerated <Col N="2091" /> by the most junior of civil servants or trade union officials.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £16,034,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Finance, including the Paymaster-General's Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total Estimate for 1983 is, as I said, £16,084,000, which represents a decrease of £27,000 on the provisional outturn for 1982.  The main features of the Vote are as follows.  On salaries and wages and allowances there is an increase of £280,000 on subhead A.1 compared to 1982.  This Estimate takes account of the carry-over of the second phase of the 1982 agreement on pay in the public service and the cost of the third phase from the beginning of January.  It takes account equally of savings realised from the non-filling of certain posts under the terms of the Government decision of 21 July 1981.  On Post Office services there is an increase of £1,079,000.  This is accounted for by an increase of £1,104,000 in the expenses of management of savings certificates, savings stamps, investment bonds etc. and partly offset by a decrease in postal services. The decrease in postal services is £28,000 and is due mainly to the large amount of arrears paid in 1982.  On subhead D &mdash; management of Government stocks &mdash; there is an increase of £374,000 over the provisional outturn for 1982 due mainly to the increased volume of foreign loans and management expenses on prize bonds.  On subhead J the 1983 provision is £2 million compared to a provisional outturn of £3,830,000 in 1982.  At the end of 1982 this subhead provided for payment <Col N="2092" /> of the Special Border Areas Programme fund.  At the end of 1982, £5.6 million had been disbursed from this fund leaving a balance of £2.4 million in the fund which has been carried forward and is available for disbursement in 1983.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>A debate on the Estimate for the Department of Finance enables the House to analyse the role of that Department and the Minister for Finance of the day.  It enables us to consider to what extent that Department and Minister are effectively becoming the motor Department of the various Departments of Government.  It is appropriate in the short time available to us that we should concentrate on this aspect of the Department and the Minister, on the policy position of the Department as recently expressed.  Yesterday in the House we passed a Vote for £110 million for the Department of Labour.  That represented an increase of approximately 125 per cent over the Vote for the previous year which then was in the region of £45 million.  The role of the Department of Finance, whichever Government is in power, is to scrutinise every penny of expenditure.  A growth in public expenditure such as we passed yesterday, an increase of 125 per cent, raises serious issues not just in relation to how the Government are discharging their duties but as to how any one of us are going to discharge our duties.  The Department of Finance, and the Minister, have a special responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to consider how we are to lift the country through these difficult periods then the Minister for Finance in his annual review of Estimates has a special role and responsibility.  If we compare that sum for the Department of Labour, £110 million, with the amount that has been allocated for Fisheries, £20 million, or for Forestry, £20 million, it is not quite clear that our priorities are, frankly, on their head.  If we think that the answer to the problems we face is to spend more building up administrative empires, experience programmes, training programmes or interview programmes, we are wrong.  One thing that is sure is that if any administrative agency <Col N="2093" /> gets a budget it will be expert at spending it.  Such agencies will take full page advertisements in daily newspapers or prime time on television to tell us all about hot lines, cool lines, fast lines and so on.  They will spend money where the private sector may not be able to compete in the same way.  It is past the time that we should decide the terms of our policy positions and even the direction in which we are going.  How are we going to encourage investment here to bring us through this recession?  Will the direction come from the Department of Finance and the Minister?  Are we going to rely on a proliferation of State agencies in every direction?  It is amazing reading today's newspaper reports of yesterday's debate to think that we can spend money of that order without testing what the outcome will be.  Is the public service, and the growth of it, to be the answer to our problems; or are we at last going to recognise that the only way we will solve our problems is to give our people the incentive, initiative and opportunity to solve the problems for themselves rather than enabling it to be done through national development corporations or agencies expanding at the rate of knots?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the problem is that the application of funds from the EEC Social Fund is growing each year because we match that fund 50 per cent. When that fund grows to £80 million we must match that figure.  Next year we are told we will be getting more, up to £150 million or perhaps more, and we must match that with more taxpayers' money. Are we seriously saying that, apart from matching it and building up administrative empires and using public time and money on television programmes, full page advertisements and so on, we are looking to the end result?  How many permanent jobs will we be creating?  Will six months work experience lead to permanent work?  The same criterion should apply to the cost of training an apprentice under AnCO.  Are we satisfied that the taxpayer is getting the best value for <Col N="2094" /> money through the application of those training schemes?</P>
      <P>The suggestion is that these training schemes funded through the administrative growth areas are more expensive than the conventional training schemes would have been if they were associated with existing industry or through the regional technical colleges.  As the keeper of the public purse the Minister for Finance has a responsibility there.  Surely it is important that training is not given just in terms of a training programme at some training centre because work, apart from developing skills, also means developing relationships with the people one is going to work with.  I am, like most people, old fashioned in that direction and I believe that the best training one can get is training with the man on the job whether serving an apprenticeship to a tradesman or training with a professional person.  The best training one can get is not just at an experience or training centre divorced from the work place but an involvement in human relationships on the job.</P>
      <P>We will not come through the recession &mdash; I believe we can do it &mdash; unless we decide now that the priorities will be to create a climate for encouraging investment on the part of our people, encouraging incentive and lifting the burden of taxation from our people who will invest and take the opportunity to develop their incentive.  We cannot lift that burden of taxation as long as we watch growth in public expenditure of the order we have seen over the last couple of years.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  The Minister will note that I have accepted that it has been going on for quite a while. I do not think I have made a political point so far because I feel too strongly about this to make a party political point about it.  We are watching the Estimates grow annually.  The current Estimate grew from £3,218,000,000 in 1981 to £4,891,000,000 this year.  That being so it is not surprising that tax revenue has to grow with that.  It grew from £3,135,000,000 in 1981 to this year's figure <Col N="2095" /> of £4,730,000,000.  The latter figure is the tax Estimate for this year.  Within that the income tax element has increased by 8 per cent.  The projected income tax yield this year will be about 29 per cent of total taxation, a jump of 8 per cent over the last two years.  We cannot create a climate for investment activity and initiative unless we re-adjust our priorities and ensure that we are not going to concentrate simply on taxation.  My first political point is that the Minister, and his Department, have been unduly concerned with that element at this time.</P>
      <P>I opened by saying that we should create a climate for investment and incentive. The evidence this year is the very opposite.  Instead of encouraging investment and incentive we find this year, even in regard to the incentive to invest in small publicly-owned Irish companies, which has been promoted since 1932 by tax credits and which might somehow bring the dividends and shareholders receipts into line with what you get elsewhere from safe investment, that the Minister in the Finance Act has abolished that credit.  This ensures that anybody who might have a notion of investing further in supporting business ventures here can forget about it.  They are now being discouraged to do this because of some taxation norm that says this should be adjusted because there is some small inequality there.  That is one example of investment, incentive and initiative being undermined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Things like the advance corporation tax are certainly not an inducement to incentive and investment.  We all know that there are too few people in the private sector who are prepared to take a risk, to get involved and start a project. The headaches and cost are too much and the tax burden is crippling.  The Minister need not take my word for that.  He can take the word of a seminar in Dublin yesterday on capital formation for business where it emerged all too clearly that the biggest problem in the country at the moment is that too few projects are being promoted in the private sector.  There are too few people willing to take the risk because the climate we have created here <Col N="2096" /> is one of division and dissension.  It is a climate, particularly, where there are some who think this can be solved by growth in the public service empire.  I take the opposite view.  We will only solve it through encouraging the people to get out and do it for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear the Deputy saying that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always taken that view and I feel more strongly about it now than ever before.  We really need a spirit of enterprise, incentive and initiative. As long as the growth we have seen in public Departments continues our people will not lift with us.  The role of Government is not so much what we do for the people but what we enable them and encourage them to do for themselves. Yesterday the director general of the CII, among other comments on the investment climate here, said that the tax rates are so crippling that top executives are leaving their jobs and leaving the country.  I know that sometimes we look at the other person.  Can we really afford to lose the best we have because of adding an extra 5 per cent to the tax burden as the Minister did this year?  We tried to dissuade the Minister from raising the level of income tax from 60 per cent to 65 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can we really afford to make success a penalty?  Can we really afford to make success, with whatever may come from it, to be something which will arouse the absolute interest of one section &mdash; the Revenue Commissioners?  The more successful you are, the more the Revenue Commissioners come after you.  The only way a person can be safe from the Revenue Commissioners is not to start, avoid the headache.  I do not suppose we want to do that.  We want to ensure, if those executives are leaving their jobs and the country now, that we will encourage them back and we will look at our tax bands.  The Minister will have enough time to look at that area before the next budget and see the level of income tax is growing to 30 per cent of total taxation. He will be able to say that he will not <Col N="2097" /> allow it to kill the most essential thing for the country: incentive and initiative.</P>
    <P>The recent report of the NESC told us that 30 per cent of jobs in manufacturing industry in 1973 were lost by 1980.  It is also telling us that job losses will continue over quite a number of years in the order of 9,000 to 10,000 per annum.  That is the climate in which we find ourselves.  Those job losses were mostly in the area of food, clothing, footwear and textiles.  Is it not sad to think that in an area where we could be the food supplier of the world that job losses are occurring?</P>
    <P>The private sector really needs support particularly in its marketing strategy.  We apparently manufacture and process food on the basis of what we think the consumers in Britain, Paris, Germany, South Africa and elsewhere should consume. Our marketing strategy in respect of the best primary product in the world, agriculture, is deplorable.  The private sector need support there.  Our small industries need support there and if they get that support it will not be only to their advantage but to the advantage of our whole economy.  Instead of developing marketing, research and development in those areas we are throwing it into Government agencies.  We can give SFADCo and the IDA all of the advance factories they like at this stage and we can give their executives, advisers, consultants and everybody else who comes up with a report all the financial provisions they like at this stage.  But unless we create the climate in which the people on whom we rely &mdash; the risk takers, promoters and initiators &mdash; occupy one of those factory bays we will find we are building them just for the sake of building them.  We are providing money through the public sector, State and semi-State, and at the same time we are not creating the incentive for the private sector to get up and rescue the country from the problems in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>We must get our balance right in our Estimates.  We must ensure that we will not find a growth in public expenditure only and a diminution of the private sector. The level of investment in the country at present as a proportion of total public expenditure has dropped over the <Col N="2098" /> last few years from 30 per cent to approximately 23 per cent now.  Public expenditure is growing enormously and the private sector does not obviously find it can invest because the penalties for investment and activity are too high.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be party political in this connection.  Above all else what we must do is ensure that the investment level, the gross fixed capital formation, as a percentage of our public expenditure, grows rather than diminishes.  The only way we can ensure that is to create the climate about which I have been talking in which tax burdens will not be unduly high and incentives will be promoted rather than discouraged.</P>
    <P>There will be no easy way through this recession.  Discipline and facing reality must form an essential part of that process. The first reality we should face is to tell the people that good Government is not necessarily a Government who spend.  If there are some members of that Government &mdash; and self-evidently there are &mdash; who believe that the role of Government is to spend more, then we take issue with them and I place the strongest possible emphasis on that.  The role of Government is to ensure that every penny they receive is effectively spent and that they collect not one penny more than they require.  Above all else they should watch the growth of tax within this economy.  Certainly this year the tax growth within our economy is of considerable concern particularly in relation to income tax, the reductions in credits for corporation tax, investment for shareholders and matters of that kind. All of those things should be geared to creating incentive, initiative, not to penalise them, but to reward them as forming an essential element of our economic development.</P>
    <P>We have immense resources in this country.  Instead of a Government telling us that things are bad and will get worse let us look at our resources and ascertain how they can be developed.  I might give just a few examples.  Take that of fisheries. Is it not a bit of a laugh that in these Estimates which the Department of Finance scrutinise we provide five-and-a-half times as much for the Department <Col N="2099" /> of Labour as we do to develop what is regarded in other countries as an asset of immense wealth, approximately £20 million? But that demonstrates our sense of priority here.  Is it not a bit of a laugh that we spend about half as much on the Department of the Public Service?  And their job is to tell other Departments, including the Ministers, how they should do their business.  I belong to the old-fashioned school that thinks that there is one thing that can be said for the Department of Finance and the Minister, that is that they obey the bottom line, that one must prove oneself and that everybody else and every other Department should be obliged to do so.  But we provide nearly half as much money for the Department of the Public Service as we do for the development of our fisheries industry.  There is something terribly wrong there.  We have about half as much to spare for that Department as we have for the development of our forests.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should keep all this to myself and say wait until we get back over there and we will do it ourselves.  That scheme of priorities demonstrates that we have not as yet recognised the immense potential of our natural resources.  It must be remembered that forestry constitutes a huge element in our development programme. Its potential wealth is enormous. Indeed, fisheries is not just a matter for Howth, Killybegs, Dingle or wherever else.  Potentially a young man from the midlands could, as could a young man from Denmark, gain meaningful, profitable employment in the fishing industry, if properly developed.  In regard to agriculture surely nobody would suggest &mdash; and I am referring now to reductions the Minister proposes this year &mdash; that Irish agriculture is too modern.</P>
    <P>One thing you will always find is that, if you cut back on the capital programme &mdash; I might tell the Minister this, it is his first year in that Department &mdash; nobody will scream immediately.  Do you know why?  It is because nobody is hurt immediately. It is the current programme that causes the screams, with people having to pay immediately a little more for this <Col N="2100" /> or that.  One might hear some objection to a cut-back on the capital programme by people who may have a somewhat longer view of the economy and its development. One can cut back the capital programme for roads, housing, sewerage, the services and one will not find anybody having to pay a penny more immediately that year.  But the whole basis of the employment infrastructural programme will have been undermined. The Minister must readjust his priorities even in public expenditure.  Let the Minister look back over the last few years when he will ascertain that the capital programme this year is just about the same as it was three years ago.  That is an interesting statistic.  Meanwhile the current budget has grown from something of the order of £3.218 billion to £4.891 billion, a growth of well over 50 per cent while the capital programme &mdash; which forms a very small proportion of the budget as a whole, as can be seen from the tables &mdash; has remained about line ball.  If the capital programme does not merit the same development as the current programme I do not know where we are going.</P>
    <P>The building industry, and we heard from them yesterday, can speak for themselves. Surely instead of cutting back on the whole infrastructural base we should be looking at other areas where cuts could be effected.  If we are to look at the semi-State bodies in terms of the capital programme &mdash; and I go along with that &mdash; let us apply the norm that would be applied to any other area, their profitability being the test of their success.  Perhaps because the Minister was rushed, I do not know why&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will remember what I said about public expenditure in the course of the debate on the Finance Bill.  I have said this so often, even in speeches I made as long ago as six or 12 months.  Therefore he does not have to remind me about being on the record because I will be on the <Col N="2101" /> record on this very often.  They are the priorities I am talking about.  The priorities expressed in this year's budget by the Minister and in the Finance Bill are so wrong.  I am saying that and I have been saying it consistently.  We are cutting back on the capital programme, on our housing development programmes, our roads, infrastructure and we can see the consequences.  We are adding more for unemployment benefit.  We are providing more money for administrative growth and not sufficient to develop our real resources.</P>
      <P>We have cutback on the farm modernisation scheme.  Who could say as of now that Irish agriculture is too modern?  I know we could look at the productivity element; of course we could.  The farmers will not scream about that this year, or next year but the economy will feel the pinch in two years' time if we have not developed agriculture in the way we should, with all the jobs dependent on it. We will discover then that this short-term decision to reduce or suspend the farm modernisation grants was taken at a very real cost to our economy as a whole.  We must take account of one reality, which is that employment is central in this country, as it is in others, but is crucial here because of our demographic structure, with such a huge proportion of our population in the under 25 age group, over 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>If we are to get economic policies promoted by the Department of Finance they must be policies to which people around the country can relate immediately. They must be able to say, I know where that is going, I am going to take part in it.  We saw this at three different earlier stages in our development &mdash; here it may be contended that I am being selective &mdash; but it was the case in the thirties when we decided we were going to protect our infant industry and we went for protectionism.  That succeeded. The next big step forward came in the late fifties with the Programmes for Economic Expansion, into the sixties.  They succeeded because people felt there was something happening and wanted to become involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now at the third stage and a <Col N="2102" /> renewal is required.  The problem will not be solved by remote central concepts of planning from the Department of Finance or by economic professors, analysts or sociologists coming out with reports.  It will be solved if we can relate those central planning concepts to the people in the country who can identify with them in a cohesive national way. This Minister would want to be very careful if he is to achieve that.  However, I note that belatedly there is coming from him and his leader an awareness that perhaps there is a common base between farming, worker and the employer interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will only take two minutes to finish my contribution.  I say to the Minister that I hope in the Estimates there will be an awareness of the real potential of the country, which is to develop our own resources, to support every industry related to those resources <Col N="2103" /> and particularly in the marketing area where we are weak.  That can be done through the private sector being relaunched.  The Minister must not fall into the trap of thinking that with the extra money from Europe we can solve problems by adding millions of pounds to all Departments.  I refer in particular to the growth of the semi-State sector.  Companies in that sector must be tested by the same criteria as anyone else.  The tax burden has grown as a consequence of the growth of public expenditure and the Minister is forced to take actions, as in the Finance Bill, which are doing more to kill incentive at a time when we need to promote that must important element.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that policies that are appropriate to other countries, that may or may not succeed elsewhere such as those being pursued across the water, have to be tempered in their application here because of the different demographic structure.  It may be that a 40 per cent endorsement such as that recently received by the British Prime Minister is a national endorsement, but I am not sure.  I am not sure if there was a response from Liverpool, Birmingham and other areas of unemployment.  In our society we need cohesion.  We cannot afford to allow social upheaval or disorder of a kind that will arise if we do not provide real employment opportunities for our young people.  Frankly, we will not do that by going through notional exercises by the Department of the Public Service. We will do it by increasing the allocation for education in the right areas rather than by cutting back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That should be a priority for the Minister for Education.  At the moment we are cutting back in areas that will enable young people to provide for themselves even though we give them training programmes afterwards.  We will succeed if we give incentives to young farmers, by encouraging investment and by ensuring that we get a base for capital investment of a kind that is absent at the moment. We can promote a new layer of small industries that will take us through this period.  However, the Minister must look seriously at the direction in which his <Col N="2104" /> proposals are going.  They are doing the opposite to what we need to achieve.  I have more confidence in the Irish people than the Minister seems to have had up to the moment.  The day he shows confidence in them he will have my support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased at the general tone of the Deputy's speech even though it comes as a great surprise to me. If I were a few years younger and less worried about the plight of the country than I am I would have made a political meal out of his recantation of views formerly held by his party and by him.  However, I will not make a political meal out of it.  I welcome his evident conversion and I will not gloat over it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy was quite right to emphasise the vital character of retrenchment in State spending.  He is quite right to warn about the tendency which the State apparently incurably has and the momentum and the dynamic which the Public Service appears to have developed to expand new agencies in all directions and to keep on the personnel in the old agencies. I have never heard that said so clearly before from the opposite benches and I was glad to hear it now.</P>
      <P>The degree and the speed at which the State has been expanding both in the civil service strictly and in the subordinate agencies is quite appalling and out of place for a country like this.  If this were a country run on de luxe lines, if we were in a position of thinking of ways to spend money, no doubt it would be possible to flatter the expectations of people by creating agencies that we did not need but which were created merely for the purpose of putting people into secure wellpaid jobs at public expense.  However, we are not in that situation and all the warnings about the necessity to cut back on the State's elephantiasis are all too timely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that my friend, Deputy Bermingham, sitting in the benches in front of me will not resent me saying the following or begrudge me the freedom which I have had to buy politically for <Col N="2105" /> myself to speak like this.  One of the features in the composition of this Government which led me to be only provisionally optimistic about them when they started and which has left me in the same position today is that I do not think the point of view articulated by Deputy O'Kennedy and which I share 100 per cent is shared by the Labour Party.  I say this in no spirit of unfriendliness, but they have never had the experience of having to provide government on their own or provide even the major part of government.</P>
    <P>I hope I will live to see the day &mdash; I mean this sincerely and not in any way sarcastically &mdash; that there will be a Labour Government here, that Deputy Bermingham and Deputy Ryan will be Ministers in that Government and all the other office holders and their successors. I am not in the least apprehensive about that day when it comes because in order to form a Government in a democracy they will have to get the votes of half of the people.  In order to get that percentage of votes in a country like this they will have to change their tune very considerably from the tune now being sung by many of their Members.  I am sure they would be a valuable corrective to a Government who might have become fat, complacent or perhaps corrupt.  A corrective of that kind would have been no harm in the mid-1960s but, unhappily, that was the very time when the Labour Party decided they did not want Government at any price and when they turned their face against Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I know the Government have an item on their programme the genesis of which is to be found in the Labour Party programme for 1977, namely, the National Development Corporation.  To counter the national development consortium Fianna Fáil in the election of that year proposed an industrial development consortium. When they won the election they proceeded to set up that consortium. Very wisely, however, Deputy Lynch as Taoiseach, confined that consortium to Deputy O'Malley who took damn good care to make sure that not a halfpenny of public money was ever spent on such a <Col N="2106" /> hare-brained enterprise.  Although I dined long and richly on the industrial development consortium in the period 1977 to 1981, let me say now, since I have grown more sober and worried about the country than I was a few years ago, that I think Deputy O'Malley was quite right to keep that consortium as a kind of spook &mdash; I used to call it the spook of Schoolhouse Lane.  It had not palpable existence that could be seen &mdash; it had no office, no address, no telephone, no staff, no budget, no functions.  It did not even have a desk.  It did not figure anywhere in the Estimates.  It was only a reason why, for a few months, a certain number of civil servants had to abandon the work they were paid to do and go through the motions of trekking over to Kildare Street to meet other civil servants who had done the same thing that morning. Even that pretence was dropped after a short while and rightly.  The reason I say rightly is because it was an excuse for pretending by means of setting up an organisation and funding it &mdash; although in this case Deputy O'Malley took damn good care to make sure it never was funded &mdash; that something was being done by way of flattering ideologists who never did what I might call a wealth producing day's work in their lives and would not know how to go about it if they were required to do it.</P>

If there is such a function I want answers to two questions.  First, why have the private sector fought shy of it?  Second, if there are good reasons, is it not a function of a kind for which an existing agency already caters?  In other words, if it is something to do with the sea, do we not have An Bord Iascaigh Mhara?  If it is to do with bogs, do we not have Bord na <Col N="2107" /> Móna?  If it is to do with taking alcohol out of potatoes, do we not have Ceiminí Teoranta?  There is an endless zareba of semi-State bodies.  They are so numerous that some to them have not been looked at for years to see what they are up to or how they justify their place in the Estimates.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  When Deputy O'Kennedy was talking about the Department of the Public Service I felt like interrupting him, but I had not the heart to interrupt his speech with which I agreed so heartily, to say he can be damn grateful there is not another Department put on top of that to watch what it is doing, but no doubt the time will come when some election manifesto will propose such a thing.</P>
      <P>We have to turn back this tendency, and I do not care what I break up politically in saying that.  I have had lots of differences with Fianna Fáil, and I probably always will because the ethos of their party has corroded them just as the ethos of my party may have corroded me.  We are in such a dangerous situation that the country cannot afford the luxury of silly ass, Punch and Judy show polemics between the two big parties represented here who &mdash; whatever their differences 60 years ago or even more recently, or the differences which are exacerbated by personal aversions in these days, and from which I am not immune &mdash; whatever these differences may be, they do share common opinions on the kind of thing we are discussing here this morning.  If the country makes wrong decisions on these topics everything else will be irrelevant. We will go under unless we get this area right.  If it means putting aside differences for ten years between people in this House who think alike and not try to make cheap headlines or steal votes from one another with silly strokes, let it be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public do not care about the individual destinies of Fine Gael or Fianna <Col N="2108" /> Fáil.  The politician is a kind of megalomaniac; there is a touch of abnormality in anyone who goes in for this livelihood, but some are more abnormal than others. The kind of anxiety we have seen here to do one another down is something which does not correspond to any anxiety which the public experience.  Our megalomania is flattered at Ard-Fheis time when we see 4,000, 5,000 or even 7,000 people crowded into a hall cheering as though they were in Nuremburg.  They are not the public.  They are a very highly selected section of the public.  The public outside are incovenienced by the traffic, they cannot understand the noise, they dislike the sight of thousands of grinning faces applauding somebody they think is a silly ass or a rogue and they are put off by that kind of political enthusiasm.  They do not get value for the kind of performance which the two big parties have been putting on for years.</P>
    <P>Having said some hard things about the Labour Party, let me try to redeem myself to Deputy Bermingham by saying that the Labour Party have done far better than the rest of us in this regard.  They have behaved with far more dignity and far more restraint than the other parties. I think their economics are all wrong but their political manners are far better than those displayed by Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael down through the years.</P>
    <P>That is all based on the theme Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned in regard to old-fashioned prudence in State housekeeping and what is called the need for cohesion. I want to tell him he has a long way to go before he can sell these themes to the media who pontificate about us every day of the week.  Only yesterday I saw my own party getting a severe wigging from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> over what they called our kindergarten penny-pinching. It is easy for a person in a white collar job, writing an editorial, to criticise the penny-pinching of others but it is because somebody somewhere in the public service, even if not at political level, did pinch a few pennies that there is any wealth in the country at all, even enough to support a daily provincial newspaper. I am sure Deputy O'Kennedy will not dissent from that, having sung an ode in <Col N="2109" /> favour of penny-pinching here this morning.</P>
    <P>He mentioned the need to give incentives to industry and the need not to make people feel ashamed of making a profit or being enterprising.  I agree with all these things but there is one point he missed.  The way we construct our educational system &mdash; I am not speaking so much about third level education but the lower levels &mdash; is all wrong.  It carries in it very honourable traditions of liberal education, making the whole man and whole woman, training people to allow their personalities to unfold and so on.  It goes without saying that I respect that tradition and I hope it will never disappear, but a point is reached when responses to that tradition cannot be afforded and when academic freedom &mdash; such a thing exists even in school &mdash; if pursued too far leads to damage to the State.  The way our educational system works is such that school leavers tend to think of jobs which are not wealth producing but are wealth consuming.  They may be necessary to society, I am not trying to belittle them, but they do not create wealth.  Students are not conditioned in their school days to think in terms of making two blades of grass where formerly only one grew.</P>
    <P>I read only yesterday that in the whole of the technological colleges' programmes only two girls are doing engineering. Every day of the week I get letters from constituents whose daughters are trying to get jobs as nurses, or in banks, or in the public service.  I am required to write letters of testimonial in support of them.  I am still waiting to hear from a parent who wants his or her daughter to get into a profession or an employment which will have some immediate and not merely second-hand connection with the creation and maintenance of prosperity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree thoroughly with the Deputy.  The only reason I did not develop that theme was that I thought it was more appropriate to the Vote for the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>I wish I had more time.  The Minister wants to move on to the next <Col N="2110" /> Estimate.  That goes in regard to industrial techniques and the failure to make children's minds lean towards these matters. It goes also in relation to training in modern foreign languages.  It is absolutely deplorable and quite out of place for a country which depends so heavily on selling its products abroad.  Our salesmen go abroad and they are absolutely tongue-tied as soon as they get onto the Continent.  They are able to sell goods in the English speaking world&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reply to some of the points made. I will begin by saying I have been encouraged enormously by listening to the debate we have just had, and particularly to hear that Deputy O'Kennedy now seems to be even further confirmed in the faith he acquired such a short time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting to listen to somebody who, after all, was Minister for Finance during a period in which we saw a very rapid increase in total public spending and in the total number of people employed in the public service, a period in which we saw the further development of a trend which regarded expenditure under the Public Capital Programme as being almost an end in itself.  If it could be described as investment, it was regarded uncritically as something which should be undertaken because it was good to be seen to be carrying out investment without necessarily looking very closely at what kind of return you would get from it.  We now see the results of that in terms of many of the State-sponsored bodies to which Deputy O'Kennedy referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is true that Deputy O'Kennedy and his party have come around to that way of thinking, we can have some confidence that there will be a greater degree of unanimity and force behind the view <Col N="2111" /> taken in this House.  We need to put across very clearly the message to the people that not only must we get value for money from current expenditure, but we must also get value for money from expenditure on the capital programme and must, therefore, take a much more critical look at the way in which we spend both current and capital funds from the public sector.</P>
    <P>The remarks made about taxation during this debate and the debate on the Finance Bill, and particularly the remarks made by Deputy O'Kennedy, were very interesting.  We had a period during which we saw the tax base eroded and narrowed down, completely unnecessarily at the time, and we have not seen the benefit from that narrowing of the tax base.  A situation was created then in which we had to bear more heavily on the areas which were taxed in order to produce the revenue to offset the kind of expenditure policies followed so uncritically for so many years.</P>
    <P>If we can take Deputy O'Kennedy's remarks here this morning as an indication that there has been this kind of sea change in the attitude of his party, I believe we will be able to make progress. I am not at all sure that Deputy O'Kennedy, so recently converted, has yet been able to convert a sufficient number of his colleagues.  Listening to the debates on the Estimates, and listening to the debates on the budget and the Finance Bill, I did not find the same care being taken in relation to the consideration of what value we are getting for public expenditure.  I did not find the same concern for a critical examination of what capital expenditure should achieve; nor did I find the same determination to ensure that we restrict the total volume of public expenditure as far as we can for the reasons Deputy O'Kennedy outlined this morning.  By the use of the kind of exaggerated rhetoric to which Deputy O'Kennedy referred a few minutes ago, we are in danger of making a number of things become self-fulfilling prophecies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions Deputy O'Kennedy was at pains to talk about a lack of confidence.  While nobody would pretend for a moment that we have anything like an ideal situation in terms of the climate for investment, the more Members of the House talk in the exaggerated way they are wont to do about a lack of confidence, the more they are giving people reason to believe, perhaps falsely, that whatever confidence they have should be forgotten.  We should use that with great care as part of a debating tactic, because it may turn some of the words used in a debate into self-fulfilling prophecies.</P>
      <P>Since we are talking about a climate for investment, I should like to make the point that whatever we do in terms of specific Estimates or spending programmes will have its own effect on activity. There are other factors which affect the level of business activity &mdash; the profitability of investment, the readiness of people to invest, and their ability to employ.  Those factors are not discussed in a debate like this &mdash; the result in terms of external confidence in our economy, for example &mdash; and therefore our ability to sustain the kind of selective Public Capital Programme we need and our ability to reduce our inflation rate, which we have been successfully doing is undermined.</P>
      <P>This will colour the day-to-day approach to profitability on the part of people who want to invest, and manufacture, and employ.  We have made very substantial progress, and there is more on the cards if we fashion the Government's intervention in the economy in such a way as to allow these things to happen, and to allow those other important factors which bear so heavily and so importantly on the readiness of people to invest, to take their proper course.  That is an essential part of the strategy we are now following.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of the argument <Col N="2113" /> Deputy O'Kennedy found in the Estimate for the Department of Labour an apparent reason for saying we do not seem to be doing a great deal to control the level of public expenditure.  Deputy O'Kennedy should have a look at the estimates volume produced by the then Government during the election campaign last year.  In it the net total provided for the Department of Labour was £108.6 million.</P>

      <P>On the point raised by Deputy McEllistrim, you reminded Deputy O'Kennedy at a certain time that we had 40 minutes left for the remainder of the Estimates.  I suggested we had ten minutes left.  That was at 11.50 a.m. and I reminded the House that we had ten Estimates to get through before Vote 9. Deputy O'Kennedy, as is his right, decided he would continue with the remarks he was making and I now propose to continue with the reply I am <Col N="2114" /> making to those remarks since Deputy O'Kennedy wishes to have a more detailed discussion.  I intend to get through this and the remainder of the Votes as quickly as possible so that there is time to discuss the matter raised by Deputy McEllistrim.</P>
      <P>In the volume produced last November there was a net Estimate of £108.6 million for the Department of Labour and in the revised Estimate there was a sum of £110.2 million for the Department of Labour.  There was an Estimate of £77 million in both volumes for the training and employment of young persons, including the Youth Employment Agency, an increase of £34 million over 1982.  Both volumes had the same provision in that respect for the same reasons and in both cases that accounted for by far the greater part of the increase in the total Estimate for the Department of Labour in 1983 as against 1982.  The point that Deputy O'Kennedy seemed to be making in suggesting that a large increase has come about in the Estimate for the Department of Labour does not hold water.</P>

I have no doubt whatever that the viewpoint from which these activities are being scrutinised is now a great deal more in tune than in the past with the objectives to which Deputy O'Kennedy now says he gives his agreement.</P>

      <P>The net amount allocated for the Vote for Public Works and Buildings for 1983 is £97,726,00, which represents an increase of approximately 10 per cent over the 1982 outturn.</P>
      <P>The cost of staffing and servicing the Office of Public Works is met from subheads A to C for which I am seeking an amount of £13,620,000.</P>
      <P>On subhead D a sum of £500,000 is the amount required to cover the purchase of sites and buildings for various Government services including the acquisition of the fee simple of some existing leasehold properties.</P>
      <P>An amount of £29,982,000 will be required under subhead E to cover the cost of carrying out new works, alterations and additions including furnishing and fitting out of new buildings for Government Departments and other State purposes.  This represents a major injection of capital into the building industry which is very badly needed at this time.  It will ensure the continuance of employment in the industry on a large and widespread scale.</P>
      <P>I have circulated among Deputies copies of the list showing the individual projects covered by this subhead and this gives a good idea of the varied nature and widespread location of these projects.</P>
      <P>A large proportion of the money is needed for the erection of new office buildings and the fitting-out of rented accommodation.  There is an ongoing need to replace unsuitable accommodation and good progress is being made towards that objective not only in Dublin but in provincial areas as well.</P>
      <P>Sums totalling over £3 million are required for accommodation for the Garda Síochána.  Over £2 million of this is for the erection of new Garda stations and major improvement schemes.  In addition to a number of smaller projects, we are now turning our attention to the replacement of divisional and district headquarters throughout the country. This year starts will be made on the provision of divisional headquarters at Galway and Monaghan and district headquarters at Mayfield and Gurranabraher in Cork and at Belmullet, Caherciveen and Nenagh.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, my understanding was that all the Estimates were to be finished by 12.30. That was the order made yesterday in the House.  There was an agreement, as I understood it, between the Opposition and the Government side &mdash; not a tight agreement, as was explained at the time that Vote 9: Office of Public Works, would be taken at about 12 o'clock.  It was taken at 12.28 and I am in the unfortunate position that I want this Estimate debated and I have given a copy of my intended full speech to the spokesman for the Opposition.  How can he deal with that, unless I make that speech?  We would be very restricted, even getting the half-hour.  The time has gone now, anyway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall put as quickly as possible the points which must be made.  I was speaking about Garda headquarters at Galway and Monaghan and district headquarters at Mayfield and Gurranabraher in Cork and at Belmullet, Caherciveen and Nenagh.  Building will also begin on new stations at Arklow and at Blackrock, Cork.  The Dublin Metropolitan area is not, of course, being neglected.  Work is progressing on the fitting out of premises at Harcourt Square which will serve as their new headquarters. The first phase of the development should be ready for occupation shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also an extensive programme of work on hands for the Department of Foreign Affairs, the major item of which is the provision of the facilities required at Dublin Castle and at Iveagh House in connection with Ireland's term of Presidency of the EEC in 1984.  The facilities and services provided during previous <Col N="2122" /> presidencies attracted many favourable comments and I am sure that the works proposed now will achieve equally good results.</P>
    <P>This subhead also covers works within the commissioners' own sphere of responsibility at national parks and on the Shannon Navigation.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week the commissioners' role in relation to national parks was highlighted by the Golden Jubilee celebrations for the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park in Killarney.  While it is right that the success of this park be emphasised one must not lose sight of the fact that this is only one of four national parks that the commissioners have in their care and are developing; the others are in the Burren, Connemara and Glenveagh, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>The importance of preserving areas of great natural beauty for the enjoyment and education of the public is acknowledged internationally and the commissioners by the developments they are undertaking in this field are ensuring that such areas are not lost to the people of Ireland.  In 1983 the commissioners will expend in excess of £3 million in maintaining the existing parks and will continue to extend and develop them according as resources allow.</P>
    <P>The commissioners are continuing with their ongoing programme for the development of the Shannon Navigation and in 1983 an amount of £100,000 will be spent on major new works at Drumsna, County Leitrim and Williamstown, County Clare.  In addition to this the commissioners will also spend £685,000 on maintaining existing facilities on the navigation, the cost of which will be met from subhead F.1.</P>
    <P>While the level of boating holidays taken on the Shannon in 1982 showed a decrease from the level of the previous year, it is hoped that the works the commissioners undertake in providing new and improved navigational facilities and maintaining the high standard of existing ones will induce more people, both from at home and abroad, to sample the delights of both the water and land based holidays that are available in the Shannon region.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2123" /> Indeed, due in part to their success in operating the Shannon Navigation it is proposed to expand the commissioners' role in relation to our inland waterways by transferring to them, from CIE, responsibility for the Grand and Royal Canals.  Officials from my office, in conjunction with officials from the Department of Transport and CIE, are drafting the necessary legislation which will give effect to this transfer and I assure the House that the Minister for Transport and I will be pressing for the earliest possible introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Subheads F.1 to F.4 cover the maintenance, furnishing, leasing, heating and lighting of Government offices and various other buildings used for State purposes.  The cost of this with the cost of maintenance of certain State-owned harbours, the River Shannon Navigation and the various national parks is met from subheads F.1, F.2, F.3 and F.4 for which I am seeking an amount of £48,474,000.</P>
    <P>In regard to subhead F.1 I am sure I do not have to stress to the House the importance of maintaining buildings and property generally.  Large amounts of public funds have been invested in these assets and it is absolutely essential that they should not be allowed to deteriorate. The commissioners are very conscious of their responsibility in this area and this is reflected in the amount of over £20 million which is needed for the maintenance subhead.</P>
    <P>I am seeking a provision of £2,915,000 for subhead F.2 to meet the cost of supplying and maintaining the furniture and furnishings required in State premises throughout the country and in Irish Embassies abroad.</P>
    <P>This is a significant increase on last year's expenditure which was kept at an artifically low level by postponing all but the most urgently needed supplies.  It is necessary this year to deal with the backlog. Stringent criteria will continue to be applied to the replacement of worn-out furniture.</P>

I want to give him that opportunity but he can hardly talk publicly about something which I did not mention.  That is why I am trying to get through all the points.  If the Opposition spokesman feels that I have said enough, I will give him the opportunity to reply right now.  I do not want to be unreasonable in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I congratulate the Minister of State on being appointed again to that office which is responsible for the Office of Public Works and I wish him well.  I want to deal with the subject of national parks.  I notice that this year only £35,000 is being spent on these parks, of which we have four beautiful ones in the country.  We have one in Glenveagh, County Donegal, one in Connemara, one in the Burren in County Clare and one in Killarney in my own county of Kerry.  What is the up-to-date position about the opening to the public of the castle in Glenveagh national park?  What about the access roads which are being made into that park and the development of the park in general?  This is important and I would like that information at some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Connemara national park, in the initial stages 4,000 acres were purchased.  In 1980, negotiations were going on to purchase more land.  Has that land been purchased and have the access roadways which were being made to that park been completed? <Col N="2125" /> In the Burren in County Clare in 1980 we were on the point of purchasing more land.  This is a unique national park in Europe.  Are they still negotiating about purchase of land in the Burren?  The Phoenix Park is not a national park but it is one of the biggest in Europe.  This park is in a deplorable condition.  There is a vacancy for a superintendent there and nobody has yet been appointed.  By way of parliamentary question recently I found out there has been a reduction in the number of staff employed.  The footpaths are in a dangerous and dirty condition. The park is more like a derelict site than a park.</P>
    <P>There is an allocation of £5,000 for the National Heritage Centre.  Last year £25,000 was spent on it.  Are the Government going ahead with the centre?  Very little money has been allocated for arterial drainage, £15,243,000.  The Boyne, the Corrib, the Robe, the Mask and the Bonet are being drained.  This is being 50 per cent EEC-funded.  This in fact means the Government need only spend £8 million on drainage since the drainage of most rivers is 50 per cent EEC-funded.</P>
    <P>In 1980 we were given a 50 per cent grant to carry out a survey on the Shannon. The Office of Public Works advertised for engineers to carry out the work. No money has been allocated to carry out that survey this year.  The Shannon is in need of dredging.  Nine counties are flooded by the Shannon.  There is good fertile land adjoining the Shannon and it is important that the river be dredged so that farmers whose land adjoins it can avail of the grants.  Dredging of the Dunkellin has not commenced.  The River Lee in Kerry, which flows into Tralee, is causing widespread flooding.  A survey was done on this river in 1980 and I ask the Minister of State to put this on the list for next year.  The River Blackwater in Cork is causing extensive flooding to land in the Fermoy and Mallow areas.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said great progress was made in providing accommodation for civil servants in Dublin and provincial areas.  I do not agree.  In 1980 in Tralee town OPW bought a site to rehouse civil servants, 200 in all, but the <Col N="2126" /> building has not yet been proceeded with. Civil servants in Tralee are in need of accommodation.  The water is coming in through the roof of the employment exchange in Tralee.  The decentralisation plan has been cancelled by the Government. I do not blame the Minister of State because that was a Cabinet decision.</P>

The Minister should ask to be allowed to be present when the Government are preparing budget estimates because he runs a very important Department.  It is important that he should make a case for his own Department.  It is no one's baby. The Minister of State should be present when the Estimates are being discussed at budget time.

      <P>The total gross provision for 1983 in the five Votes in the Education Group of Votes, excluding the Vote for the National Gallery, as provided in the revised Book of Estimates, is £889,478,220 including £18,434,220 as appropriations in aid.  The corresponding provisional outturn for 1982, including non-voted capital being provided as a voted service in 1983, was £829,205,630. There is, therefore, an increase of £60,272,590 or 7.3 per cent for the education services in 1983 over the provisional outturn for 1982.</P>
      <P>The capital provision for 1983 is £86,500,000.  The corresponding provisional outturn figure for 1982 was £92,357,680 including non-voted capital of £15,875,000.</P>
      <P>The gross non-capital provision for 1983 is £802,978,220.  The corresponding outturn figure for 1982 was £736,847,950. The provision for 1983 represents an increase of £66,130,270 or 9 per cent over the outturn for 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gross provision for pay and pensions for 1983 is £655,704,000 or 81.7 per cent of the total non-capital provision. The comparable outturn figures for 1982 were £596,003,800 and 80.9 per cent.  The provision for 1983 represents an increase of £59,700,200 or 10.02 per cent over the provisional outturn for 1982.  The <Col N="2128" /> increased provision for pay and pensions represents 99 per cent of the overall increase of £60,272,590.  The provision for non-pay non-capital expenditure in 1983 is £147,274,220 or 18.3 per cent of the total non-capital provision.  The comparable outturn figures for 1982 were £140,844,150 and 19.1 per cent.  The provision for 1983 represents an increase of £6,430,070 or 4.6 per cent over the 1982 outturn.</P>
    <P>The provision for educational services this year reflects the financial situation and the budgetary policy adopted to cope with it.  Pay and pensions comprise the single greatest cost heading and the greater part of the increased provision of £60,272,590 is to meet increased pay costs, including the cost of 300 additional national school teachers to be appointed in 1983.  A sum of £1.9 million has been provided for an increase from £82 to £92 per student in the rate of supplemental grant payable to secondary schools in lieu of tuition fees.  A sum of £1.1 million has been provided for an increase from £15 to £17 per pupil in the capitation grants payable towards operating costs of national schools.</P>
    <P>By any standards the financial commitment by the State to education continues to be high.  In the 1964-65 financial year the net audited expenditure in the education group of Votes plus non-voted capital for vocational school building amounted to 3.3 per cent of gross national product.  By 1970-71 the percentage had risen to 4.7 per cent.  In 1979 the figure reached 6.1 per cent.  The Estimate for 1983 represents 6.6 per cent of estimated GNP for 1983.  This is a very good percentage.  Indeed the percentage of GNP we spend on education is one of the highest in the EEC.  The net provision of £871,044,000 sought for education in 1983 is 15.54 per cent of the total net provision in all Votes.  The comparable figure for 1982 was 15.17 per cent.</P>
    <P>The amounts sought for 1983 include provision for the payment of the final phase of the 1982 agreement on pay from 1 January 1983.  They do not include provision for the payments being made in 1983 in recognition of the postponement of this increase from 1 October 1982 to 1 <Col N="2129" /> January 1983.  Neither is provision included for any general or special increases which may be approved in 1983. It will be noted that Vote 50 contains a provision of £60 million for increases in remuneration and pensions.  A sum of £8.03 million has been included in that provision for the estimated requirements of the education group of Votes.  This Estimate, in addition to the £889,478,220 provided in the five Votes for Education, makes a total of £897,508,220 for the education services in 1983.  In his Budget Statement on 9 February 1983, the Minister for Finance stated that if the outcome of consultations necessitated increased expenditure on pay, it would be necessary for the Government to take appropriate measures in order to fund the cost.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education is for:</P>
    <P>(a)  the administrative costs of the Department;</P>
    <P>(b)  the services in relation to art and culture in the National Museum and National Library;</P>
    <P>(c)  miscellaneous educational services.</P>
    <P>The net amount being sought this year for this Vote is £60,311,000, an increase of £4,802,800 or 9 per cent over the 1982 provisional outturn.</P>
    <P>The administrative costs of the Department in 1983 are estimated at £14,369,000 as against an outturn of £13,616,900 for 1982.  This is an increase of 5.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Late in 1982 the Government decided to allocate responsibility for youth affairs to the Minister of State at the Department of Labour.  Consequently the Youth Section of my Department, comprising 17 officers, was transferred to the Department of Labour.  The provision for administrative costs in the revised Book of Estimates reflects this transfer.  This transfer of responsibility also involved the transfer to the Vote for Labour of the provision for a number of services, namely:</P>
    <P>(a)  The provision for grants to youth <Col N="2130" /> organisations towards the employment of development officers has been transferred and the provision in subhead D.10 in Vote 28 is now for grants to sports organisations only.</P>
    <P>(b)  The capital provision for recreational facilities formerly in subhead D.11 has been transferred in full.</P>
    <P>(c)  The provision for a grant-in-aid fund in subhead G.3 is now for grants to sports organisations only as the provision for grants to youth organisations has been transferred to the Vote for Labour.</P>
    <P>(d)  The provision for youth employment formerly in subhead G.3 has been discontinued and the funds included in the grant-in-aid fund for youth activities in the Labour Vote.</P>
    <P>(e)  The provision for receipts from the European Social Fund in respect of the Department's Temporary Youth Employment Scheme formerly in subhead H.7 has also been transferred.</P>
    <P>In all, the transfer of responsibility involved the transfer of £3,718,000 gross or £3,418,000 net from the Vote for the office of the Minister for Education to the Vote for Labour.</P>
    <P>A sum of £8,586,500 is being provided for higher education grants, an increase of £3,096,500 or 56 per cent over the 1982 outturn.  This provision is required to make refunds to local authorities in respect of sums paid by them in grants in 1982.  This increase reflects the improvements in the scheme introduced in 1981 by my colleague, Deputy Boland, then Minister for Education.  The number of grant holders was 5,021 in 1980-81, 6,263 in 1981-82 and is estimated at 7,410 for 1982-83.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, students attending approved courses in Northern Ireland were dealt with on the same basis as students attending approved courses in the Republic.  The grants scheme is being amended for a pilot period of three years from the academic year 1983-84 so as to provide that:</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of grants awarded under the scheme for 1983, (i) the lecture <Col N="2131" /> fee payable will be the appropriate lecture fee payable in sterling and (ii) the maintenance element of awards will be deemed to be pounds sterling and will take into consideration the distance between the student's home and the educational institution he or she is attending.</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of existing award holders the position as from the academic year 1983-84 will be that the lecture fee payable will be the appropriate lecture fee payable in sterling and the maintenance element of awards will be deemed to be pounds sterling.</P>
    <P>The provision being made in subhead D.6 for grants to students at Thomond College of Education shows a similar increase from an outturn of £469,500 in 1982 to £685,000 for 1983.  The provision of £620,000 sought for scholarships, research grants and fellowships represents an increase of 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>Provision is again being made for a grant-in-aid fund for cultural, scientific and educational activities.  The organisations which receive grants from this fund include the Chester Beatty Library, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, An Cumann le Béaloideas Éireann, the Music Association of Ireland, Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Marsh's Library, Comhdháil Múinteoirí na Ríncí Gaelacha, the National Film Institute of Ireland, Dublin Institute of Adult Education, An Cumann Scoildrámaíoctha, Irish Committee of Historical Sciences, Royal Zoological Society of Ireland, People's College, Aontas and an Foras Éireann.</P>
    <P>The provision of £666,500 for international activities shows an increase of 26 per cent.  This provision is for a contribution to the UNESCO budget and incidental expenses of the UNESCO National Commission; costs relating to participation in the European Schools' Day Competition and in the International Apprentice Competitions; contribution to and scholarships at the College of Europe, Bruges; educational tours to the USA for teachers; expenses in connection with the organisation of <Col N="2132" /> any international conference of EEC, Council of Europe, OECD, and so on, which may be held in the country; scholarships and other expenses arising from participation in the European University Institute, Florence; EEC study visit schemes and exchanges under cultural agreements.  This year Ireland hosted the 13th Session of the Standing Conference of European Ministers of Education in Dublin from 10 to 12 May.</P>
    <P>A number of separate programmes are catered for in the provision of £238,500 for exchanges under cultural agreements.  Student exchange scholarships are awarded by the Irish Government on a reciprocal basis to other countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Switzerland.  Language assistants are exchanged with other countries &mdash; currently 49 with France, 12 with Germany and five with Spain.  These assistants are student teachers who are assigned to schools in the host country for an eight month period from October to May for the purpose of enriching the teaching of their mother tongue in the schools and introducing the pupils to the culture of the assistant's home country, and of providing the assistant with the opportunity of studying the language and culture of the host country.  In addition ten experienced teachers are exchanged with France each year for one school term.</P>
    <P>The provision for school transport continues to be the biggest single provision in this Vote.  The non-capital cost of the service in 1981 was £25 million.  This rose to £28.109 million in 1982.  When the 1983 estimates were being prepared the cost in 1983 was estimated at £33.6 million.  This represents an increase of 34 per cent over two years.  The provision of £28.2 million made in the Estimates for the Public Service and published in November 1982 was made on the basis that measures including the introduction of charges would be introduced to reduce the cost to the Department by £5.4 million.  Subsequently, the present Government decided to waive the charge in the case <Col N="2133" /> of pupils who attend their local centre and whose parents or legal guardians hold medical cards.  This concession will reduce by around £1 million the yield from these charges and the cost to the State will be £1 million higher.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Vote for Primary Education includes national school teachers' superannuation.  The net amount sought is £318,874,000, an increase of £25,333,200 or 9 per cent over the 1982 provisional outturn.</P>
    <P>Salaries, allowances and superannuation of national teachers account for 85 per cent of the total gross provision.  The increased provision for pay and pensions as a whole accounts for 99 per cent of the overall net increase.</P>
    <P>At present 20,475 national teachers are employed in 3,401 national schools.  The number of teachers continues to increase reflecting both increasing pupil numbers and improvements in pupil-teacher ratios.  The provision sought reflects the full year cost of a net additional 581 teachers appointed during 1982 and also includes a provision for a further 300 additional teachers to be appointed in 1983, to cater for growth in enrolment. Recoupment of costs incurred in the employment of substitutes during teachers' absences will cost an estimated £3.52 million in 1983.</P>
    <P>It had been decided, in framing the Estimates set out in the abridged volume published on 18 November 1982, to appoint remedial teachers to vacancies only where pupil numbers exceed 300. This decision is not now being implemented.</P>
    <P>The gross provision for superannuation of national teachers is £38,732,000. This provides for retirement and other gratuities and pensions of retired teachers and spouses of deceased teachers. The number of pensions payable increased by a net 62 during 1982.</P>
    <P>Ten point one million pounds is being provided for the payment of capitation grants towards the operating costs of national schools as compared with a provisional outturn of £8,863,500.  This has allowed the grant per pupil to be increased from £15 to £17 with effect <Col N="2134" /> from the beginning of the 1982-83 school year.</P>
    <P>A sum of £25.5 million is being provided for the building, equipping and furnishing of national schools.  Projects for which grants may be paid include the provision of new schools in new housing areas, additional classrooms in existing schools, essential facilities such as sanitation, heating, lighting and furniture in existing schools, new schools where necessary for mentally and physically handicapped children, upgrading of existing schools to meet modern requirements and replacement of prefabricated accommodation. Twenty-one new schools and 33 extensions were completed in 1982, providing 9,940 pupil places on the basis of the current pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>A sum of £6,649,000 is being sought for the non-capital costs of the colleges of education for primary teachers.  A further £871,000 is being provided for loans and grants to students of the colleges.</P>
    <P>The provision for child care assistants in schools for the handicapped is being continued and in fact is being increased by 33 per cent.  A bigger than average increase is also being provided for special educational projects for children in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The net amount being sought for post-primary education in 1983 is £394,359,000, an increase of £47,758,700 or 14 per cent over the provisional out-turn for 1982.  The 1983 provision, however, includes £15 million for vocational school building which has hitherto been provided as non-voted capital from the Local Loans Fund.  If this service is included in the 1982 outturn, the £394,359,000 sought for 1983 represents an increase of £31,883,700 or 8.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Pay and pensions account for the greater part of the increased provision, at £295,858,000 or £30,460,100 more than the 1982 outturn.  This is an increase of 11.5 per cent over 1982.</P>
    <P>A sum of £148,511,000 is being provided for incremental salary and allowances of secondary teachers.  Currently 12,064 secondary teachers are in receipt of incremental salary in 518 secondary schools catering for over 200,000 pupils. <Col N="2135" /> Since 1978-79 the number of teachers has increased by 833.</P>
    <P>A sum of £98,312,000 is being provided in subhead A.2 for grants to vocational education committees.  Hitherto, provision was included in this subhead for the running costs of the technical and specialist colleges administered by vocational education committees.  The provision for these colleges for 1983 has been included, with the provision for regional technical colleges, in subhead D.2.</P>
    <P>There are at present 243 second level vocational schools catering for approximately 72,000 full-time students.</P>
    <P>The sum of £31,290,000 is being provided for the running costs of comprehensive and community schools, £28,520,000 for pay and £3,400,000 for other expenses.  The number of comprehensive schools remains static at 15 while the number of community schools has increased from 30 in 1979-80 to 41 in 1982-83.  These 56 schools now cater for approximately 32,200 pupils.  The number of teachers has increased from 1,545 in 1979-80 to 2,009 in 1982-83.  One additional community school is scheduled to come into operation in 1983 and the total number of students is expected to increase by approximately 2,500 next September.</P>
    <P>There are 18 regional and other technical and specialist colleges under the aegis of vocational education committees, catering for approximately 18,500 whole-time student equivalents and having approximately 2,056 full-time teachers. The number of full-time third-level students in these colleges has increased considerably in recent years &mdash; from 7,610 in 1979 to an estimated 14,300 in 1983.</P>
    <P>A sum of £26,253,000 is being provided for grants to secondary school authorities of which £6,530,000 is for capitation grants which are payable to all recognised secondary schools at rates varying from £21 to £30 per recognised junior pupil and £24 to £38 per recognised senior pupil.  A further £18,347,000 is provided as supplemental grants in lieu of tuition fees to secondary schools within the free education scheme.  This sum represents <Col N="2136" /> an increase of £2,146,030 over the 1982 provisional outturn.  This allows the rate of grant to be increased from £82 per recognised pupil to £92 per recognised pupil from 1 January 1983.  The special arrangements for boarding schools, Protestant schools and pupils from islands and remote areas will continue.</P>
    <P>From the initiation of the free post-primary education scheme in 1966-67 there has been substantial State capital investment in the provision of post-primary schools.  This investment has increased from £3.82 million in 1967-68 to £7.81 million in 1973-74 to £43.2 million in 1982 and £43.3 million in 1983.</P>
    <P>The investment programme has three main objectives: (i) meeting the growth in enrolments arising through population growth as well as population shifts, (ii) replacing unsatisfactory and uneconomic accommodation and (iii)  replacing as speedily as possible the prefabricated accommodation provided in the late 1960's and early 1970s to meet the bulge in the demand for places.</P>
    <P>A total of 56 secondary schools are at present under construction and a further 115 are at various stages of planning, while 33 vocational schools are at present under construction and a further 77 are at various stages of planning.  Five community schools are under construction and 21 in course of planning.  The 1983 provision will provide about 13,800 places of which about 7,900 will be new places and 5,900 replacement places.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2.5 million is being provided in respect of regional and other technical and specialist colleges.  This is mainly for: (a)  payment of final accounts and completion of furnishing and equipping relating to the major expansion of seven regional colleges carried out between 1978 and 1981; (b) planning expenses and site acquisition costs in respect of new regional technical college premises in Tralee, where construction is scheduled to commence in late 1983 or early 1984; (c)  planning expenses and initial site development expenses relating to the provision of new premises for the College of Marketing and Design in Dublin; (d) work proceeding at the College of Music, Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2137" /> Planning is proceeding on other projects for example the School of Music, Cork, and Killybegs Hotel School.  A full evaluation is being undertaken of the operation of the existing regional technical colleges preparatory to deciding whether any further expansion may be warranted.  An evaluation of the needs of the Limerick Senior Technical School, in particular of the School of Art, is being finalised.  A rationalisation and expansion programme for the colleges of technology in Dublin has been approved and planning is proceeding.  Sites have been acquired for new regional technical colleges at Tallaght and Dún Laoghaire, and provision has been included for a deposit on a site at Blanchardstown.  Consideration is being given to moving the Dún Laoghaire School of Art into buildings on the Dún Laoghaire site and provision has been made for adaption.</P>
    <P>The net amount sought for residential homes and special schools in 1983 is £3,865,000 which is a reduction of £25,230 or 1 per cent on the provisional 1982 outturn.  The main reason for this is the reduction in the capital provision from an expenditure of £1,773,600 in 1982 to £650,000 in 1983, as major building projects near completion.  The non-capital provision for 1983 represents an increase of 52 per cent on the 1982 outturn.</P>
    <P>A sum of £600,000 is being provided for grants to residential homes certified under the Children Acts for the reception into care of deprived children.  The number of children in these homes who are the responsibility of the Department of Education continues to fall.  The number of children in care has fallen from 243 on 1 January 1982 to 195 on 1 January 1983. The provision sought allows the rate of capitation grant to be increased from £68 to £85 per child per week, an increase of 25 per cent; half of this grant is paid by the Department and half by the appropriate local authority in the case of children under 17 years of age.  The grants for children over 17 years of age who remain in care to complete their education are paid in full by my Department.</P>
    <P>An amount of £2,540,000 is being provided in respect of the operational costs <Col N="2138" /> of special schools and assessment units for young offenders.  This represents an increase of 71 per cent on the 1982 provisional outturn.  The main reason for the increase is the opening of two new units in addition to the existing facilities at Finglas Children's Centre, Scoil Árd Mhuire, Lusk, and St. Joseph's Special School, Clonmel.  Trinity House, Lusk, has been built entirely from State funds to provide a secure school for boys who cannot be provided for in an open setting. It has places for 30 boys and replaces Loughan House which was run by the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>Cuan Mhuire Assessment Unit for girls has been established in modern premises at Collins Avenue, Dublin, and will be used as a remand and assessment unit for girls.</P>
    <P>The £2,540,000 sought is to meet the pay costs of non-teaching staff in these units and general running costs.  Teaching staff employed are a charge on the Vote for Primary Education.</P>
    <P>A sum of £650,000 is being provided for capital development this year as against an outturn of £1,773,600 in 1982. The projects involved include staff accommodation at Trinity House, Lusk, continuation of a development scheme at St. Joseph's, Clonmel, and miscellaneous minor works at other special schools.  The decreased provision reflects the completion of the main construction at Trinity House, Lusk, and of the first phase of the development at St. Joseph's, Clonmel.</P>
    <P>A sum of £25,000 is being provided for courses in child care.  This is an increase of 97 per cent on the 1982 outturn and is intended to provide ongoing training and refresher courses for staff in the area of special care.</P>
    <P>A sum of £93,635,000 is being sought for the Vote for Higher Education which provides for grants-in-aid of an tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas in respect of its own general expenses and the current and capital costs of designated institutions of higher education, and of the Dublin Dental Hospital, the Cork Hospitals Board and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.</P>
    <P>A sum of £446,000 is being provided as a grant-in-aid of the general expenses of <Col N="2139" /> the Higher Education Authority.  This is an increase of 14 per cent to salary increases and other increased costs.</P>
    <P>A sum of £76,450,000 is being provided as a grant-in-aid to the Higher Education Authority towards the general non-capital costs of the universities and other designated institutions of higher education which are funded through the HEA. A sum of £14,050,000 is being provided in the Vote for capital costs.</P>
    <P>Thirteen million pounds capital is being provided for the universities and colleges and designated institutions of higher education which are funded through the HEA.  The bulk of this money relates to projects already under way &mdash; National Institute of Higher Education, Limerick, Library Lecture Theatre complex and Microelectronic Research Centre at UCC, completion of the first phase of the National Institute for Higher Education Dublin, completion of phase II of the National College of Art and Design and a variety of other smaller projects.</P>
    <P>The only major project scheduled to commence this year is Phase II of the UCD Library.  Consideration is being given to a list of priority developments at third level with a view to making the best use of the limited resources which will be available over the next few years.</P>
    <P>In addition, £750,000 is being provided to help meet the cost of replacing obsolete and outworn furniture and equipment in these institutions.</P>
    <P>The £200,000 in respect of building and capital costs of third-level institutions not funded through the HEA relate mainly to the final account for the new Cork Dental Hospital and School and renovations to the Dublin Dental Hospital.</P>
    <P>A new dental hospital and school on the site of the Cork Regional Hospital was built in 1980 and the equipping and furnishing of the building was proceeding when damage was caused to the building and equipment by a fire which broke out on 14 May 1981.  Restoration work was completed in 1982.  The fire was the subject of a criminal injury claim by the Cork Hospitals Board against Cork Corporation. The Cork Hospitals Board were <Col N="2140" /> awarded full compensation but the award was appealed and the outcome of the appeal is awaited.  A further £100,000 is being provided for capital furniture and equipment costs of non-HEA institutions mainly urgently needed equipment for the Dublin Dental Hospital.</P>
    <P>The net amount being sought for the National Gallery Vote for 1983 is £633,000 which is required for the salaries and expenses of the National Gallery including grants-in-aid.  This represents an increase of £88,600 or 16 per cent over the 1982 provisional outturn.</P>
    <P>The greater part of the increase is to meet the increased cost of salaries and wages, travelling and incidental expenses and Post Office services.</P>
    <P>So much for the details of the Estimates. I would hope that the House has taken note of the fact that, despite the exceedingly difficult financial situation, this Government were able to provide a sum of £1.9 million in order to increase the grant to secondary schools in lieu of school fees from £82 to £92.  They also have provided an additional sum of £1.1 million to increase the capitation grant to national schools from £15 to £17, while the grant to children in care in residential homes has been increased by 25 per cent from £68 to £85 per child.</P>
    <P>For many years now it has been the fashion to measure the success of Ministers by the amount of money they can obtain from the Exchequer to finance the services of their Departments.  In other words, the bigger the spender, the better the Minister.  Time and time again, Ministerial speeches triumphantly referred to the progress being achieved and the criterion invariably was the increase in expenditure &mdash; this, too, without any regard to where the money was coming from.  It is not the Government who pay. The bill must be passed on in the form of taxation or charges.</P>
    <P>Is it not more relevant to boast in terms of cost-effectiveness and cost-efficiency, if one wishes to boast?  It is not the big spenders but the prudent, cost-effective spenders who merit the approval of the people of Ireland.  My Department could not hope to escape unscathed from the severe pruning in Government expenditure <Col N="2141" /> that is so necessary as a result of the extraordinarily misguided and shortsighted financial and political decisions made between 1977 and 1981.</P>

      <P>I want to put those economies into perspective.  Facts are facts but fancy is free.  The economies amounted in all to some 2 per cent of the total Estimate &mdash; a reduction of £2 in every £100.  Even with this pruning of expenditure the financial commitment of the Government continues, by any standards, to be high.  Indeed, the education services have been given more favourable treatment this year than many of the other State services.  Let me illustrate the point.  As I pointed out earlier, the provision for the Education group of Votes this year represents 15.54 per cent of the total budget for all State services compared with 15.17 per cent in 1982.  This year, too, it is estimated that the budget for education represents 6.6 per cent of GNP, compared with 6.1 per cent in 1979, for example.  These are tangible indicators of my Government's commitment to education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In seeking economies the options open to the Government were extremely limited. Pay and pensions this year take 81.7 per cent of the non-capital budget for education.  With such a labour-intensive service it was clear that the growth in the numbers of teachers over the past ten years simply could not be sustained at a time of economic retrenchment.  In 1972-73 there were, for example, 29,187 teachers at first-and second-level.  Ten years later in 1982-83 their number had increased by 11,068 to 40,255.  This represented an increase of 37.9 per cent.  At the same time the number of full-time pupils had increased by only 17 per cent. This continuous escalation in teacher numbers simply cannot be sustained at this difficult budgetary time for the country. Adjusting the overall pupil/teacher ratio in second level schools this year was merely restoring the ratio that applied in 1977.  Because of the inordinately high percentage of the current budget devoted <Col N="2142" /> to pay and pensions, teacher staff numbers had to be looked at in seeking retrenchment.</P>
    <P>On the non-pay side the scope for retrenchment was extremely limited.  The four major areas of expenditure &mdash; school transport, scholarships and student grants, loan charges and the day-to-day running expenses of the some 4,000 institutions at first-, second- and third-level sectors &mdash; take some 90 per cent of the non-pay budget.  Against this backdrop, economies of 2 per cent had to be found.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters to indicate the difficulty in achieving economies.  It is sad that, for the sake of short-term political opportunism, the Opposition have mounted a strident campaign against the economies made &mdash; precisely the same economies which, when in Government, they themselves had decided to implement and had included in the Book of Estimates for 1983 published in November last.  I do not shirk from my responsibility as Minister in this matter.  I regret that it was necessary for me to go along with the economies which the former Government had determined.  As Minister, I must stand over them.  The House will recall that two fundamental changes were made by my Government from the list of economies determined by the previous Government.  First, the cut in the remedial teacher programme for national schools was restored and, second, medical card holders were exempted from the school transport charge.  These changes are a measure of our concern for the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I want to pass on now to more general issues of policy.  It is generally expected that each new incumbent of the Education portfolio should spell out his or her educational policy when introducing the Estimates for the first time.  The House will be aware of the fact that the country has had six Ministers for Education since 1981.  This has led to the position that many groups involved in education have been seriously concerned at the lack of coherent planning in the educational system. In order to restore a sense of purpose and a sense of direction to the crucial area of educational planning, I have taken the unprecedented step of involving <Col N="2143" /> the major groups in education &mdash; parents, managers and teachers &mdash; and engaging them with a working party in my Department in the planning process. I expect to be able to announce a programme for action which will chart a clear path in Education for the next four years. I need hardly add that the programme for action must and will be rooted in reality and must have regard to the current financial situation.  When the programme is available, and should the House so wish, I will be happy to cooperate in affording the House an opportunity for discussing it.</P>
    <P>I do not intend today to pre-empt the recommendations of the working party. I do wish, however, to indicate some of the general principles on which I have asked my officials to base the action programme. One assumes that the programme, while not setting out a complete philosophy of education, will be based on the continuing role of the educational system in transmitting religious and moral values, as well as maintaining existing key traditions.</P>
    <P>As I perceive the process of education here, I see the system enabling, as far as possible, all citizens to have access to an education which is relevant to their needs and which will enable them to fulfil the potential of their abilities and talents. Second, education should be continuously updated to make it relevant to the modern world, to changing employment patterns and to increased leisure time. Third, our system should enable our young people to appreciate and develop their cultural heritage, both Irish and European.  Fourth, it should discriminate positively in favour of the disadvantaged in our society.  Fifth, it should seek to delegate responsibility and authority as far as is feasible and in such a manner as to achieve a genuine partnership between all interests involved.  Finally, I have asked the working party to examine in depth the issue of cost-effectiveness and cost-efficiency in the use of existing and future resources.</P>
    <P>The House may be aware of my own personal interest in the curriculum options available for girls.  I am particularly <Col N="2144" /> concerned to ensure that girls have the opportunity of participating in the science and technological subjects in post-primary schools.  The recent ESRI report highlighted the inadequacy of the subject options generally available to girls.  I am having a special study of the report undertaken by my Department with a view to improving the situation for the girls attending our schools.  Yesterday I met representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discuss an important report which they have just issued on sexism in education generally.</P>
    <P>I am not naive enough to think for one moment that the production of a programme for action will be the panacea for all our ills in the educational system. After six months in office I am fully aware, as never before, of the complexities in education, the minefields in which one must tread warily and the tremendous challenges facing us as a society.  I acknowledge and respect the external factors &mdash; social, demographic and financial &mdash; which necessarily influence educational policy.  Our large young population under 25 years, representing 48 per cent of the total population, the lack of employment opportunities for school leavers, and the new disturbing trends towards vandalism, drug-taking and other forms of socially disruptive behaviour provide a formidable challenge to us all who have responsibility for our educational services.  In particular, the continuing growth in the number of full-time students will, it is projected, within five years, lead to an increase of some 50,000 students by 1987.  In percentage terms, the increase will be of the order of 5 per cent.  The greatest increase will take place at third level where some 15,000 additional students will be in full-time education. This, of course, is the most costly sector of all.  For example, an intake of 1,000 pupils at first level is estimated to cost £470,000 per annum whereas 1,000 students at third level would cost £2,160,000.  At the same time, our young population brings an immense vitality and hope.  The educational system is providing a large cohort of well educated young people who want to play their part <Col N="2145" /> in the further economic development of the country.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I wish to refer to another topic, not unrelated to what I have already discussed.  I refer to the urgent need for fundamental reform in school curricular and assessment procedures. There is an almost universal demand from parents, teachers, students and employers that major changes be brought about.  Many students, particularly those of lower ability and those in disadvantaged areas, increasingly find existing school courses irrelevant to their needs.  I hope to set up by January 1984 on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis a Curriculum and Examinations Board and that this Board will be a means of undertaking a fundamental review of school courses at primary and post-primary level.</P>
    <P>I want to confirm my commitment to the greatest possible development of the natural talents of all our children.  Much has been done over the years; much remains to be done.  The Government and I shall continue to strive for the provision of the most comprehensive and equitable system of education which is within our capacity to achieve.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that this is my first time here as Front Bench Spokesman on Education for my party in replying to the Minister's speech on the Education Estimates.  I should like, if I may, by starting on a less acrimonious note, to say to the Minister that she spoke of her philosophy of feminism in education towards the end of her debate.  There is no more salient feature of feminism than today in the House, it is a female Minister for Education and a female Opposition Shadow Minister for Education speaking on this matter.  I have not been a strident feminist but I have been a feminist in the real meaning of the word as I have always felt there should be equal access to men and women and boys and girls to all areas of employment, education and opportunity.  It is quite a milestone that there are two women here today debating the very important subject of education.  That is really feminism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech contains the housekeeping for the year for the Estimate for the Department of Education. The Minister and her advisers have <Col N="2147" /> betrayed in her speech a sort of slick selectivity in the figures they are giving and the credit they are taking for some matters and not taking credit for other matters.  I could not commence without saying that.  The Minister takes credit for the increase in the total expenditure on education.  She stated that this year it is estimated that the budget for education represents 6.6 per cent of GNP compared with 6.1 per cent in 1979, for example.  In many parts of her speech she berates the previous Government for the stringent measures they put into their Education Estimate which she as Minister was forced to adopt.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  She cannot take credit for the growth between 1979 and 1983, which was a Fianna Fáil growth in education and not want to take blame for any stringent measures which would have been implemented and had to be implemented by her.  The Minister must take her responsibility seriously.  This slick selectivity of figures is not quite fair or just in the situation we are talking about.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with general headings first and then I will get on to the various points I want to make.  The Minister referred to her overall philosophy in education in the setting up of the curriculum board which she hopes to have in operation on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by January 1984.  You cannot always be destructive and I, unequivocally, welcome this announcement by the Minister.  However, this was announced by her predecessor in the previous Coalition Government, Deputy John Boland, the present Minister for the Public Service.  In fact he came into the Seanad when I was then a member of the Cultural and Educational Panel and spoke of the necessity, as he saw it, for the setting up of this Curriculum and Examinations Board.  As the Minister pointed out, there have been many changes of Ministers since that time and it was allowed lapse.  That was because of various pressures brought to bear.  The present Minister announced formally at the teachers' conferences last April, but informally in a series of interviews she gave to magazines and newspapers, her interest in this field and the <Col N="2148" /> fact that she wished to pursue the setting up of that board.  She has included it in her introductory remarks here today and has repeated it at many seminars and functions around the country.  I quibble with the fact that it had already been announced by Deputy Boland, when Minister for Education, and that it will now take until January 1984 to set-up what I would regard as a very necessary board.</P>

      <P>I would be glad if I could be afforded the same facility.  If this is not to become a female screaming house I should like to be allowed to continue. The Minister said that she hopes to set up this Curriculum and Examinations Board by January 1984.  I ask why will it take that long to set up such a highly desirable board, one to which I will give my fullest support?  The Minister will have my constructive support, interest and comments in regard to this board. But the Minister should hurry up with it and, if possible, not wait until January 1984.  If it is to be set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis it could be done in September.  Why wait until January?  Why not set it up earlier and so be able to say that it was set up in the Minister's first year in office? It is something which should be pursued with great vigour and celerity.</P>
      <P>I welcome also the Minister's proposal to establish a planning board.  Here I might quote what the Minister had to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to restore a sense of purpose and a sense of direction to the crucial area of educational planning, I have taken the unprecedented step of involving the major groups in education &mdash; parents, managers and teachers &mdash; and engaging them with a working <Col N="2149" /> party in my Department in the planning process.</P>
    <P>I might point out to the Minister that the major parties in the educational process are the pupils who sit at the school desks, the students attending the schools. Therefore I cannot see how anybody, advisers or whoever was engaged in this submission, could say that they had taken the unprecedented step of involving the major groups in education when that group precludes the students who receive the education.  If the Minister is involving herself and her Department in a major overhaul of the planning of education there must be a student input.  It is ridiculous to maintain that one is concerned with the major interests and yet not be concerned with the numerical and direct interest involved, that being the students.</P>
    <P>That brings me to my next point &mdash; I want to go into all of these before moving on to the general areas of education &mdash; and it has a bearing on what I have just said.  If I may be pardoned for being parochial, on Monday night last at a meeting of County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee a most appalling circumstance occurred.  One month ago, in May last, I proposed and had accepted by a vote at that committee that student representatives would be given observer status on the board of management in Athlone.  That was a legitimate vote won as a result of intense lobbying by the students to have what I regard as their legitimate say &mdash; not as members because the board cannot be enlarged except by amending legislation &mdash; but that they would have observer status at board of management meetings. Exactly one month later, last Monday evening, Westmeath Vocational Education Committee met again.  There was a rescinding motion put down by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, won by the casting vote of a Coalition member, that the right of student observer status be taken from them.</P>
    <P>This is in direct conflict with the Fine Gael policy on education of 1981 when they said they would provide for statutory representation, or student representation on boards of management in all schools <Col N="2150" /> in which they would be involved.  Therefore there is need now for the Minister to speak to her partners in Government, to members of her own party.  Why was the status granted them taken away by a rescinding motion?  As a member of the Fine Gael Party said at that meeting, they did not want students poking into college affairs.  I found a great echo of those sentiments in the Minister's remarks here today when she announced that she would set up a planning body which did not involve students.  That is utterly ridiculous. It is quite extraordinary coming from a party who pride themselves on their youth involvement, the gearing of their policies towards young people, indeed their responsiveness to the needs of young people.  I look forward to the July meeting of Westmeath Vocational Education Committee when I shall have a further motion down, and I look forward to hearing that the Minister has poked her Fine Gael and Labour councillors in County Westmeath, having seen to it that students get their right, at least to have their presence felt if not their voices heard.  It is an issue on which I feel very deeply.  It is ridiculous for a party who say they have a youth policy, to put in their manifesto, that they will afford statutory representation and then take it away, it having already been granted.  I know that Deputy Boland, when Minister for Education, said he was preparing amending legislation of the 1930 Vocational Education Act to enlarge the boards of management, with the stated intention of allowing student representation on those boards.  Perhaps the Minister would resurrect that amending legislation and have it implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us the Estimates, as she said, which had been prepared by Fianna Fáil and with which she has had to cope.  Again I must say that whoever prepared the Minister's speech has shown slick selectivity.  I have in front of me the correct budget Estimate showing the additional measures brought in in the last budget by the Coalition Government. It is a document headed &ldquo;Principal policy measures adopted by this Government in settling the revised Estimates&rdquo;<Col N="2151" />&mdash;that is the present Government.  There are there detailed a number of cutbacks in education which were not, I might emphasise, detailed in the Fianna Fáil Estimates of last November, those Estimates which the Minister decries continuously when she talks about cutbacks in school transport.  These are cutbacks they shrug off as not being theirs but you do not want to take responsibility for the additional ones listed here and of which you made no mention &mdash; remarkably slick selectivity &mdash; in your speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it does, yes. In all of the Minister's speech there was no mention of these additional expenditure cuts which have been brought in by this Coalition Government.  It is in this area that I contend that what we have been presented with today is a slightly dishonest document.  If we are going to point out where there were cuts envisaged last November surely any correct ministerial statement would have pointed out then where additional cuts had had to be effected because I understand what we are discussing are the revised Estimates announced by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The areas that will be hit more are the regional technical colleges and the colleges of technology in Dublin.  Fees will be raised by amounts ranging from 100 per cent to practically 300 per cent for a small number of schools.  All of these increases are listed in the revised Estimates.  The Government have stated that £100,000 will be obtained by raising fees and further measures will also be taken in the regional technical colleges and in the schools of technology.  The savings include the following: increased <Col N="2152" /> fees, increased academic standards required for EEC scholarships and reduced provision for pay and non-pay will amount to £1.55 million; reduced provision for class materials in the VEC sector, £0.5 million; reduced provision for science and other equipment grants, £0.465 million; reduced provision for pay and non-pay in the HEA sector, £1.3 million; reduced provision for running costs in training colleges, £0.35 million; allocation from youth employment levy receipts towards the cost of VEC preemployment and secretarial courses, £5 million.  The Minister also referred in her speech to additional provision for youth services.</P>
    <P>All the above in addition to what was in the budget amounts to an assault or even a dismantling of the regional technical colleges and the colleges of technology. The Minister has been very political in her speech and I aim to be the same.  All the measures taken during the years by Fianna Fáil Governments are slowly but efficiently being eroded by the Coalition Government and the Minister for Education.  I am thinking of matters such as the attempt to raise the school leaving age.  Now we see the pillage of the RTCs.  In the 1960s we had the OECD report and the Commission on Education and finally between 1967 and 1970 there was the setting up of the RTCs.  This was in response to a real need that was emerging throughout the country.  What is proposed in the document to which I have referred is a dismantling of the RTCs. Let us not forget that these measures are specific additional entries in the Estimates for Education as prepared by the Government and the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to address myself to a matter about which I feel particularly aggrieved. I intend to embark on a crusade, much as I embarked successfully on a crusade against the harshness of the measures introduced in the school transport arrangements.  I devoted myself to that matter for three months.  It may have appeared at the time that I was not going to do anything else in the educational area but I intend to embark on a crusade to highlight what I regard as a measure that is not acceptable from the social or <Col N="2153" /> educational point of view.  As was stated in the small print of the budget last February, and this was confirmed by the Minister in a speech to the IVEA Association in Portlaoise on 18 May last, it will now be mandatory for a student who wishes to avail of a vocational education scholarship to enter an RTC to obtain two straight honours in two higher level subjects.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot in justice or from the social or educational point of view justify that decision.  She attempted to justify it in her speech in Portlaoise in which she stated:</P>
    <P>We must face the reality that measures of this kind cannot be avoided if we are to maintain the quality of our educational services.  In the case of the two-honour requirement, let me mention the recent survey which has drawn attention to the high drop-out levels at the end of first year by students who attend third level colleges.  We cannot ignore <i>inter alia</i> the cost implications of this and must recognise that the State is only in a position to subsidise those whose record of attainment shows that they have a good chance of coping with courses at this level.</P>
    <P>I regard that as a dreadful statement.  It is saying that only the best educated, qualified people will benefit by vocational education scholarships, that they will be the only ones allowed to enter that level of education.  It was a quite horrific statement. The attitude is that only the good, bright, capable boys and girls should step forward but that the not so bright or not so capable &mdash; but who may have vast potential if they got the opportunity &mdash; should step aside because there is no place for them.  The more I read the statement of the Minister the more my blood boils.  I say to myself, how dare any Minister for Education put that in a speech and hope to get away with it, as obviously the Minister did at the time?</P>
    <P>When dealing with the two-honour requirement the Minister referred to a report.  I do not know if it was the report of Dennis Murphy, Lecturer in Economics, Galway Regional Technical College, or if it was the report entitled <i>Participation</i><Col N="2154" /><i>in Higher Education &mdash; a National Survey</i> by Patrick Clancy.  The Minister in an apologia for her requirement for two honours says it is because she and the Department are worried about the drop-out rate of the lower academically geared students entering college.  I draw the attention of the Minister and her advisers to the report of Dennis Murphy issued in April 1983 entitled <i>The Characteristics and Performance of First-Year Students in Galway Regional Technical College.</i>  In table 9 there is a statement under the heading &ldquo;Prior educational attainment of failures and drop-outs in percentage proportion&rdquo;.  We will take the year 1981-1982 as the figure in which we are interested.  In 1981-1982 the drop-out rate from Galway Regional Technical College of students with no honours at entry was 20.5 per cent; the drop-out rate of students with one honour in their leaving certificate examination was 23.3 per cent; the drop-out rate for students with two honours was 24.6 per cent and the drop-out rate for students with three or more honours was 31.5 per cent.  These are statistics from the report of Mr. Murphy, Lecturer in Economics at the Galway Regional Technical College.  I accept that some of the drop-out rate would have been in respect of students who got employment or who went on different courses.</P>
    <P>The regional colleges have various demographic characteristics, but we must take one example &mdash; this is what this man said when he carried out a survey in Galway. He said it was the higher honour students who had the highest percentages of drop-outs.  I dispute the reason the Minister gave for the drop-out rate, which is that they were among the less academically geared children because that cannot be sustained.</P>
    <P>I asked the Athlone Regional Technical College to provide some statistics.  Up to now if a student wished to apply for a vocational education grant/scholarship and wished to enter a regional technical college, he could do it by getting five passes in stated subjects.  Then he could follow the course of his choice.  The Minister announced, and it was also in the <Col N="2155" /> small print in the budget, that now a student must have a minimum of two straight honours in two honours subjects before he can get into an RTC.  In the months of May and June, when the students are leaving, the Minister cannot say they need two honours to get a scholarship for next September.  I do not say that this requirement should ever be introduced but if it were it could only be introduced in two years time because the leaving certificate course takes two years. Whoever decided that this should be a feature of the budget was a very silly person who did not know anything about education and did not realise that after intermediate certificate a student had to do a two-year course for the leaving certificate.  A student decides which subjects he will take in fifth year.  In most schools, thanks to Fianna Fáil there is a good guidance counsellor to help students on the courses they wish to follow. How can the Minister decide now, in the month of June, that these students must have two honours subjects?  That is daft.</P>
    <P>I have met very distressed children coming from their leaving certificate examinations when it burst upon them suddenly that they needed two honours to get a vocational education scholarship/grant. They told me they could not afford to go to Athlone Regional Technical College next September because, while they were confident they would get five or more passes, they knew they would not get two honours because they had not done the honours course.  I realise I am going on and on about this, but I will take every opportunity to put this point across because it is a gross miscarriage of justice to say to students at this late stage that they must have two honours this year.  They cannot do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has plenty of commonsense and humanity.  I know the Ceann Comhairle told me not to be personal but I am being personal in a nice way.  I ask her to use her commonsense and change this requirement.  Whoever thought up this idea &mdash; I know it was not a woman &mdash; did not know what he was talking about.  This will make her the laughing <Col N="2156" /> stock of the country and will be a grave miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>As I said, I asked the Athlone RTC for statistics because I wanted to see what was happening in my own patch.  Of the total intake of students at present 58 per cent are on VEC scholarships.  In 1982-83 the number &mdash; I want the Minister to listen to this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point you make but I never mentioned &ldquo;civil servants&rdquo;, although I used the word &ldquo;advisers&rdquo;. In the year 1982-83 the number of first year VEC scholarship holders with one honour or less is 70.2 per cent.  That is a massive statistic and one the Minister will have to bear in mind.  To bring that to a more precise calculation, 40 per cent of all first year entrants to the RTC with one honour or less got a VEC scholarship. This means Athlone RTC would have 40 per cent fewer students if this new requirement had been enforced; 70 per cent of VEC scholarship holders have one honour or less and 58 per cent of total students are on VEC scholarships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are witnessing is the pillage and plunder of the RTC system.  It is very serious that a system which has served so well and which should be growing and getting stronger is being dismantled.  Perhaps there is a need for a review because the first RTC has been set up for 14 years and most have been set up for more than a decade.  I admit there is a need for a review of the efficacy of the curriculum and the whole system of RTCs now that a decade has passed since they were set up.  However, we cannot implement what <Col N="2157" /> the Minister sees as economies in a selective way and not present them in the Estimate speech today.  But we must also mention the marvellous strides that were made, and quite rightly, in the extra provision of remedial teachers and in the amelioration of the worst and most horrible aspects of the school transport arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the question of the catchment boundary facility areas, which I adopted last February and never let go of, has been acknowledged by the Minister and the Minister of State as being entirely necessary for review, and that they will be reporting on it.  At the time I was accused of exaggeration and hyperbole. The fact is that it was a very unjust decision that the children of medical card holders could not get school transport because they were going to schools to which they had traditionally gone.  The Minister was very good to make the change.  Children of medical card holders will now be exempt and will be allowed to go to the school of their choice.  I take no little credit for having hammered that point so often that it struck a chord.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned her commitment to feminism and to opportunities for women in education.  The ESRI report showed alarming lacunae in the choice of subjects for girls in second-level schools.  I agree fully with her sentiments. I will gladly support her in any research and development she intends to carry out in this area.  The Minister mentioned the ICTU report which she received yesterday. There is a very good article in the <i>Irish Press</i> of Friday, June 17.  It talks about women's rights in spirit but not in practice.  The second paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>Mrs. Fennell was hearing the results of a survey of 35,000 white collar women workers by the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations in Dublin.  The survey, entitled &ldquo;Report on Women in Employment&rdquo;, follows a similar survey by the same group made in 1980.</P>
    <P>What it really says is that women are not getting the top jobs.  The Minister of State has agreed that women are not getting the top jobs and she will see that more <Col N="2158" /> women will get more top jobs.  That is relevant to the ESRI report.  If women are not doing the correct subjects, if they have not got access to them, or if there are lacunae, it follows that they are not being geared towards the top jobs.  I welcome all these reports which detail deprivations in education for women.  The Minister has stated her commitment to follow them up.</P>
    <P>While I was in my office this morning I listened to Deputy Kelly speaking about lack of access for women to some educational subjects.  He said women should be encouraged to take up subjects in the field of technology.  He said he did not receive requests for advice from parents whose daughters wanted to take up engineering, and that there is a very small number of women engineers in the country. This is something to which we can all usefully address ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we shed crocodile tears about school transport cuts because there were cuts in the earlier Estimates. In my research for the debate today I delved deeply and I found the Official Report of the Dáil Debates of 9 July 1982.  A Cheann Comhairle, on that date you played a major part in the debate on an estimate for the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>You said these were the Estimates of the present Government and that the Opposition should stop saying: &ldquo;They are not my Estimates.  They are somebody else's Estimates.&rdquo;  You said the Minister should accept his responsibility.  I am now saying to the Minister, Deputy Hussey, that she should accept her responsibility.  In the same debate the then Deputy Boland said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government had their opportunity in their budget to change any of the Estimates published in January. They did so in respect of whichever Estimates they chose to change.  They did not do so in respect of those Estimates they wished to adopt in their totality.  It ill behoves the Minister, or <Col N="2159" /> some of his colleagues whom I have noted also in recent days, to adopt this Pontius Pilate-like attitude of endeavouring to suggest that the Estimates were incapable of being altered.</P>
    <P>That was a former Minister for Education talking to the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Donoghue.  It is all very interesting.  You can say one thing when you are in Government and another thing when you are in Opposition.  You are like &ldquo;Goody Two Shoes&rdquo; when you are in Government and &ldquo;Baddy Two Shoes&rdquo; when you are in Opposition.</P>
    <P>The sanctimonius and self-righteous way in which the Minister for Education presents her Estimate must be noted. Methaphorically speaking she wags her finger at the Opposition and tells us what she has had to bear in more strident and abusive language than I would care to indulge in.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak now about the group with responsibility for adult and continuing education in Ireland.  Recently the Minister met the Aontas people and they told her about their extreme disquiet, and their very real fear that Aontas may go out of existence.  Aontas have the responsibility to see that all the adult education programmes are carried out properly.  They are the administrative body.  They give a marvellous service. They say quite starkly that Aontas will collapse at the end of August 1983 unless they can obtain additional finance before the end of the financial year.  This collapse will mean making all three staff redundant and surrendering the lease of the office.  I know the Minister is sympathic to the concept of adult education. On 21 November 1979 there was a debate in the Seanad.  The then Senator Murphy moved the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to formulate a policy on adult education, provide a comprehensive adult education service with adequate funding and resources, and identify priorities in the development of adult education within the Government's development plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2160" /> The then Senator Murphy very ably moved his motion and the then Senator Hussey seconded it in a very erudite fashion. She praised the role of Aontas and their contribution to the furtherance of adult education.  I know the Minister still has those sentiments but, no matter how worthy she considers it not to ask for extra money, nevertheless I ask her not to prune in this area.  Aontas say starkly that they are going out of business in August 1983 unless they get additional finance.  A sum of £25,000 is very little direct extra expenditure and is all that is required to keep Aontas open.  I appeal to the Minister to allow Aontas to continue their estimable and worthy activities which, as a Senator, she so heartily endorsed in 1979.  That motion on adult education makes marvellous reading and it would be very sad if they had to close the shutters.  Some way must be found to allow them to continue.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I welcome the proposed setting up of the curriculum and examinations board but it must be set up quickly. I also agree with the setting up of a planning board but I do not agree with the exclusion of students from that board.  I cited the VEC in my own constituency of County Westmeath.  How can you set up a development board for the planning of education and exclude students?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the greatest increase will take place at third level education where some 15,000 additional students will be in full-time education. This is the most costly sector and, unfortunately, the one on which she has made her most savage assault, notably on RTCs and the schools of technology.</P>
    <P>I also want to dispute the huge rise in fees to students entering RTCs and schools of technology.  They range from 100 per cent rising steeply to an increase of 304 per cent in one case.  We must not allow those fees to be implemented.  The increase in population has worked its way through primary school and second level education and is also emerging in the third level sector.  The Minister seems to be trying to prevent more people seeking third level education but what is going to happen to all the students who are not allowed to continue their studies because <Col N="2161" /> of prohibitive fees or the two honours requirement?  How are these young people going to occupy their time?  There are few jobs available and those there are require a third level qualification.  We are told that the Government are gearing themselves towards growth.  We may never again see a boom time but surely young people must be given an opportunity to fulfil their potential.</P>
    <P>Recently the Taoiseach spoke about an up-turn in the economy and hoped it would not be too long before this happened. One needs to instill confidence but if our economy, in tune with that of the rest of the world, does show an upturn, how are we going to be able to cope with it if we do not have trained young adults?  If a huge percentage of those students are not allowed to avail of this opportunity because of extreme academic requirements or financial restrictions what will happen to them? We cannot say that our young people are the great hope of the country, our shining beacon, and at the same time extinguish the light.  Young people have the right to express their talents and to see what their potential is.  To cruelly cut off that right in the month in which they are doing their leaving certificate is Marie Antoinette type politics.  Let them eat cake.  Let them get their two honours if they wish to further their education.  I am very angry indeed about this situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the constructive parts of the Minister's speech and I hope to help and advise in the areas about which I spoke. I should like to say something now which does not just apply to me as spokesperson for Education, it applies to the whole role of opposition.  Nowadays there is a belief that there should be consensus in everything and we are going to have committees on every subject.  I spoke here on Dáil reform as being in favour of this committee system.  I am also on record as saying that there must always be a Government and an Opposition.  It is healthy that there should be a tension between a Government Minister speaking on policy and an Opposition spokesperson giving his or her view as to how that policy should or should not be altered or implemented.  It is the essence <Col N="2162" /> of democracy that there be an Opposition and a Government.  One cannot have benches of Government people putting forward new policies and benches of people fresh from committees giving agreement on these.  One must run the country on the basis of a working Government and a working, healthy Opposition.</P>
    <P>I reserve the right as Opposition spokesperson on Education, to speak for my right and that of any other Opposition Member to criticise and put forward the Members' views and the constituents' views and to see how those views might be amended, adopted and implemented. I will not listen to self-righteous humbug that I should not put forward my point of view on education.  I do not say this in any sense of aggrandisement but I come from a tradition of education which ranges back over 120 years.  I have that tradition to maintain and will do so from these Opposition benches.  I will devote my energies to pointing out the shortcomings where they exist and to agreeing with those areas which are correct.  I reserve my right to make my input into the educational process in the Ireland of the eighties and looking forward to the Ireland of the nineties.</P>

She has done a very good job since coming into office and it has not been easy.  There is no joy in making cuts and trying to redress the imbalances of what has been accepted as being bad Government for a number of years.  The Minister has taken on that role and mantle with courage and, I would say, without any experience.  I offer her my congratulations and good wishes.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;seeing that she gave me an <i>entrée</i> earlier on, in the publicity in today's press regarding the report issued last night on Women in Employment. That report indicated the low representation of women in jobs above a certain grade.  They are bunched in very great numbers in service areas&mdash;low paid jobs, low status.  While women are making progress, and have certainly made great progress in the ten years since the marriage bar was lifted, they are not making as much progress as one would wish and this applies across the board.</P>
      <P>We must look at education in examining why women are not making the grade in job areas.  This is my special area of responsibility and that is what I will talk about.  I shall not spend too long, because other people wish to contribute, but I refer to the ESRI report recently published which has been mentioned before today in this debate.  I know that the Minister has this report and that she is committed to equal opportunities for women and for their advancement and will take this report very seriously.  I wish to praise the foresight of the ESRI and the Employment Equality Agency and congratulate Professor Hannan on the timely publication of the report.  As the Minister has announced, a committee is already working within her Department on the setting up of a Curriculum and Examinations Board.  It is important that this board have at its disposal, from the outset, the findings of Professor Hannan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless we examine seriously the educational lifestyle of our children, we will not prepare them for the reality of work life after school.  The whole area of stereotyping and subject selection is important, but there are areas of what are called hidden curricula.  I hope that this report will be read by teachers in the staffroom and discussed by them.  Very often teachers can bring into their classes their own attitudes, perhaps their biases and prejudices, even in their attitudes collectively to a class on how they address a mixed group based on preconceptions of boys' or girls' reactions and expectations. <Col N="2165" /> We need to go very deeply into this subject.  Perhaps a lot can be done in the schools with a will and I believe that the present Minister has that will.  However, there is not much point in changing the curriculum to give opportunities on selective subjects which are going to stream girls into, say, the scientific and technological areas, rather than the service areas as in the past.  Before I came into the House I bought some of these books thinking in my innocence that this was nonsense about mummy baking bread.</P>

      <P>As regards adult education, I have been closely involved with groups in Dublin who have organised themselves locally despite all the difficulties and obstacles which were in their way.  These happen to be all women's classes.  This is an area of vital importance in the educational field.  I know the extent to which many women, particularly those working full-time in the home, benefit from this form of adult education.  I know that a report is due to be issued from the Department in the autumn.  Many women left school at 13 or 14 years of age and did not have access to second-level let alone third-level education.  In the main they would have had low paid jobs. There is an awareness among women who married in their late teens or early twenties that the educational opportunities available through the VECs are far broader than baking, cooking, domestic science or dressmaking or some of the traditional skill areas.  Many women are now enrolling for maths, history and other subjects.  This is a worthwhile change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full credit must be given to these women groups.  One such group is the Kilbarrack Local Education Adult Renewal.  They started as a group of local housewives interested in self-development and discovered what academic subjects were available to them.  They approached the VEC to arrange morning classes for them.  Following discussion the women agreed with the VEC on the content of courses in English and basic maths.  The success of the first course can be gauged from the fact that 50 women have now enrolled for a range of subjects, many of which lead to the leaving certificate. Testimonial to the strength of the group's motivation is that they have successfully <Col N="2167" /> organised crèche facilities with help from the National Manpower Service work experience programme. They have published a booklet and they plan to publish another in the near future. Mothers who stay at home while their children are young benefit from this experience not only from the social interaction with other participants but also from the intellectual challenge which faces them.</P>
    <P>Many educationalists feel that at a time of recession and unemployment adult education should be made more accessible. In a recession the ideal approach is to pursue creative activities and make up the shortfall by learning useful skills.  This is a new movement and I am sure it is happening in other areas.  Mothers at home organise baby sitters and push prams long distances to get to classes.</P>
    <P>As regards the link between women in employment and the education system I should like to read an extract from Review of Policies for Equality of Opportunity&rdquo;, the Irish Report of the OECD:</P>
    <P>The extent of sex differentiation is deeply institutionalised in the ideological and cultural presumptions underlying the educational system.  Provision, allocation and choice are influenced by the &ldquo;hidden curriculum&rdquo; which reflects the attitudes and values which are dominant in society, and clearly reflected in schools.</P>
    <P>Participation in second level education among teenage girls is as high as for boys.  However, there are significant differences in the range of subject courses followed by boys and girls.  In general, girls are under-represented among those following courses in technical areas such as technical drawing, metalwork, etc., and in advanced mathematics and physics &mdash; subjects which lay the groundwork for further study in most engineering and technological disciplines.  These differences manifest themselves both in the more academically orientated secondary schools and in the vocational education sector.</P>
    <P>While the subjects taken by boys and <Col N="2168" /> girls are in part determined by pupils' choices (influenced by attitudes in the home and in society generally) there are indications that differences in the subject choices offered by schools to boys and girls is a contributory factor. A substantial proportion of the subjects taken by girls at second-level influence the range of choices open to them subsequently &mdash; (choice in employment, in future education, and in post-educational training).  Thus, rather fewer girls than boys go on to third-level education.  Of these, nearly three times as many girls as boys go into training colleges orientated towards primary teaching, nursing and secretarial courses; about half as many girls as boys go on to third-level technical colleges, and those who do tend towards the business rather than the engineering disciplines; and among those who go to university, girls tend mainly towards the humanities and the social sciences.</P>
    <P>I do not think many parents look through primary schoolbooks but their illustrations are as bad if not worse than the pose of the caring mother.  You never see a father fixing a child's jacket or putting on a baby's nappy or a child's shoes.  Fathers do this type of work.  We must reflect reality in children's schoolbooks.  We have the caring mother seeing the child off to school.  We see mammy at the stove making a cake in that one.  Here we have Uncle Seán showing little Seán how to build a kennel for the dog.  This is Matthew sailing his boat and talking about his boat with his father.  The girls tend to be clean, tidy and neat and shocked and horrified at anything the boys are doing. It is just a case of this being a boy's and a man's world in that anything serious is being done by the boys.  We get the picture of daddy showing the way but we know that that is not the case in today's world.  We have a changed approach and we must reflect that in our text books.</P>

Ba mhaith an rud é dá dtosnódh an tAire nó an Roinn Oideachais clú agus cáil a bhí ag múinteoirí agus páistí scoile, a chur ar ais i n-aigne na ndaoine.  Is dócha go mbeidh sé deacair é sin a dhéanamh, ba chóir dom a rá, nuair nach bhfuil flúirseacht agus líofacht Ghaeilge ag an Aire Oideachais.  Tá roinnt bheag Ghaeilge, ceapaim, ag an Aire Stáit san Roinn Oideachais de bharr go bhfuil sé as mo chontae féin agus go bhfuil Gaeltacht beag ann.

      <P>There are many aspects of this Estimate to which I should like to contribute but unfortunately the time available to us is much too restricted.  It is ridiculous that having begun debate on this important Estimate at 12.45 p.m. today we must conclude by 4 p.m.  This is a bad advertisement for us as legislators so far as people involved in education at all levels and also parents and pupils are concerned. Even with the Friday sittings of the House we have not been able to arrange more time for a debate of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the chaos and confusion that have followed <Col N="2170" /> the arrangements made by the Minister in the area of school transport.  The problems began on 23 December last when without consultation with anyone involved, the Minister rushed in with an arrangement that was intended to try to embarrass the previous administration. However, that did not work and to add insult to injury there have been various changes since in the school transport arrangements.  All of this has led to utter confusion.  If it is the intention of the Government to discontinue the school transport system, a system that was introduced by the late Mr. O'Malley, as Minister for Education, and which was financed down through the years by Fianna Fáil administrations and by a Coalition Government for a short term, they should say so instead of discontinuing the scheme by stealth.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to reduce the numbers of children being carried on the buses.  The concept of the catchment area has assumed a very important role in recent months.  The position often is that if one is in a certain catchment area one goes to the nearest school although there will be no bus transport to that school.  Therefore, the children caught in this situation must make some other arrangements for going to school.  The social aspect and the affinity of people with the areas in which they live and such factors as parochial boundaries do not matter so long as the Department can save money.  They are applying the most stringent regulations possible.  In my time as a public representative I have never seen so much effort being made as is the case in this instance.  Obviously the Department are eliminating school transport to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>On the general question of education, we should educate our people for life rather than in the interest of academic qualifications.  There is so much pressure on students leading up to examination time that their ability to take their examinations is being affected adversely. Pressure is put on children to attain the same level of success as was obtained in the previous year by their neighbours.  I am glad to note that the Minister is acting on a proposal that we put forward while <Col N="2171" /> in Government by way of a White Paper. I refer to the setting up of a board to investigate curriculum.  The curriculum indicated by the Minister was included in our White Paper some years ago and I am glad to know that it is to be retained and made a reality.</P>
    <P>Student accommodation at third level colleges was not mentioned by the Minister. Instead we have a requirement of two honours for scholarships to the regional technical colleges, the implications of which were spelled out by Deputy O'Rourke.  I contacted Cork County Vocational Education Committee to ask them what effect this might have and I received a letter which stated that a total of 142 new scholarship awards were accepted for the 1982-83 school year and 90 of those students had obtained grade C or higher in two honours papers in the leaving certificate examination.  The effect of the Government's proposal would be that 52 of those students could not have gone to the Cork Regional Technical College last year because they had not the financial wherewithal.</P>
    <P>An education system which provides only for the academic and intellectual development of students is very narrow and shortsighted.  I condemn the dropping of the axe by the Minister on the counselling service and I would point out that in the present climate of social change the education of our young people is more important than ever. Because of the change in direction of employment possibilities young people need to be equipped to maintain personal stability in their emotions and relationships with others in the face of repeated change and constant challenge.</P>
    <P>It is argued that one must focus on generalised skills which will live on regardless of the fluctuating employment scene.  We are in the era of the microchip but some of the old skills will be needed. I refer to such skills as decision making, coping skills, conflict solving skills, relationship and communication skills, learning and creative skills.  Social and personal education could, therefore, enable the young person to face the future confidently <Col N="2172" /> and optimistically, knowing his or her own worth, aware of his or her own strength, capable of making decisions and coping with uncertainty. Adaptability, flexibility, resourcefulness, openness to challenge and change are the qualities which need to be nurtured in the social and personal development of the young person.  Nevertheless we have a Minister for Education who at one fell swoop has discouraged the kind of guidance service we need.</P>
    <P>The first year at secondary school involves a major transition for the student. A guidance counsellor would focus on the difficulties encountered in the change from primary to secondary school, allowing pupils to express their hopes, fears and anxieties.  Self-awareness is developed by helping them to see themselves as unique individuals with different interests, likes, habits, values, attitudes and abilities and by enabling them to see themselves as persons of worth, regardless of potential or achievement. They are encouraged to discover, to explore and to express their own individuality, thus building up confidence and a positive self-image.  These are the directions which we as legislators should be encouraging our educators to pursue. Forty-eight per cent of our young people are under the age of 25.  Where counselling is available students are given the opportunity to talk about love, fear, anger, disappointment, loneliness, anxiety and worry and they share ideas on how to deal with these feelings.  Making friends, coping with conflict, with quarrels, with the bullying that goes on in some places, shyness and attitudes to school and study can be explored in the classroom or amongst small groups.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the social and health education programme being provided by Ogra Corcaigh.  We are fortunate to have such a comprehensive and worthwhile programme in Cork.  Two hundred teachers are engaged in this project which has been formally recognised by the Southern Health Board.  I would hope for some rethinking within the Department of Education.  I do not totally disagree with the previous speaker in regard to education <Col N="2173" /> for life, although I might stop at supporting some of these suggestions.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give some consideration to the position of scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha.  I had this matter in mind during the debate on school transport but I will not go into detail about the reason I did not raise it.  At present there are only 3,000 students attending lán-Ghaelach post-primary schools in the whole country, apart from State schools, technical schools and community schools.  Only one of 14 lán-Ghaelach post-primary schools has an intake of more than 250 pupils.  The Minister's Christmas package has in effect meant that no provision would be made for career guidance teachers, that the raising of the pupil-teacher ratio will mean that other subjects will have to be dropped from the curriculum.  As most pupils attending these schools live well over three miles away and in some cases travel up to 35 miles each way to their school, the only compensation they had was free travel and that is now being withdrawn. Private schools run by religious orders&mdash;they are not private in the sense that people might have an ideological idea about them &mdash; are financed by the parents to a large degree.  I was given information about one such school here in Dublin who must raise £18,000 a year to pay bank interest.  Now parents must pay to send their children to school also, and to a very restricted curriculum.</P>

      <P>The Opposition should have manners.  I did not heckle them.  I want to remind the Opposition of a few home truths.  They complimented the Minister on bringing forward their White Paper but Fianna Fáil have constantly avoided the fact that they left the school transport service short £5.4 million. Had they been returned to office they would have had to make the same cuts in that service that we did.  I have often said that it is a pity there was a change of Government in the last election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I say that is that Fianna Fáil were returned to power in 1977 with the biggest majority ever secured by any political party but they failed to do anything.  From 1977 to 1981 they borrowed £9,088 million.  What did they do with that money?  Had that money been spent correctly many schools could have been built and equipped and roads improved.  The problem the Minister, and the Government, have to face is the disaster that occurred following the implementation of the 1977 manifesto. That was the root cause of all the problems in education.  Deputy Lyons prompted me to make those remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition seem to forget that they have ruled the country for 80 per <Col N="2183" /> cent of the time since the foundation of the State.  We are all aware of the number of people who had to emigrate and the fact that we were handed 165,000 unemployed when we took office.  Previous Ministers in Fianna Fáil Governments promised that there would be full employment but we all know what happened to that promise.  They cannot blame us for the situation the country is in six months after we are elected to power.  It appears that the Opposition have forgotten <i>The Way Forward</i> in a few months.  I accept that a former leader of that party lost his memory but it now appears that Front Bench members of that party are losing their memories as well as their minds.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Government are in difficult circumstances because of what we inherited but when things improve in the Department of Education I hope the Minister will provide more money for the primary school sector.  I am a member of the Meath VEC and I am aware that seven of the eight vocational schools in my constituency are in urgent need of attention.  There is need for new vocational schools in Trim, Kells and Nobber. The school in Kells has been promised for 21 years and we all know which party were in Government for most of that time.  At every general election since 1962 Fianna Fáil approved the erection of a new school in Kells but the sod has not been turned.  That was not done by Coalition Governments.  We had all heard rumours at election time that the school will be starting soon.</P>
    <P>There is a need for permanent extensions to Longwood, Athboy, Oldcastle and Dunshaughlin vocational schools. Most of the money we get in Meath for the VEC is spent on administration and most of our schools are old, particularly those with less than 200 pupils.  Repairs are needed and money is needed to replace equipment.  Unfortunately, often there is not sufficient money to deal with these essential matters.  Would the Minister get her officials to have a special look at the allocation this year to Meath VEC to see if it can be improved?</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the <Col N="2184" /> decision the Department of Education took about charging people £24 for school transport to people outside the catchment area.  The Department must look at this again.  The population of Meath is 100,000 and there are 30,000 living in the area from Dunboyne, Dunshaughlin, Duleek right across to the sea but there is only one secondary school in that area, the community school at Dunshaughlin. Parents constantly come to me complaining about having to pay £24 for school transport.  Those people live in Dunboyne and in Laytown and their chidren are going to schools in Drogheda and Dublin.  The Department cannot provide educational facilities for people in that area.  The Minister inherited that from the previous administration.  I am putting it on the record of the House that the Department of Education have agreed in principle to erect a secondary school in Ashbourne.  I want the decision on that speeded up.  I also want to put it on the record of the House that a new secondary school in Dunboyne is needed. I do not see why the people of Meath, with a population of 100,000 should have to go with their caps in hands to secondary schools in Dublin and Louth asking them to take their children.</P>
    <P>I attended with the Minister for Industry and Energy a meeting lately of 200 parents who discussed the cuts in education. Despite what the Opposition say, I believe the public at the moment know the financial situation and would support a Government who tackle the problems and are seen to be tackling them.  I believe that is why the Leader of the Opposition lost the last three elections. The people knew he was not the man to lead the country.</P>

      <P>When the economy improves and money becomes available I would like to see money going back into education.  I do not like to see cuts in the money available for career guidance teachers and I do not like to see cutbacks in relation to remedial teachers.  I am aware, because of what we inherited, that the money is not there at the moment. People come to me and say: &ldquo;Frank, you are a Labour TD, can you not speak to the Minister about this?&rdquo;  I am man enough to know that, even if the Government were composed entirely of Labour Members, there is very little we could do with the economy at the moment because of the deplorable mess it was left in by bad government from 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have savagely cut my speech because of the position in relation to finishing.  I would like to refer to the 100 per cent increase in the fees of the regional technological colleges.  That is a completely unjust move and is illogical. The idea of trying to bring technological colleges into line in terms of fees with universities is ridiculous.  The Dublin Institute of Technology and regional technological colleges do not enjoy anything like the facilities universities enjoy, from library services to sporting facilities.  There is no comparison between the two, although some of the facilities in the universities are completely inadequate.  It is important to remember that the VEC colleges were originally set up to provide technical skills for those who could not go to universities, hence the need to keep the fees low.  The scheme was mainly aimed at working class people.</P>
      <P>I would also like to deal with the decision to cut equipment grants and material grants by nearly £1 million to VECs and RTCs.  The capital provision cutbacks of £7 million which will severely hit VECs and RTCs is disastrous.  Does the Minister not agree that in a sector badly in need of more money it is wrong that those cuts should take place at this time?  The Rathmines College of Commerce, for example, has a library which seats less than 90 people with a student population of 1,000 full-time students and 2,000 part-time students.  The library is a prefab building and is so bad it could well be a health hazard because of the very bad conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an indictment not alone of this Government but of successive Governments over the years&mdash;we have to accept, as Deputy McLoughlin says, that the Fianna Fáil Party have been in power 80 per cent of the time since the State was established&mdash;that one in every four primary schools has prefabricated classrooms, that one in ten do not have any drinking water, that three in every four <Col N="2187" /> do not have a telephone and that one in eight of all primary classes have in excess of 40 pupils.  It must also be said, despite these conditions, that the standard of achievement of the pupils is a credit to the dedicated teachers who teach under those conditions.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a point which is gaining currency at the moment.  There is a very dangerous theory being floated about&mdash;based on the idea that the unemployed, like the poor, will be always with us&mdash;that to deal with the increasing number of unemployed we must train them to deal with the so-called leisure time.  I must make it clear that leisure time and leisure facilities are very important, but they are available to us after a day's work, a week's work or a year's work.  Leisure time is not an occupation and must not be allowed to become another word for unemployment.  We must plan for full employment, educate and train our young people in academic and technological subjects so that they can advance our economic development.  We have the resources to make that advance.  We have the resources in our seas, on our land, beneath our seas and beneath our land. I have no shame in continuing to press the Government, or any other Government that may be in power in the future, for more resources for education, demanding the millions of pounds due in unpaid taxes from the rich and the ruling classes and that some at least of the 200,000 unemployed could be more usefully engaged in educational services, in reducing the pupil/teacher ratio, building new schools so badly needed, acting as caretakers and engaging in other ancillary duties rather than remaining on the dole queues.</P>
    <P>All attempts to deprive education of adequate financing must be resisted.  It seems that this Government are determined to follow the Tory line in Britain, where savage cuts in public spending have included education and have become the order of the day.  The Government seem bent on following that line here.  If we follow suit and deprive the students of today it means that we are abandoning their future.  A progressive <Col N="2188" /> and developing urban industrial society requires an educated and adaptable population, adaptable to change and properly equipped to cope with the demands society makes on it.  We need to reorientate education to provide for a population optimistic about industrialisation and urbanisation, motivated by the tremendous opportunities presented by developing technology.  In this way only can we make technology a servant of society. Only then shall we dispel any notion that technology is an alien force threatening our lives.</P>
    <P>The schools curricula should be changed to place more emphasis on our social history, the developing urban culture and aspects of science and technology. Our educational system must become a positive part of our society in harmony with the needs, real culture and aspirations of the majority of our people.</P>
    <P>I might refer briefly to one or two points in the Minister's introductory remarks.  She referred to the unprecedented step of involving the major groups in education, engaging them with a working party in her Department, in the planning process.  She says she has laid down the principles on which that working party will report to her and said:</P>
    <P>I assume that the programme, while not setting out a complete philosophy of education, will be based on the continuing role of the educational system in transmitting religious and moral values, as well as maintaining existing key traditions.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has an opportunity to reply to this debate today, or at some other time in the House, I should like her to explain what she means by &ldquo;maintaining existing key traditions.&rdquo;  It must be accepted that the traditions and values of this society of ours are changing.  Society is changing, moving from being ruralbased to urban-based.  If we are going to endeavour to maintain key traditions through our educational system without spelling out beforehand what the Government see those traditions as being and what value they see those traditions as having, then in this society of ours today and that we are likely to have in <Col N="2189" /> coming years we may be developing an educational system and curricula which will not be able to cope with technology or the manner in which our society is to develop.  Therefore I should like the Minister to spell out exactly what she means by &ldquo;maintaining existing key traditions&rdquo; so that we can have a debate on whether those traditions are relevant to today's society and to the needs of our people.</P>
    <P>I had a lot more to say on the subject of curricula and the need for change there.  I note that the Minister said she intends to set up a Curriculum and Examinations Board on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by January 1984.  I should be anxious to know why she chose this <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Would she not have considered that it would be better to have a permanent board which would carry out a continuous review of curricula and examinations. Practically everybody is agreed that the curricula have to be changed and that the examinations system must be changed. Numerous approaches have been made to the Department over the years, before the present Minister took office and since, stressing the need for such change and outlining how they should and ought to be effected.</P>
    <P>Rather than go into a lot of detail on the matter I would urge the Minister to explain more clearly what are the Department's views in relation to how this board will operate and whether there is any possibility it could be established before early next year.  I am sure the Minister will agree that there is an urgency about this matter, that the sooner it is set up and reports the sooner the necessary changes can be implemented.</P>

      <P>Ba mhian liom i dtosach báire mo dhíomá a ghabháil chuig an Aire os rud é nár bhain sí úsáid as focal amháin Ghaeilge.  Nílim ag iarraidh gearáin, nó masla, a chur ar éinne go pearsanta.  Táim ag iarraidh a chur in iúl don Teach seo, don Roinn Oideachais agus don Aire an tábhacht a bhaineann agus a bhain agus a bhainfidh, le cúnamh Dé, le Gaeilge agus le labhairt na Gaeilge.  Mo náire thú, a Aire, nach ndearna tú iarracht.  Tá a lán daoine sa tír seo agus níl mórán Ghaeilge acu.  Ach <Col N="2190" /> ó tháinig Liam Ó Murchú ar an aer agus chuir sé &ldquo;Trom agus Éatrom&rdquo; ar aghaidh. Mar a deireann daoine go minic i láthair na h-uaire &ldquo;na cúpla focal.&rdquo;  Tá an pobal a baint úsáid as.  Ionas nach bhfuil siad sásta cúpla focal a úsáid, ag an am gcéanna molaim go ndeineann daoine agus go ndéanfaidh daoine, agus go ndéanfaidh Aire Oideachais, iarracht agus beidh mise sásta.</P>
      <P>Sí an Ghaeilge an gné is tábhachtaí dár gcultúr.  Cuirfidh an Ghaeilge go mór le caractaer ár ndaoine.  Le dhá mhíle bliain anuas bhí sí á h-úsáid againne.  Tá sé sofheicthe gur cailliúint tubaisteach a bheadh dá rachadh an Ghaeilge i léig.  Sin é mo thuairimse agus sin é tuairim formhór na daoine sa tír seo, ach tá siad ag brath ar dhea-shampla.  Tá siad ag brath ar dhaoine atá in ann an sprid sin a chothú; agus a leathnú sa tír.  Sin an príomh chúis atá agamsa ag iarraidh ar an Aire as seo amach sa Teach seo iarracht a dhéanamh agus cúpla focal a rá as Gaeilge.  Molaim gur chuir sí amach na Meastacháin trí mheán na Gaeilge freisin.  Tá daoine taobh amuigh den Teach seo ag féachaint orainn agus ag iarraidh dea-shampla a fháil uainn.</P>
      <P>Cuirfidh an córas oideachais freisin go mór leis an nGaeilge a athbheochaint ar fud na tíre sa mhéid go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar eolas ag scata mór daoine agus go mbíonn siad ag iarraidh úsáid a bhaint as an méid atá acu.  Ach níl an Ghaeilge á labhairt sa Ghalltacht ach go fíor annamh agus níl sí á labhairt sa Teach seo ach go fíor annamh agus molaim ar Teachtaí agus iarraim ar na hAirí i bhfad níos mó úsáid a bhaint as.</P>

    <P>Sílim féin go raibh dearmadaí bunúsacha sa pholasaí oideachaisiúil ón tús.  Ar an gcéad dul síos bhíomar ag brath barraíocht ó na scoileanna agus is beag a rinneamar taobh amuigh de na scoileanna an aidhm sin a chur i gcrích. Rinneamar dearmad ar an bhfiric go ndeineann páistí aithris ar dhaoine fásta. Sin an cleachta is tábhachtaí go gcaithfimid féin a fhoghlaim: go ndeineann paístí aithris ar dhaoine fásta.  Má tá cúrsaí Gaeilge riachtanach sna scoileanna caithfimidne, mar dhaoine fásta, mar Teachtaí Dála agus mar Airí, an dea-shampla sin a theaspáint do na daoine <Col N="2191" /> óga sna scoileanna.  Bhí sé riachtanach go múinfí an Ghaeilge sna scoileanna ach bhí sé níos tábhachtaí atmosphere a cothú taobh amuigh den scoil a cuideoidh leis an aidhm tábhachtach seo a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>Gidh gurb é an aidhm a bhí againn an Ghaeilge a chur á labhairt shílfeá gurb é an toradh a bhí á dhith orainn ná scoláirí Gaeilge a dhéanamh de pháistí bunscoileanna, mar de réir dealramh bhí sé níos tábhachtaí go mbeadh páistí ábalta an tuisil ginideach a aithint ná a bheith ábalta abairt simplí a rá.  Sin an béim atá mise ag iarraidh a chur inniu anseo.  Tá an ré sin thart &mdash; an ré nuair a chuireamar an iomarca béime ar an gramadach.  Tá dearcadh na ndaoine i bhfad níos ciallmhara inniu.  Tá modhanna múinte ar fáil anois atá i bhfad níos éifeachtaí ná mar a bhíodh.  Tá béim ar labhairt na Gaeilge sna bunscoileanna ach tá an iomarca béim ar scríobh na Gaeilge sna meánscoileanna.

    <P>I appeal to Ministers and to Deputies to use more Irish.  I have read the Estimates speech and I regret the failure to mention the importance of Irish or to mention the promotion of Irish language projects.  I know they are there.  The Minister spoke about lip-service in another context.  The significance of having that reference in the Estimates is to put on the record of this House &mdash; if that record means anything &mdash; the commitment of the Minister and the Department to a particular issue.  I had hoped there would have been such a reference in the speech so that I would have the opportunity to comment favourably and positively on it. I ask that this matter be noted seriously so that in the future we can look forward to a more serious attempt by all of us to promote what is the basis of our culture and our tradition.</P>
    <P>I regretted the apprehension expressed by Deputy De Rossa when he pointed to the traditional aspects to which the Minister had referred.  I do not think we should be apprehensive about traditional <Col N="2192" /> aspects.  I would be one of the first to concede the need for change and ongoing development in our thinking on educational training and on the content of the curricula and syllabi.  Nevertheless, if we imply that is to discard what is traditional and what has been the basis of the values on which generations of Irish people have been nurtured&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>I noted with interest the statement of the Minister of her intention to set up a curriculum development board.  I know other Deputies have commented on this. I regretted the Minister's decision to establish the board on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by January 1984.  On the basis of commendable research done by the VEC and other organisations in the educational structure, I cannot see that it would cost an inordinate amount of money or that it would incur an inordinate amount of time by experts in the Department or outside the Department on whom the Minister might feel obliged to call upon to establish such a board.  If the Minister acknowledges that the board is necessary, why does she not set it up now?  We must keep abreast of the new needs that emanate from the industrial, commercial and other sectors as they need to be reflected in our educational thinking and training.  I ask the Minister, having deliberated on what has been said by Deputies here, to come back to the House within the next few weeks or at the earliest opportunity and tell us that this curriculum development board will be brought <Col N="2193" /> forward.  It should be established on a formal working basis, not next January but as early as possible in the next session of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I regret it was necessary for me to go along with the economies which the former Government had determined in the area of sport and community activities.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will have an opportunity at an early date to address herself to this matter.  I am questioning the content of her statement. The amount provided by Fianna Fáil in the Estimates for grants was £700,000.  I am asking the Minister to confirm at the earliest date if her provisions have taken almost £100,000 off that amount and if it now stands at £619,000? She could by way of nod or otherwise confirm that what I am saying is the situation.</P>

      <P>The Minister will <Col N="2194" /> have an opportunity of commenting on the matter at an early date. If that is the situation it is very serious.  The Government and the Opposition in an unanimous way have expressed the need for development of recreational and leisure facilities and they have given great emphasis to community games.  I think I am correct in saying that the former Coalition Government saw fit to appoint a co-ordinator for the community games and I commended that action at the time. Now, this Government have decided to slash £100,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
