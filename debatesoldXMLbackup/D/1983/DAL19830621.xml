    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he raised at the Council meeting of heads of state last week the continuing high level of interest rates; if he sought an explanation as to the reasons for this high level considering that inflation is now at a lower level in the western world than heretofore; if he demanded US action to bring about an immediate reduction of interest rates in order to help to commence economic revival; and if he will state the Government's policy and intentions on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The general view of Community Governments is that US interest rates are too high and should be reduced.  This view, which the Government share, has been conveyed on behalf of the Community, to the US authorities, most recently at the Williamsburg Summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I put it to the Taoiseach that Ireland could do more? Does the Taoiseach feel Ireland could give a lead at heads of state meetings like the one the Taoiseach recently attended, considering that at present Irish industry is crippled by high interest rates and that <Col N="2198" /> interest rates are now regarded as the biggest barrier to growth and employment in the Community?  Indeed, I will go so far as to say that many firms in this country now pay more in interest rates than they do in wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem posed by the high level of interest rates is very serious in this country and elsewhere.  It is determined by a number of factors, a principal one amongst which is the level of interest rates both nominal and real in the United States.  The view of our own Government and other Governments in Europe as conveyed to the United States Government at Williamsburg through the Community representation there and other heads of Governments of Community states was clearly that the American interest rates position is distorting the world economy.  Any possible pressure was put on the American Government at that meeting by countries who individually are more powerful and influential than we are, and collectively on our behalf through the Community representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that, on the face of it, there would appear to be serious political manipulation by the United States in the whole question of interest rates, considering that interest rates and inflation usually stay fairly close together?  There would seem to be a very strong political decision making process behind the present rates of interest, brought about mainly by the funding of the American deficit which is basically military expenditure. Countries like Ireland and other countries in the EEC generally are paying for the high level of military expenditure by the United States.  Considering the virtually unanimous view at the Williamsburg Summit about the high level of interest rates, does the Taoiseach not feel Ireland should give a stronger lead in the EEC and not adopt such a defeatist attitude towards this high level of interest rates which seems to be politically motivated based on the upcoming Presidential election in America?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2199" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have taken a very strong position on this.  In recent months one of our objectives was to ensure that the Community position as expressed at Williamsburg collectively and by certain member states would be expressed as cogently as possible to the United States. To a large degree that was done.  I cannot say that the Williamsburg meeting can be regarded as a success in all its outcomes.</P>
      <P>On the point made more directly by the Deputy, it is undoubtedly the case that the high level of American interest rates is connected with the level of the American budget deficit which is, I think, in terms of GNP per head almost as great as our own.  The impact of that on the interest rates situation there is a distortion. There are problems there which the American Government have to resolve as to how to manage their own economy. There is a limit to the extent to which we can tell them in detail how to resolve them.  They are aware of the general European view and the strength of that European view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach assure the House that he will continue to express the worry of the Irish Government about these levels of interest rates and make sure pressure is applied through the EEC on the Reagan administration in America?  If he will assure the House of that I will be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That question will continue to be a major preoccupation and priority of the Government and other EEC Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan's question asked specifically if the matter was raised at the recent heads of state meeting which took place after Williamsburg.  If it is a major priority of the Government as it should be, was it raised at that meeting and, if not, why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Mention was made of the issue.  As it was discussed so recently with the United States at Williamsburg, the centre of gravity, if you like of the discussions at the EEC meeting on economic <Col N="2200" /> and social issues was somewhat away from that point.  One of the things being looked at was the question of the internal coherence of Community policies themselves even in the face of the American situation.  I will be making a statement to-morrow about the European Council and drawing attention to a particular aspect of the Presidency statement at the end in regard to the economic and social situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If the social aspects received such priority at the heads of state meeting, one of the major social problems is unemployment caused by the high interest rates and surely the heads of state could have taken that opportunity to reiterate Europe's view of the American situation to the American President.  Was that done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has just been dealt with at Williamsburg with the Americans.  Clearly the preoccupation and concern of the European Governments remain because the problem remains and will continue to be expressed to the United States Government.</P>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the National Planning Board will produce a national economic plan; and, if, so, when it will be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Planning Board have been asked to prepare a draft medium term programme for the economy within the framework of which short term economic planning would proceed but I cannot, at this stage, say when it will be completed.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the Government have just received interim proposals from the National Planning Board on the more immediate economic and fiscal situation, which will be taken into account in the preparation of the Estimates and budgetary policy for 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed the Taoiseach brought a new word into his reply. He said the board were asked to prepare <Col N="2201" /> a &ldquo;programme&rdquo;.  I am trying to find out specifically will the Government be publishing a national economic plan in the normal meaning of that term.  Will there be a published plan and, if there is, will it be brought before the House?  Perhaps the Taoiseach would like to tell me about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work and preparation on that programme have begun although the immediate area to which we asked the planning board to direct their attention and to give their recommendations for the year ahead was in the context of medium-term prospects.  The preparation of the programme or plan, whatever name you like to give it &mdash; and we have played around with these names for 25 years now &mdash; will take some time and the question of how it will be processed is something that the Government have not yet considered.  I fail to see the advantage of a programme which is locked away in a drawer and which nobody can see. Whatever emerges will provide a basis for proposals to be put forward publicly and to be debated in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that there is an impression given in the Fine Gael-Labour programme for Government of December 1982, in which a new national planning board was mentioned, that the results of their activities would constitute a soundly based plan for national development?  Does he agree that the normal view of a national plan is an integrated, published document which spans a set number of years?  Are we going to have that type of plan or a sort of rolling programme of government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our immediate concern is to have set out an integrated plan or programme for something like four years ahead.  The question of whether that plan will be rolled over or brought <Col N="2202" /> to completion and replaced by another one is a matter for further consideration. Indeed, the views of Deputies on that matter will be of interest in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach envisage a plan for a specific number of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>When will that be ready?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot make a statement on that.  The planning board have begun consideration of it but we asked them to direct their attention in the first instance to recommendations as to what we have to do in 1984 in the context of their preliminary expectations for the years ahead.  The work of preparing a plan for the years ahead will now begin but I cannot give a date for its completion because the board have not gone far enough down the road for that to be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Dáil be discussing that plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the plan or programme is produced, it would be unreasonable for the Dáil not to discuss it although that practice did occur in 1960 when plans were produced but not debated in the Dáil.  It is one of the things to which the Dáil should give major attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that the planning board have made interim proposals which the Government are considering in the context of next year's budget.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that in the context of Dáil reform it would be a good idea if the proposals of the planning board were published and could be debated in the Dáil to assist the Government in the preparation of next year's budget?</P>

    <Col N="2203" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These proposals have only just been received and have not been given consideration by the Government, except in the most general way, so the question is somewhat premature.  As I have said, the proposals relate to the economic and fiscal situation, the Estimates and budgetary policy for 1984, and obviously proposals for 1984 will have to be considered by the Government and decisions taken on them before there is any question of publication, because they raise issues of a kind to which publicity is not given in advance of decisions being taken.</P>

      <P>The 1980 GATT arrangement for the import of cheddar cheese into the EEC <Col N="2205" /> formed part of the comprehensive outcome of the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations.  Any adjustment of the quantity of 9,000 tonnes provided for could only be made after renegotiations which would involve appropriate compensation to New Zealand and the other supplying countries concerned.  In the case of New Zealand such compensation would almost certainly involve concessions on imports of other agricultural products from that country into the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement was made in 1980 and I should like to point out that the primary problem is due to a drop in demand for cheddar cheese on the British market.  The imports from New Zealand are not a significant factor in the problems confronting the Irish cheddar industry at present.  The problem is also due to increased production by the British.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>Animal feed prices in Ireland tend to be somewhat higher than those in most other member states because we have only comparatively small quantities of native grain surplus to requirements and because of higher transport costs for imported supplies.</P>
      <P>In recent months the unusually high cost of animal feeds has arisen mainly from the exceptional demand brought about by unfavourable weather conditions in late spring and also early summer. With a view to alleviating the situation I secured as part of the EEC price package, that 50,000 tonnes of feed wheat from intervention stocks in Germany will be transferred to this country. The first shipments of this wheat should arrive here about 1 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the animal feed prices here are substantially rather than somewhat higher?  Producers, especially in poultry enterprises, are at a serious disadvantage because of these high prices.  Would it not be possible that the cheaper wheat be diverted into those areas where these poultry producers are experiencing such <Col N="2211" /> difficulties rather than distributed over the whole country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that that would be desirable.  Unfortunately transport costs play a significant part in our increased prices compared with the prices on the Continent and we have great difficulty in overcoming this. Also, the Dutch in particular are able to transport enormous quantities at one time into ports such as Rotterdam.  That gives them a significant trading advantage over us.  Our shipments are considerably smaller, which adds to the transport costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is time some kind of mechanism was set up within the EEC to ensure that no particular area or section is severely disadvantaged, such as has happened with the poultry industry in my own constituency?  These people are facing severe competition which is all due to the high price of grain.  It is time some mechanism was set up to aid these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

      <P>My Department have recently proposed to a number of other Departments, including the two Departments mentioned by the Deputy, that an inter-departmental committee should be established to examine urgently the many issues arising in relation to dog control, including the strengthening of measures to prevent attacks on farm livestock and organisational arrangements at local level.  In regard to the latter point, the County Wicklow arrangements and experience will provide useful pointers to the committee on its deliberations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be set up shortly.  There is a substantial grant available from the Department of the Environment for setting up dogs homes and shelters.  Some local authorities have availed of this grant.  In County Longford they did so last year as they did in Waterford. A dog shelter will be opened shortly in Waterford city.  We need one of these shelters in every county.  I can only appeal to local authorities to avail of the very generous 50 per cent grant available from the Department of the Environment. Perhaps there would be additional financial support from other bodies in various counties, particularly the farming community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 to 25, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am at present engaged in a comprehensive review of all aspects of land policy, including the proposals contained in the White Paper, &ldquo;Land Policy&rdquo; published in December 1980.  The purpose is to secure the optimum use of our land resources through an integrated programme which will facilitate the movement of underutilised land into the hands of those willing and able to work it to full capacity.</P>
      <P>I have no plans for winding up the Land Commission as I believe they can still have a central role to play in the operation of land policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a retirement scheme would be central to any land structure change and does he expect to get funding from the EEC for the purpose of increasing substantially the retirement pension?  Would the Minister agree that this is central to any scheme to be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that a farm retirement pension scheme is a vital ingredient where land mobility is <Col N="2240" /> concerned.  I am currently looking at ways and means of improving the situation. We are all aware that the last retirement pension scheme was not very successful. At present the EEC Commission are also looking at certain proposals and as soon as they come to hand we will consider how they would operate here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that there are no plans for winding up the Land Commission.  There had been rumours about its winding up for a number of years.  Has the Minister any plans for restructuring the Land Commission or the procedures or purpose of the Land Commission?  Does the Minister think it still serves a useful purpose to buy up and distribute parcels of land here and there when there is a wide demand among young farmers all over the country for land for leasing?  Does the Minister intend to restructure the Land Commission to provide land for leasing rather than for redistribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>An in-depth reappraisal of the activities of the Land Commission is under way.  It is my intention to give them a new direction.  This country badly needs a new land policy.  While I said in my reply that it is not proposed to disband the Land Commission, it is certainly proposed to give them a new role in order to bring them more into line with the aspirations of farmers in the eighties.  Many aspects must be considered such as the importance of mediumand long-term leasing of land, the concept of group purchase schemes for small farmers and the whole question of land rearrangement and the division of commonages. I am deeply invloved with all these matters in order to ensure greater land mobility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation which is proposed deals with land leasing and the protection of farmers who are leasing to tenants in order to ensure that the tenant has only the type of rights that <Col N="2241" /> will be agreed between the farmer and the tenant on the date that the contract is made.  The legislation will be brought before the House during the next session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to now the Land Commission would not distribute land to landless people.  Is it envisaged that land will now be made available to such people with certain qualifications?  Will the Minister consult with farm organisations such as the Farm Apprenticeship Board, the IFA and the ICMSA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the second part of the question, I have had detailed discussions with all interested parties on many occasions on all aspects of land policy.  There is great expertise on matters relating to land among the staff of the Land Commission and it would be very appropriate in the future if this would be harnessed in the proper manner. With an imaginative approach and the expertise available in the local offices we can have a very useful land policy in the future.</P>

      <P>What role does the Minister see the Land Commission playing in this new policy?  How does the Minister consider that group purchase schemes will function?  Does he see the Land Commission playing a part in assisting these groups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of group purchase is, in my view, a good one.  I believe it should work all over the country.  Heretofore small farmers did not come together to buy estates jointly. I have issued instructions to the area offices of the ILC to give every possible help to such groups.  For obvious reasons inspectors will not be involved in the formation of the groups but once a group has been formed and has purchased land, the ILC staff will give every help and encouragement in the provision of maps and the allocation and division of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we recently passed a Bill giving extra money to the Land Commission to acquire land, I would ask why land is not now being acquired.  Are we to take it that the acquisition of land by the Land Commission has ceased?  Are the Land Commission drawing up the register we have heard about whereby only suitable applicants can purchase land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The land bonds which we spoke about in the House some months ago are being used for the most part to pay for land already acquired.  It takes almost two years from the serving of a section 40 order until the land bonds are made available.  We were providing for the acquisition of land which had been going on for 18 months or two years.  It is the intention of the Land Commission to hold their acquisition powers so that under certain conditions land could be acquired, but the new policy will mean that for a variety of reasons the Land Commission will not become involved in the normal traditional acquisitions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be a separate question but in so far as it relates to the relief of congestion, which is the traditional way that the Land Commission have been dividing land, the House is well aware of the criteria used &mdash; size of farm, size of family, distance from a particular estate, whether there is offfarm employment, age of farmer and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the system has worked over the years, there has been. However, for obvious reasons it is not a black and white case, because it is well <Col N="2243" /> known that most families have more or less the same standards in so far as they have the same amount of land.  Land Commission inspectors often make decisions in favour of one or the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will intervene in the dispute between Dublin County Council and water inspectors employed by the council so as to ensure that there is no further disruption in the water supply in County Dublin and in particular in south Dublin which has suffered severe disruption in its water supply since Thursday last and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute between Dublin County Council and the unions representing assistant water and sewer inspectors employed by the council concerns the effective date for payment of a special pay increase awarded by the Labour Court to these employees.</P>
      <P>The agreement on pay in the public service, as amended, and to which the unions concerned are a party, provides for payment of 40 per cent of the increase from 1 October 1983 and for payment of the balance, with retrospection to 1 January 1983, at a date yet to be decided. The unions are seeking payment with effect from 24 May 1979.</P>
      <P>The question of the date was examined by the Labour Court which indicated that under the terms of the public service pay agreement there was no scope for recommending a date earlier than 1 January 1983.</P>
      <P>I understand that the dispute has today been referred to the monitoring committee provided for in the pay agreement. As the normal industrial relations machinery is available, it would not be helpful or appropriate for me to intervene in the dispute.</P>

Will the Tánaiste give an assurance that <Col N="2245" /> he, the appropriate Minister, will sanction any recommendation made by the monitoring committee because there is a threat that this strike will extend to the other services of the county council?

Bearing in mind the type of weather we are experiencing this is an extremely dangerous situation.  This is not good enough.  Is the Minister doing his best, because he said he is waiting for talks to take place?  Will the Minister assure the people in County Dublin that there will not be any further breakdown?  Has the Minister given any thought to restoring supplies while the talks are in progress?  It is not good enough to say that he has to wait until the talks have concluded.

    <P>In moving this and other motions before the House today, I am honouring the commitment given in the Programme for Government to reform our parliamentary institutions to make them relevant and effective.  You may recall it was promised that:</P>
    <P>The Committee system will be greatly extended.  In addition to Committees already in existence, others will be established to provide a debate on the main areas of public policy in an atmosphere that would be much less party political than that which exists in debates held on the floor of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am also responding to the debate which we had here in January and February on the subject of Dáil reform when the House resolved that its proceedings should be reformed to improve efficiency and its control over the public finances.</P>
    <P>I would like, at this stage, to acknowledge formally the helpful role played by the Opposition, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, in the advancement of Dáil reform in general and these new committees in particular. Over the past few months there have been numerous contacts between the Whips, Deputy Seán Barrett, Minister of State, and Deputy Bertie Ahern, and between the Leader of the Opposition and myself.  All our discussions were carried out in a friendly and helpful atmosphere. The House will be aware that the Opposition have proposed the establishment of further Oireachtas committees, details of which are on our Order Paper as Private Members' motions.  I have indicated to the Leader of the Opposition that the Government are giving urgent detailed consideration to these proposals and it is my intention to have the Government's formal response in the near future.</P>
    <P>In moving to establish the Committee on Public Expenditure the Government are aiming directly to improve the <Col N="2365" /> method by which the Dáil exercises its responsibility in the voting of public money.  The new Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure will complement the work of the existing Committee on Public Accounts and will involve Dáil Deputies to a much greater extent than in the past in reviewing the effectiveness of and justification for ongoing programmes of public expenditure.  The committee will not be directly concerned with the annual Estimates process but with the longer term review of spending programmes in any area of public expenditure they so choose.  It is open to them to look at, for example, the operation of the health service, in terms of the level of health care received for the money spent, in a given period, say, the last five years.</P>
    <P>The committee will be able to propose cost effective alternatives which will meet the objectives of Government policy but in a manner which uses less public money, which means less taxpayers' money.  While I have used the health service here by way of illustration, there are many areas of public expenditure which can be selected by this new committee. On completion of one review, the committee would report to the Dáil and then move on to another area of expenditure. As I will indicate it will be possible for it to be conducting more than one inquiry at once because the committee will be able to operate by way of sub-committee if it sees fit.  It would be my hope that after five years or so, the Public Expenditure Committee would have reviewed the major areas of Government spending so that a reasonably regular scrutiny of all expenditure by elected representatives will become a permanent feature of political life in the country.</P>
    <P>To enable the committee to provide themselves with the necessary information needed to do their work, provision has been made for them to hire consultants or other specialists to assist them.  At present much of the information that comes to Members of this House about the operation of public bodies, comes from either the public bodies themselves or through the medium of the civil service.  The availability of specialists will act as a counter-balance to the standard <Col N="2366" /> information flow.  While the committee are being given a general power to hire consultants to assist their work I hope that they will use this power sparingly owing to cost implications.  It is my belief that the committee will be able to obtain much information on a voluntary basis from public spirited individuals who will be happy to put facts before the committee. In the House of Commons in Westminster it has been found that much useful information is given to select committees by academics and other experts in this way.  This would help to reduce the expense of providing consultancy services.</P>
    <P>An important feature of this committee is that much of their work will be done in public.  Meetings will be held in public and evidence will be given in public. Obviously, when the committee are deliberating a report they may wish to do so in private but as far as evidence is concerned, I would hope that the committee would see fit not to move into private session except where this is absolutely necessary.  It is very important that the public be aware of the valuable committee work of Dáil Deputies in this area.</P>
    <P>Specifically included in the terms of reference is the review of expenditure by non-commercial State-sponsored bodies. While the commercial State-sponsored bodies are catered for by a Joint Committee of both Houses, the performance of State agencies in the non-commercial field has not previously been the subject of systematic Oireachtas review. It is my intention that the Public Expenditure Committee will either directly, or more likely by way of sub-committee, review the operations of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies either individually or as part of an overall review of a particular area of Government spending.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with the Leader of the Opposition, I have amended the terms of reference of the Committee in relation to the examination of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  Where previously the term &ldquo;non-commercial State-sponsored Bodies&rdquo; was used the term &ldquo;State-Sponsored Bodies not included in the Schedule to the Order establishing the Joint Committee on <Col N="2367" /> Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies&rdquo; has been substituted.  This change makes the distinction &mdash; sought by the Leader of the Opposition &mdash; between the work of the two committees in relation to State-sponsored bodies more clear and takes account of the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition in this regard.</P>
    <P>In addition to the hiring of consultants, the committee will be empowered to send for persons, papers and records to assist them in their work.  Another significant provision is the presentation of an annual progress report to the Dáil by the committee on its activities and plans.  This will allow the Dáil to monitor the work of the committee and to know of the future plans of the committee.  Such an annual assessment is necessary in view of the longer-term nature of the work of the committee.</P>
    <P>I will move separately a motion providing that reports of the Committee on Public Expenditure will be automatically debated in this House within a specific period after their presentation.  For too long committee reports&mdash;once produced after considerable effort&mdash;have tended to be lodged in the Library and not considered by the House.  The reports of the Public Expenditure Committee may be very relevant in providing new thinking on the way in which we organise our public spending.  When such a debate takes place in this House a suitable opportunity will be available for all Members to discuss issues which intimately affect the lives of our people.  Furthermore, the report of the Committee on Public Expenditure will provide a direct Parliamentary influence on the central question of the provision of public services.</P>
    <P>Once this committee is established, it is very important that it sets out for itself a basic plan of its activities for the coming years.  It should also examine the arrangements for its meetings so that the public can best be informed of its work.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, I intend to review the operations of this committee in about one year's time.  As with all experiments, it cannot be expected that all will go exactly as planned.  However, <Col N="2368" /> the major and most difficult step is now being taken and only improvements can follow.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to the other committees I should like to mention one which I had hoped would be discussed here today along with the new ones being discussed now&mdash;the Committee on Public Expenditure about which I have just been speaking, the Committee on Legislation and the Committee on Small Businesses &mdash; that is the Committee on Women's Affairs.  The House will probably be aware that there have been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;discussions between the Opposition and the Government on this matter.  This is motion No. 10 on today's Order Paper in the name of the Minister of State, Deputy Nuala Fennell.  I understand that the Opposition have some suggestions to make in this regard.  Following discussions with the Opposition Whip this morning it was decided that it would be best if we could take these into account in framing the final motion to be presented to the House.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it has not been possible to proceed with that committee today.  But it is the intention to proceed with it this day week, when Deputy Fennell will be moving it.  I am sure that she will be anxious &mdash; as will be the Government &mdash; to take into account the suggestions of the Opposition in regard to their terms of reference which I understand will be constructive, as have been their suggestions in respect of the other committees.</P>
      <P>If I may turn now to the Joint Committee on Legislation.  I am aware of the consensus which exists in this House regarding the need for improvements in the legislative process.  This consensus was clearly illustrated in the many valuable contributions made by Deputies in the debate on Dáil reform earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary function of this committee is to modify various aspects of the legislative process by improving the method of input of Members of this House and of the Seanad and by providing for <Col N="2369" /> greater participation in the legislative process by the general public.  What is notable in the functions of this committee is the proposal that investigative hearings in public will be a regular feature of its work.  The committee will have power to invite written and, if considered necessary, oral representations from individuals and interest groups outside the Oireachtas on Bills or other legislative proposals referred to it; a legislative proposal could include, for example, draft heads of a Bill as well as the circulation of the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>I envisage this aspect of the terms of reference of the new committee as being a major step forward in reforming the legislative process.  It will pave the way towards the establishment of a direct link between those formulating and processing legislation and those members of the public who will be affected by it when enacted.  In assimilating the views of outside parties and in presenting the results of these hearings in its report to both Houses, the committee will provide Members with valuable information which will be of help to them in their assessment of the legislative measure. The terms of reference provide that a Bill or other legislative proposal, other than measures relating to the budget, can only be referred to the Joint Committee on Legislation with the consent of a member of the Government.  However, it is my hope that the work of the committee, over the next year or so, will prove to be of such value that the selection of Bills for public examination ultimately will devolve to the committee itself.  It is envisaged that consultation will take place between Government and Opposition before any Bill or other legislative proposal is referred to the committee for the taking of evidence or for a public hearing under paragraph (1) (a) of the motion establishing the committee.</P>
    <P>It is my concern that the role of the backbench Deputy be given its due recognition and importance.  Central to the success of representative democracy is the level at which Deputies make known the interest of the public which they represent.  Accordingly, provision is being made that, subject to the prior <Col N="2370" /> approval of the committee, any Member of either House who wishes to do so will be able to participate fully in any investigative hearings.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might amplify that. Obviously the committee will be holding hearings on a wide range of legislation in respect of some of which there will be members who will be particularly specialised. One value of this procedure&mdash; whereby a Member other than a member of the Committee on Legislation can participate in the hearings &mdash; for example, will be to allow the spokesman of the Opposition Party to participate in the hearings on a Bill which affects his area of responsibility, even though he might not be an actual member of that committee. Naturally enough, there will have to be some control on such activity, hence discretion is given to the committee in this matter as to who they should allow participate in addition to their normal membership.</P>
    <P>The opinion has been expressed in this House that if in the past we had outside contributions to the legislative process of the type envisaged some of the laws on our Statute Book would be somewhat different in detail and workings and somewhat better.  There are few Deputies who would disagree with this, and I believe that the Joint Committee on Legislation, through the investigative hearing process, will help to make for better law in the future.</P>
    <P>The new committee will combine the functions of the existing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills, and the Seanad Committee on Statutory Instruments.  It is, I think, important that a consolidation of our committee system should carry with it a streamlining of the functions of other committees.  While it was the intention to incorporate the functions as well of the Committees on Private Bills in the new Legislative Committee, the issues involved here are very complex and arise only once or twice every five years or so. Accordingly, those functions, that is the ones in regard to Private Bills, will remain separate from the new committee.</P>
    <P>In adopting the functions of the Seanad Committee on Statutory Instruments, the <Col N="2371" /> new committee will be fulfilling an extremely important function in its own right.  However, many Deputies have expressed a sense of dissatisfaction as to the validity of a committee which reviews the making of statutory instruments but which only has power &mdash; as is the case with statutory instruments at present &mdash; to accept or reject the instrument.  Under our present procedures amendments cannot be recommended.  I believe that the practice of rejecting a total instrument which may be unacceptable in one article only is an archaic and unnecessary one. This is why the new committee, in addition to the power to recommend annulment, are being given power to recommend amendments.  The committee will also be in a position to require written and oral submissions from the Department or instrument-making authority involved so as to aid them in their consideration.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Legislation will also have a function in examining and reporting to both Houses their opinion on the reports of the Law Reform Commission. In including this provision in their terms of reference, I have sought to provide a forum in the Oireachtas in which law reform matters can be considered. The type of assessment and subsequent reporting will lead us inevitably to the point where various reports and recommendations of the commission will be put to the use for which they are intended, namely, as the basis for the formulation of legislation.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference also include the general function that the committee keep the law under review and bring forward proposals for law reform.  This would be normal for such a committee and will enable members of the committee to look at matters which they may consider relevant beyond what has been considered by the Law Reform Commission to date.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals for the Joint Committee it will be possible to combine both the Dáil and Seanad Committee Stages of a Bill.  This provision will not, of course, apply to Money Bills.  The advantage which such a system will confer is that, in particular with highly technical <Col N="2372" /> Bills, a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Legislation can act instead of a Committee Stage on the floor of the Dáil and Seanad.  Both Houses will then be able to consider the measure again in Report Stage.  However, nothing in this resolution will prevent this House or the Seanad from exercising its right to have its own Committee Stage if it sees fit.  It will only be with the agreement of both Houses that the Joint Committee on Legislation will deal with Committee Stage of any particular Bill.  This provision should not alone expedite legislation but will permit serious technical consideration of a measure outside the time constraints which can exist in both Houses.</P>
    <P>As a rider to the proposal that the Joint Committee deal with the Third Stage of certain Bills, it has been provided that either the Minister or Minister of State responsible for any proposal under examination will be an <i>ex officio</i> member of the committee for that purpose.  In addition, the committee will be able to draw on the special expertise of individual Deputies for detailed Committee Stage examination of Bills as provision is made for the participation of any Member of either House in this process.</P>
    <P>There is a general power included in the terms of reference for the appointment of sub-committees.  This will enable the committee to divide up their work on a rational basis, appointing sub-committees to deal with the Third Stage of Bills, other sub-committees to deal with specific investigative hearings, others to deal with law reform, others to deal with statutory instruments.  However, all reports of sub-committees will be submitted to the Dáil via the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would expect that Members will co-operate and participate fully in the operations of this committee.  I believe that it has the potential to be the agent of very significant reform in our parliamentary institutions.  It is my intention that the committee will operate initially on an experimental basis and that Members will have a full opportunity to debate the usefulness of the committee in their operations after a period of, say, 12 months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2373" /> Finally, I wish to refer to the Joint Committee on Small Business.  The Programme for Government provides for the establishment of a committee of the Dáil and Seanad to assist in the development of the small business sector of the economy, and make such recommendations as they think necessary.  This committee will comprise nine Members of the Dáil and seven Members of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>The experience worldwide is that small firms show greater adaptability and resilience than many larger firms to the vicissitudes of the business and trade cycles. Members of the Oireachtas are now being given the opportunity to apply their collective talents and wisdom to the question of developing a more dynamic small industry sector in Ireland.  In particular I would envisage that the committee will devote their time to: an assessment of the performance of the small business sector; the identification of obstacles to small business development; and the development of recommendations for new policies and programmes.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference have been constructed in such a way as to allow the committee the widest possible scope in their deliberations on the small business sector and to come forward with proposals on many areas crucial to the development of this sector.  Deputies are being asked to put forward proposals in respect of the development of Irish small industry which, despite its progress to date, still lags behind that in other member states of the EEC.</P>
    <P>At present there are 5,500 manufacturing companies in Ireland.  Of these 82 per cent are small firms employing up to 50 people.  Medium sized firms, 50-200 employees, account for 14 per cent with the balance of 4 per cent being accounted for by large firms employing 200 workers or more.</P>
    <P>Following the launch on a pilot basis in 1967, the IDA's Small Industry Programme was extended nationwide in 1969.  In 1978 SFADCo were given a special mandate for the intensive development of small industry in the mid-west region.  The regime of State assistance has been adapted and modified throughout <Col N="2374" /> these years to respond to the growing and varied needs of the small industry sector and the increasing entrepreneurial skills of Irish management.  In 1978 the Enterprise Development Programme was introduced and additional incentives in the form of loan guarantees and interest subsidies were made available for first-time entrepreneurs possessing managerial and technical skills who had not formerly owned a business of their own. More recent developments include the assignment of a small industry specialist to each of the IDA's regional offices and the initiation of a new concentrated small industry programme on a pilot basis in Cork city and the non-designated areas of the country.</P>
    <P>I would expect that the proposals which the committee will bring forward will be well developed &mdash; merely putting down what might be laudable objectives will not represent progress.  Accordingly thought and effort will be required of each committee member.</P>
    <P>A brief word now about the terms of reference of the committee.  The situation has developed where for administrative expediency the definition of small industry in Ireland differs between State agency and State agency and between official and private industrial organisations. A need for a common set of criteria is apparent.</P>
    <P>I am particularly conscious that the successful development of first-time enterprises is strongly influenced by the ability of the entrepreneur to receive the necessary loan finance on attractive terms for either working capital or fixed asset investment.  I am not altogether happy that the banking community adopt the right approach to the provision of loan finance for industry.  While it must be recognised that the banks have a responsibility to their shareholders, they also have a wider responsibility to the community, particularly in these recessionary times, to act as a catalyst for the promotion of enterprise.  The time has come for an abandonment of the traditional conservative approach to the provision of finance for &ldquo;risk&rdquo; enterprises.  I am at present engaged in discussions with the banks about the possibility of providing <Col N="2375" /> venture capital type finance for industry. I have also met the Stock Exchange in this regard.</P>
    <P>The importance of research and development and innovation in industry cannot be overstressed.  It is imperative that the necessary mechanisms and incentives should be available here in order to ensure that Irish small business can participate in any financing scheme proposed at EEC level.</P>
    <P>Ireland is highly dependent on exports for continued economic growth and, accordingly, it is necessary that the range of export finance schemes already available be fine-tuned to ensure that Irish small business will not be hampered from benefiting from the export opportunities arising from the upturn in the world economy predicted for later this year.</P>
    <P>I am particularly conscious that, in addition to attracting overseas investment, future wealth and job creation will depend to a large extent on the exploitation of the opportunities for linkages between indigenous small industry and the medium and large overseas industries attracted to locate in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The potential of the sector cannot be fully utilised if the management structure of companies is not adequate to the challenge facing industry in the present competitive environment.  Management retraining schemes will form a crucial part of any successful development effort in this sector in the coming decade.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is establishing a Committee of Inquiry which is to recommend a simplified tax regime for family businesses.  The House would, no doubt, welcome the Joint Committee's observations on this work.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is particularly appropriate that this Joint Committee should be established in 1983 &mdash; the year designated by the European Parliament as the year of the small and medium-sized enterprise.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to draw the attention of the House to the following printing errors which occur on the Order Paper:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2376" /> Motion No. 7, column 2464, paragraph 7, should read:</P>
    <P>That any Member of either House may attend and be heard in the proceedings of the Joint Committee or a sub-committee in relation to a matter comprehended by paragraph (1) (a) subject to the prior consent of the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;due&rdquo; was placed here in error.</P>
    <P>Motion No. 9, column 2467, paragraph 5, should read:</P>
    <P>That the quorum of the Joint Committee shall be four of whom at least one shall be a Member of Dáil Éireann and one shall be a Member of Seanad Éireann and that the quorum of each sub-committee shall be three at least one of whom shall be a Member of Dáil Éireann and one a Member of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>The paragraph as it appears on the Order Paper does not make sense.</P>
    <P>Motion No. 9, column 2,467, paragraph 6 should read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Resolution&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;Order&rdquo; in line 3.</P>
    <P>This is only an expediency motion, the order for the Small Business Committee will come around after the Seanad has discussed the expediency motion.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank all those who have been of assistance in getting the process of Dáil reform this far.  Already I expressed my appreciation of the constructive approach adopted by the Opposition in the many consultations I have had with them.  I spoke of the Government's anxiety to look constructively at the proposals which the Opposition recently made in this area.  The House and the country at large may not be aware that considerable progress has been made in other matters and, of course, proposals for Dáil reform are also proceeding in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. That committee are now meeting on a <Col N="2377" /> weekly basis to consider various proposals to improve and to streamline the procedures of the House.  There has been a positive and constructive attitude in the committee towards the proposals in relation to these committees.  The extent of the valuable committee work this House already does is greatly underestimated. That work will now be enhanced by the broadening of the scope provided for in these committees.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest hope that it will be possible for the various media, press and otherwise, to give suitable prominence to the work of the committees, to show the very valuable role being played by public representatives and the role that will be played by them to an extended degree in the future as members of the new committees to be established.  As the House is aware it is the intention of the Government in due course, after consultation with other parties in the House, to introduce broadcasting here.  I do not wish to prejudge matters but it will be discussed in due time.  I am not making this a substantive issue now.  I merely say that it would be of assistance in drawing attention and public notice to the valuable work Deputies already do on committees as well as here in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House wish to give qualified, cautious approval to these committees which the Government are proposing to establish. That approval is subject to some particular conditions which I and my colleagues will mention later.  We are anxious to discharge our role as a constructive Opposition.  In that regard we recognise the enthuasism of this Minister for the committee system, which he now intends to expand greatly.  His personal enthuasism is perhaps the explanation for the fact that as Minister for Industry and Energy it is he who is bringing these proposals before us.  One would have thought that at the present time the Minister would have a full briefcase of work as Minister for Industry and Energy, particularly in view of the unemployment situation, and that the area of Dáil reform would be left to somebody else.  However, we accept that he has taken a personal interest in <Col N="2378" /> this and we are quite happy to accept that these proposals should be put forward by him.</P>
      <P>I want to make it very clear what our specific concern is because as usual attempts have been made to misinterpret our position.  Indeed, I understand that this morning on a radio programme a fairly definite attempt was made to misconstrue our approach to this exercise by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>By me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It was a radio programme dealing with our attitude and our response to the Minister's proposals.  A very well-known programme presenter does not very often hesitate to misinterpret Fianna Fáil's position on any issue, if he can do so.  As the Opposition, we want any innovation to make this House more effective to succeed, and it is precisely because we want any new departure to succeed that we are voicing concern and reservation about these proposals.  I am grateful to the Minister for acknowledging that our approach has been a constructive one.  The Minister has been entirely co-operative in coming to the Opposition and explaining to us what he has in mind and justifying his different proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is simply because we want to make sure that anything done in this House will be done to improve it and not to its detriment that we want to make sure that if there are to be committees they will work and function effectively and efficiently. That is why in all conscience we have to voice some serious reservations about the proposals&mdash;more to the extent of the Minister's proposals than the quality of them.  If all the committees the Government have proposed to date, plus our committees, were to be set up there would be 20 committees.  I will deduct from that the Committee of Selection, that peculiarly routine mechanical committee which do not have any great significance or importance.  That would leave us with 19 committees.  You could take an average attendance of ten members and that means that 190 Deputies and Senators would be involved.  If all the <Col N="2379" /> quorums were to be supplied by Deputies, and you have to envisage that because of the nature of the Seanad, you would have 190 Deputies attending committees, and when you take out the Government and the Ministers of State there are only about 130 Deputies left.  In all seriousness, I think the Minister must have a suspicion that he is overloading the committee system.</P>
    <P>It has been my experience, and it is a practical common-sense experience over a reasonably long period of years in this House, that it is not an easy matter to get these committees to function.  I know a lot of commentators and people who do not know the realities think this is a wonderful system which will solve all our problems.  I know, and many of my colleagues know, that the problem is to get Deputies to man these committees once they are established.  That is a very genuine worry I have.  I would have preferred to see a programme whereby a limited number of committees would be established and we would get them under way and working effectively and efficiently and then move on to one or two more and so on.  I fear that the Minister in his enthusiasm may be proceeding with this system in a way which, in the end, will not be entirely satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The question of the press and publicity is very important.  Our newspapers, because of the many constraints and burdens on them, find it very difficult to service this House as it sits from day to day.  For instance, Private Members' Time is very rarely adequately reported. By the time Private Members' Time comes around in the evening, whatever sort of staffing arrangements the newspapers and RTE have, very often there is only one member of the press on the Gallery, presumably taking notes for all of his colleagues.  That is a regrettable fact.  I am not blaming anybody for it, but it is a sample outcome of the workings of this House and the demands it makes on the press that only a limited amount of our affairs can be fully and adequately reported.</P>
    <P>Now we are going to have a large number of committees which, I understand, <Col N="2380" /> should be available to the press.  I doubt very much if the press will be able to give these committees the coverage we would all like to see and which will be essential if they are to operate efficiently and in the way we would like and if they are going to be able to make the contributions we would all like them to make.</P>
    <P>Those are two fairly practical aspects of these proposals which I do not think the Minister has fully adverted to at this stage and I fear the whole proposal may not be as effective as we would all wish it to be for that reason.  My personal view is that this Chamber is the place where we should do our political business.  I accept that in some limited areas, which are of a non-party nature, a joint committee can do useful work but, by and large, the real political debate and discussion, in my view, should take place in this House and be fully reported to the general public.  In so far as the superfluity of these committees would seem to encroach on that basic principle to which I adhere, then I am somewhat unhappy about them.</P>
    <P>Basically decisions have to be taken by the Government.  Those of us who have been in Government know that is the reality.  We can get things examined by interdepartmental committees, or committees of this House or committees of any other sort, but the running of the country, particularly the running of the economy, is a matter for clear hard decisions by the Government.  I do not want us to indulge in some sort of self-deception that by setting up these committees we are going to avoid the hard crunch difficult decisions because they have been discussed in some committee perhaps on a non-party basis.  I want to make the point that it is the business of the Government to govern and it is the business of the Government to take the executive decisions that have to be taken, and that we should not think for one moment that we are going to obviate that hard central need by establishing these committees.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect about which I worry, although perhaps with all-party consultation and a reasonably intelligent and mature approach we can get over this difficulty.  We in the Opposition, and I <Col N="2381" /> am sure the Government backbenchers too, find the procedures in this House restrictive from time to time.  We try to shuffle off those restrictions as best as we can through one sort of subterfuge or parliamentary device or another, but nevertheless they are there.  The very nature of our business means we must have rules and regulations and we must have debates confined within particular limits.  I am afraid these committees may restrict the freedom of Deputies either on the Opposition benches or the Government backbenches rather than the reverse.  I could very easily envisage a situation developing where Ministers being questioned will take refuge in the answer that that matter is being discussed, has been referred to such and such a committee and that he is awaiting the outcome of the committee.  I want to tell the younger Members of this House that I have seen that happen; in fact, I would go so far as to say that I might have been guilty on the Government benches of resorting to that device from time to time.  Unless we are very careful, with 19 committees operating, it could very seriously restrict the scope of debate and Question Time in this House.</P>
    <P>These are aspects which I feel may not have been fully adverted to by the Minister and the Government.  I would like to mention briefly the status of the different committees as we see them now. The Committee of Selection, the Committee of Procedures and Privileges and the Committee of Public Accounts have been established and are operating.  The process of establishing the Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, the Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EEC and the Joint Services Committee are before us today for the final stamp of approval. I do not intend to take up the time of the House talking about them because we have more or less accepted them.  The Minister is proposing <i>de novo</i> the Committee on Public Expenditure, the Committee on Legislation and the Committee on Small Businesses.  I want to say a few brief words about them.</P>
    <P>I do not know that the Committee on Legislation will be very valuable but I would not be strong enough in my view <Col N="2382" /> to oppose it.  It is one of the committees to which I give qualified approval but I would emphasise that our agreement to this committee is very much on the basis that the reference of any particular piece of legislation to this committee will be by agreement.  The Minister has gone a fair way to meet me in that regard, but I am not happy that he has gone far enough.</P>
    <P>What I would like to see developing is a situation whereby the reference of a piece of legislation to the Committee on Legislation would be by agreement with the Opposition in the same way as the Business of the House is agreed from day to day.  We are entitled to that.  If we proceed on those lines the Committee on Legislation will work much better than it otherwise would.</P>
    <P>I want to put that reservation very strongly to the Minister.  We feel he should give us a more clear affirmation of his acceptance of the principle that Bills, and particularly important Bills, can be referred to this committee only by agreement between the parties.  Otherwise legislation of very keen political interest could be shuffled off to one of these committees and perhaps the political confrontation which should take place would not necessarily take place.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Expenditure worries me a little because I am not quite sure how it will operate.  The Minister kindly accepted one of my proposals with regard to the terms of reference, although he did not accept the other.  I am not too happy about the terms of reference.  I would have preferred them to be much broader in their import.  I wonder has the Minister clearly thought out the need for this committee as a separate committee from the Committee of Public Accounts.  Traditionally the Committee of Public Accounts has had a historic role.  It looks at expenditure after that expenditure has been undertaken.  It examines that expenditure to see whether or not it has been justified and properly undertaken.</P>
    <P>Apparently this committee will be looking at ongoing Government expenditure. Would it not be possible to combine the two functions?  Let us look again at the practicalities.  Apparently the secretary <Col N="2383" /> of a Department and his panoply of officials will go to the Committee of Public Accounts and give all the explanations and justifications for items of historic expenditure.  The same set of officials will go to another committee where they will be asked to justify and elaborate on current expenditure.  I am not too sure that this division needs to be made, because even the expenditure which is examined by the Committee of Public Accounts in an historic context is still ongoing.  Perhaps that is something that could be looked at: whether or not this new Committee on Expenditure should not be merged with the Committee of Public Accounts, with one committee being given a mandate to review all expenditure historic, ongoing and future.</P>
    <P>There again I should like to enter a caveat and ask: who ultimately is responsible for expenditure?  Are not the Government?  Take an item of expenditure on the health services.  Is it not really a function of the Government whether that expenditure should be engaged in? Are not the Government ultimately responsible to the House and to the people for that expenditure?  I wonder is this committee being placed in an invidious and unreal position if it is being asked to take decisions on ongoing Government expenditure.  I suppose only time will tell whether this committee will meet the Minister's expectations.  My own view is that it will be very difficult indeed to get a quorum to attend a meeting of this committee.</P>
    <P>I have no great faith in the Minister's Small Businesses Committee, as he knows.  Any average sized businessman could give a very quick answer about his problems and difficulties today.  He would almost certainly say the cause was Government interference at every level of his business and the fact that he is completely burdened with impositions from the Government in one shape or another, from taxation to the filling in of forms, and a whole battery of what he sees as interference by the Government or the local authorities with his capacity to run his own business as he would like to run it.</P>

      <P>We have a Committee on Building Land which is operating.  We have agreed to it.  There is probably a social need to look into that.  I do not see why the Government could not have done what Deputy Kelly suggested and taken a decision on it in its own right. The Committee on Marital Breakdown is the subject of discussion between ourselves and the Government at the moment.  I am quite optimistic that that committee can come into being without any undue difficulty or undue delay.</P>
      <P>The Committee on Women's Rights is another committee which we are prepared to accept in principle.  We would like to have some discussion with the Government people concerned on the exact terms of reference.  I do not think we will have any great difficulty about that committee either.  The Committee on Development Co-operation is also on the way.  Subject to some doubts about the efficacy of these committees in some cases, and some doubts about their usefulness in others, we are prepared to go along with the Government.  The Government seem to be committed to this process and, despite our very serious reservations, we are prepared to give this process a reasonable trial.</P>
      <P>Our committees must get serious consideration from the Government.  I should like it to be clearly understood that our agreement to accept the general scheme of committees proposed by the Minister is totally dependent on the Government meeting us in a very substantial way in regard to the committees we propose.  We believe that a number of the committees we propose are far more appropriate than some of the ones the Government have proposed, and are certainly more relevant to present day circumstances and very real present day problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need to justify the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  The Committee on Marine Affairs will be widely welcomed.  There is a great area there which needs to be looked at on a non-party basis.  The same <Col N="2385" /> applies to the Committee on Science and Technology.  If we are to have a committee system, these are the sort of areas which should be the subject of an all-party approach in joint committees.  I personally am very keen on seeing the Heritage Committee established and also the Committee on Arts and Culture. Very good positive work could be done by different Members of the House coming together on those committees.</P>
    <P>The other two we propose are agriculture and energy and natural resources. That is the sort of structure we see as appropriate.  Our whole agreement to this process being proposed here today depends on the Government meeting us very fairly and in a very substantial way on the seven committees we have put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the efforts made to bring about this reform of the House.  I congratulate the Minister on responding so quickly to the debate which took place some weeks ago on the whole question of this House being involved in a committee system.  I welcome that departure to the extent that it is a departure.  Instead of setting up a committee to see how it will function, the Minister seems to be suggesting that we should go much further than that and put greater emphasis on a committee system. The numbers of committees which are being set up seem to indicate that.  I have no fault to find with that.  These committees are welcome and will, in due course, benefit the House.</P>
      <P>We have been complaining for a long time that legislation comes through the civil service and that Deputies and Senators do not have an input into it at the pre-legislative stage.  We are approaching a stage where Deputies and Senators, in most cases, will have an input, by way of making reports and examinations, to legislation. As elected representatives that should be a modern function of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much criticism, some of which is justified, has been made about there being only four or five Deputies in the Chamber. I often wonder what the people who report this kind of thing expect.  Do they <Col N="2386" /> think there should be 168 Members sitting here from 10.30 a.m. until 10.30 p.m.?  The whole role of a Deputy must be re-examined.  If anybody came in here and saw 168 Members sitting from early morning until late at night there should then be criticism because the function of a public representative is not wholly exercised by sitting in this House.  There are monitors in all the Deputies' rooms where we can listen to debates.  I was listening to the Minister's introductory remarks on this debate and that is what brought me into the House.  No one even mentioned that aspect of debates, and criticism has been exaggerated.  Of course there is justified criticism which, unfortunately, is often included in an overall criticism which is not justified.  We can get away with the wrongs we do by defending the inaccurate comments which have been made.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Committee on Public Accounts.  I was also a member of the outgoing committee and it is a worth-while one.  It has an audit function by reporting to the House on expenditure which has been made.  I think it should not have a management function which should seek to examine expenditure before it is made.  It should examine the accuracy of expenditure which has been made.  This is the difference between the Committee on Public Expenditure and the Committee on Public Accounts.  It would be a mistake, contrary to what the last speaker said, to amalgamate these committees because there is a definable difference between their functions.  The Committee on Public Accounts has a very special function to play and that should be protected.</P>
    <P>I have a question on the Order Paper to the Minister for Justice asking him to consider setting up a committee on crime. I did not raise it when we were debating the reform of this House and no other&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did raise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I?  Thank you.  I do not recall raising it.  No other Deputy raised it at that time and it is down as a question to the Minister for Justice.  I <Col N="2387" /> hope the Government will accede to this request.  It would be a very worth-while committee but, unfortunately, has not been included in Government proposals. I hope that when we are dealing with questions to the Department of Justice next week the leader of the House will have consulted the Minister for Justice and that there will be a positive response to this.  There should be a committee on crime because of the serious problems in this area.  However, I will not go into the matter now as it would be more appropriate on a debate about the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>The Committee on Public Expenditure is one of the more important committees which the Minister is proposing to set up. I suspect, in common with many other representatives and members of the public, that there is a lack of care in the spending of public funds.  It is true that we are not as careful in spending public money as we are with our own finances. That is understandable but, for far too long, expenditure in the public service has been allowed to continue unchecked. We have now reached the point of saturation in taxation and we must be very careful to see that we are getting value for money and that the State is not being taken for a ride in its public expenditure. There is room for improvement and it should be examined on a factual basis.  I regret that the Minister has not gone the whole hog and appointed an expenditure commissioner to work with this committee because it would benefit the committee and the House if such a person were appointed.  I know the Minister has considered this in the past.  We cannot change everything overnight but this suggestion is worthy of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are spending vast sums of public funds and we are the people who vote that expenditure.  We are elected and given a mandate on behalf of the people whose hard earned money this is.  There should be more control and answerability regarding that expenditure.  As the people who supply those funds we must be satisfied that they are being spent in worth-while areas.  We should be trying to find out if the money is spent wisely.  It is <Col N="2388" /> the taxpayers' money and they must know how it is being spent.  Many sections in Government Departments feel they must spend the money allocated or they will not get it the following year.  The reverse should be the case and there should be incentives within the civil service to save, not by skimping on worthwhile schemes but by cutting down on waste.  We should give much thought to this in these difficult times of constraints.</P>
    <P>For far too long we in this House have been apologising to all sorts of people for our existence.  It is time that we stopped this nonsense.  We went through rough times to be elected and anyone else wishing to be elected to Parliament should go through the same tough times.  We have been bending the knee to trade unionists, journalists and pressure groups and this must stop.  It is part and parcel of the problems of Parliament that we have allowed ourselves to be at the beck and call of everybody.  We have been afraid to stand up and be counted, but we must be determined to do this.  It is not easy to become elected to this House and even more difficult to stay elected.  Many of us take the job seriously and work very hard and it is time we told those who want to run the country that they should stand for Parliament.  We should put right the wrongs of Parliament and should not apologise for being here.  We are here to do a public service and to do it to the best of our ability.  No other profession would stand up to the examination we undergo but it must be a proper examination.  No other profession would work the long hours, take the abuse or make the effort. We have to put up with abuse, much of it manufactured and unearned.  I have absolutely no complaint against fair and balanced criticism, and criticism which goes beyond that.  However, if it is totally manufactured and people are facilitated in manufacturing it by access to this House, we must take the matter seriously.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider the matter of contempt of committees?  What would happen, for instance, if someone is called as a witness &mdash; say, a senior manager in a public service company or <Col N="2389" /> some other witness, and he does not give accurate information to the committee or resists reasonable questions put by the committee?  What powers of censure will the committee have in such matters?  I suggest that they should be given reasoned and balanced powers to cope with this situation.</P>
    <P>Within this Chamber, Members are becoming increasingly more inaudible. When we are in recess, I hope the Minister will take the necessary steps to ensure that that is put right.  However, I shall not make a meal of that point.</P>
    <P>We have had much criticism from Members of the House about the scandal of ministerial pensions.  That is not relevant to this debate, but we are appointing a number of chairmen of committees. These people will be asked to take on extra responsibilities and extra work.  In no other section of the public service or private enterprise would that be asked without remunerative reward.  According to the procedure of this House, a Member of 40 years' service cannot get service pay or one penny more than someone like myself who has been in the House for only two years.  That is not very fair.  A Minister in Opposition who gets a small pension could be given an increment in this way.  This is open to misinterpretation and there is a peculiar element, not always outside this House, who deliberately misinterpret such matters for their own short-term benefit.  It is time we examined the matter.  I ask for no special privileges for Members of this House, but do not want them to have any special disadvantages either.  Time and time again, Members are asked to carry burdens and accept standards which no self-respecting trade union leader or member would accept.  It is time we said that we are not going to accept them either.  The Minister should give consideration to rewarding chairmen of the committees and, if necessary, providing staff for these chairmen from existing civil servants.  We have no need to engage additional staff.</P>
    <P>We are moving more into the line of full-time parliamentarians and I welcome that.  We have moved away from the time when there was a night shift in the House <Col N="2390" /> when the Four Courts closed down and then it became a club.  This Parliament is becoming more representative of the people.  It has become increasingly difficult for working class people or people without another source of income to become a Member of this House or to compete as such.  I want to see a full-time Parliament which is respected and has self-respect.  It is time we stood up for ourselves.  We must become involved in this extra work and represent what we should represent.  We should work for those for whom we should work.  We should be properly facilitated, remunerated and staffed to do that work.  When we are examining the whole question of committees, we should deal with a number of these questions &mdash; for instance, back-up research facilities.  The people who lose by not having those facilities are not the Deputies &mdash; because most Deputies will keep up their image and work in their constituencies and find themselves re-elected &mdash; but the public.  The vast amounts of money taken from them in taxation are not being properly accounted for by us who should be doing this.  We should be ensuring that this money which we vote here time and time again is spent to our satisfaction and not to the satisfaction of anybody else.</P>
    <P>I want a stronger and more open Parliament which relates to the people and to their needs.  I do not wish there to be any pandering to Deputies.  The minimum facilities should be provided and we have been too afraid to take upon ourselves the necessary powers to provide these.  Now when we are setting up these committees is the time to act.</P>
    <P>I was talking to a United States Senator of the State of Washington who told me that there they had a committee on committees. We have many committees, but I do not suggest that there should be one on committees.  I suggest that the Minister provide machinery for an automatic review of this whole system within a fixed period of time, so that we can deal with existing problems and solve them.  I congratulate all those who were involved in bringing these proposals before the House.  It is a good day's work and an excellent action on the part of the Minister <Col N="2391" /> in taking the debate in the House so seriously and in coming forward with proposals for committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reforms we are anxious to operate in the House is that we do not have long speeches.  I am not suggesting that the speeches made so far have been long but I know there are at least ten Deputies who wish to contribute to this two hour debate.  It would be bad example if I go on for too long and I ask those who contribute after me to conclude reasonably quickly.</P>
      <P>We have been trying to get away from the practice where Deputies from the back benches have been brought in to make speeches to keep the House going.  I am glad to say that it is a dying art.  Perhaps we will lose one of the great traditions we had where senior Deputies, at a moment's notice, could go into the House, make a long speech and keep the House going.  While we cannot regulate the length of time a speech should take, it is an area where I would be anxious to co-operate with the Government Whip.</P>
      <P>I agree with the setting up of these committees.  I thank the Minister for Industry and Energy for his courtesy and for the time he spent on this.  He does not neglect his chores in other areas but does much of this work outside of what would be considered normal hours.</P>
      <P>People outside the House often attack us, justifiably or not, as being irrelevant. If we can streamline our business then we have an obligation to ourselves, if to no one else, to do so.  When the Dáil resumed after the Christmas recess we spent the first week talking about Dáil reform.  We were accused of wasting time.  In the months since then almost every second day there have been meetings about these committees to try to see how best they could work and bring in rules and regulations to make them more attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An attempt has been made &mdash; I am sure it will not be 100 per cent successful &mdash; to bring forward these committees, change the terms of reference of some others and suggest new ones.  I understand <Col N="2392" /> from the Minister that we will get favourable decisions on at least some of the committees we suggested.  As regards some committees which have not been agreed on, it is a case of not having completed our discussions.  We put forward some necessary amendments to the Joint Committee on Women's Affairs.  That committee's terms of reference included a reference to all women being vulnerable. It is our party's understanding that all women are not vulnerable.  This committee is trying to help those in need and not all women.  We have some other minor amendments like that.</P>
    <P>Deputies must make themselves available to attend these committees.  I am not sure we can compel them to attend or entice them by some other means.  Deputies are accused of being involved in messenger boy politics and of doing this, that and the other.  However, that is what they are elected for.  Politicians are answerable to the electorate and to no one else. The politicians who receive the highest number of votes are those who mix parliamentary activities with good constituency work.  People who do one or the other may be elected but do not do quite as well.  However, there is no conflict between the two.  If the energy spent in saying that TDs are messenger boys was spent on saying why they have to be messenger boys it would be much better. If the people who spend their time writing and preaching outside the House about all the things we do wrong spent their time looking at some of the other areas they would serve society better.  However, I suppose they will not listen to that.</P>
    <P>We are in favour of the majority of these committees.  We have put forward some amendments.  I have been an active member of committees and know the difficulties involved.  We must keep the committees as active as possible and make sure they get as much publicity as possible. Politicians live on publicity and if they were to receive publicity for being active on these committees members would agree to attend.  The problem about committees is that nobody really cares what happens at them.  Only some of them report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2393" /> The Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which deals with affairs which directly affect Deputies, often has a poor attendance.  It is often difficult to get this meeting off the ground.  My understanding from conversations which have taken place is that there is a will on all sides to be actively involved, to try to make the committees work and bring forward legislation, examine expenditure and deal with other matters.  In that way we will show we are fulfilling our obligations as parliamentarians and are not just concerned with regional or small parochial matters but are also interested in national affairs.</P>
    <P>As I have said privately to the Minister and in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, if we want suitably qualified people to stand for election to Dáil Éireann we must give them the facilities, financial and otherwise, to carry out their duties.  It is no secret that a number of us who do not have other interests find this increasingly difficult.  When we stood before the electorate we knew we were not taking up the best paid job but we did not know we would have to forego all future national wage agreements and make sacrifices no other section of the community have to make.  In the last 18 months we have had three elections.  As people know, we are not paid during that period.  I accept that my party did not implement things which were agreed last year by the CPP.  However, I ask the Minister to use his efforts to ensure we are paid in line with the grades we have been linked to.  Such a line of action would mean that we would not be forced, in order to provide for our families, to go outside and earn an adequate wage. People do not appreciate that.  Some people consider £13,800 an enormous salary. Perhaps if they tried being a Deputy for a year they would understand the problems.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of our having known on entering this House what the situation would be.  We were not told that we would not get the benefits of the wage agreements in line with the grade with which we have relativity, that is, a grade about sixth down the line.  At least if I were receiving what I understood on <Col N="2394" /> coming in here that I would be receiving I would have no grievance.  If Deputies do not have sufficient means by way of their salaries from here they must spend some of their time on other duties.  One might argue that this should not be the case, but as one who has been here for six years and involved in numerous committees I am aware of the problems of Deputies in this regard.  We may have a small band of Deputies who are wealthy but the number in that respect is decreasing. The majority of Deputies fit into the category I am talking about.  If they did not have to engage in these other activities, they could afford to be here on Mondays and Fridays.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most effective manner of dealing with legislation and public expenditure committees is to have them meet outside Dáil time.  At times when the Dáil is in recess these committees could do a lot of work.  Many of the Deputies who would be involved are around.  I do not know of any Deputy who can afford to take three months holidays. It would be convenient to have the committees meet on Mondays and Fridays as well as during the summer recess and also during the month of January and during the Easter recess.  That sort of arrangement would eliminate the present situation whereby committees are interrupted continuously to allow Members to vote in the House.  On Thursday last we spent about two hours of a seven-hour debate to-ing and fro-ing in response to division bells.  This is not a productive way of spending one's time.  I realise that divisions are an important part of parliamentary procedure but we could streamline some of the activity in that regard. The Minister has undertaken to examine the situation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the committees being debated here today, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges are examining also the question of the Order of Business and of Question Time.  Question Time has become self-defeating.  Some of the Ministers who were appointed in December last have not succeeded in getting their turn to answers questions yet.  We should be able to have Ministers here to answer in respect of the areas of policy <Col N="2395" /> with which they are associated.  On the other side of the coin, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare was here for three weeks answering questions.  In the autumn session we are to try some experiments. For instance, we will endeavour to have a Minister per day here for Question Time and any question not asked on the expiration of the time allotted for questions will be put at the end of the list.  This may prove an attraction for people not to ask so many supplementaries and to ask them only in cases where they are absolutely necessary.  It may lead also to parochial-type questions being put down for written reply instead of taking up the time of the national Parliament with such matters as water grants which, though important, should not consume the hour allotted for questions each day.</P>
    <P>In addition we have succeeded, by way of suspending Standing Orders, in having matters of urgent importance discussed promptly.  During this session this has led to four or five debates on matters of urgent public importance.  For instance, we had a debate on the Fairview Park case and also on a number of major factory closures.</P>
    <P>This indicates to the people that the Dáil is talking about issues that affect them instead of having a situation in which they read that the Chair, through no fault of his but in compliance with Standing Orders, must rule certain matters out of order.  At least half the Standing Orders should be changed.</P>
    <P>We have made a good deal of progress in six months.  A number of committees are meeting on a weekly basis.  We must do our utmost to influence people in what we are doing and also to win the respect of outside bodies so that when any of these bodies are due to appear before a committee of the Houses, they will send their appropriate people who will treat the committee seriously.  I hope, too, that our friends in the media will endeavour to promote the committee system and to show that the Dáil is not as uninteresting a place as one might think from reading the press sometimes.  I accept that a good deal of the criticism is true but we must do our best now to make this institution <Col N="2396" /> more relevant.  It in a year's time we find that we have not gone far enough in terms of committees, we can make whatever amendments are necessary or we may drop any committee that may not be effective.  It is only in that way that we can be seen to represent the people who returned us to this House.  I appreciate the amount of time that the Minister has put into this whole area.  We have considered all his suggestions very seriously. Our parliamentary party and in particular our Front Bench have spent a considerable number of hours on our proposals for committees and in drafting amendments to the Minister's committees.  I hope that before we go into recess we will be able to set up at least the four committees we proposed as priorities.  These are committees to deal with crime, lawlessness and vandalism, marine resources and maritime affairs, heritage, culture and the arts.  If we have those committees set up together with the Committee on Women's Affairs and the all-party committee on marriage we would at least in one session be attempting some kind of Dáil reform.  We can report at a future date on how workable all this appears to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I will be brief.  Today marks a very important stage in the process of Dáil reform. We know it is only a step in that direction but it is a step which is long overdue and very great credit is due to the Minister who has managed successfully to combine this task with the effective and vigorous carrying out of his job as Minister for Industry and Energy.</P>
      <P>I was puzzled by the somewhat lukewarm approach of the Leader of the Opposition to the whole question.  I suspect that on this subject the Leader of the Opposition is at variance with many of his own backbenchers.  I know there is great enthusiasm among backbenchers and members of the front bench on all sides for the process which has begun and this came across very clearly in the speech made by Deputy Ahern.  Nobody is so naive as to think that what is happening today will radically transform overnight the workings of this House or make us appear to be more relevant or give us any greater degree of control over the areas where we should have control.  Nobody inside or outside this House will see what we are doing as the beginning of an assault on the sovereignty of Parliament. This House has, unfortunately, long since lost its sovereign central role.  We are not, in any overnight fashion, transforming the workings of Parliament nor are we engaged in some assault on the traditional role of Parliament; rather are we beginning a process which will bring back to politicians and to this House in a belated way the respect and the purpose which they should enjoy and exert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the debate on parliamentary reform earlier this year one theme came across very clearly from virtually every speaker &mdash; the need for a committee system which would be more effective and more thorough going than any existing already which would cover areas of public policy and areas of parliamentary and Government practice not at present being covered.  It is also clear that, while almost everybody wanted committees, they were for the most part fairly vague as to how these committees <Col N="2401" /> should function and the powers they should have.  Many claims were made during the debate for the introduction of committees.  We see today these vague ideas worked out and given a reality and they will serve for the future development of our committee system.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Minister was not carried away by the enthusiasm which came from many of us and he still sees the central role of Parliament resting in this House in full plenary session.  Nothing in these proposals attempts in the slightest way to diminish that sovereignty. The Minister has learned from the good ideas expressed in that debate and he has also learned from the experience in other countries where committees are not a luxury or an addition but are essential to the smooth functioning of Parliament.  These committees involve Members in detailed scrutiny of Government proposals and Members are allowed to specialise in various areas. Ministers are very often chosen without any specialist preparation for the enormous portfolios they must administer and we can see in this system an amateurish approach.  Committees will at least allow Members to specialise so that when they show expertise in a particular area they will be serving their apprenticeship for a Ministry at a later date and will be better prepared than would otherwise be the case.  In other countries these committees allow policy proposals to be discussed earlier than is the case here and they allow Members to carry out detailed investigations and to hear evidence, the kind of things they should be hearing, if proper legislation is to be introduced. The Minister has learned from all of these lessons and these aspects are incorporated in his proposals.</P>
    <P>The experience universally in those parliamentary systems which have vigorous extensive committee systems is that the work of Parliament is enriched and made more complete while the role and job satisfaction of Members is far greater, as is their impact on the public.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Haughey and others pointed out, a committee system in a Parliament such as ours must face up to a number of major obstacles.  The first of <Col N="2402" /> these is the view, which I suspect is held by Deputies Haughey and Lenihan, that Parliament is there to provide Governments and Governments are there to govern, to be strong and decisive and that the Government should not be hampered in carrying out this decisive role by too great a degree of scrutiny and too great a degree of daily accountability to Parliament on, perhaps, minor matters.  This is a view which is very quickly adopted by virtually everybody who becomes a Minister. The present Minister is one of the exceptions and there are other exceptions on both sides of the House.  It is strange how quickly Ministers who feel they have vitally important work to do can become very impatient about having to come into the House to answer even to their own back benchers.  They have a lukewarm approach to backbench committees of their own party and they have a reluctance to be questioned by a full, wellversed parliamentary committee.  Those who become Ministers may feel that they know best and have the best advice and that what they have to do must be done quickly in the interests of the country.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the experience of all Governments over the past few years shows many instances where parliamentary scrutiny and detailed questions would have prevented us from embarking on some of the great disasters such as NET, Whitegate, Knock Airport and Irish Steel.  Many of these ventures might not have got off the ground had there been detailed scrutiny in Parliament and had wider advice been taken.  There is a deep-rooted feeling among many people that lip service is paid to the idea of committees but that essentially they hamper the full working of decisive government. It is a view with which I totally disagree.</P>
    <P>A second obstacle which faces the effective working of committees is the work practice which we have inherited and which is part and parcel of being reelected. One need not talk at length about the huge tyranny of constituency work which has an urgency about it and which will prevent many Deputies who would like to take part in committees from doing the background preparation <Col N="2403" /> which is an essential part of smooth committee functioning.</P>
    <P>No great answer has been found to the dilemma which faces us.  I could propose a heresy such as that there be a single mandate, that no TDs should also be members of local councils and that no member of a local council be allowed run for the Dáil.  That might involve constitutional change but I know it is not on. However, the burden of council work which TDs are forced to carry in addition to Dáil work distorts their overall parliamentary performance.  More realistically, we could have a simplification of the procedures, a better appeals system in local and central Government, the type of reform the Minister, Deputy Boland, is trying to introduce.</P>
    <P>The biggest possibility of change would be a change in public attitudes.  In many cases there is a public tyranny, a sense in which the public expect Deputies to be at every garden fete and every public event in their constituency.  The public expect Deputies to be available for every local meeting, to do a lot of constituency work and, at the same time, to be functioning effectively in the Dáil.  In part it is because of unreasonable public demands that we are in this situation.  The resolution of this part of our political culture is central to any effective working of a committee system.</P>
    <P>I was not clear about the attitude of Deputy Haughey to committees.  On the one hand he wanted a limited number of committees working effectively, but on the other hand, instead of allowing the committees mentioned today to go ahead on an experimental basis, he has proposed seven or eight new committees.  If adopted those committees would tax the capacity of the House.  I accept that many of the committees Deputy Haughey has proposed are worth-while.  I hope some type of accommodation is possible and that some of them will be set up before too long.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt with some of the difficulties.  A back-up service is essential but here we need a certain <Col N="2404" /> maturity.  Before there is detailed questioning and raising of hands in horror at the hiring of outside consultants we should get this question into scale and perspective.  If committees have to hire a few outside experts, so be it.  The quality of the advice given will greatly outweigh the small cost involved but I am sure that much of the expertise can be supplied from within the public service.  That expertise is there and I hope it will be possible for those in the public service who have a contribution to make to do so as part of the back-up service for the committees.</P>
    <P>In setting up the committees the Minister avoided one great pitfall.  It would have been tempting to set up a whole range of committees over certain policy areas such as health, education and agriculture, areas where those committees would inevitably draw into membership those who had a vested interest in extra spending in those areas.  The result might have been a whole series of committees which would become lobbies for extra spending rather than acting in a balanced way or looking at the problems and questions from the point of view of the House. The Minister has carefully avoided that pitfall and avoided setting up extra forces for spending within the new system.</P>
    <P>The Minister was correct to have the committees as open as possible, to have as many public hearings as possible and to have them broadcast or televised should the interest arise.  We are living in an age where the fullest possible access is essential because without such access rumours and innuendoes thrive.  They may well thrive where there is full access but at least we are in an area where open Government is in everybody's interest.  I am glad the committees will function for the most part openly, that evidence will be taken openly and that the media will be invited to attend to relay to the public what is happening.  That is in everybody's interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right to be confident that interested parties will give evidence freely to these committees.  Many of the groups we all meet in the course of our daily work will be delighted to get an opportunity to put forward their point of <Col N="2405" /> view.  The process of allowing them put their point of view to those who in some way take the decisions will remove much of the remoteness which surrounds the working of Parliament.  It will make the bringing forward of those views a legitimate part of parliamentary activity.  In most other countries that is done openly; a lobby makes its point of view openly and it is assessed by all.  The committees will open up Parliament to those who have a right and an interest in being heard.  I wish the Minister well.  I congratulate him on his extremely constructive and well fleshed-out proposals.  I assure him that backbenchers on all sides welcome his approach and that we have made the first real step towards strengthening the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the whole idea of a committee system and the decision to establish the various committees, with one exception.  I disagree with the setting up of the Committee on Public Expenditure on a strong basis of principle in regard to effective decision-making by the Government and the place in which the Constitution places the Government. We are willing to give that committee a try but there is no point in raising expectations that bear no relation to reality. The reality of the matter in practice, and under the Constitution, is that the central role as far as public administration is concerned rests with the Taoiseach nominated by the Dáil and the Government recommended to the Dáil by the Taoiseach. That is central to our system of Government, and our Ministers, with one exception, have been drawn from membership of this House.  In fact, not more than two Members can be drawn from the Seanad.  The people make a decision at election time and a majority of the Deputies returned in that election decide on a Taoiseach and a Government. Executive power rests there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is one weakness in the modern democratic system, here and throughout the democratic world, it lies in the growing paralysis of decision-making by the Executive, the growing paralysis of Government power and the inability of Governments to make decisions effectively <Col N="2406" /> and get on with their business.  That is the central weakness of modern democracy. The challenge facing modern democracy is its inability to cope with serious problems by reason of governments who cannot act in an effective and decisive manner.  A Committee on Public Expenditure of its very nature is concerned with examining Government expenditure proposals, looking into those proposals and making a decision on them as a committee before they are implemented.  The motion deals with positive policy areas.  It states:</P>
    <P>(1)  That a Select Committee... be appointed to review the justification for and effectiveness of ongoing expenditure of Government Departments and Offices and of State-sponsored Bodies not included in the Schedule to the Order establishing the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies ... recommending cost effective alternatives and/or the elimination of wasteful or obsolete programmes, where desirable.</P>
    <P>That is precisely a policy area which lies with Government.  There will be a serious difficulty here.  We may run into a situation where if a Committee on Public Expenditure gets bogged down, the Government, in their ordinary process of administration and decision-making, may get bogged down The Constitution is wise in a number of Articles in putting the responsibility for policy-making, raising and expending money fairly and squarely within the realm of Government. Article 17 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>2.  Dáil Éireann shall not pass any vote or resolution, and no law shall be enacted, for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation shall have been recommended to Dáil Éireann by a message from the Government signed by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It is basic and fundamental.  The expenditure area is one for recommendation to the Dáil by the Government and the <Col N="2407" /> Taoiseach.  There is basic power in Article 28 which states:</P>
    <P>The executive power of the State shall, subject to the provisions of this Constitution, be exercised by or on the authority of the Government.</P>
    <P>There is another provision in Article 28 which states:</P>
    <P>The Government shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government.</P>
    <P>This Article also states:</P>
    <P>The Government shall prepare Estimates of the Receipts of the Expenditure of the State for each financial year, and shall present them to Dáil Éireann for consideration.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear under those relevant Articles of the Constitution that the basic policy and financial powers relating to the expenditure of money reside with the Government elected by the people through the Dáil.  It is the people's right at election time to elect a Government through the House and to be drawn from this House.  From there on policy making, the raising of finances and expenditure relating to policy making and raising of finances resides firmly within the compass of the Government.</P>
    <P>I can see a real danger in over-elaborating here what this committee can do. The Committee on Public Expenditure can do no more than advise.  That has to be made quite clear at this stage.  I can see the Minister nodding his head.  Let us have no illusions or expectations, because that is all the committee can do. That reduces the matter to size.  Some commentators have fed the illusion that the Dáil in some magic way, by establishing committees, can achieve some executive power and achieve some action beyond the fundamental and central power and effectiveness of Government. Any such notion is not on.  I am entering a sceptical <i>caveat</i> at this stage so that people realise the real limitations there are to the work of this particular committee <Col N="2408" /> and the very real dangers at this stage of ascribing powers and functions to it that are not in accordance with the practical reality of the situation and are not in accordance either with the constitutional position.</P>
    <P>That is the central point I wish to make but, as an ancillary point, I would like to say that I do not believe the hiring of consultants by the committee will help matters.  It is a rather trite means by which ailing or failing firms tend to prop themselves up for periods of time.  I am not very enamoured of the whole notion of the committee hiring consultants.  In such a committee I would prefer the horse sense of the Members of the House on the Committee.</P>

      <P>Their common sense will be of far greater value to the committee than any such consultants or outside advisers.  This side of the House welcome the establishment of the committees.  I have no criticism to offer in relation to the other committees.  In fact, I welcome their establishment.  I wanted to enter a very positive and definite <i>caveat</i> against overstating the possible powers of the Committee on Public Expenditure. There is a very real danger of a conflict situation starting between such a committee and the Government of the day. I want again to emphasise my firm belief that while parliamentary reform may be very well and excellent in its own way, a far more serious problem facing the democratic world is the provision of effective Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importation of a committee system that works well in the American scene is not the answer.  The American parliamentary scene is totally different.  The congressional committees meet in public within a Congress framework.  The Congress framework does not provide the American executive or the American Government.  They are provided by the President.  In that system Congress are in an adversary position <i>per se,</i> by reason of the American Constitution, from day one <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Government, who are not <Col N="2409" /> drawn from Congress and are not accountable in that way to the Congress.</P>
    <P>In our system the Government are drawn from this Parliament and are accountable to this Parliament in relation to daily questioning and the passing of legislation.  It is a totally different system. Any analogy between the two can be very misleading.  While I welcome the establishment of the committees I would like to say that the Minister has worked very hard in relation to their establishment.  I am certain he appreciates the points I have been making in relation to the relevant position <i>vis-á-vis</i> Government and Parliament within the classical system of parliamentary accountability of the Government and election of the Government from the Parliament, which is our particular system and is written into our Constitution.  There should not be, without very cautious travelling, an over-zealous or over-optimistic approach towards this committee because any such approach or any elaboration or view of this committee's powers and functions out of proportion to the reality and to the constitutional position can only put such a committee on a collision with whatever executive is there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not leave unrecorded, as one of the newest TDs in the House, my enthusiasm in welcoming the introduction of the first series of committees to the House and also in congratulating the Minister who has had a commitment to Dáil reform and to the more practical and realistic running of the business of the Dáil as long as I have known him.  Today's work is medium term so far as the Minister has brought it to the House and now it is up to all of us to put it into practice.</P>
      <P>Like the other speakers I will brief because I know many speakers wish to speak on this matter.  I take Deputy Lenihan's point that the sovereignty, role and authority of this House should not be undermined in any way.  I do not think the committees will allow that.  Everybody on this side of the House certainly supports working against anything which would undermine the authority of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2410" /> Deputy Lenihan mentioned the practical reality of the situation.  As I see this, and as a lot of TDs and Ministers see it and, probably more important, as the electorate outside the House see it, there is not a very practical, realistic situation operating in the House at all.  I believe we were in danger, without this kind of reform, of losing contact completely with the electorate, particularly our young electorate, who look with total cynicism at an outdated and a traditional way of acting that has no relevance to their way of life and, particularly, has no relevance to the quick day-to-day decisions we have to make in order to cope with the eighties, let alone plan for the nineties.</P>
    <P>That is the whole thrust of these committees. Despite the caveats they must be not alone accepted but implemented with realism.  Otherwise we can wave goodbye to a great respect for democracy in this House.  With the introduction of these committees we now face the moment of truth in this House: that if we do not participate fully in them and make them work we can look out.  The young electorate reject totally what has been going on for some years in this House.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on the three committees proposed to be established today by way of highlighting some aspects of each.  Taking into account all that has been said by the Opposition and others about the Committee on Public Expenditure, apart from using the talents and expertise of Members of this House and, if necessary, experts, even more importantly we shall be attempting a longer term review of spending programmes. This is something that has been neglected to our great tragedy, with our huge unemployment figures and recession.  There has been no real deployment of our natural resources.  Something not done over the years with regard to public expenditure or even our economic policies and programmes is proposed, as stated here:</P>
    <P>The committee will not be directly concerned with the annual estimates process but with the longer term review of spending programmes in any area of public expenditure it so chooses.</P>
    <P>This would mean that that committee <Col N="2411" /> would be monitoring how public moneys were being spent currently and their effectiveness in the long term.  Indeed had we adopted that policy 20 years ago we would not now find ourselves in the situation obtaining.  The tragedy was that there was total focus on what were considered to be economic programmes which completely excluded long-term social planning.  Therefore, I welcome the integrated thrust of the work of that committee.</P>
    <P>The second committee to be established is that on legislation.  Nobody on either side of the House could deny that we need a committee to focus on legislation and reform.  To our shame let it be said that a great portion of the awareness, changing of attitudes and pressurisation has come not from within this House, with any political will, but from groups outside it.  Not alone will this committee recognise and pay tribute to that fact but it will also take oral representations from individuals and interest groups outside this House.  In this respect the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It will pave the way towards the establishment of a direct link between those formulating and processing legislation and those who will be affected by it when enacted.</P>
    <P>That is where a lot of our legislation has fallen down in the past.  I put it to Members of the House who questioned &mdash; and I shall come to this later &mdash; that we should dare to think that the position of women in society was vulnerable, that the vulnerability of the position of women in society and other groups would not be so accentuated had we had that kind of committees and input into committees from these various groups over the years. Therefore, I accept and indeed applaud the present proposal.  I would ask Members to give the same commitment to the work of these committees as has the Minister.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the Joint Committee on Small Businesses, there is no doubt that, as some of our most heavily-invested industries have gone to the wall, in the future we must look very seriously <Col N="2412" /> at the removal of obstacles to people who wish to set up small business or cooperatives. These must be seen as constituting a valid way forward for us to quickly generate employment.  One has to look only at the idealism, enthusiasm and training of young people who still remain unemployed.  I should like to see this committee focussing all of their attention on devising the most advantageous method of ensuring that young people, people made redundant and undergoing new training get the training, advice and professionalism they need without themselves having to incur the huge costs involved and not knowing where to turn for it.  That is the fastest and most effective way I foresee of our generating employment and of giving independence and responsibility to our people and of getting them to rely on their entrepreneurial skills.  Rather than putting them down or placing obstacles in their way we should be encouraging them in every way possible.  One sentence of the Minister's introductory remarks jumped out at me.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Management retraining schemes will form a crucial part of any successful development effort in this sector in the coming decade.</P>
    <P>This is an area we must look at.  Indeed, had it been examined earlier perhaps we might have prevented some of the major breakdowns that have occured; certainly lack of such examination was a contributory factor.  Those comments of the Minister are not a reflection on management at present.  Rather is it a recognition that in the last 20 years we have experienced an industrial revolution such as had not been encountered in the previous 1,000 years.  I read somewhere recently that by the year 2000 60 per cent of the products we will then be using have not yet been discovered.  That is the speed with which modern technology is overtaking us.  Unless we have the skills, training and management to control it then we shall be unable to take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>Such will be the value of these committees. There is no way that overburdened Deputies, either individually or as <Col N="2413" /> Ministers, have the time, energy and expertise.  Life has become too complex. Therefore the collective talents of this House must be focussed more energetically. People choosing to serve on committees at which they can offer their expertise, energy and commitment surely must constitute the best way of ensuring the most efficient working of this administration. I know &mdash; and I am sure other Members listening to me will agree &mdash; that one of the most positive things we have been able to promise the electorate during these difficult times has been the setting up of this type of committee system in addition to reforming Dáil procedures. I was delighted to hear from Deputy B. Ahern that that is progressing in the work of these committees being set up and that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges are meeting each week. That is the kind of commitment that will raise respect for politicians and give the public outside an awareness of how hard politicians have been working behind the scenes for years, which work has gone totally unacknowledged.  That is why the publicity and immediate coverage of the work of these committees will be a priority, but it will also afford publicity to the people engaged in that work.  That is something of which the electorate may need to be reminded.</P>
    <P>I must record one disappointment this afternoon amidst my enthusiasm &mdash; and I have heard explanations advanced across the House for this &mdash; that is, that the Joint Committee on Women's Rights has not been included in this afternoon's business.  I would hope it is not an indication of the priority we shall afford that committee, coming in last.  I hope also it is not an indication that we are going to encounter such sensitivities within this committee that it will need more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In case I do not get an opportunity next week, I wish now to welcome the establishment of the Committee on Women's Rights. Deputy Ahern spoke about the vulnerable position of women in society but I do not wish to get into a debate on semantics on this point.  I will give a few examples of that vulnerability. They have no economic independence in the home, including no dental or optical benefit.  Married women have no right of domicile in their own right.  The ICPSA report this week regarding women in employment shows that the odds against promotion for women are 100 to one as compared with promotional opportunities for men.  We have had legislation on equal pay since 1976 but still women's earnings are only 60 per cent of men's earnings.  Another report has been issued on schooling and sex roles.  We shall have to look carefully at our educational and training systems to see why so few women are concentrated in career roles, with very few long-term promotional job opportunities.  I cite the above as merely an <i>hors d'oeuvre</i> of what the committee will be considering.  I welcome the fact that it will be set up next week but I am disappointed it was not included in the list this afternoon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what it will be like when we get to the main course if that was merely an <i>hors d'oeuvre.</i>  I am very conscious of the fact that a number of Deputies, almost all of them on this side of the House, have been waiting to make a contribution to this debate.  We realise that matters of importance such as dealing with constituents and other matters are being ignored while we are engaged in this debate, but that is the nature of our business.  For that reason, I am anxious that those who wish to contribute should be able to do so.</P>
      <P>We are concerned to ensure that the Dáil will be relevant and effective.  This does not just start with the introduction of committees: it has been an ongoing consideration throughout the existence of this and every other Dáil since it was first established.  While I agree that a committee system can make a contribution, I tend to caution against expecting too much, as I believe Deputy Barnes may be, in seeing this as the major breakthrough that will satisfy people outside or enable us to show that at least we are doing what apparently we have not been doing effectively up to now.  I hope I have not misunderstood Deputy Barnes on this point.  We have the responsibility not only to do a job but to be seen to do that job.  To that extent our public relations becomes a matter of importance &mdash; not on a party political basis but as the Legislature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various people have a role to play in this: the Executive, this Parliament and the press and I should like to make a few comments in respect of each of them. First, I should like to say that the Minister's approach to this matter has been characterised by his own typically objective approach and his research and concern which has been reflected in what has been said in the House.  The Minister has acknowledged in relation to the committee to review public expenditure that we should not run away with the idea that somehow we will be engaged in a function that is basically a function for the Executive. Let me go a stage further because the deputy leader of our party has dealt with that already.  How money is spent <Col N="2416" /> and the priorities for spending that money is not just a matter for the Executive. In many ways it characterises the political approaches of the various parties. Without going into this matter in detail, there are some areas where our party would have different positions from that of Fine Gael or the Labour Party. This is what justifies our presence here on the Opposition benches or in Government, as the case may be.  How we present to the public the priorities we have is a matter of some significance.  Where does education stand in our priorities?  I am not going to engage in that debate now but there is a case for recognising that there is a difference in priorities on that issue.  However, I will not trespass into Deputy O'Rourke's area of responsibility which she has been covering very well.</P>
    <P>In relation to the capital programme there is a difference between our approach and that of the Government. In relation to, for instance, the National Development Corporation there is a dramatic difference between the Government and ourselves.  These differences exist and we should not look to the committee to fudge them.  The day we come in with a consensus will be the day we have not fulfilled our political commitments and have lost our sense of direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the Last Day &mdash; the day of Resurrection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be the day on which Government was no longer needed.  To an extent there has been a degree of euphoric expectation about the committees.  There has been the attitude that all our differences will no longer exist or else they will pale into insignificance. Differences are no harm provided that in presenting them we test each other on the issues involved.  To the extent that the committees will enable us to concentrate on issues as distinct from personalities, I welcome them.  There has been an undue concentration on personality politics, <Col N="2417" /> not just in the Chamber but outside. I will deal with that briefly in a moment.</P>
      <P>The second role, as a subsection of the Executive, is the role of Departments.  I am convinced that the responsibility for seeing that every penny collected from the taxpayers is spent properly is basically with the Department concerned.  Departments are not just channels of public expenditure and they should not see themselves in that light.  They should always ensure that every penny spent is being spent in the most effective way. They should make sure there is no waste &mdash; and there has been waste &mdash; and they should look for ways and means to improve efficiency.</P>
      <P>If we were to think that what we are doing here today will mean the end of all our problems we are deluding ourselves. In <i>The Irish Times</i> of today's date there is a report that the merging of Departments is advocated in a publication of the Public Service Advisory Council.  They were dealing with promotional matters that were negotiated between the Department of the Public Service and the Association of Higher Civil Servants. Here we are talking about public expenditure. I will give the quotation:</P>
      <P>The Department, in its report to the advisory council said that it was not in a position to force other Departments to bring changes into effect &mdash; it could only advise, guide and persuade.</P>
      <P>Is the role of the Department of the Public Service merely to advise, guide and persuade and not to implement?  We are not here in any way taking away the responsibilities of the Departments to watch and account for every penny they can save to ensure that it is properly done.  This consensus does not take from that responsibility of the Departments, which is more onerous now than ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say something about the role of the press.  Whatever happens outside, or what is presented outside of what is done inside has to be an abbreviation of the proceedings in the House on the day.  A tendency has grown up over the years &mdash; it started a number of years back &mdash; to have a little cameo on the day, which is very readable, presented <Col N="2418" /> by people who have a gift for writing, for turning phrases, but that cameo as often as not confines itself to the Order of Business&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the first half hour, or to part of Question Time.  The issues in these committees will be tedious. The committees will not be very entertaining.  They will not be the places to go to to enjoy the circus.  They will be painstaking and detailed, if we can manage to get them going properly.  They will not present themselves very well in terms of escalating public interest, if that is what the press is read for.  There will not be much material for sketches coming from these committees.  If we are to be relevant &mdash; and I suppose the Fourth Estate would like to see that happening &mdash; then let us hope that they, too, have a responsibility.  Anyone who talks to the men who cover this House from the gallery regularly, those who take &ldquo;copy&rdquo;, shall we say, will appreciate that there is a limitation on the other side as well.  I should like to suggest that perhaps at the end of the week each of our daily newspapers would have one page to present to the people the issues that were decided and which were of particular importance during the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They would want us to pay for it, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to be relevant it will be important that the committees will be reported.  However, with the number of committees coming up I doubt the capacity of the press to cover them in the way they should be reported. I doubt if they would have the capacity in numbers.  Incidentally, if we are to get the benefit of expert opinion it may mean that those who report the committees will need facilities to get extra opinion to enable them to become aware of how we will become better informed by having expert advice than we would otherwise be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of this imposes responsibilities on each section involved.  In the final <Col N="2419" /> analysis this Parliament will be the place where the decisions of the Executive will be tested by the decisions of the Opposition to ensure that the system will be the fairest we have and that whatever is done will be done after it is tested effectively and fully in the full glare and scrutiny of publicity to which the press and the other media have access.</P>
    <P>Though I welcome what the Minister is doing there are some examples, even in what we have been doing today, of the Government, any Government, in the existing procedures doing the opposite to what we are trying to achieve today.  The best example I can give is in the context of the Finance Act.  We spent from morning until night, described by one commentator as being a boring discussion, considering the income-related property tax.  That would not have affected the Finance Bill one way or another because the Minister did not know exactly how much that tax would bring in.  We mentioned during that debate the proposals the Minister has now brought in and we asked the Minister for Finance if he could possibly take that tax out of the Bill and let us deal with it in select committee so that we could all look at it objectively and calmly.  I do not know what happened to the pleas of Deputy Kelly, Deputy G. Mitchell and others because when the gong went we all trooped up into the division lobby.  We discussed that new tax in the space of three hours although it did not make any point in the Finance Bill at all &mdash; it should have been brought in separately.  Even under existing procedures we did not use properly what was available to us.</P>
    <P>Therefore, procedures will not answer everything at all times &mdash; it is how we use them and the facilities available to us which is much more important.  Whatever we do must be seen to be done properly.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the penultimate point I want to make.  As Deputy Lenihan said, I think we do not need consultants because they only tend to give us confirmation or a sort of <i>ex post facto</i> justification for what we wanted to do ourselves in any event.  Every industry has learned to use consultants so that they can always <Col N="2420" /> say:  &ldquo;It was not we who imposed this idea.  The experts recommended it to us. Therefore it has to be authoritative&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We can use consultants but we must be conscious that we need more practical assistance, perhaps clerical assistance. Everybody in the House appreciates that we are relying on one secretary to do a bit of typing, to make telephone calls, and I, particularly, am aware of that, having been in various positions, here for a while, away for a while and again here for a while.  We have one secretary at the moment to deal with constituency and other matters, facing a whole range of facilities the Government have. Obviously we are therefore limited in the way we can discharge our role.  If there are to be people to make these committees effective then there should be extra secretarial facilities.  I am not looking for an empire growth, but the longer one spends on a committee the more one is divorcing oneself from the very important matter of relating to one's constituents. Any Deputy who does not relate to his constituents will be reminded very quickly of Deputies who do so.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister picked the Small Business Committee out of the clouds.  I find myself much in agreement with what the Minister has said, not here today but elsewhere, in relation to enterprise promotion, about investment, base, a climate for small industries.  In his absence from the House I said to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, that I wished the Minister for Finance would display the same views on the need to promote enterprise, incentive and investment as the Minister at present in the House has done fairly consistently.</P>
    <P>I do not think a committee is necessary for that purpose.  The most important thing is to ensure that the Government by their actions will not impose penalties, disincentives, on those engaged in small businesses.  We are in the extraordinary position that the level of investment was never lower in the last ten years than it is now.  It is about 24 per cent of total national income and it is getting lower. The money is there.  There are people prepared to put up funds.  The people who are not there are those who are not <Col N="2421" /> prepared to take risks and headaches because they find that the tax climate is penal, that the attitude towards business is not very encouraging, and unless the Minister present is prepared to persuade his colleagues to change that, we can come up with all the recommendations we like about small business here but the real crunch will be whether the tax climate can be improved considerably.</P>
    <P>By definition about 98 per cent of businesses here come within the European definition of small and medium-sized industries.  What we are talking about is applying effectively the funds which are coming from the social fund in growing amounts.  Next year it may be of the order of up to £200 million.  We should inject that money into management, into strengthening marketing proposals, strategies and so on.  In this way we could spare a great deal of the money which is at present being swallowed up by State agencies.  I would prefer to see this money going directly to the industries concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to mention marine resources. This is one area which must be considered as a priority.  This fact illustrates what I mean.  Apparently one-third of 1 per cent of what we are providing in our Estimates this year is going to fisheries.  That is the place we give fisheries on our list of priorities. This is a matter on which we could reach some degree of consensus in the long term.  We should ensure that fisheries is given more than one-sixth of the Estimate for the Department of Labour. The allocation for that section this year is £18,700,000 compared with £19,500,000 last year.  In almost every other area the amount provided this year was higher &mdash; salaries, wages and allowances were up 13 per cent, post office services were up 96 per cent, and office machinery and supplies were up 24 per cent, but when it comes to developing one of our basic resources the allocation is down.  I hope the Government will accede to our request to increase the allocation for fisheries and that they will figure very prominently in our discussions in the committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I welcome <Col N="2422" /> this debate.  The purpose of setting up these committees is to attempt to reform the system which operates in this House.  The first reform I would like to see is in the setting up of committees each time a new Dáil is elected.  I have been in this House on three opening days and have noticed that the process of reconstituting and setting up existing committees is so unwieldly that in some of the sessions some committees never got off the ground, and others met once to elect a chairman.  I hope the first reform will make it simpler to bring these committees into operation as soon as another Dáil is constituted.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition, in a lukewarm manner, accepting that these committees should be set up.  I felt very cynical when I saw the number of new committees the Opposition proposed, as well as the list put forward by the Minister, Deputy John Bruton.  I thought there would be so many committees that there would not be enough Deputies to service them and that the system would collapse before it started.  I was very pleased to hear that the Opposition Party were going to help set up these committees and take part in them.  I welcome particularly the commitment that the Committee on Marital Breakdown and the Committee on Women's Affairs would be set up shortly. I was disappointed they were not on today's list but admittedly these are more sensitive subjects than some of the issues mentioned here and I understand agreement on them will be reached shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said it would be better if a few committees were set up to get the ball rolling and then to assess what progress was being made, but there is a problem about this method.  These other areas which need to be examined will not go away.  We cannot say items A, B, C and D are the most important, that we will start with them and if they are successful we will then set up the other committees. Unfortunately all the other problem areas are still there.  When setting up committees we should ensure that they are as broad in scope as possible so that they are effective, and have a purpose and achieve the Minister's objective, <Col N="2423" /> which is to make the work of this House more relevant and to improve the public's image of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>Over the last few months there seems to have been a concerted effort to undermine the democratic process and elected Members.  The people who indulge in this exercise are very shortsighted because they are undermining our democracy.  It is the general public who elect Members to this House.  If they are not satisfied with the way we are working they can get rid of us by electing somebody else in our place.  The more sniping is done here the more it will rebound on the snipers at election time and the public have had too many opportunities in the last few years to show their displeasure with elected representatives.  The public image of this House is not good.</P>
    <P>As I said, I welcome the setting up of these committees.  We all know what happens when legislation is introduced and passed.  At that stage we start getting letters and submissions from interested bodies.  By the time we have read all the correspondence and assessed it, it is too late to put any good ideas which have been brought to our attention into action. I see as one of the main aims of these committees, particularly the Committee on Legislation, allowing interested groups and individuals to make submissions on legislation in the pipeline so that good ideas from people on the ground can be incorporated.  Another advantage of the committee system is that it gives the public an opportunity to see that there are many areas where there is no disagreement between the Government and the Opposition Parties.  There are many areas of policy where there is no disagreement.  At the moment it appears that if the Government say something it behoves the Opposition to oppose it and <i>vice versa.</i>  That is not a very realistic way to carry on our business.  We all know that a Government Deputy often agrees with a great deal of what is said by an Opposition Deputy and <i>vice versa.</i>  The committee system will give us an opportunity to thrash out these areas and to reach a consensus on matters where there is no disagreement.  The country will be <Col N="2424" /> the better for that.  Our legislation will be the better for it, and a number of Departments will be the better for it, if we can work out those areas of consensus, and not fight in here about political differences because we feel we must oppose something since that is the nature of the House.  I see that as one of the major advantages of these committees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey talked about his fears that these committees would introduce more restrictive measures than already exist for Members.  These restrictive measures have been there for a long number of years.  There were opportunities to change them.  Deputy Haughey and his party should accept that it is time for change, come with us in setting up these committees and take part in the committees with enthusiasm and open heartedness. I agree with Deputy Haughey in his reservations and concern that the committees will find it difficult to get a quorum. I do not think that is a good reason not to institute committees.</P>
    <P>It is up to each of us to examine our conscience and, when the committees are set up, to make an effort to take part in them.  Over and over again we have protested that we are here as legislators, and to do more than constituency work.  The buck has to stop here.  We will now be given an opportunity to take part in these committees, to take part in the formulation of legislation, in the examination of public expenditure and the formulation of policy.  Once these committees are set up, it is over to us to show we have the way and the heart to take on the job.  We must make an effort to make the committees work.</P>
    <P>I want to say something to the Minister and to the people who will be arranging the meetings of these committees.  It is very important that they should meet on a day which is suitable for all members. It is easy for me to say any day suits me because I live in Dublin.  We all know that Deputies who live far from the city have to get back to their constituencies.</P>

      <P>I will cut my remarks very short.  I hope the committees will meet on days when rural Deputies will be able to attend, and that they will not find themselves caught between trying to get back to their constituencies on Fridays and trying to attend the committees.  I hope the Minister will examine carefully the days on which the committees will meet to ensure that all Deputies can play their full part.</P>
      <P>I made this point in the debate on Dáil reform.  The image of the Dáil needs to be improved.  Over the past few months there has been an increase in the number of groups coming into the Dáil.  I do not know whether that is because so much is being written about the Dáil and its irrelevancy. I do not know whether that is drawing people in to see what is going on.  We should look very carefully at the kind of image we want to project.  We could improve the image of the Dáil if we had a proper booklet and a video film showing what goes on at meetings of these committees.  It is not possible for people to sit in on all the committees.</P>
      <P>A well prepared video film of the history of the House and the working of the House would be of assistance.  It would give the public an idea of what goes on at these committee meetings.  Deputy O'Kennedy said the general public get a synopsis of what goes on in the Dáil sketch, but that is a very narrow view of the work of the Dáil.  I recommended to the Minister that he should improve the image of the Dáil by having a proper video prepared which can be shown at regular intervals to visitors.  Then they can be shown into the House and they may go away with a better understanding of the role of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that a backbench Deputy has to sit in the House for three hours and five minutes in order to make a five minute contribution underlines in a very real way the need to give backbenchers some committees into which they can make an input.  This point demonstrates the practical difficulties backbenchers have.  I welcome these committees, but I want to make a few <Col N="2426" /> points which I have trimmed down to size because of the time constraints.</P>
      <P>I want to know what happened to the Joint Committee on the European Communities. I see it is proposed to set it up again.  Before we embark on the setting up of a plethora of new committees, for all of which I have some excitement &mdash; they will do an enormous amount of good &mdash; I want to say that the way in which the EEC committee has worked since its foundation has been nothing short of scandalous.  That committee is supposed to be the watchdog of this House and a watchdog for the people of Ireland in relation to the enormous amount of EEC legislation which is flung at us week after week.  I do not believe that committee is discharging the function it was set up to discharge.</P>
      <P>I served on it for a short time after the 1981 election.  It was not a postman who arrived at my door every morning but a post office van with bundles of literature from the EEC.  Even to read a summary of them would be a mammoth task indeed.  In my excitement about these new committees, and having regard to the Minister's enthusiasm about them, I want him to look at what has happened to a committee which was at the core of this House and at the core of EEC legislation. All of the directives coming to the committee were not properly checked and did not come onto the floor of this House.  When did we last have a debate on proposals from the Joint Committee on EEC legislation?  I cannot remember it in my time, and I have been here two years almost to the date.  After three elections it feels like 20 years.  We have not debated anything from a joint committee about which we all expressed delight and enthusiasm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had great hopes for the committee on semi-State bodies.  There was an enormous amount of work for that committee to do.  When was a recommendation from that committee accepted by this House? I cannot remember even one and, from my cursory examination of the record, I cannot find any recommendation from that committee which was accepted by the House.  We could come to the conclusion that we all meant well; it was a great <Col N="2427" /> committee, it was an all-party committee; but all it had to do was to lay a report before the House.  It did not have to get it debated in the House.  By the time it reports nobody is interested.  It gets a small space in the newspapers.  A debate will have to be mandatory on the Committee on State-sponsored Bodies if it comes up with a report or an idea.  There is no point in sending out the report with all the other bumf every morning in the post.  Otherwise it ends up in the Library and we are told that if we want to read it we can read it in the Library.</P>
    <P>I do not want these new committees to meet the same pitfalls which have come in the way of our existing committees, and I want us to look at our existing committees and see if we can improve them.  They are limping along.  They are helpful, but they are not doing anything like the work they were intended to do in terms of speeding up the work of this House.  A debate on a report from the Committee on State-sponsored Bodies should be mandatory as soon as possible after it is submitted.  There is a problem about printing reports which I can never understand.  Printing of these reports seems to take months.  Yet Dáil Reports on Question Time can be produced almost overnight.  That whole problem has to be sorted our urgently.</P>
    <P>The Joint Services Committee is not working either.  On the Order Paper there is a reference to regulating and supervising the operation of the research service for Members.  What research service for Members?  I honestly do not know.  In fairness to the staff in the Library, they give you all the books you want; but to put in the Order Paper &ldquo;to regulate and supervise the operation of the research service for Members&rdquo; is an exercise in political licence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope I have demonstrated that while it is nice to have committees I should prefer them to work better.  With regard to the Committee on Developing Countries it says in the <Col N="2428" /> absence of a member from a particular meeting of the joint committee, a person who is a Member of the Dáil may vote in his place, and if someone is absent a proxy vote will be allowed.  I am not sure I like this new principle being slipped in when it does not apply to any other committee. I do not think it serves any useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the Committee on Public Expenditure will not be directly concerned with the annual Estimates but &mdash; and this is beautiful ministerial language &mdash; with the longer-term review of spending programmes.  In other words, we can lock it up and they can spend the next five years in a longer-term review of spending programmes in any area of public expenditure they so choose.  If they like something they can report to the House and, if not, it does not matter because we can tell the public we have a Committee on Public Expenditure.  Will that include capital expenditure?  If so, it is quite useless because the Government can make massive expenditure on any capital project one cares to mention and this committee can look at that project in an academic way but cannot deal specifically with it.  This committee sounds nice but this longer-term review of spending programme is precisely what they will spend their life at.  The Minister has specifically said it cannot deal with annual Estimates and I wonder if the immediacy of that committee is to be taken out of the political arena.  I do not see any point in the committee engaging in a longer-term review of public spending because we were told today that a national planning board and inter-departmental committees will deal with that.  I support the Minister in his desire to attack public expenditure but I do not think the longer-term review is the answer.  The Minister said that non-commercial State-sponsored bodies will be dealt with by this committee, but that will confuse many issues.  The semi-State bodies committee should deal with the non-commercial semi-State bodies.  I do not see why the Minister split up the semi-State body between the existing committee on semi-State bodies and another committee, the Committee on Public Expenditure.  It is very confusing <Col N="2429" /> and all those semi-State bodies should be put together.</P>
    <P>Individual Deputies and Senators are appointed because they have expertise in an area and may be very interested in a certain Bill.  I do not like the idea of a standing committee which deals with all Bills and which other people can visit if they wish.  There should be a different committee for each Bill because the different areas of expertise should be clearly separated.  For far too long there have been too many deputations and too many pressure groups at Ministers' doors and too many queues in Merrion Square.  All the sectional groups are queuing to see Ministers and some of them proudly boast that they will be on a deputation to see the Minister in three months' time. All this back door approach by pressure groups will be stopped if this committee deals with those people and lets them put their case publicly to a committee on legislation.  If they feel strongly about something they should bring their delegation to the committee and state their objections openly.  They should not be continually pressurising Ministers of any Government.  A ridiculous deputation tradition has built up here and it is a headache for most people.  What they say behind closed doors to the Minister and what he says to them is probably not what would be said at a properly convened legislation committee where they have to put their case publicly on the record as we do in this House.</P>
    <P>Law reform should not be included in this committee because I see it as another device for delaying reports from the Law Reform Commission.  I have been screaming from these benches for a report from the commission on the question of nullity.  They have now been studying it for seven years and I should not like this committee to be another filter through which all these reports have to go from the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>It is not just reform of this House which is needed.  There is also a need for reform of the whole public service.  I urge the Minister to expedite his investigations and bring forward his proposals to reform the public service.  The Minister has gone some way today in improving the image <Col N="2430" /> of elected representatives.  I think it was Deputy Gay Mitchell who said that the role of the Deputy is much maligned.  The image of politicians has taken a severe battering and I compliment the Minister on going some way towards improving it. However, there is a long way to go before the profession of politician reaches the status which the people deserve.  In that regard I ask the Minister to give the Deputies proper research facilities and remuneration.  For too long there has been this ridiculously apologetic view of what politicians earn.  The official income for a Deputy is £13,800 per annum and I do not think any Deputy should apologise for receiving that, considering the amount of work involved.  The expenses of doing the job are never taken into account by the people who criticise them. Average expenses are well over half that figure in terms of doing the job.  If a Deputy in this House on £13,000 a year has £5,000 or £6,000 for his family after expenses, I challenge him to get up and show it to the public of Ireland.  My contention is that they have not.  I do not say this in a sense of Deputies looking for more money, but it is time that the public representatives stood up and fought back.  We should have fewer Deputies and more should not be created, Constitution or not.  Let us close the door and get on with the work.  They should be properly paid and given research facilities and made publicly accountable in a greater sense.  They should be given time and the facilities to do committee work and be remunerated.  This would give responsibility back to the House.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to deal in ten minutes with the subject of this debate as I have attempted to do.  In his programme for Government, the Minister says that Estimates will be before the Dáil in September. I wonder what the Minister's intentions are in that regard.</P>

      <P>First, I must say how opposed I am to anything which savours of a charade.  I have heard people say that they have a guarded welcome for these committees.  I applaud the Minister for endeavouring to reform this House, but my own experience of committees was gained in sitting for four years on the Committee of Public Accounts, the most important committee of the House.  The secretary of that committee waited for us outside in the mornings with sweets, coaxing us in to make a quorum.  That was because at the time there were people who had other interests, business and political&mdash;committees of a corporation or county councils or their businesses to attend to&mdash;and could not come. Secretaries from Departments&mdash;an entourage of officials&mdash;were all there to answer any questions which might be put, but which were never put.  In circumstances where I do not see any change in the <Col N="2432" /> personnel or personalities of representatives of this House since then, I must have a guarded welcome for the proposed committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal first with the points made by Deputy Haughey.  It is not the intention of the Government that these committees will be used in any way as a means of the Government hiding from the necessity of taking decisions.  There has been little experience in the past of committees of the Dáil being used for that purpose. Governments very often have tended to use inter-Departmental committees or outside committees established by them as an excuse, but have never used committees of this House.  There are people from the other parties on those committees who can expose any attempt by the Government to use them for that purpose. That is not the case with expert committees established outside this House.  Therefore, I do not have the worry that Deputy Haughey has.</P>
      <P>Other deputies&mdash;Deputy Mitchell, in particular&mdash;have dealt with the need to make a distinction between the Committee on Public Expenditure and the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not think that I need add to what Deputy Mitchell has said in answer to Deputy Haughey in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Committee on Small Businesses, it should be recognised in this House that the Small Firms' Association of the Confederation of Irish Industry, an important and influential body, have been calling for the appointment <Col N="2433" /> of a Minister for Small Firms.  A committee of this House is probably a better response to that call for a special initiative to recognise their problems, more important is that it does not involve the massive staff that a new Ministry would involve and that it will involve Deputies on all sides.  If we get a consensus on all sides on what needs to be done about small firms, a continuity despite changes of Government that might occur, we can create an environment which will make small firms feel at home in the economy and deal with the problems which Deputy Haughey mentioned as facing small firms.  We all know what should be done here and now to solve the problems of small firms, and it is hoped that the Government will have the courage and ability to do this.  Those problems have grown up over time, decisions taken individually by Government which added more and more of a burden to small firms.  Even if we do succeed in solving the problems this time, to avoid the same problems coming up again the existence of a committee on small firms in this House would prevent any measures being adopted which were injurious to the interests of these small firms.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputies who suggested that we should perhaps have a time limit in debates such as this, including one which might apply to myself.  I am sorry that there have been Deputies who could not contribute.</P>
    <P>I would like to return to the point made by Deputy Lenihan, who suggested that in some way the Committee on Public Expenditure were taking from the ultimate responsibility of the Government and the Dáil itself for public expenditure. That is not the case.  The Committee on Public Expenditure will not interfere with the normal Estimates process, which will be the responsibility of the Government to propose and of the House to dispose. It will be looking at trends in public spending, at particular programmes in the long-term way which Deputy Brennan mentions&mdash;not long-term in the sense that it will not produce any report for five years; it would take individual programmes&mdash;for example, education&mdash;<Col N="2434" /> and produce a report on educational expenditure within a year of being set up. Then it would go on to deal with, perhaps, fisheries expenditure, produce a report within six months and go through the cycle of various programmes in that way.</P>
    <P>It will deal with a point mentioned by Deputy Brennan, in that the Government will be required to provide time for debates on reports of the Committee on Public Expenditure.  Deputy Brennan made an eloquent case for extending that provision to other committees as well. Let us see how it works with the Committee on Public Expenditure.  If it proves to be a valuable and practical asset to the work of that committee, then we have a standard procedure which will enable it to be extended to other committees as well.</P>
    <P>To deal with a further point made by Deputy Lenihan, we should not see the introduction of these committees as in some way an imitation of the American model.  I agree that the American model of government, with the separation of Houses, is entirely different from ours. What this is attempting is to bring our system a little closer to the continental system where there are, as a regular course of action, committees operating in most continental legislatures.  Unfortunately, we have imitated the British system far too much, to our disadvantage over the last sixty years, and this is a small movement away from that model.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy that the committee work may get away from personality politics, which have been the bane of political life here.  I am sorry to hear what Deputy Brennan has to say about the Joint EEC Committee and the Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies. To a great extent, that is the fault of the committee members themselves.  They have not been coming into the House insisting that their reports be debated.  In addition to attending the committee meetings, they should be demanding time for discussion.</P>
    <P>The Joint Services Committee will provide for dealing with the research service. We have such a service in the library.  It is not being used adequately and is not <Col N="2435" /> perhaps staffed adequately.  This new committee will give it a profile which will, it is hoped, make it improve in both regards.</P>
    <P>This reform will be accompanied by a reform of the public service.  It is, I understand, the intention of the Minister for the Public Service to bring forward proposals which will be considered by the Dáil some time later this year or early next year.  I thank all Members who contributed to this debate and also the Opposition Deputies and Deputies on the Government backbench who assisted me and Deputy Barrett in preparing these proposals.  I hope the confidence the House places in these proposals will prove to be justified in the light of experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to recognise the need for the development of the Border region and requests that available EEC funds be used more extensively for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I note that the Government have put down an amendment to this motion which states:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Eireann&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>recognises the need for the development of the Border region and urges the local authorities and other agencies concerned to ensure that full use is made of the opportunities offered by the Special Border Areas Programme for the improvement of the economic and social situation of those areas.</P>
      <P>This is a simplistic approach.  The Government say they will urge the local authorities and other agencies to be more alert, but it is the Government who have the finger on the purse strings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate will enable us to seek clarification of a number of points concerning the system of allocation of the fund. There is an EEC publication relating to <Col N="2453" /> Regulation No. 2165 of 1980 and No. 724 of 1975 which states that the Border areas of Northern Ireland and Ireland are among the most disadvantaged areas of the EEC being characterised by low population density, a labour force highly dependent on agriculture, high unemployment, emigration and low incomes.</P>
    <P>We do not seem to be operating the Border Counties Fund satisfactorily.  The fund was for £20.5 million and was allocated in 1980.  It is time to have a clear look at it.  We must set up an operating structure which would ensure that schemes are co-ordinated.  When Ireland decided by a massive vote to enter the EEC we all looked forward to the benefits which would accrue from our membership. We thought funds would be made available for the less developed areas.  Many people have questioned whether the benefits have been as great as we hoped.  I am satisfied that overall our entry has been beneficial.  However, we have not made proper use of the funds that are available.</P>
    <P>People living in the Border areas looked forward to EEC entry, first of all because it brought both sovereign Governments into the same trading group.  In addition it was known that Border areas are of their nature deprived areas.  The fact that our Border areas are deprived is an indictment of every Government for the last 50 years.  The Border areas have been neglected.  There are politicians here who trot out their concern for the region now and again and then conveniently forget all about it.</P>
    <P>In the past I made loud protests about EEC funding because it was either insufficient or was not forthcoming.  There are funds available now which are not being used and it is only right that I should protest equally loudly.  I mentioned the special programme fund for Border areas.  It was a fund of £20.5 million which was made available for 1980-85.  At the end of the first two years we had only expended £3.4 million.  A sum of £2.1 million was not taken up.  Those are figures I got in reply to parliamentary questions. In reply to a parliamentary question the Minister for Finance said that as far as the unexpended balance from the <Col N="2454" /> EEC special Border area programme fund could be identified on a county by county basis, Donegal received £1.8 million and £1.1 million was unexpended; Cavan spent £500,000 and £606,000 was unexpended; Monaghan spent £398,000 and £191,000 was unexpended; Leitrim spent £391,000 and £34,000 was unexpended; Louth spent £299,000 and £159,000 was not taken up.  On glancing at that one could say local authorities had a lot to answer for.</P>
    <P>When this fund became available Monaghan County Council drew up a comprehensive list of projects the cost of which were scrutinised by technical and other staff.  We came up with the figure in excess of £2 million.  On 6 January 1981 I asked the Minister for Finance for a breakdown of the funding which would be available.  In a letter the Minister stated that a Council regulation was approved which enabled the non-quota section of the European Regional Development Fund to participate in a special five year programme of measures aimed at the improvement of the economic and social situation of the Border areas of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  A tentative allocation of surveys from the special fund has been made as follows: £3.6 million in grants for the development of tourist accommodation; £1 million for the promotion of tourism in the Border counties; £5.3 million for the development of tourist-related amenities; £5.1 million for the improvement of telecommunication services and access to tourist areas, such as improvement of minor roads; £2.2 million for the development of transport activities aimed at providing easier access for tourists to the Border areas; and £3.3 million for grants and marketing aids for craft industries.</P>
    <P>Regarding the £191,000 unexpended in Monaghan, I should like the Minister to explain why, we having submitted our annual list of projects in 1982 in respect of which we sought grant aid, we received from the Department of Finance in January 1983 a notification that £40,000 worth of those projects did not qualify on the criteria laid down.  There have been projects to the extent of £2 million in value submitted but yet this £191,000 is <Col N="2455" /> unexpended.  I find it hard to accept that. Last year our allocation in respect of tourist improvements was £105,000 and in respect of minor road improvements it was £95,000.  The road improvement allocation was expended.  Much more could have been spent under that heading but in 1983 under that same fund from which we expected to get nearly £1 million per year for a five-year period, we received only £80,000.</P>
    <P>In respect of tourist-related projects our allocation is £40,000 and for purposes of road widening and the provision of parking areas along scenic routes, the allocation is £40,000 also.  Why were the criteria not laid down before the £2 million worth of projects was submitted?  We are talking about a Government Department, not about some local club.  There is inefficiency in a Department, whether it be the Department of Finance or of the Environment, that hold a project for so long and then throw it out on the basis that it did not meet the criteria laid down.</P>
    <P>The last item referred to in the letter we received from the Department relates to an allocation of £3.3 million for grants and marketing aids in respect of craft industries.  Having visited the national display at the RDS for a number of years and having seen the displays on the part of the craft industries, both North and South, I concluded that we were weak in this regard in the Border regions.  I asked at county council level that the VEC would become involved.  I even went so far as to get an application form for one of the Kilworth craft centre courses thinking that in those early years we would involve our youth and that on the expiration of the five-year period we would be in a position to avail of this funding.  In February this year Deputy Blaney and I asked by way of parliamentary question what was the position about funding for the craft industries.  The Minister replied that a total of £149,934 by way of grants was provided for craft industries in Counties Donegal and Louth, 50 per cent of this being provided by the non-quota section of the Regional Development Fund, that £500,000 had been allocated to Córas Tráchtála, who <Col N="2456" /> provided marketing aids for small- and medium-sized industries, including craft industries in all the Border counties. More than three times the £149,000 &mdash; £500,000 &mdash; was given to Córas Tráchtála.  Those of us who are involved in cross-Border development and who are concerned as to the expending of that money are anxious to find out why that amount was allocated to CCT.  Is this money being siphoned off in respect of marketing of other industrial development? It is important that money allocated to industries in the Border area be used for that purpose.  I should like to know what the attitude in Brussels would be in that regard.</P>
    <P>Because the Border area so warranted, we secured from the EEC more than £20 million; but it is a matter of great disappointment to me that all our State agencies&mdash;the IDA, county development teams and so on&mdash;were not brought together in an effort to produce a programme by which we could avail of the £3.3 million.  This is an example of where we fall down in terms of the usage of such funds.  It is why I am asking that there be a direct allocation and that we set up a structure in the Border area, be it a board or whatever, with an executive officer to deal with such matters.  It is possible that money would be provided by the EEC for such a structure.  Perhaps we could have something on the lines of SFADCo.  Two-and-a-half years later we are not in a position in the Border area to avail of our allocation.  I should like the Minister to explain how the £500,000 was used to market projects to the extent of £149,000 in two of the five counties.  It does not make sense to me.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is a structural weakness in the operation of this and other funds, control of which rests with Brussels, Dublin, London and Belfast and with a series of committees and of officials and public representatives.  The control is so dispersed and bad that one can only be surprised that anything has been done.  In order to have the development scheme operate properly an overall controlling presence on the ground in the Border area is required. An experienced organiser with a small <Col N="2457" /> back-up staff would be able to turn this scheme into a worthwhile endeavour. This would encourage the provision of other funds, whereas failure to utilise the present position can only inhibit us in terms of other funding.</P>
    <P>The sum of £1.1 million has not been taken up, despite the fact that there are about 1.800 unemployed people in County Monaghan and 11,000 in County Donegal.  If that £1.1 million were handed to some agency tomorrow and they were told to get people at work in Donegal, before the end of the week there would be 600 or 700 people in jobs which would qualify under the terms of that scheme.  The unexpended balance of £191,000 in Monaghan could provide jobs for 30 or 40 men for a full year.  The Government are passing the buck by stating in their amendment that they are urging the different agencies and the local authorities to be more effective in their approach.</P>
    <P>The record of SFADCo is a prime example of what can be achieved with the right will and leadership and it is an example which could well be studied by councils in the Border region.  I would ask the Minister if SFADCo or some other agency could examine the situation with a view to improving it.</P>
    <P>Expenditure at the end of two years amounts to 38 per cent of the total available in that period.  It is a national scandal that funds should remain unexpended when employment is so badly needed. The massive under-expenditure has not arisen for want of sufficient projects.</P>
    <P>A recent occurrence shows yet again that the Government do not recognise the problems of this area.  I refer to a letter from the secretary of the Minister for Health sent on his authorisation to the North Eastern Health Board a week ago which stated that the board would have to make a decision on the three hospitals in the area&mdash;two in Cavan and one in Monaghan.  He wished the board to let him know what proposals they had for the disposal of these hospitals. Monaghan town has had many problems as a result of troubles in the Border region and has had more atrocities, bombings and shootings than anywhere <Col N="2458" /> else.  Last week a young man who had been married only two months had bullets fired into his chest from a distance of two yards while standing in his bathroom. He suffered six broken ribs and a broken wrist and is now lying in Monaghan hospital. The Minister, without visiting either Cavan or Monaghan, has decided with the flick of a pen to dispose of this hospital.  We cannot allow that type of attitude to continue.  Such people have no appreciation of the difficulties in the region where there have been so many atrocities.</P>
    <P>There have also been many problems in small family-type industries dealing with meat processing, pigs, ducks and broilers.  The Government are taking in terms of closing down a basic component of our infrastructure, leaving people with no option but to travel 50 miles for medical attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance also increased the price of petrol and wrecked the economy in the area for several months.  It is accepted that there was a loss of 25 per cent or 30 per cent in trade during those months until the relationship between sterling and the punt altered the position, not due to assistance from the Government or any State agency.</P>
    <P>On 11 January 1983 the Minister for Finance announced that the Commission of the European Communities had approved the commitment of £14.7 million in Regional Fund aid for Ireland, which represented a partial reimbursement of Exchequer expenditure.  He went on to give a list various infrastructural projects but not one penny was to be spent in the five Border counties.  The Government and various State agencies are hiding behind this type of allocation saying that there is a special Border counties fund.  This is a myth as far as we are concerned and we are to get nothing of that £14.7 million.</P>
    <P>Donegal and Leitrim are classified as severely handicapped under the disadvantaged areas scheme and qualify for cattle headage payments.  Something like 24 per cent of Monaghan has now been declared severely handicapped and a slightly higher percentage of Cavan is so <Col N="2459" /> designated.  Both these counties in their entirety should have been declared severely handicapped, but this was not the case.  Another review is coming up and submissions will be made to Brussels before the end of the year and it is my hope that the imbalance will be rectified.</P>
    <P>According to An Foras Talúntais, 77 per cent of land in Cavan and 44 per cent of the land in Monaghan is marginal, that is, land which is difficult to drain and expensive to maintain.  Many schemes, including the western drainage package, have been suspended because finance is not available.  We must rectify at the first opportunity the problem whereby a county where 77 per cent of the land is marginal has been declared severely handicapped only to the extent of 30 per cent.  The figures giving a comparison of farmers in various regions prove that Counties Monaghan and Cavan should in their entirety be declared severely handicapped.</P>
    <P>There seems to be little appreciation by politicians and people in the remainder of the country of the problems of the Border area.  The Border area we are talking about constitutes 20 per cent of the total land area of the island and the population there amounts to 15 per cent of the island's total.  We are talking about a substantial area and a large population which surveys have shown clearly are at standards below those of the rest of the island.  I would like the Minister to take that into consideration.  A feature of the entire Border area is the dependency rate, that is the ratio of persons under 15 and over 64 years of age to those in the active age group, which is 75 per cent as against the national average of 70 per cent.  Unemployment is above the national average at 20 per cent in every area, and in some parts of the region 50 per cent of the work force are unemployed.</P>
    <P>The EEC assessment to which I have referred sets out how underprivileged and neglected the Border region is.  A more lengthy and detailed analysis of this position is set out in this report on the Erne catchment which was prepared by a team of consultants, Brady, Shipman <Col N="2460" /> &amp; Martin and P. A. Management Consultants Limited.  It is in that context of urgent need that we protest about the failure to use these available funds.  The Erne catchment study was launched in 1979.  The report was presented in 1980 and it was accepted by the sovereign Governments and by the local authorites. Prior to the issue of this report a number of local authorities commissioned management consultants Stokes Kennedy and Crowley to examine the situation in that area, at fairly high cost.  The catchment study was carried out by P. A. Management Consultants Limited and Brady Shipman &amp; Martin and presented. Three years afterwards nothing has happened. In 1978 I was in contact with Mr. Giolitti, a Commissioner of the EEC, and I issued an invitation to him to visit the region.  The North Eastern Regional Development Organisation visited Brussels in 1980 and they renewed the request.  He has not visited the region, and that is a great pity.  I wrote to him a few months ago and in March I received a reply.  I had pointed out to him our disappointment at the fact that nothing has been carried out regarding the consultants' report.</P>
    <P>In the course of his letter he admitted that he was a little perturbed at the implications of the Erne catchment study which was jointly commissioned and financed by the Irish and British Governments and the Commission and that the high hopes raised had not given rise to concrete action.  He went on to say that he had received the first progress reports on the Border areas programme covering the period June 1981 to December 1981 and, while it was a relatively short period in which to judge the development of the Community measure, he had noted that certain of the recommendations in respect of tourist accommodation had already been undertaken.  The ones undertaken were those I have outlined where we failed to take up the money.</P>
    <P>That Erne study should have had terrific benefits for the complete region.  It would have been very positive in regard to cross-Border development because it involved all of county Fermanagh, a portion of Tyrone, half of County <Col N="2461" /> Monaghan, all of Cavan and portion of Leitrim.  It covered a very wide area. Included were the Woodford River, and the Ballymore-Ballyconnell Canal, the complete Erne catchment for drainage, and a spread of tourist facilities and amenities for the development of the area.  I made inquiries in Brussels during the early part of this year and it seems that nothing on the ground is being done in this respect.</P>
    <P>At the end of last year I was in contact with Mr. Prior, Secretary for State for Northern Ireland.  Last September he made a speech in which, according to the press, he cast the blame on the people in the South for the insufficient headway made in cross-Border developments.  I wrote to him and received a reply from the British Embassy which stated:</P>
    <P>In your letter you mentioned the drainage of the Erne catchment area. The Secretary of State shares your view of the importance of this project and work is now underway: The Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland in conjunction with the Office of Public Works in the Republic is presently involved in the design of a draft scheme for the Finn-Lackey rivers. Design work on the River Blackwater cross-Border drainage scheme is well advanced and details are expected to be published soon.</P>
    <P>You also referred to the Monitoring Group which played an important role on behalf of the Councils on both sides of the border during the Consultants' study of the Erne Catchment Area.  As you rightly say the group fell into abeyance after the report of the study was published.  But the Northern Ireland Office believe that some members of the Councils involved are now anxious to reactivate the Monitoring Group,</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to go ahead and try to get that off the ground.  It was worthwhile.  The initial allocation was £80,000, £40,000 from the EEC and £20,000 each from the two sovereign Governments.  I ask that this report be not allowed to gather any more dust.</P>
    <P>Given the urgent need of the limited <Col N="2462" /> works and the struggle to secure EEC funding for them it might be asked why a large part of the fund has been left unexpended.  I believe that we are looking a gift horse in the mouth.  Any country getting £1 for £1 at a time like this should go open-armed to collect it.  An amendment by the Minister saying that he is going to urge local authorities to do something about it is not good enough. Something positive must be done.</P>
    <P>The report I have referred to mentioned telecommunications.  That is a laugh.  In the area where I live we have still a number of manual exchanges. People are coming into this House about them day after day and I heard a Minister of State in the Department responsible for Posts and Telegraphs claiming that we would have telephones on demand inside a few months.  They expect to hand them down like packets of sweets.  In the area I have referred to, not alone can we not get telephones for years, but the system has deteriorated since most of the other areas of the country went automatic. We have appealed about this year after year and money is made available for it in the Border Counties Fund.</P>
    <P>In that area the roads structure is not good.  Research done recently by the technical staff of Monaghan County Council revealed that we would require to get and spend twice the money that we have been spending even to keep our roads passable.</P>
    <P>If we are sincere about improving cross-Border co-operation, about building bridges between the people on both sides and improving the climate between both communities we should spend more money on road structures in those areas. The connecting roads between national primary and national secondary roads, North and South, should be improved. The Minister should go to Brussels and get agreement for additional money to improve facilities in those areas.  The goodwill exists in Brussels but we are not availing of the handouts.  The Minister should ensure that Government agencies responsible for expending EEC funds in Border areas do not fall down in their task.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;recognise the need for the development of the Border region and urges the local authorities and other agencies concerned to ensure that full use is made of the opportunities offered by the Special Border Areas Programme for the improvement of the economic and social situation of those areas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The motion by Deputies Leonard, Conaghan and Kirk asks the Dáil to call on the Government to recognise the need for the development of the Border region and requests that available EEC funds be used more extensively for this purpose. I do not think there is a great necessity for any Member to stress the need that exists in Border areas to secure the greatest possible rate and level of development we can.  There is no need for any Member to insist that we should use whatever source of funds that are available to the maximum possible extent.</P>
      <P>In approaching the problem we should be conscious of the means that are at our disposal.  We should also be conscious of the fact&mdash;I am sure Deputy Leonard agrees&mdash;that the people aware of what is required in the Border areas are those who live and work there.  It was for that reason that I put down the amendment to change slightly the direction of the motion and bring it into closer conformity with present requirements.  My amendment urges local authorities, and the other agencies concerned, to ensure that full use is made of the opportunities offered by the Special Border Areas Programme for the improvement of the economic and social situation of those areas. Deputy Leonard spent a lot of time talking about unexpended balances in the fund and asked why that was so.  Those remarks, and questions, are very much to the point.  It is to get at that point, and highlight it, that I have put forward my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fund was set up to deal with a particular problem in Ireland and in the <Col N="2464" /> context of the review of the regional development fund which gave rise to what is known as the non-quota section. The measures which the operation of this special section of the fund in Ireland covers are, development of tourist accommodation, tourism promotion, provision of amenities and infrastructure directly linked to the development of tourism, cultural and recreational facilities, improvement of communications giving access to tourist areas, the development of transport activities aimed at providing easier access for tourists to those areas and the establishment and development of craft industries and marketing aids for small and medium-sized undertakings.  I read that list out to make it clear what is involved in the operations and to outline the structures that would be appropriate for those activities.  When we look at the areas covered by the fund we see that in the case of a number of them we have agencies or structures to deal with such activities and it would be unnecessary to set up a new bureaucracy or organisation to handle the activities of the fund.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a fund which is due to operate over a five-year period and what will happen at the end of that five years is a different matter.  We are about half way through that term and we should concentrate on getting the maximum advantages from those resources during that period.  My amendment is designed to focus attention on the aspect of local initiative in the operation of the fund.  Those who are in the best position to define what is required in the Border areas in respect of the activities covered by the fund are those who live in that region.  For example, those involved include local authorities, Bord Fáilte, Udarás na Gaeltachta, CTT and bodies and agencies which need the input and advice from local level to design and pick the projects most required for those areas.</P>

      <P>In County Donegal.  The purpose of the programme is to foster the development of activities in the Border area in the sectors I mentioned.  Up to the end of 1982 more than £8 million had been allocated in the Vote from my Department for the purposes covered by the fund but by the end of last year £5.6 million had been drawn by the agencies and local authorities implementing the programme.  We still have a balance of £2.4 million not used from the amount allocated up to the end of last year, and in this year's Estimate we have located £2 million for the continuation of the scheme.  The amount of money which could be expended this year on projects qualifying under the terms of the fund is £4.4 million, £2.4 million unexpended from the allocation made up to the end of last year and a further £2 million allocated for this year.</P>
      <P>It would be a matter of some concern to me, as it is to Deputy Leonard, that the resources available are used in those areas.  I am anxious that the funds available are used.  It is difficult to make sure that the funds are expended for the purposes covered by the fund if we do not have coming forward the projects in the numbers and size that are justified by the resources we have at our disposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this Government and the previous Government have carried out their proper function in relation to the activities covered by this fund by making the funds available and by expediting the examination and the authorisation of payments for the projects put forward.  There is an area here <Col N="2466" /> which we need to explore.  If we have unexpended balances which are not being taken up we need to go back to the local authorities and the agencies in question to find out what the reasons are.</P>
      <P>Quite honestly I do not believe&mdash;nor do I believe Deputy Leonard believes&mdash; that the reason projects are not coming forward is that they do not exist or cannot be developed.  Deputy Leonard has pointed out some of the needs of the Border areas.  Even when we speak only of the six types of activities are covered by the fund.  I am quite sure we are a long way from having satisfied all of the needs of the Border counties in those activities when we get to the allocation for this year alone.  We must ensure that the projects put forward and assisted are worthwhile projects that will have a lasting effect on the economy of the areas concerned and on the development of those areas.  I know Deputies on all sides of the House will agree with me that there are a number of very good examples from projects that have already been carried out or in some cases initiated.  I have a long list of them here which I do not propose to read out.  All of our colleagues from Border counties will be familiar with a number of these projects where extremely useful work has been done and in many cases where very useful facilities have been made available with the assistance of those funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular questions raised by Deputy Leonard are very much to the point and need fairly close examination in relation to the overall question of whether the fund is operating as we want it to and whether it is generating the kind of projects that are envisaged.  We should remember the way in which the Regional Fund actually operates.  Under the present rules governing the Regional Fund there is no case in which a decision is made on the basis of a direct application by a group, agency or authority in any area of the Community to the Regional Fund authorities in the Commission.  This is for a number of reasons which it would be inappropriate to examine here during the course of this discussion.  All of the applications for assistance from the Regional Fund and all of the funding <Col N="2467" /> made available through the fund are channelled through the national exchequers. There are very good reasons for that which we will not go into here.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that in the context of a five-year programme covering the kind of areas we have been talking about it would be appropriate to set up a new procedure at EEC level for dealing with projects of that kind.  I do not believe either that a case has been made that would allow us to draw the conclusion that we should set up a new structure here mainly for the reason I have already put forward: that we have existing agencies dealing with the kind of areas covered by the fund.</P>
    <P>The operating structures need more review in terms of how the agencies produce the proposals for the projects.  In that connection there can be no fixed procedure for developing projects.  The regional tourism organisations have in a number of cases taken the initiative.  Certain activities covered by the fund are of such a nature that individual initiative is needed.  For example, as far as the fund concerns marketing needs for small and medium-sized industries, obviously the initiative must come from an individual who approaches the agency concerned which then processes the application through.  I believe that interposing another structure, either between the local level and the agencies or between the agencies and the central level would gum up the works by adding an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and of processing to the whole business.  I do not believe that setting up a new agency would in any way help to generate ideas for new projects covered by the fund.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard asked if some of the £3.3 million allocated for marketing aids for craft industries is being creamed off into some other use.  That opens up another area of discussion to which we should give some thought.  The first point I would like to make is that the list of different uses provided in the letter of 1981 from the Department of Finance, from which Deputy Leonard quoted, was the original list of the possible uses to which it was felt funds from this source <Col N="2468" /> could be put.  The original list was an indicative list.  I am sure everybody agrees that it is very difficult to say at the beginning of a five-year period that we will spend exactly so much money on the kind of activity we are talking about here, that we will spend exactly so much money on helping craft industries, that we will spend so much on tourism infrastructure and we will spend so much on any one of the other activities covered.  It was an indicative list which set out broadly the kind of pattern that was expected from the use of the fund.</P>
    <P>I am making that point deliberately because I want to make it quite clear that there is no compelling reason why we should always stick with that particular balance.  If we find, within the kind of criteria laid down for the assessment of projects that come forward in the general areas covered by the fund, that there is a good case in any year for adjusting the weight of effort as between different uses, I would not object to that.  If we find, for example, that there is a good case in a particular year for increasing the amount to be spent on the development of tourist facilities and reducing the amount being spent somewhere else, we could look at that and I would not rigorously exclude any rebalancing of the use of the funds available.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Leonard about whether any of the money which was indicatively allocated for marketing aids is being creamed off for another use the answer is no.  We have the same problem there as arises in other connections in this fund, that is, that some balance of the moneys which have been allocated up to now has not yet been spent, again because the projects have not come forward.  On this point, in relation to the assistance for marketing for small and medium-sized industries, I might refer Deputy Leonard to the first annual progress report on the Special Border Areas Programme which was sent to the Commission at the end of last year.  It covers the operations in 1981. If the Deputy has not already got a copy of this report, I shall be very glad to make it available to him.</P>

In any case, as I have said, I shall be very glad to make it available to Deputies.  The report gives a fairly comprehensive account of what was done during 1981.  We are required to produce an annual report on what has been carried out.  One of the particular values of the report is that it sets out the kinds of projects and activities undertaken under each one of the headings covered by the fund.  In relation to action on small and medium-sized undertakings, there is a listing here of the kinds of things that were undertaken with the assistance of the fund.  For those who are interested and involved in Border areas themselves with the development of projects and forwarding them for approval reference to this report would be of assistance to them in showing how the thing has developed so far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something I could not say just at present; I am not in a position yet to make a full report in relation to 1982.  I would like to get it done fairly quickly so that we can keep track of what is going on under each one of the different headings in the scheme.  This will enable us to ensure, firstly, that we keep up to target in relation to the use of the fund and, secondly, that we can identify whether or not there is a case emerging for a different balance in the use of the funds that are made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the question of the use of the funds so far made available.  With the indulgence of Deputies, I shall give a few figures to illustrate the expenditure that has taken place to date.  Then I want to talk a little about the unexpended balances, as they are and the allocation for this year.  Under the heading of the development of tourist accommodation, expenditure to 31 December last came to £1.129 million; on tourist promotion, <Col N="2470" /> again expenditure to the end of last December came to £340,000; for the provision of amenities and infrastructure linked directly to the development of tourism, cultural and recreational facilities £2.280 million were spent up to the end of last year.  For improvement of communications giving access to tourist areas the expenditure was £925,000.  For the development of transport activities aimed at providing easier access to tourist areas, £235,000 and for the establishment and development of craft industries and marketing aids for small and medium-sized industries a figure of £680,000.  That is the total expended up to the end of December last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact that is a full report for 1982 as well, if one subtracts 1981 from it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, as far as the total figures are concerned.</P>
      <P>The question of the unexpended balance comes up.  As I have said, £2.4 million remain unexpended.  To go through the headings rather quickly &mdash; I seem to have used up a lot of time so far &mdash; the unexpended balances are as follows for the various agencies involved here: Bord Fáilte, £427,000; local authorities, £620,000; the IDA £240,000.  Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Arts Council have used fully the allocations that have been made to them.  The office of Public Works, £390,000; Roinn na Gaeltachta, £50,000; Department of Transport, £367,000; Department of Fisheries and Forestry, £345,000; and Córas Tráchtála have used in full the allocation made to them.  It is that unexpended balance, together with the £2 million allocated for the year, on which we should concentrate and examine the development of projects that will come properly within the scope of the fund so that we reap the benefit of that full amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To reply to one point of detail in relation to a question asked by Deputy Leonard &mdash; he mentioned the difference between a figure of £500,000 allocated for marketing aids and a figure of £149,000 which he understood to have been spent on marketing aids &mdash; the <Col N="2471" /> £149,000 was for craft industries only, the £500,000 is for marketing aids for small and medium-sized industries generally. Again, on that front there is no reason to fear that funds are not being used for the purposes for which they were intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of clarification I should say I was reading a letter I received from the Department of Finance.  As the Minister said himself, they were the initial regulations and did not cover marketing aids.  It mentioned only the manufacture and sale of crafts. Seemingly the criteria were changed later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic point is that none of the funds that have not been used so far have been diverted to any purpose for which they were not intended.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the reason the motion was put down.  I hope Deputy Leonard now appreciates the reason I proposed the amendment.  It was intended to focus attention more clearly on where it appears the difficulty arises.  I want to assure the House that any assistance I or my Department can give in order to assist in the business of bringing forward suitable projects will be given.  However, in response to something Deputy Leonard said, I must make the point that we do have to be careful to ensure that projects put forward conform to the criteria laid down.  It is understandable that Deputy Leonard was somewhat scandalised by the fact that at a time when not all of the fund was expended projects were turned down because they did not conform to the criteria.  It is important that we ensure that the projects do conform to the criteria &mdash; and they are fairly wide &mdash; because we want to make sure, first of all, that we get the kind of value intended from the fund and secondly that the funds continue to be made available.  As Deputy Leonard said, half of the funding is made available from EEC sources.  We do not want to endanger that.  Thirdly, we must ensure that the kinds of projects for which we use the money make a lasting impression on the areas in which they are located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2472" /> Those are the comments I wanted to make and the replies I want to give Deputy Leonard.  I would urge Deputy Leonard to reconsider his view of the amendment and agree with me that it is one that will allow us focus attention on where the real problem seems to be.  I would ask the House to accept my assurance that in dealing with that problem I shall be only too glad to give any assistance required from my Department so that we can get value for money from this scheme.</P>

      <P>Well, the Minister said he did not see the necessity for bringing forward the motion, that the reasons were self-explanatory and that there was common ground between the first speaker and himself in relation to those reasons.  There is a grave necessity to bring a motion like this to the attention of the Minister and the Government.  I am a Deputy from a county with a border extending from Moville in North Donegal down to Pettigo.  The Border which has existed for the past 60 years has created problems for the community which were never dealt with by successive Governments here or by the administration in the Six Counties and it is an unfortunate reflection on the two administrations that an elected representative has to make such an admission.  I hold the belief that people in the border areas, particularly in Donegal, were not considered by the two administrations.  We know how the people in power in the Six Counties operated in relation to the share-out of industry west of the Bann and the other side of the coin was the fact that we were west of the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the limited time available to me I hope to make a case for special consideration <Col N="2473" /> for the whole border region. Donegal, in particular, suffered grievously through the setting up of the Border in the first instance.  The whole economy of the county has been affected because we were completely cut-off from the rest of the country.  Prior to the establishment of this State our natural outlets were Derry and Belfast.  Unfortunately due recognition of the special problems which the Border posed for us was never given.</P>
    <P>I hold that as a result of our entry to the EEC we were in a position to get some benefits from the Regional Fund in order to relieve the problems of the region.  When the communications study was undertaken by our Government and the British Government and supported by Brussels our hopes were raised.  It highlighted the difficulties with regard to communications in the area but unfortunately, after eight years I do not think the programme is on target.  I do not deny that we got some benefits as a result of the study.  Telecommunications have improved reasonably well and we are getting some moneys for road development work.  However, the pace is too slow. Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan were not compensated for the loss of the railways. In turn, our roads structure completely deteriorated and until we got money from the Regional Fund we were totally neglected.  I contend that when EEC moneys became available the share we should have got from central government was cut.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the Border region should be considered in isolation, that a special case should be made for it and an in-depth study should be made. The Border region has difficulties to contend with which the rest of the country have never experienced.  Business people in Donegal must cross the Border frequently to do their work.  There are difficulties with regard to customs procedures and there is also the problem of road blocks and the closure of roads.  All of these add to production costs but no account is taken of them.  Although many studies have been carried out, there has never been an in-depth study of the economic problems facing the Border region.  It is time that the Government <Col N="2474" /> carried out such a study.  If they did this they would find out that there was a justifiable argument for special consideration for the area.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the region of Innishowen, Derry and Strabane.  That has been designated &ldquo;The Black Triangle&rdquo; by the EEC.  Figures released some time ago show that almost one in every three in the north-west depends on social welfare and hand-outs from Governments on both sides of the Border for survival. Two-thirds of Donegal's population of 126,000 are covered by the medical card scheme because the people cannot afford to pay for medical services.  One in every four workers has not got a job.  The Innishowen Peninsula is the most northerly point of the country and the most cut-off area primarily because of the unnatural border that exists there.  In that area 2,800 people are claiming State assistance and when one takes account of their dependants it means that 11,200 people in Innishowen are dependent on assistance out of a total population of 24,000.</P>
    <P>We cannot take this argument in isolation from Derry and Strabane.  We must cross to the other side because one area affects the other.  Strabane is the worst unemployment black spot in Europe.  A staggering 38 per cent of the work force is out of work.  Unemployment in Derry in the past few years has doubled and the figure now almost reaches 12,000.  In County Donegal the figure is 10,500 unemployed out of a work force of 45,000.  This is twice the national average, not taking into consideration the number of secondary school-going children in the region.  There are almost 18,000 secondary pupils in that area and their prospects for a future are grim.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the Minister tonight.  I do not intend to go into the arguments put forward by Deputy Leonard who put his case so well in relation to how this fund is operated and how it has been applied.  There is a wide issue here but I do not think that the fund as it operates at present is dealing with the problems in the Border area.  It will not solve the problem there.  We have a special case and special consideration should be given to the entire Border region.  It <Col N="2475" /> is time that Deputies from that region banded themselves together to get their just claim and to have remedies applied to the poverty and the deprivation of the people along the Border.  This has existed in the last 60 years and no Government have come to grips with it.</P>
    <P>This job must be tackled and the regional fund is not doing it.  It is only tinkering with a position which needs drastic remedies.  Particularly in the Six County area the problems are being aggravated by unemployment which will mean that a desperate situation will exist in the future.  The sovereign Governments here and in London must seriously look at that entire region and try to ensure a future for the children there by providing the necessary industries and the infrastructure which is very bad.</P>
    <P>There is a strong argument particularly for action in relation to the Derry-Donegal Border area.  The Social Affairs Committee of the EEC did a study of the northwest and their report verifies what I have said, that that area is the most impoverished in the EEC.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the powers that be to try to get some action on that report to relieve the chronic problems that exist there.  There should be a project for the Donegal-Derry area that would straddle the Border.  Both Governments should build there the attractions for industrialists to come in to develop the area and to generate employment.</P>
    <P>Lough Swilly provides a massive port with the deepest waters in Europe.  It contributed greatly to the British economy when Britain had full control in this country.  It was one of the safest anchorages for her mighty fleet when she was queen of the waves.  It lies there now idle.  Surely the Departments concerned should come up with an argument for development of that port, particularly considering the congestion that prevails in European waters.  This has been commented on elsewhere by various public representatives and I invite the Minister's comments on it as well.</P>
    <P>In regard to the non-quota section of the EEC fund, the Minister clearly indicated that a lot of that money has been <Col N="2476" /> left unspent.  In the Border region we have the worst communications system in the country.  We have no railways and we have no real road transport system.  We have no air service.  We have been trying to get an airport developed.  The current estimated cost of the airport project is £2.8 million.  Both the regional development organisation and Donegal County Council were given to understand that the project would be funded entirely at national level but that the running costs of the facility would be a matter for Donegal County Council together with other appropriate interests.  It was understood that the finance to provide the facility was being made available from the Special Border Area Programme of the Non-Quota Section of the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    <P>The present position in relation to the project is that Donegal County Council have carried out all the necessary work to identify and acquire a site for the facility and to design and prepare a feasible scheme.  The council encouraged substantial expenditure and entered into major financial commitments.  The basis of the council's actions was a clear commitment by the Government, reiterated on a number of occasions and copperfastened by such decisions as confirmation of the CPO, formal consents under the Navigation Acts and so on.  It is imperative, therefore, that the necessary financial allocations be made by the Government to the council to enable them to meet their financial commitments up to the present and to put the necessary work in hands.  An appropriate decision is all the more urgent because the present Special Border Area Programme will cease in 1985, and every effort should be made to ensure that the allocation for this project from that source will not be lost.</P>
    <P>We earnestly request the Minister to review this project fully and arrange for the necessary allocation to Donegal County Council to proceed with the work now and so avoid the additional cost which will inevitably arise from any further delay.  A sum of £1.6 million has been earmarked for that project and it seems odd that with the commitment and the financial constraints at present on <Col N="2477" /> Donegal County Council we are faced with having to raise a loan to relieve our responsibility.  There is the £1.6 million in the non-quota section which should be made available to get that programme off the ground and to give us our just entitlement, an air service.  That would give some hope of getting people coming into Dublin a transport service to the north west.  Now when they look at the map and inquire how they can get there they are told there is nothing but CIE buses. We in the Border region must band ourselves together, make our case, stick by it and ensure that every avenue will be pursued to give us our entitlement to ease the problems that have been there for 60 years.  It is a situation that would not be tolerated elsewhere in the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say something about the <Col N="2478" /> Geological Survey which is in a state of flux at the moment.  Apparently a task force was set up some time ago to make recommendations on what should be done when the Geological Survey move to their new headquarters.  It appears the steering committee to which this task force were in the process of making recommendations have not yet reported but there were indications on the lines which their report might take.  It appears those recommendations have been pre-empted by an extraordinarily rapid movement in the reorganisation of that side of the Department.  I wonder if this is wise and, if it is a matter of which the Minister is not aware, he should make inquiries about it and see that less haste be followed in this instance until particularly those from abroad who were asked to look into this matter and make recommendations have an opportunity of doing so.  This brings up the question which was dealt with as recently as yesterday by the publication of the report of the Advisory Committee on the Public Service who bemoaned the fact that the relationship between the general civil service and what is called the professional or technical civil service was still as far from solution as it had been several years ago. What is happening here is an effort to ensure that the technical or professional civil servants are kept at a remove&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to move from the Geological Survey and their position within the Department to the general mining position.  The last evening I heard the Minister of State make some typically optimistic and happy noises about mining. I want to point out to him that there is no time I have known when less satisfaction could be expressed in regard to the position of mining here.</P>
      <P>I got some up-to-date figures recently from people involved in mining.  The number of exploration licences today is half what it was five years ago; the number of people employed in exploration is half what it was five years ago; and the amount of money being spent on exploration has shown a marked decline in the last year or two.  Contrary to the satisfaction expressed by the Minister of State the position is the opposite.  I quote from column 1473 of the Official Report of 14 June when, after mentioning all the closures of mines in the last 12 months, he said:</P>
      <P>However, the continued confidence of so many companies in Ireland's potential to produce further commercial base and metal discoveries is heartening.</P>
      <P>I wonder if he spoke to any of those companies because every one of them express the absolute opposite to confidence in Ireland and Ireland's ability to produce anything.  In particular they express their frustration and anger at the financial arrangements that exist here in relation to prospecting and subsequent exploitation of a mine if it is found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had intended to bring with me tonight to quote some paragraphs from it, the chariman's statement of a public exploration company, Oliver Prospecting, of which the chairman is a Dr. Waldron. Their annual report for 1982 issued last week and is available to the Minister and the public.  In it the chairman reviews <Col N="2480" /> the present position in Ireland and ends by saying that their duty to their shareholders makes it incumbent on them to make their further investments in the United States of America and not in Ireland, although they are an Irish public company, and he explains why.  He said even if they find something they do not know where they stand.</P>
    <P>How long is it since any Irish mine made any genuine profit?  How long more is it going to be?  I want to remind the House that we are fortunate to have the largest zinc mine in Europe and the fourth largest zinc mine in the world and it is losing money.  They have had to renegotiate their borrowings and they are in an unhappy situation to say the least. There is another ore body surrounded by them at the same site in Navan which was debated at great length in this House six-and-a-half years ago.  The debate went for almost the entire month of February and some of March 1977.  Unfortunately but for the fact that I had to go to the United States for Saint Patrick's Day we might have continued the debate into April.  It was a very instructive debate and every day we learned more and more.  I began to make forecasts.  For example, I forecast that that particular ore body would not be in production by 1980, three-and-half years later.  That was a cause of great merriment and scoffing at the time.  I forecast that there was a distinct possibility that the £9.54 million agreed to be paid over in 1976, and which was subsequently ratified by legislation, would be wasted money so far as the Irish taxpayer was concerned and that it was a totally misleading concept to think that an equity holding in something as speculative as that could be of any value to the Irish Exchequer.  That was laughed at and I was told we would have enormous dividends in time to come.  We are here this evening six-and-a-half years later, and if we could be guaranteed that our losses were only £9.54 million would we not be lucky?  There is still no planning permission six-and-a-half years after that money was paid over.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, could you imagine anyone paying £5,000 for a house if there was no planning permission, or <Col N="2481" /> £5,000 for a plot on which to build a house if there was no planning permission to enable you to do so?  This very substantial sum of money &mdash; and, of course, it was very much more substantial in 1976 than it is today &mdash; was paid over in these circumstances with disastrous results.  We have, perhaps, the worst example of a bad commercial decision ever made here. There were others where a great deal of money was lost, but it was lost after the event and frequently through circumstances which were beyond people's control, or through unforeseeable circumstances.</P>
    <P>This money was invested not in the company incidentally, but handed over privately to the shareholders for their own personal benefit.  It was not invested in the company and the country has seen the sorry result.  Until such time as a particular system of return to the State that is fairly precisely forecastable is produced here, it seems unlikely that we will ever see the level of exploration we had here in the seventies.  If there was nothing else I did in Opposition, I would wish to work out some system whereby on return to Government &mdash; I do not think we would need to enact it; I think it could be done administratively &mdash; we could hand out to exploration companies coming here looking for licences a set of the circumstances under which they would do their exploration.  It is the uncertainty, above all else, that is causing the drift away from this country and from the exploration here and the loss of interest in mining or exploration in Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with the question of Whitegate and what flows from it.  As recently as in today's papers we have had an indication that a price increase of 7p a gallon for pertol is being sought by the oil companies.  We had an indication from the Minister of State last week that there <Col N="2482" /> would be a reduction of premium petrol of 20 US dollars a tonne on 1 July from Whitegate.  If you combine the two together, the net effect is an increase, according to my calculation, of 3.25p roughly per gallon in the price of petrol.</P>
    <P>To say the least of it, this is extremely disappointing.  I presume the companies place most of the reason for it on the weakness of the púnt in recent months as against the US dollar.  I am entitled to ask the Minister, and he in entitled to ask the companies, what their attitude is at the beginning of each year to buying dollars forward for the year.  They know they will have to pay for oil in dollars.  They know fairly accurately what their requirement will be because they are able to forecast it to within 1 per cent or 2 per cent.  They can cover their dollar requirements quite cheaply in the course of the year.  The cost to them of covering them forward for a year works out at about one-third of 1 per cent per month, which is relatively negligible if you take into account the difference in the interest rates between Ireland and the United States.</P>
    <P>This problem has been added to by the devaluation in March.  It has been made greater from that point of view.  It is very disheartening and discouraging for the Irish consumer of oil, much as his consumption has dropped in recent years, to find that alone in Europe he is paying more for oil.  Here we are talking in terms of increases within the next couple of weeks rather than decreases, when decreases are being passed on everywhere else.  In present circumstances we are entitled to complain about that.</P>
    <P>The Whitegate situation has improved considerably.  The diseconomy, as it is called, is much smaller that it was six months ago.  In this debate we are entitled to information on the present state of play as between the Government and the Commission on the question of the legitimacy or otherwise of the mandatory offtake from Whitegate.  The Commission wrote an unusually strong letter on 1 February last, I think, pointing out to the Government under five or six different headings why, in their opinion, the <Col N="2483" /> arrangement made with the oil companies was in breach of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>Obviously long since the Government will have replied to that.  The House is entitled to know what the position is.  Are the Commission satisfied now, or will they refer it to the court in Luxembourg? If so, has it been referred, or what is the present situation?  The whole question of the future of Whitegate and the security it affords us, is very much bound up with what will happen in relation to this.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister what is the present position about the proposed pipelines for natural gas to Limerick and to Waterford.  In November last, the previous Minister for Energy, Deputy Reynolds, told Bord Gáis Éireann to go ahead with those pipelines and to have the construction carried out in 1983 in order that supply would be available to these cities in January 1984.  No work has started, and we are coming towards the end of June 1983.  There is really no possibility of supply for those two cities in the first half of 1984 and it may well take a good deal longer.  BGE were prepared to do this work, and I wonder why it has been held up, and when it will start. These are only the first two of several spur lines which will have to be built off the main pipeline between Cork and Dublin.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Reynolds spoke on this Estimate the week before last, he asked various questions about the extension of that pipe to Northern Ireland.  Although the Minister of State purported to deal with the energy aspects of this matter, he did not reply to those queries at all, or give Deputy Reynolds that information. I invite the Minister when he is replying tonight to do that.</P>
    <P>I want to draw to the Minister's attention a development which has taken place over the past six to nine months.  We have had the ESB and the Dublin Gas Company both advertising very extensively, electricity in the first instance and gas in the other instance, and inviting the public to consume more and more.  The advertising is really aimed, I suppose, at trying to maintain or increase the market share of each of these forms of energy.  Does <Col N="2484" /> the Minister consider that that kind of useless advertising is in the national interest? Both of these companies have expended large sums of money on advertising and it simply has the effect of increasing energy consumption and trying to get more members of the public to consume one type of energy as opposed to another.  From a national point of view, it is immaterial which is used.  The use of gas is probably preferable from the national point of view but I do not think that two bodies like this &mdash; one a semi-State body and the other up to very recently in receipt of a substantial State subsidy running to many millions of pounds per annum&mdash;should be allowed to do that.  I recall some years ago they tried it and I stopped it then but I notice they are at it again.</P>
    <P>On the question of alternative energies, the Minister of State spoke for some time about this the last day.  I found it particularly disappointing that all the emphasis tended to be placed on forms of alternative energy that seem as a result of the experience of recent years to have no real prospect for this country.  He said most of our resources were being expended on wind energy and small hydro.  With regard to small hydro, some years ago when the ESB were asked to identify such possibilities, the best one they could identify was the weir above O'Brien's Bridge between Clare and Tipperary.  They put a unit there at a cost of about £½ million and its capacity is one megawatt.  If that was the most advantageous one, it does not speak very highly of the other possibilities of what is described as small hydro because that is so small as to be totally negligible.  If we are going to have these at less than a megawatt it does not seem worth spending much money on them because we would want to have hundreds before they would make any appreciable difference to the overall situation here.</P>
    <P>On the question of wind power, where most of our admittedly rather limited resources seem to have been spent in the last few years, we had a session in late February or early March here where the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, was answering questions rather laboriously <Col N="2485" /> for some days.  I think the Minister was engaged in parliamentary reform elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  It was a laborious session because about half an hour was devoted to Deputy Reynolds, Deputy Flynn and others dragging information from the Minister of State in regard to each of 13 wind generators all around the country.  However, it was worth it because it transpired at the end that all 13 of them were broken down, that the ESB had no confidence that any of them would ever work and that as soon as the wind got above x miles per hour they tended to crack up.  They were unsatisfactory generally and there were environmental problems associated with them also.  In the light of that experience, neither of those two forms of alternative energy have much future in realistic terms.  They may, theoretically, be very attractive but they are not realistic commercially. Perhaps it would be better to spend a much higher proportion of our resources on wave energy of which we are fortunate to have probably the greatest resources in the world along our west coast.  Very little money if any, has been spent on it and prospects for this country are far better than they are in these various alternative fields.  Biomass is not very promising either.  It has been discovered, as a result of the work done, that even to establish a very small station would require tens of thousands of acres and the station would still have a capacity of less than five megawatts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The potential of wave energy is enormous but the technical problems are also enormous.  We have an obvious advantage here and it is something on which we should be spending money.  That is why I was a little taken aback to read in the newspapers the other day that we spent £¼ million on a solar demonstration model in Fota Island, Cork.  There is no future for solar energy in this country.  If every day was as sunny as today has been we might have a future but there are few days like that.  Why waste such limited <Col N="2486" /> resources on that sort of thing?  We should leave that to the people who will benefit from it.  It is in their interests to develop it.  We can buy the technology when they do but why spend money on something like that rather than spend it on something in regard to which we have the greatest advantage in the world and, therefore, have the greatest vested interest in promoting?  Other countries will not spend money in promoting this because there is no point in their doing so.  Do the Italians spend anything on wave energy?  They do not; they spend it on solar energy.  But we seem to do the opposite although we have all the possibilities in relation to waves.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a few words about the Shannon Free Airport Developement Company.  We had a debate on it here recently and I made some suggestions at the time.  I should like to put one of those suggestions briefly before the House for the consideration of the Minister and especially for the consideration of the board of the company who are struggling to meet the challenges and the difficulties that beset them in that region at present. They should now establish a marine development division within the company to plan and to co-ordinate the development of the Shannon Estuary, which is one of the most valuable natural assets we have.  It is certainly that region's most valuable asset.  However, it has been insufficiently planned and there is a lack of co-ordination and co-operation in that region.  It needs a new, outside body and Shannon Development have proved themselves ideal in this respect to take on the necessary work to have it developed.</P>

It is the finest deep water port in Western Europe and we are fortunate that we have a company like Shannon Development who would be more than willing to <Col N="2487" /> accept that challenge.  It is relevant to the present problems there and if the challenge were taken up and this opportunity grasped, the Shannon Development Company would do it excellently and it would make an enormous difference, not just to the region but to the country. When one thinks of the expenditure, for example, that the Dutch and Belgium governments had to engage in in the building of large, essentially artificial, harbours and the relatively small expenditure that would be involved in the development of this great natural harbour, it would be a great tragedy if it was not undertaken in a co-ordinated way. Unfortunately, the various local and interdepartmental divisions have been allowed to hinder its progress up to now. If over the next few years we allow this opportunity of developing it to pass, we will not be thanked by future generations for being so remiss.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputies please bear in mind that the debate concludes at 10.30 p.m. and that the Minister is due to be called at 10 o'clock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few brief words, firstly, about Clondalkin Paper Mills and to remind the House that the Government have expended approximately £1.7 million on the acquisition of this mill as a going concern.  That acquisition took place approximately six months ago.  I am disappointed that there has been no indication up to the present that any appreciable progress has been made towards arranging the reopening of that plant for the purpose for which the Government acquired it &mdash; namely the production of paper.  One point seven million pounds is a very heavy amount of public money to be lying idle, tied up in that premises and plant.  I calculate, on an approximate basis, that the holding charges on that money would be in the region of £4,000 a week, so that every week that goes by an extra £4,000 of public money is wasted, put to no purpose whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that that <Col N="2488" /> potentially productive asset, whose product is so urgently needed all over the country &mdash; local government service, semi-State service and so on &mdash; is produced at Clondalkin.  They have the machinery and the skilled manpower are standing by, waiting only too anxiously to get back into the mills to make paper. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell the House that there are imminent plans pending to enable production to take place again shortly and that the State will then begin to see some return on the very wise and proper investment made by the Government.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of energy costs, particularly ESB costs and charges which are such a vital factor and which affect the entire industry base.  The Minister is clearly conscious that all is not well with the prices and costing arrangements of electricity because he has recently set up a committee to make inquiries into the prices and costings of the ESB.  His action in setting up a committee is too little and too late.  It is well known and conceded that our energy costs and electricity prices are among the highest in Europe, if not the highest.  That has taken a dreadful toll of our existing industries and I am quite certain that it has taken an appalling toll of the potentiality of new industries coming in to open up here.</P>
    <P>The question of energy costs has become the single most vital factor in determining the viability of most industries. I know that wage costs are a factor also, but the wage element is overemphasised. The energy cost is a key and vital factor.  I do not know whether the Minister needed to set up this committee at all.  It must be clear that the prime agency controlling the price of electricity and energy here is, in fact, the Government. The reality is that the Government, through their agencies, control the price of electricity and can direct the price of electricity and of energy to be virtually at any level they want.  The Government have made a decision that energy costs are to be at the full replacement and full profit-making level and that availability of energy at cost price, as it were, is not the policy to be adopted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2489" /> There is a dilemma involved here which Deputy O'Malley analysed very well at some length and I was glad that he did.  He referred to the two alternative policies open to a Government on this issue: on the one hand, making the energy available at a low price &mdash; at cost or slightly above it &mdash; and looking to the raising of the revenue lost thereby in other ways which would result from a low energy policy.  However, I was a little disappointed at the end of his analysis that he did not come down in favour of either policy.  I would like to hear from him and his party what line of policy on that issue they would advocate and follow.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the policy which we now follow and have followed for quite some time &mdash; the high energy cost policy bringing in a substantial tax yield, which, no doubt, is the intent and purpose of it &mdash; is the wrong policy.  We have been mistaken in following and persisting in that line of policy for as long as we have.  It has been the cause of collapse of so many industries which would otherwise be viable.  One example is cited in a recent newspaper article.  It concerns a small factory, but illustrates my point. The <i>Sunday Press</i> of June 5 reported that a city factory was closing down.  It refered to the Sellotape factory in Finglas which was to close in a couple of weeks' time with the loss of 27 jobs.  The company said that losses had continued at the factory despite the reorganisation and that the high price of fuel and production costs had forced the company to close down. Admittedly, only 27 jobs were involved, but that is a classic example of the effect of high energy costs on our industries.</P>
    <P>The ESB have pointed out that the biggest cost element is in the cost to them of fuel and that they are not enabled to buy their fuel to make their electricity at world competitive prices but are compelled &mdash; the Chief Executive states &mdash; to purchase their fuel oil at prices which are fixed by Government directives.  The Chief Executive, Mr. Moriarty, in his speech on 17 May 1983 stated that the Government fixed the prices at which they purchased their peat, their oil and their natural gas.  He pointed out that the level <Col N="2490" /> of hydrocarbon tax here is the highest in Europe and on the question of natural gas that gas accounted for 50 per cent of their generation in 1982.  The last budget increased its price by 50 per cent.  He goes on to point out that if gas was supplied by Bord Gáis Éireann to the ESB at cost it would produce a reduction in electricity prices of 12½ per cent.  Bord Gáis Éireann supply their product to one source at cost.  It is not a question of them, by virtue of some magical reason, being disentitled to supply their product at cost anywhere.  As their 1982 report indicates, their sales to Nítrigin Éireann are at cost and they supply between £11 million and £14 million of their product to them.  I am not suggesting there is anything wrong with it.</P>
    <P>If Bord Gáis Éireann were to supply gas to the ESB for electricity manufacture at cost we would have the real value of a 12½ per cent reduction in electricity prices but on the other hand, as a short term result, as was pointed out, there would be a revenue loss of £80 million.  As against that one must balance a number of things: first of all the hardpressed domestic consumer of electricity would find a very welcome relief from the real hardship that many thousands of them suffer at the hands of the ESB. Thousands of families await the arrival of the ESB bill with terror and trepidation. The ESB cut people off when there are very small amounts of arrears due.  An appreciable reduction of 12½ per cent in the price of electricity would be a major factor in inducing new industry to set up, both indigenous and from abroad.  Entrepreneurs in this country and firms from abroad considering the question of opening a factory in this country look at the price of electricity.  They would be attracted by a competitive electricity price which we do not have at present. The position is quite the reverse.  Many would-be entrepreneurs go to other countries where they can obtain their electricity at considerably lower prices.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to say that a firm measure of the new industry which is around &mdash; a scarce commodity I agree &mdash; would come here if that key competitive factor was available.  The Minister was not slow <Col N="2491" /> to point out how important it is to be competitive.  The idea of competition was something of a recurring theme in his speech.  He said that all-round competitiveness must be central to our strategy for recovery.  He also said that growing energy costs are seriously affecting our industrial development and competitiveness. Our indigenous industry is uncompetitive internationally.  He followed that up by saying that we must be prepared to learn from the success of industrial countries such as the US, Germany and Japan. One thing we could learn from them is the importance of keeping our energy costs as low as possible and subsidise them, if necessary, as many European and other industrialised countries do. The fact that our energy costs to industry are at their present level pushes many firms like Sellotape over the brink.  There are many firms and jobs which could be preserved were they not pushed over the brink by the high cost of energy.  Fóir Teoranta spends many millions of pounds bailing out industries and trying to maintain employment.  As against the £80 million short-term loss in revenue we must balance the money that would not be paid out in rescue by Fóir Teoranta.  If we preserve existing industry by keeping down energy costs our foreign exchange position would improve substantially. There would be savings on social welfare payments which otherwise would be paid to the thousands of people consigned to the dole queues.  The item I am referring to is not the sole factor but it is an important one as the Sellotape example illustrates.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley in his speech highlighted the dilemma that exists.  He made an interesting comment and from his experience in Government I am sure it was calculated and no accident.  At column 1492 of the Official Report of 14 June he said:</P>
    <P>Those of us who have been in Government know the intractable view of the Department of Finance on this matter, that the highest level of charges should at all times be extracted.</P>
    <P>The words he used were &ldquo;the Department <Col N="2492" /> of Finance&rdquo; and not &ldquo;the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  There is a clear message to be learned from that.  It is time the Minister for Finance made it clear in the Department of Finance that the view that the highest possible amount should be extracted should be tractable and not intractable as heretofore.</P>
    <P>The chief executive of the ESB concluded his speech on the question of setting up a committee to deal with this problem.  His closing words appealed to me.  They might bear some relationship to the committee to inquire into ESB prices.  He said that the idea of setting up such a committee is journeying to never-never land where problems disappear by promising yet another committee of inquiry which will sit for a long period and confirm the obvious in a report on which no action will be taken.  The inquiry into ESB prices will not meet the urgent problem we are faced with.  If we continue the way we are, unemployment will go over the 250,000 mark.  These are difficult times in Europe and throughout the industrialised world.  I appreciate it is not confined to this country.  However, we are getting the worst of it and coming out top of the unemployment league percentage-wise.  There must be some reason for that.  I feel strongly that energy costs are a vital factor in putting us on the top of this league in these difficult times.</P>
    <P>That is the instinct I have on this issue though.  I am well aware that one's instinct is not a sufficient basis for bringing about a redirection of economic policy. However, I would have thought that if there had to be an inquiry a far better one would have been the ascertaining of the overall effect of imposing a change of direction in energy prices and coming back from the Department of Finance's parameters of insisting on extracting the maximum possible price in respect of energy.  I should like to see a study being done on what the alternative would be &mdash; that if we lose the £80 million in revenue on the one hand, what would be the plus that would be counterbalanced against that loss.  I have never seen any report that attempted to estimate on those lines.</P>
    <P>In the short time remaining to me I <Col N="2493" /> should like to speak to the question of protectionism and the defence of our industries.  The Minister touched on this subject in his speech when he exphasised the importance of improving our performance in export markets and said that the greatest threat facing us was the move towards short-sighted protectionist policies even among countries who have been committed traditionally to a free and open market.  The Minister's phraseology represents an understatement.  We are not in a situation in which the industrialised countries, including those in Europe, are moving towards short-sighted protectionist policies.  We have gone well beyond that situation.  In fact, they are practising protectionism against this country among others and they are doing so in a heavy and widespread manner. The Minister has pointed out that the Government can use all their influence in the EEC to prevent any form of protectionism.  That has been tried.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs has raised this matter at some conferences in Brussels while the Taoiseach adverted to it at a meeting in Stuttgart but I find no indication that there is to be any lessening of those protectionist measures.</P>
    <P>This whole subject was examined in some detail by a committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe who were commissioned to make a report on the situation.  Their report is document No. 5052 which was published on 19 April last.  Some of their comments are interesting.  For instance they say there is little evidence to suggest that the international trading system is in any way open and liberal and that these protectionist practices seem to be so much a part of business policy and supported so often, if not initiated, by the Governments themselves, that any idea of a return to free trade can be described only as wishful thinking.  The report continues that every party &mdash; governments, management and labour &mdash; will claim to be in favour of free trade and will protest vigorously about occasional incidents such as France's recent decision to have Japanese video equipment dispatched to Poitiers for custom clearance.  The committee <Col N="2494" /> go on to say that public opinion has very little idea of the extent to which protectionism is inherent in the presentday trading system.  They say also that the over-all assessment is that in world terms between 51 and 55 per cent of total imports are subject to restrictions.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the only country not involved in such activity is Ireland. The importance of our ensuring that there be free trade worldwide has been emphasised, since we rely on free trade for our exports to a large extent, but would anybody here advocate the policy whereby the rest of the world practices protectionism while we practice free trade?  There cannot be such a situation. It is suggested that were we to take any measure to defend our industries or to preserve vital aspects of our employment, something which very easily we could do, we would be subject to retaliation from outside.  The situation is that the retaliation is taking place against us and that we are suffering and losing jobs because of these measures that are practised in so many countries.  The Council of Europe committee estimated that there are no fewer than 100 different forms that this protectionism can take apart from tariffs involving harassment, customs clearance and all sorts of obstacles that are put in the way of the receipt of exports.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out in an independent report recently that the French and Germans were likely to come in for strong criticism regarding trade barriers.  I do not think they mind that very much.  They seem happy enough to accept strong criticism if it means that they can protect their jobs.  I should be happier that we would come in for some of the criticism if at the same time we were protecting jobs.  The situation is similar to one in which somebody kicks you on a regular basis and apart from a very mild protest you do not do much about it.  The result is that the other person continues to kick you but if the point is reached where you kick back, the person who has been kicking you looks back in startled fashion and asks why you have kicked him.  When you have told him the reason the message may then sink in.  Judging from the action <Col N="2495" /> that has been taken by the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, the Government must be well aware of what is happening worldwide in this respect.  Consequently, I do not think it would be inappropriate for us on a temporary and selective basis to use defence mechanisms to protect some of our vulnerable industries which would otherwise go to the wall.  In this way we could preserve employment in industries that are on the brink, and of which there is no shortage.  I am sure the people are beating a path to the Minister's door to point out to him their difficulties. It might be a salutary exercise for our partners in Europe and for the other industrialised countries if we were to indicate that it takes two to tango and that if they are to indulge with impunity in these measures we, too, will be compelled, not in any aggressive fashion but in a defensive fashion, to take steps to defend our vulnerable industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to a large extent with what Deputy Taylor has said.  Perhaps we have taken the words of the bible too literally and have turned the other cheek too often in regard to the protectionism being practised by almost every other country in the EEC.  It is about time we adopted some of the steps which Deputy Taylor is advocating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of changing our policy in relation to energy.  The economy of Ballina and north Mayo depends largely on two industries, Asahi and Hollister.  They have faced up to their problems in a very realistic way both in relation to the energy conservation policies they have successfully adopted and also in relation to some voluntary redundancy.  It is time the Government did something for Asahi.  They held a large public meeting in Killala recently which was attended by public representatives from all parties.  We were shown a set of charts by Asahi personnel which showed quite clearly the effect of energy and transport costs on the company.  The company, together with the work force and the unions, are adopting a sensible attitude but they can point to the fact that the same material which is being manufactured <Col N="2496" /> in Killala is being imported into Europe from the United States where there is a hidden subsidy because it is manufactured on a low-cost energy basis. They can also point to the exceptional percentage cost of their product represented by energy and transportation costs.  I am sure they will be very worried by suggestions that the price of petrol is to be increased by six pence or seven pence a gallon.  This would have a very severe affect on Asahi and it should be clarified.</P>
    <P>We must turn our attention to the whole question of small industries in which I know the Minister has a special interest.  I do not mean industries employing 40 or 50 people but those involving two, three or four people.  I have in mind the industrialist setting up business to supply a specific need and employing, perhaps, himself and one or two others.  When I send people to the IDA offices in Sligo, Galway or Dublin to get information on import substitution they may come back a week later without having obtained any hard facts, although some of them may have done a circuit of the three offices.  They get plenty of general advice but not hard information on which they can set up an industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two people who did the rounds looking for specific information in relation to a number of small items which are being imported.  I have tried myself and got vague generalities but no hard facts.  When Deputy Reynolds was Minister he was instrumental in sending an informative exhibition to a number of areas.  If the IDA are approached by people who have skills but not the requisite information they should be able to tell them all they need to know. They should be able to give the figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about what the Deputy is saying and I would ask him to give me information about the particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister <Col N="2497" /> the information.  There may be lots of people with expertise who would be able to satisfy a need in their own areas.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we need to re-educate people in the various State-sponsored bodies.  A small industry need not employ 20 or 40 people; if it employs two or three people it can make a great contribution to the economy of a small village.  The IDA could give practical help to people looking for information.  If that were done, we would be able in a very short time to eliminate many imports.  There are people in every county who would be able to employ three or four men or women if they had some expert advice.</P>
      <P>I must say in fairness to the western region of the IDA that they did interview people who had some ideas.  Employment could be generated by more co-operation between the county development teams and the IDA.  The size of an industry should not necessarily be the criterion but unfortunately in many instances when a person makes an inquiry and says he will be able to create only two or three jobs he gets very little help.</P>
      <P>Another problem is the reluctance of various bodies to make decisions until they know that another body will make a favourable decision.  There is a &ldquo;catch 22&rdquo; situation where one body will agree to a grant if a second body say they will give finance.  Potential industrialists are involved in a tug of war between, say, the ICC, on the one hand, and the IDA, on the other.  I had a case which, fortunately has been sorted out, where 22 jobs were at risk for four months because of the reluctance of both these bodies to give a decision until the other did.  A crazy situation existed.  Fortunately it has now been solved and in a village in Mayo shortly 20 people will be working.  Some people in this House might ask, &ldquo;What is 20 people?&rdquo;  The Minister comes from a rural constitutency and he knows what 20 people being employed will mean to the economy of that village.  One cannot repeat too often that the more small industries we have&mdash;and I mean small&mdash;the better off we will be.  I will be parochial again for a while and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;refer to the question of Ceimicí Teoranta.  I know the Minister met their chairman last week.  Ceimicí Teoranta have one of their factories in Croy in the parish of Knockmore.  It was established there in the mid-thirties and that factory kept that rural parish for the last 50 years.  Now because of a decision to initiate a whole survey into the starch industry, Cork is to get the jobs that Mayo has had for the last 50 years.  I made inquiries at the time the decision was made and I was told by the IDA that they were very well aware of what the decision to grant this industry to Cork would mean to Croy and that they would do their utmost to replace the jobs in Croy.  It is all very well to take such a decision, but the IDA have a moral obligation to replace the 35 or so people who are very shortly to be made redundant in Croy.  As a result of what has happened, Ballina port will now be obsolete.  The vast bulk of the craft coming into that port were small boats with starch for Croy, so now 25 or 30 dockers who are part-time working on about 35 boats will be redundant also as a result of the decision that was taken.</P>
      <P>Min Fhéir Teoranta are not in my constituency but I have a tremendous interest in them.  I ask the Minister to give a decision in relation to the problems that have arisen there and I ask him also in fairness to make certain that the redundancy which these men are looking for will be on the same level as his Government have already given others who are not even employed by a semi-State company. I ask him also whether he has consented to the request he got from the Killala Development Company who were very anxious to get a grant for the study of solar energy.  I believe he has a very good brief from the company and I would be grateful if he could let me know at some stage, not necessarily tonight, whether he has come to a decision in that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what Deputy Calleary said in relation to small industries. Like him, I have known of many difficulties small industries have had with, on the one hand, the IDA and, on the other hand, the ICC.  As he has stated, it is difficult for them to get help.  One thing that has always amazed me is that in the west of Ireland we have never been able to get an ICC office, and I hope that the Minister will make some inquiries with a view to locating an ICC office in the west to serve the needs of people who have enterprise in the west of Ireland area.</P>
      <P>I have been encouraged, as I am sure the Minister has, by the number of people who have applied to Bord na Móna for a scheme of grants to develop privately-owned bogs which was made possible by the Turf Development Act, 1981.  What was encouraging about this was that we had a high rate of grants for groups of people who were prepared to enter into agreement to develop a bog for the production of turf and turf products for fuel. The amount of money for the year ending 1982 in grants which were approved was in the region of £1.26 million and that scheme helped 2,648 individuals and gave employment to about 2,000 people for the turf-cutting season.  Under the scheme 300,000 tons of turf were produced by private developers which represented a saving of £17 million approximately in crude oil imports.  I mention this scheme because in the past there was an alternative whereby people could get a grant from the local authority under a local improvement scheme for bog roads and bog drainage, but more recent regulations on that would appear to give a very low priority under the local improvements scheme for bog drainage and bog roads.  Now the priority seems to be for developing farm roads.  I ask the Minister to ensure that more funds are made available under the Bord na Móna programme because it has been a great success.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was concerned, as were people in my constituency, to hear on the radio this morning and to read reports about the possibility that the briquette factory at Derryfada will be deferred.  According to reports that we heard and read, this was supposed to have been discussed at the Cabinet meeting at Barrettstown Castle. The report that I heard was that not only was the briquette factory to be deferred, there was also the possibility that the Tuam sugar factory would be axed.  These projects are in my constituency.  I will have an opportunity to talk about the Tuam factory at another stage.  As regards the briquette factory, this project was approved in May 1979 when the area had lost the power station which was to be sited there.  Since then there were great hopes that the project would start pretty soon; in fact it was to start in 1981. However, we had reviews and surveys and eventually it was not until 1982 that some money was made available under the Estimate for Bord na Móna to start work on it.  We had the turning of the sod ceremony for this £21 million project in November 1982 but I have had occasion since to ask the Minister when the contract will be awarded.  I was told it would be awarded by Easter but it has not yet been awarded.  The Minister may tell me that there are problems between the local authority and Bord na Móna with regard to charges for services but that is not an adequate reason for the delay by the Government in reaching a decision about the project.  I hope the Minister will tell me that the Government do not intend to defer that project.  It is vital for the people of north Galway and south Roscommon. I have been told that the factory will have an output of 140,000 tonnes and, when fully operational, will provide 110 jobs. I understand that additional jobs will be made available in the development of the Derryfadda bog and that if an outside <Col N="2501" /> contractor is involved in the construction of the factory more jobs will be provided.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy about the way FEOGA grants are distributed for the installation of electricity in rural areas.  The grants are processed very slowly.  I hope they will be extended because at present they are given only to people involved in agriculture but there are many people living in isolated areas who are not involved in agriculture solely.  They should qualify for a grant for the installation of electricity. I have always wondered why local authorities are not helped if they build a house for a family living in an isolated area where the capital cost for electricity is very big.  The Minister should endeavour to have more money made available so that electricity can be provided to people living in rural areas at a reasonable rate.  I should like to know if the Government have made a decision on the application for a price increase by the ESB.  It is reported that the ESB have applied for an increase of 10 per cent and the Minister should tell the House if that is so.  I should like to remind the Minister that last year Deputy Reynolds, as Minister, approved a 5 per cent increase, the lowest increase for years.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with two towns in my constituency in need of new industries. The people of Loughrea, through the local chamber of commerce and other organisations, have made representations to the Government seeking an industry to replace Tynagh Mines.  Since the mines closed that area has experienced further difficulty with the closure of the cotton factory and the Westfalian carpet factory.  The only industry in the town giving employment on a major scale is the Schlegel factory. I understood that a company to manufacture computer cabinets was to be located in Loughrea but I have not heard much about that proposal in recent times. Will the Minister indicate to the House if there is a possibility of the IDA getting an industry for that town?  I accept that the IDA are actively promoting the town. Tuam is also in need of industries.  In fact, there is an advance factory available in the town.</P>

      <P>My contribution will deal mainly with the Industrial Development Authority who have embarked on the preparation of a strategic plan for the period 1982-92.  That work is being undertaken to pinpoint development opportunities in those years and ensure that the IDA are geared to operate effectively in the changing economic environment. It will analyse labour force trends and seek ways of optimising the contribution which commercially-based production and services can make towards job creation and economic development. The south-west region of Cork and Kerry which has been successful in the past is no longer in a position to attract suitable industries, particularly as far as Kerry is concerned.  According to the IDA annual report for 1981 the fixed asset investment for Cork was £157.5 million while for Kerry it was £5.8 million.  The grant commitment for Cork was £57 million compared to £4.7 million for Kerry and, according to that report, the job potential for Cork was 6,103 as against 512 for Kerry.  Those figures indicated the complete imbalance as far as Kerry is concerned.</P>
      <P>In view of the massive unemployment in Kerry I appeal to the Minister to consider declaring Kerry a special region under the direction of the IDA.  If that occurred the county could seek new industrial opportunities.  We have an excellent county development team but we need an independent authority to seek further industry.  At present we are linked to Cork on a regional basis and we are not getting the investment or expertise that we should from the IDA.  Over the years Kerry has built up a good industrial reputation and in Tralee we have one of the best AnCO training centres in the country and an excellent regional college. They will play an important part in the future industrial development of the county.</P>
      <P>In Castleisland recently a factory premises which has been vacant for some years was put up for public auction but it has now been decided to sell it by private treaty.  Some years ago that factory was opened with a blaze of glory and the people involved obtained in the region of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2503" /> £92,000 from the IDA.  That casts a reflection on the IDA.  The factory should be taken over by the IDA and held for the people of Castleisland and north Kerry.  I appeal to the Minister to take a personal interest in this matter.</P>
    <P>If the Minister designates Kerry as a special region I am convinced he will get the co-operation of the local authorities, trade unions, industrialists and business people to guarantee the success of the venture.  That would be a step forward and would result in many new jobs being created.  Will the Minister consider extending the gas pipeline from Limerick to Tralee?  I am grateful to the Minister for taking a personal interest in the Kingdom Tubes factory in Tralee and I should be obliged if he would indicate the current position with regard to the jobs there.  A commitment was given by the IDA some time ago that they would endeavour to get a suitable alternative industry because 300 jobs have been lost and approximately £30,000 per week taken out of the economy of the town.  Some time ago I asked the Minister to consider extending the operations of SFADCo to the north Kerry region.  Such a move would be of great benefit to that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Members who participated in the debate. It is true to say that Deputy Foley and I have had discussions about Kingdom Tubes.  In fact, I replied to a parliamentary question about the matter tabled by the Deputy today.  The Tánaiste was also in touch with me on a number of occasions about this subject.  Deputy O'Malley referred to the Geological Office.  Some minor staff changes took place there for operational reasons and I do not think they were of any significance. They do not prejudge the inquiry the Deputy referred to.  The Deputy was also somewhat sceptical about what he described as the typically optimistic and happy noises of the Minister of State about mineral exploration.  As the Deputy is aware, mineral exploration suffered all over the world because of the depression which has led to depression in <Col N="2504" /> the usage of minerals and also, in respect of certain metals, there have been technological advances which have reduced the usage of metals in particular processes in terms of the volume of metal required.  However, I am glad to say that recent predictions I have been reading in relation to the United States economy suggest that metal mining is one of the areas where it is expected that there will be quite significantly more growth in the four-year period 1982 to 1986 than there was in the previous four-year period.  It is too early yet to say if this will extend to Europe and to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley made some very reasonable points when he referred to what he described as uncertainty facing people who are engaged in mineral exploration. I would be most anxious to remove any difficulties that exist in this area.  I am aware that work is being done in the Department to bring forward some new ideas.  There have been discussions with the representatives of the people concerned and, I hope, we can do something about it.  I appreciate the interest shown by Deputy O'Malley.  As far as the Bula ore body is concerned I do not propose to get involved in a discussion on the rights and wrongs of what may or may not have happened six-and-a-half years ago.  I intend to use my good offices to the maximum possible extent to achieve a joint operation of the two ore bodies, Bula and Tara.  From my point of view, it is clearly important that this be done in a harmonious fashion.  It would be highly undesirable if the usage of the ore body were to be delayed by unnecessary disputation. I have asked an independent party who has a particular knowledge in the mining field, to assist my Department in mediating between the two mining companies concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies referred to the situation in regard to Whitegate.  I have already indicated that the Government have established a committee, who have reported to me, on oil prices here.  It includes consideration of Whitegate amongst other things.  No decision at this point has been taken on the findings of this report. I expect to be discussing it with my colleagues <Col N="2505" /> in the reasonably near future.  I have replied to the letter received from the European Commission in regard to the mandatory offtake regimes.  There has been no reply to our letter at this point.  The Irish courts have yet to consider definitively if they will proceed with their consideration of this case in advance of the views to be made by the European Court about their interpretation of the situation.  Deputy O'Malley also referred to the pipelines between Limerick&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister leaves Whitegate, could he deal with the question of prices relating to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to deal with the subjects in the order in which I have the papers here.  I have dealt with the question of prices to some extent.  I have indicated that we had an inquiry into oil prices which included the Whitegate factor along with some others. That has yet to be considered by the Government.  I do not believe that at this point I have much to add to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note what the Deputy said about the ESB and Dublin Gas advertising very extensively.  We have to realise that these two companies, to some extent, are in competition with one another.  I suppose one could argue that all advertising is wasteful in a sense, even advertising in the purely private sector.  If only people had enough information without advertising they could go and buy the cheapest product.  There is no doubt that if Dublin Gas are to succeed in making adequate use of what is, hopefully, to be a very premium and profitable market from everybody's point of view, of natural gas, they have to persuade many people to make the capital investment involved in becoming gas consumers.  That involves them in an advertising campaign.  Likewise, I suppose it is equally true to say that the ESB have to try, by advertising to ensure that they are able to retain their consumers of a product of which they have excess supply capacity over present demand.  However, Deputy O'Malley has raised this point about the competitive advertising in this natural resource field. I would not like to come to a hasty conclusion <Col N="2506" /> on it.  I will have a further look at it to see if any advice from me would be appropriate to the bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>I also note what Deputy O'Malley says about alternative energy.  He has made a reasonable point in regard to the relevance of solar energy vis-a-vis wave energy here.  At the moment we seem to be mere spectators as far as wave energy research is concerned rather than anything else, whereas we have become involved more directly in other fields.  I will ask the Department to review the alternative energy programme in the light of what the Deputy has said.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the point the Deputy made about SFADCo becoming involved in marine development in a more structural way.  I fully agree with what he said about the Shannon Estuary being one of our major natural resources.  It, along with the Bantry Bay area, was identified in the Telesis Report as an underutilised natural resource.  It came out in that report that the natural port facilities which exist there should be used not alone for serving the immediate hinterland of the ports in question but as a trans-shipment facility serving Europe as a whole where the larger delivery vessels could trans-ship their materials to smaller vessels.  I will ask SFADCo to give me their views on this matter so far as it is relevant to their and my responsibilities for industrial development.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that this is primarily a matter affecting the responsibility of the Minister for Transport.</P>
    <P>I was also interested in Deputy Taylor's contribution in regard to Clondalkin Paper Mills.  As he said, the Government have acquired the premises in Clondalkin. The aim I have in regard to this mill is to provide an attractive opportunity for the recommencement of paper making, on an entirely viable and economical basis.</P>
    <P>I believe it is very important that we obtain a substantial participation, on a risk-bearing basis, by other interests apart from the State in papermaking in Clondalkin.  I would not be happy with a situation in which the State &mdash; even regardless of the scarity of the resources but particularly in the light of the present <Col N="2507" /> obvious scarcity of financial resources &mdash; was to become involved as the sole risk-taker, or even the major risk-taker in a recommencement of papermaking. All my efforts and those of the IDA in this area have been devoted to seeking to attract a suitable investor.  We have had two discussions in this area in recent times.  One was with a German promoter. That has not progressed as one would have hoped; in fact it would seem to be a possibility that is at present receding. The second was with Canadian interests with whom discussions at present are very active.  I will do everything in so far as my office is concerned to promote these discussions. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate the validity of the point I made earlier, that it is important that we get people involved who are prepared to put their own money up front in this project.</P>
    <P>I find myself unable to go all the way with Deputy Taylor in his view about energy costs.  Deputy O'Malley stated the dilemma quite clearly although he did not come down on one side or the other in regard to this matter.  Quite apart from the fact that there is £78 million worth of revenue this year to be obtained by the State from the sale of natural gas one must bear in mind that we have at present only one gasfield and that we are importing very substantial quanties of oil.  If we are to sell our natural gas across the board at a price significantly less than the oil replacement price, then all we are doing is accelerating the day when we shall have to go back to having to pay for further oil imports.</P>
    <P>The situation would be quite different had we three or four gasfields, three or four Kinsale Head fields.  Then one could look with greater confidence at the possibility of charging, say, a correlated price.  But, as long as we have only one field, it behoves us to use it sparingly.  I readily concede that there are anomalies in the present structure.  Deputy Taylor referred to the position in regard to NET. The Government will have to review the policy in regard to the pricing of natural gas overall.  Against that background one would hope to bear in mind the considerations adverted to by Deputy Taylor in <Col N="2508" /> regard to particular problems in certain energy-intensive industries.  But it would have to be done in the overall context.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor referred also to the price being charged to the ESB.  Even at the increased price the ESB are now paying I would point out to him that they are still paying significantly less than they would be had they to buy oil instead of gas.  Secondly, the amount of gas they have been given has been increased substantially over the amount they were getting previously.  Given that they are getting that gas at less than what they would be paying if they had to get oil instead, they are getting the benefit to the extent that they are paying 24p per them for the gas, whereas if they were getting oil, they would have to pay perhaps the equivalent of 30p per therm.  Likewise, in regard to turf, there have been complaints by the ESB about the price they are paying for that.  It should be said that that price has been increased by a number of Ministers &mdash; and Deputy Reynolds was one of those Ministers involved too.  I am not mentioning that fact in any criticism of him.  That has been pursued as part of a deliberate policy by successive Governments. Both Governments have been involved in a policy of relating the price of peat to energy-value-related prices. Those prices have been increased more or less on the same principle, that we are endeavouring to charge on oil-related prices for gas.  It is fair to say that it is prudent for the ESB to be buying peat, that it is not altogether an imposition on them.  Any prudent electricity utility would use and place itself in a position to use over time &mdash; and this would involve perhaps using at particular points during the longer term &mdash; this resource under conditions which would be less than the most favourable at that point.  But any prudent electricity utility would place itself in a position to be able to use a domestically available product, such as peat, for strategic reasons, so that it would not find itself, let us say, totally dependent on imported oil.  Therefore the use of peat is not something imposed solely on the ESB by successive Governments. Probably it is something they <Col N="2509" /> would have decided to do anyway, even if they were free in the matter.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to an electricity inquiry.  Deputy O'Malley did not refer to it in his speech but he did pose the question on another occasion as to why we needed an electricity inquiry; were not many of the factors affecting high electricity prices already known? That is fair point.  Indeed, as a result of that point having being made by Deputy O'Malley, I decided I would ask the inquiry to report to me within eight weeks, an interim report, on those factors which, in their opinion, were sufficiently documented already in order that they can give a recommendation to the Government for action within an eight-week period and that the other factors requiring further research could be reported on by the committee within the six months duration.  I think that is a reasonable response to a reasonable point made by Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <P>The question of protectionism was raised by Deputy Taylor&mdash;I am sorry, I shall be coming to Deputy Reynolds's contribution; I do not intend to ignore it either.  I do not agree that we should get involved in trying to outdo other countries on protectionist measures, or to imitate them, even to a moderate extent because we have much more to lose from this sort of trend than they.  We are much more vulnerable to this sort of action. We should not over-estimate our position and our clout in the EEC in this context.</P>
    <P>I was concerned at the points made by Deputy Calleary about particular instances of firms interested in import substitution running into difficulty because he felt, partly, they were such small projects they were not getting the attention they deserved.  I would be interested in getting details of these cases and shall pursue them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt and others raised the question of Derryfadda near Ballyforan.  The position here is as stated in the Public Capital Programme, namely that the Government are examining this project in consultation with Bord na Móna to see if the payback to the community and the State of this investment will be sufficiently rapid to justify the rate of interest <Col N="2510" /> that will have to be paid on the funds being borrowed while we await that return.  That is the approach that must be adopted to any new investment, an approach that would be adopted in the private sector.  We are having detailed discussions and exchange of information with Bord na Móna in regard to that project.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt was interested also in the question of the employment scheme for bog roads.  That is primarily a matter for the Department of the Environment. Deputy O'Malley discussed mineral prospecting. I would point out to him that under this Government the Rossmore coalmine and the Clonakilty barytes mine have been reopened.  There is some development there although I would not overestimate that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt referred to the Industrial Credit Corporation having an office in the west of Ireland.  That is a matter for the Department of Finance in the first instance but I have brought it to their attention.  Deputy Calleary and others referred to a lack of co-ordination and delays where people have been told they could get a grant from the IDA if they could get funds from the ICC or <i>vice versa.</i>  A kind of table tennis is being played between State agencies.  To the extent that this is happening this is not a desirable development and the Government are doing something about it.  The Minister for Finance has appointed an IDA representative to the board of the ICC and it is the intention in due course to appoint a representative of the ICC to the board of the IDA to ensure better co-ordination between the two agencies. I understand a formal agreement has been reached between the IDA and the ICC to better synchronise their operations. I realise the ICC is a bank and has a certain perspective just as any other bank has and that the IDA is a grant-giving agency.  To some extent there will be differences of perception between them and, therefore, differences of opinion about projects but I hope that will be minimised by the arrangements I have indicated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds referred to the overruns on the Marino Point project and also <Col N="2511" /> to the IIRS building.  I share his concern about this.  In regard to the IIRS building, I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, to carry out an in-depth inquiry into the circumstances of this cost overrun.  I think Deputy Reynolds had initiated some moves in this direction before he left office.  I decided I should ask the Minister of State to head this inquiry and I understand I shall have a report from him quite soon.</P>
    <P>One should take very seriously anything of this kind.  The overrun in respect of the Marino Point complex is somewhat further in the past and perhaps an inquiry would not be as immediately relevant. However, arising out of the various overruns &mdash; the two mentioned are not the only ones by any means &mdash; when I was Minister for Finance I commissioned a report on cost overruns in the public sector, which report was published three or four weeks ago.  Since then I have met all the State companies under my aegis for an all-day meeting.  One of the points I stressed was they they should adopt all the recommendations set out by the study group in regard to avoiding cost overruns in the future.  It is necessary that the companies themselves should not only be anxious to concern themselves with overruns in the engineering sense but also that at various points during the progress of a capital project they should reassess it.  They should ascertain if market conditions have changed in respect of the product they are seeking to produce to the extent that an undertaking that might have been justifiable two years ago and which is now in process is no longer justified and should be stopped.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in State companies to assume that once a project gets the green light it should continue regardless of changed market circumstances.  A good example of this is that cited by Deputy O'Malley in regard to the Moneypoint project.  Deputy O'Malley or Deputy Reynolds asked who had approved Moneypoint 3 project: it was approved by the then Tánaiste, Deputy Colley.  I am not saying he made a wrong decision at the time.  At the time he made the decision the circumstances then <Col N="2512" /> obtaining may have justified it.  However, in the first instance it is a matter for the board concerned, not the Minister, to have this project reassessed.  It is primarily for the board concerned to reassess all projects on an ongoing basis in the light of changes in demand.  We cannot have a situation where the detailed management and reassessment of projects that are ongoing is a matter for the Minister of the day.  He simply does not have the time or the data to do this kind of work. That is what boards are there for.  Since I came to office I have initiated a review of the Moneypoint 3 project from my own point of view but I must say I believe it is something the ESB should do themselves as a matter of course in respect of any ongoing project.  The review I have initiated is rather difficult for the Department of Energy to carry out with the limited staff resources at our disposal and it has not yet concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely to answer that question that I initiated this review almost as soon as I came to office.  Much technical information has been obtained from the ESB and I hope to be in a position to discuss the matter with my colleagues quite soon.  I agree with Deputy Reynolds about the need to maintain consistency in regard to a regime for industrial incentives.  There have been a number of undesirable developments in this regard in recent times.  I do not say they were confined to any particular side of the House and I will not go into detail about them.  We need to educate our colleagues on the need for consistency.  Anyone who has been involved in discussions abroad in seeking to attract industry here is well aware that <Col N="2513" /> one of our major selling points has been consistency in the pursuit of a particular tax regime in regard to industry.  We have got to maintain that.  I applaud the interest shown by Deputy Reynolds in this debate and as Minister on the need to encourage greater links between the schools and industry and I intend to pursue this vigorously.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds asked that industrialists have an input into the White Paper. I intend to take up that suggestion and to ensure that it is done.  He spoke favourably about the Small Business Investment Companies programme which is prominent in the United States.  I am interested in a debenture capital concept and while I think it is early days yet to say whether we need such a formalised structure as they have in the United States with a particular statute, I would not rule it out as a possible future development.  However, I think more immediate initiatives could be taken in this area before we reach that point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds also asked about the National Development Corporation. That is intended to form part of the White Paper on Industrial Development.  I do not think it would be wise to proceed with a National Development Corporation in isolation from overall industrial policy.  I can assure the House it will be my intention to ensure that the National Development Corporation will be engaged in viable projects that have a genuine commercial future and that that discipline is maintained before the eyes of all those involved in the National Development Corporation at all times.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Malley thought the Nuclear Energy Board should get the chop &mdash; although this may be a distortion of what he said &mdash; and that their only remaining function was to monitor the use of nuclear material at St. Luke's Hospital. I understand the board are monitoring the use of nuclear material in 200 different establishments throughout the country which are under licence from the board to use radioactive substances.  In due course I will furnish the Deputy with a complete list of the 200 establishments for his bedtime reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for asking for permission to raise this matter is a most extraordinary letter, probably one of the most extraordinary from any Department, which was presented to the North Eastern Health Board yesterday. The basis of that letter was that before permission would be given to the health board to build a hospital in your own town of Cavan, Sir, the board would have to give a commitment that the county hospital in Monaghan would be closed and disposed of.  I shall quote one or two relevant passages from the letter:</P>
      <P>It was intended initally that these three hospitals would close when the new hospital was commissioned.</P>
      <P>The three hospital in question are Lisdarn, the surgical hospital in Cavan and the county hospital in Monaghan.  There is no basis in fact that I can find for that. The last time a Minister wanted to downgrade the Monaghan hospital was when another Coalition Minister was in office, Mr. Corish, who is no longer in the House.  In February 1976 he wrote to the health board stating that the county hospital, so designated, could commence to function as a community hospital.  There was no question of closing the county hospital at that time.  The letter presented to the North Eastern Health Board yesterday goes on to state:</P>
      <P>Accordingly it is necessary for the Minister for Health to have a firm commitment form your Board that the three hospitals which were intended to be replaced by the new hospital will be closed as acute hospital facilities.  The Minister also wishes to be informed of the Board's plans for the disposal of the properties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the board were asked to get rid of these properties.  As far as I am <Col N="2515" /> aware there was never any suggetion that Lisdarn should be got rid of: indeed it was to be incorporated as part of the new hospital complex in Cavan.</P>
    <P>This is an extraordinary decision.  It is extraordinary that a Coalition Government, just six months back in office, again have decided not alone, this time, to downgrade Monaghan County Hospital but to close it down and to sell it.  It is a political decision and one could lay a lot of blame at the door of the Coalition Government for it, but I do not think that would be a correct thing to do.  Our priority must be at all times to ensure good health care for all the people for whom we are responsible.</P>
    <P>When the health board sent out the agenda, with the letter from the Department, the six Members of the Oireachtas from the area, Cavan and Monaghan, met the Minister and an official and pleaded with him in the interest of the good health of the people in the area to withdraw the letter, that it was totally unnecessary to have sent such a letter to the health board, passing the death sentence on the hospital.  If the death sentence is passed on the hospital it will leave the area without hospital facilities, apart from those in Cavan, and it is fair to say that the surgical hospital in Cavan is probably the worst hospital building in the whole of Europe.  Indeed, it is a tribute to the staff that they are able to carry on a surgical hospital there.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to go into the social and economic implications of the Government's decision.  I believe the request of the elected representatives to the Minister to withdraw that letter was prompted by good sense to see that the needs for good medical care in the area are met.  The immediate effect of that letter is, one, it will undermine public confidence in a hospital which is providing an excellent service for the community; two, it will demoralise the staff, nursing and ancillary; and three, if the excellent consultants there decide, because the death sentence has been passed on the hospital, to look for more secure employment in hospitals which the Minister does not intend to close &mdash; we <Col N="2516" /> do not know how many there will be &mdash; Monaghan County Hospital will not be able to attract the kind of staff necessary to ensure the good health of the people who use that hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister's letter also stated that subsequent commitments were given that Monaghan hospital would continue in use on the completion of the new hospital. That is correct.  The present Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, when he was Minister for Health came to Monaghan to see for himself what was happening.  He met the local county health committee.  He told them, and I will use his own words:</P>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to state categorically to the members of the Monaghan Health Committee that Monaghan County Hospital will be retained as a general hospital providing the full range of appropriate services for the people of County Monaghan.  The status of Monaghan hospital will not be affected by the development of Cavan Hospital. Monaghan County Hospital will provide the following services &mdash; general surgery, general medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology, with the necessary back-up of radiology, pathology and laboratory services.</P>
    <P>Later in that statement the then Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I would like to remind everybody concerned that when I assumed office Monaghan County Hospital was scheduled to be downgraded to what was described as a Community Hospital.  I reversed that decision.  I have implemented the measures necessary to maintain a full-scale County Hospital in Monaghan.  The future of Monaghan as a county hospital has been secured beyond doubt and I would like to suggest that everybody concerned should now devote their attention to building up and perfecting the community health services.</P>
    <P>There is no word about closing it in that statement.  We should contrast that with the letter which arrived at our health board offices yesterday.  Following that <Col N="2517" /> message from the then Minister for Health, new appointments were made to the staff in Monaghan.  In the Official Report of the Dáil for 27 June 1978, at column 1941, Deputy Haughey, the then Minister, is reported:</P>
    <P>I have asked Comhairle na nOspidéal, and they have agreed, to provide the level of staffing necessary in both hospitals to satisfy the needs of their areas.</P>
    <P>The two hospitals referred to were Tullamore and Monaghan.  Since then, a second physician has been appointed.  There are now two surgeons in Monaghan Hospital, there is a new full-time radiologist and two anaesthetists, and there is a full working laboratory.  Monaghan County Hospital has become one of the finest hospitals in the country.</P>
    <P>The bed occupancy is very important to statisticians and it is true that it has dropped over the last five years, but it is wrong and grossly unfair to take bed occupancy as a statistic on its own.  If one looks at the medical unit alone in that hospital one sees that the number of patients treated increased by 4,000, the length of stay was reduced from 14 days to seven days, and the number of outpatients increased from 368 in 1977 to 2,233 in 1982.  These are the significant figures. It is easy to keep beds full all the time; just keep people lying in them, but I would not recommend that.  It would be wrong if the hospital were to be penalised because the bed occupancy dropped when one looks at the other figures which show this is a very active and improving unit.</P>
    <P>The second physician was appointed. One of the physicians left the hospital two years ago.  Last year a new appointment was made.  The physician offered that appointment did not take it and the health board requested that they advertise again.  Now, two years later, again with the Coalition in power, the answer I received to a question in this House on 14 June explained that a candidate was selected for appointment to this post following a competition by the Local Appointments Commission last year and he indicated to the health board that he <Col N="2518" /> did not wish to take up the appointment. In accordance with normal practice, because of the lapse of time since the last competition, the Minister said it will be necessary to readvertise the post and his Department will be writing shortly to the board in the matter.  Has the Minister written to the board?  What is the reason for the delay in making this very necessary appointment?  The development of the Cavan hospital is at a very late stage. Tenders are due to be returned to the health board on 23 July.  It is hoped that the hospital will commence in the autumn, probably September.  Previous Minister for Health were satisfied to continue with this project because they know there is a need for a hospital in Cavan and it is important that the project should not be hindered.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Minister's most extraordinary decision is to undermine confidence in Monaghan County Hospital, to demoralise the staff and to ensure that if for any reason a consultant leaves or transfers there will not be any replacement because no consultant will take a post in a hospital on which death sentence has been passed.</P>
    <P>The members of the health board at a meeting yesterday, like the Members of the Oireachtas who met the Minister last week, were unanimous in their decision that Monaghan County Hospital should not be closed or downgraded.  They asked the Minister to withdraw that letter and to visit both Monaghan and Cavan to meet the members of the health boards so that we could discuss in a rational and sensible way the needs of both Cavan and Monaghan and ensure that there will be proper health services in the area.  It is extraordinary that a Minister would not listen to all the elected Members from Cavan and Monaghan representing the two major political parties.  I hope the Minister will listen to the North-Eastern Health Board who have a major responsibility in this matter.  As I said earlier, while this is a political decision for which the Government will have to accept responsibility we must be concerned primarily with the health of the people. Looking at this from any angle, certainly from the point of view of health care and <Col N="2519" /> as a political move, all I can say is that this decision was completely mad.  Again I appeal to the Minister to withdraw that decision, allow Monaghan County Hospital to continue as a viable unit, and ensure that Cavan Hospital will commence on target this autumn.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to that of Deputy O'Hanlon, but I will not go over the same ground.  In the mid-seventies when Fianna Fáil were in power the then Minister for Health Deputy Haughey, reached a decision after long discussions with interested parties on the necessity for a hospital in this area.  At that time there were many atrocities and bombings in the Monaghan area.  As late as last week there was a shooting incident.  A young married man was shot while in his own bathroom.  If he had had to travel even 20 miles in all probability he would be dead today.  In the Monaghan area there is a great deal of industry and it is an arterial route.  The people of this area are entitled to this basic facility, that is, hospitalisation in emergencies.</P>
      <P>The health board at their meeting yesterday passed a vote of confidence in that hospital and complimented the staff on the performance of their duties and mentioned how contented patients were.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision. He has been invited to the area to look at the situation.  It is a pity that he reached this decision before he saw the facilities which are required in Cavan and Monaghan.  Again I invite him to meet the members of the North-Eastern Health Board who have proved down the years that they are very reasonable people.  They put the care of the patients before any other consideration.  If he visits our area I have no doubt that when he returns to Dublin he will change his decision.  I ask him to listen very attentively to the request of the health board and to let the staff know if they have a future in that hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to remind Deputy O'Hanlon, Deputy Leonard, Deputy Wilson who is <Col N="2520" /> present, and yourself, a Cheann Comhairle, as Deputies for the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, that I face a continuing and very serious budget situation. The health services for which I have responsibility cannot be wholly excluded from this reality.</P>
      <P>At present I am faced with an endless list of demands from various quarters for the provision of new and expanded facilities to deal with many health care problems. The capital cost of these demands totals £670 million.  I have a major problem to maintain in 1983, not to mention the years ahead, the existing level of hospital and health care services, quite apart from considering any expansion of these services.  As Deputies know, any expansion of these services requires the employment of a large number of additional staff.  The previous Government introduced an embargo on employment and directed the various health agencies to reduce the number of staff employed by 5 per cent over the next few years. The present Government consider it necessary to continue that directive.</P>
      <P>I am on record as having stated on a number of occasions that I consider a number of areas in the health services to have been very seriously neglected. Psychiatric patients have very few people to talk for them in this House.  Geriatriac patients have very few people to talk for them in this House.  The mentally handicapped have damn few people to talk for them in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner is one of their most eloquent spokesmen. The services for the physically handicapped, the deaf and the blind need to be expanded.  There is no money in 1983 and there is a prospect of very little money in 1984 to open a hostel and a workshop in Cootehill for children leaving the Holy Family School, Cootehill, or to open a day centre and a sheltered workshop for 40 adults at Oliver Plunkett Hospital in Dundalk.  We have no money, and money must be found.  We have no money for a day centre and a sheltered workshop in Monaghan town for 40 trainees, <Col N="2521" /> and money must be found to get this under way.  In an area adjacent to Monaghan, in Drumcar, a hostel for adults needs to be opened, and a new unit for 20 severely handicapped girls there must be opened.  We have no money, and money must be found.</P>
      <P>In effect Deputies are asking me to build a new hospital in Cavan, a major hospital with 336 beds which will cost £21 million in 1983 prices over the next five years, and simultaneously to maintain a hospital in Monaghan.  We must face reality. The background is that there is a proposed development of a new major hospital in Cavan.  The firm date for the receipt of tenders for this development is 22 July 1983, and it is likely that construction could commence by early next November.  Present planning is for a completion date towards the end of 1987.  In the light of our recent experience with the construction industry it is possible that it could be completed six or nine months earlier &mdash; it could be ready for opening in March 1987 or so.  The hospital in Cavan is designed and is being built to cater for a population of approximately 100,000 people in both Cavan and Monaghan.  It was always in the planning brief that the Monaghan hospital would close when the new hospital was opened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my clear understanding of the situation.  At present prices it would cost £11 million to run the new hospital for a full year compared with a total cost of £8 million for the existing three hospitals.  By opening the new hospital there will be a revenue cost increase of £3 million.  As I said, the new hospital will provide 336 beds.  It is planned to cater for the population of the catchment area of the two existing hospitals in Cavan and the general hospital in Monaghan.  It will have modern purpose-planned accommodation with the most up-to-date equipment.  Given what I have said, I could not accept in these circumstances that it is reasonable to provide a new 336-bed hospital to cater for the general needs of the entire <Col N="2522" /> Cavan-Monaghan area and, at the same time, to keep open the existing 174 acute bed hospital in Monaghan.  In fact, it would be irresponsible for me to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The net outcome of allowing this to proceed would be to have one very large hospital in Cavan which was planned and purpose built to cater for the entire needs of the Cavan-Monaghan area and, at the same time, to keep open another 174-bed hospital at Monaghan which now costs £3 million a year to run.  At the best of times that would be entirely wasteful and, in the current situation, one could not justify the expenditure of such resources.</P>
      <P>It was in this context that I wrote to the North Eastern Health Board seeking a firm commitment that the hospital in Monaghan will close when the new hospital in Cavan is opened.  I had no option but to seek such a commitment because this was the understanding on which the hospital at Cavan was planned.  I should emphasise that I am not in any way directing the health board to close the Monaghan hospital.  Indeed, it would be inappropriate for me to do so at this stage.  It is incumbent on me to draw the attention of the health board to the fact that the provision of the new hospital at Cavan and the retention of the existing hospital at Monaghan would result in a gross over-provision of beds in the area which simply could not be justified.</P>
      <P>It is pertinent to add that the two existing hospitals in Cavan have a percentage occupancy of about 85, on the latest figures available to me, while the hospital at Monaghan has a percentage occupancy of 60 which indicates that this hospital has a surplus of over 50 beds.  At the moment I am awaiting the health board's response to my request.  I have had no official response yet, but I have been given to understand that the board have deferred their decision on the matter and are to request further discussions with me on the issue.  If this is the case I will be happy to meet the board to discuss with them what is to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must emphasise that, whatever is <Col N="2523" /> done, I cannot and will not agree to a situation where an over-provision of acute general hospital facilities is available in one area, while so many other areas of health services are in need of development.  I hope this situation will not delay the scheduled plans for the new Cavan hospital to which I have allocated a clear priority from 1983 to 1987 in my revised capital programme.  There is no way I can or will issue a contract for the new Cavan hospital while I have no assurances about the future role of the Monaghan hospital.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to state in the strongest possible manner that his whole situation would never have arisen were it not for the deliberate ignoring of the content of the planning brief for the new Cavan hospital by my predecessors, Deputy Haughey and Deputy Woods.  In November 1978 Deputy Haughey, as Minister for Health, in a wholly irresponsible way laid the foundations for the current impasse by guaranteeing in writing the continuation of Monaghan hospital irrespective of any Cavan development in size, in content, or in planning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 382, 383 and 384 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with established Government policy and in the light of the resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on 27 April, we are keeping the situation in Central America under constant review and we are following closely the efforts of the Contadora Group to achieve a lasting peace in Central America based on the principles of self-determination and the right of each country in the region to determine its own destiny free from outside interference.  I would recall that the Contadora Group have proposed that a first step on the way towards establishing such peace is through the suspension of arms shipments to the area and the withdrawal of outside military advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Contadora Group of countries have made it clear that they regard the problem of Central America as essentially regional, to be solved by the countries of Latin America themselves.  As the Deputy will recall, in my statement on the motion on Central America which I made in the Dáil on 26 April I indicated the Government's full support for the <Col N="2248" /> efforts of the Contadora Group to bring peace to Central America, and our willingness to assist the Contadora Group of countries in their efforts in all appropriate ways.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should be in no doubt that our partners in the Ten are aware of the concern of the Government and Dáil Éireann at the serious situation in Central America; our wish to see a peaceful negotiated solution to the problems and conflicts in that region and our desire to see a radically improved social, economic and human rights situation.</P>
    <P>The situation in Central America was discussed at the Stuttgart meeting of the European Council which ended several days ago and an important joint statement on Central America emerged from that meeting.  Ireland actively sought the issuing of this statement and played a full part in its preparation.  In that statement, the Ten heads of state and Governments expressed, among other things, their full support for the current initiative of the Contadora Group.</P>
    <P>The resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on 27 April was conveyed through diplomatic channels to the United States Government and to all of the Governments of the Central American region, including the members of the Contadora Group.  Moreover, the Deputy may take it that diplomatic missions accredited to Ireland are fully aware, both through their own efforts and those of my Department, of important decisions taken in this House.</P>

      <P>I am indeed aware of the famine situation in Ethiopia.  Regrettably it is no longer the threat of famine but the reality of this terrible condition which is affecting this country at present.  The most recent information available, based on Ethiopian Government figures, puts the total number of the drought-affected population at three million in 13 regions, of which the most seriously affected are the four northern regions of Gondar, Wollo, Tigre and Eritrea.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the present famine situation is but the culmination of a succession of droughts which Ethiopia has suffered over the last decade. In 1981, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation estimated that 4.5 million of Ethiopia's population of 31 million existed on food aid.  The country has also experienced repeated refugee crises in recent years as a result of the conflict in Eritrea and Tigre provinces and the dispute with Somalia over the Ogaden region.</P>
      <P>My Department have continuously monitored the drought situation in Ethiopia and have done so particularly closely in recent months as the famine situation has worsened.  We have received frequent reports on the extent of the famine from the national and international organisations involved in emergency relief work there.  In common with many other countries, Ireland has contributed to the relief of the situation there.  On 28 March 1983 the Government announced the allocation of £50,000 from the Disaster Relief Fund to the Irish Disaster Appeals Committee which groups together several of the Irish voluntary organisations engaged in the provision of emergency aid to Ethiopia.  Ireland has also participated in the EEC's emergency aid to Ethiopia which has consisted of a grant of two million UAs and food aid in the form of 5,000 tonnes of cereals and 94 tonnes of butteroil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did receive reports that some of the emergency food aid being sent to Ethiopia was being misdirected and used for purposes other than was originally intended.  These reports included allegations that some of the food aid was being <Col N="2262" /> diverted to the military forces instead of the civilian population.  My Department investigated these reports and were satisfied that the vast bulk of the food aid was reaching the people for whom it was intended.  The European Commission also conducted an investigation of similar allegations in relation to Community food aid through their delegation in Addis Ababa with the assistance of bilateral donors and non-governmental organisations.  Their conclusion, which was reported to the European Parliament by Commissioner Pisani on 14 April, was that there was no evidence to suggest that there had been any significant or generalised deflection of aid.  They recognised, however, that in certain areas of Ethiopia, the only available form of transport is military transport and that, to that extent, the military forces were involved in the distribution of food aid.</P>
    <P>Since then there have been no further allegations of misdirection of food aid and the reports received by my Department do not suggest that any such misdirection is taking place.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to monitor the situation in Ethiopia closely and will pay particular attention to the channels used for distributing food aid.</P>
    <P>The Government would be seriously concerned if it were shown that emergency aid allocated to any country was not being used entirely for the purposes for which it was intended, i.e. the relief of the victims of the emergency in question. Emergency aid is given by the Government on the strict understanding that it is distributed fairly and equitably among all the affected people and it would be quite unacceptable if such aid were restricted to one particular group of people or section of the community.</P>
    <P>If that were to take place in a particular country, the Government would take whatever steps were open to them to redress the situation and would seriously reconsider any plans they might have to provide further emergency aid to that country.</P>

    <P>The only figures available to me on job losses are those contained in the latest IDA manufacturing employment survey, conducted at the end of 1982.  This shows that there was an estimated 600 jobs lost in manufacturing firms in County Galway during 1982 while 674 jobs were gained resulting in a net increase of 74 in manufacturing employment in County Galway.</P>

      <P>Lough Mask is a State lake.  A dispute which existed between local interests and tourist interests concerning shooting on the lake has recently been resolved.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The action, which was unofficial, was in support of a demand for extra overtime <Col N="2289" /> for handling the orders.  The matter had been under discussion between local management and staff and proposals made by management on the previous afternoon had been taken away for consideration by staff representatives.  If the proposals were unacceptable to the staff, which turned out to be the case, it was open to them to make representations through the headquarters of their union in accordance with agreed disputes procedures. Regrettably, instead they took precipitate action which caused inconvenience to social welfare recipients.  In the event the matter was resolved on a basis which enabled the bulk of the unemployment pay orders to be delivered on the Friday afternoon and the balance was cleared over the Saturday and the following working day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the reason a sub-contractor's certificate has not been issued to a person (details supplied) in County Louth; if he is aware that the failure to issue this certificate is hindering the efficient financial operation of his business and that without this certificate his business is likely to go into liquidation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of a sub-contractor's certificate is governed by certain statutory conditions which are set out in section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970, and the regulations made under that section.  One of these conditions requires the sub-contractor to have discharged all tax liabilities for the three years prior to the year for which the application for a certificate is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in this particular case, tax is outstanding for the years 1980-81 to 1982-83 inclusive.  The position was explained to the taxpayer's agent in the course of a visit to the tax office on 20 April 1983.  The inspector of taxes has also written to the agent for clarification of certain matters in the accounts which have been submitted and a reply is awaited.  The question of issuing a sub-contractor's certificate will be further considered by the inspector when the taxpayer <Col N="2296" /> has complied with the statutory requirements.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 7 August 1982 and his claim was allowed at the maximum flat-rate benefit £68.05 weekly.  He exhausted 156 days of unemployment benefit on 8 February 1983 and as he did not fulfil the contribution conditions for continued payment at the maximum rate, his weekly flat-rate benefit was reduced to £59.20 from 9 February 1983.</P>
      <P>His entitlement to pay-related benefit with his flat-rate unemployment benefit is governed by the condition that the sum of weekly flat-rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and income tax rebate may not exceed 85 per cent of his average net weekly earnings.  The 85 per cent limit applicable to him is £65.53 weekly.</P>
      <P>Consequently he was not entitled to pay-related benefit during the period he was in receipt of flat-rate unemployment benefit at £68.05 when the weekly sum of flat-rate unemployment benefit exceeded the 85 per cent limit.</P>
      <P>However, he qualified for pay-related benefit at £6.33 weekly from 9 February 1983 when his flat-rate unemployment benefit was reduced to £59.20 weekly and all benefit due was paid.  He ceased to sign as unemployed after 12 February 1983.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £18.60 being the appropriate maximum weekly rate in his case of £21.20 less means notionally assessed by reference to PLV of £2.60 derived from his farm.  He is therefore receiving the correct rate of unemployment assistance based on the means notionally assessed in his case.</P>
      <P>The increases in social welfare payments generally due at the end of June 1983 will not apply to notionally assessed smallholders.  This follows from the High Court decision of July 1982, that the PLV system was unconstitutional and the granting of increases by reference to PLV would as a result be unlawful.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2339" /> All notionally assessed smallholders have been advised of this by letter.  They were advised at the same time that their means for unemployment assistance purposes would be factually assessed in due course.  Smallholders whose means are factually assessed will receive the benefit of the general increase in unemployment payments from the end of June.  Statutory provision for this matter was contained in the Social Welfare Act 1983 and provided that entitlements based on notional assessments must be reviewed within a period of three years.  These smallholders were also advised that they could apply for early assessment of means on a factual basis if they considered this would be to their advantage.</P>
