      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Dentists Act, 1928 it is illegal for a dental hygienist, or indeed for any other auxiliary dental worker, to perform any operation or to give any treatment usually performed or given by a dentist. However, I hope to introduce a new Dentists Bill soon to replace the 1928 Act. The new legislation will propose the setting up of a new Dental Council which would have the power to recognise and register auxiliary dental workers, including dental hygienists, and to specify the extent of the dental work they could undertake under the direction of a dentist. When this legislation has been enacted the qualifications and training of dental hygienists as well as the role they might play in the public dental service are matters which would have to be given detailed consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a new 100 bed unit at St. John's Hospital, Enniscorthy, is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  In view of existing financial constraints, progress on this development will depend on the priority attached to it by the board <i>vis-à-vis</i> its other capital projects.  The South Eastern Health Board's priorities in relation to the provision of geriatric accommodation are the replacement of the Sacred Heart Home, Carlow, followed by the replacement of the middle block at St. Joseph's Hospital, Dungarvan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the utilisation of the fever hospital, New Ross is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  The board's plan for the future of the fever hospital is that it will be used mainly for elderly patients.  It is the board's intention to retain a limited isolation service on the first floor of the hospital and to make the remainder of this floor available for expanded geriatric accommodation as soon as financial circumstances permit. The ground floor of the hospital is being used to accommodate elderly patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 33 persons currently awaiting admission to geriatric <Col N="1872" /> accommodation in the whole of Wexford. I believe the best way to deal with the geriatric services is through the community, not necessarily by providing extra beds.  That will be my policy.  We should try to keep these people in the community as long as possible.  That should be our way forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting the Minister's view that patients should be maintained at home as long as possible, would he concede that there are a considerable number of geriatric patients who require hospitalisation on a long-term basis?  It seems very bad policy to have this hospital in New Ross lying idle while there are patients waiting to get into hospital. When does the Minister intend doing something about this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 469 longstay beds in the Wexford district.  That is well in line with the general guidelines for the population as a whole.  I am not in a position to say when this hospital will be in full use, but given these circumstances there is not a big backlog of patients in Wexford.  As I said, I propose to try to involve the community caring for these people.  That is the way forward, rather than rushing in to provide beds.  If that is done quickly we will be moving in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I am at present reviewing the entire health capital medium-term programme in the context particularly of the revenue implications of the projects included in it, the contractual commitments already entered into and the priorities of the health agencies.  Pending the outcome of this review it is not possible to say when I can give sanction for the development to proceed.  Realistically, in the present economic circumstances, I cannot see any prospect of the work commencing in the short to medium term.</P>
      <P>I might mention here that the Midland Health Board's top priority for Tullamore is the provision of a theatre, mortuary and autopsy room at the hospital. I will give this development very serious consideration in the review of the capital programme.</P>

      <P>I accept that there has been a serious increase in the recent past in the number of young people abusing heroin in certain areas in Dublin.  I am not satisfied that the existing treatment facilities are adequate to deal with this new problem.  As an interim measure, the Eastern Health Board, with my approval, are taking steps to provide community-based facilities for drug abusers in the greater Dublin area.  The Report of the Eastern Health Board Task Force on Drug Abuse is being examined at present.  The board will be contacting my Department concerning the report's recommendations for the development of an integrated range of services to provide for the needs of people with drug problems.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will of course be aware of the establishment of the Special Committee of Ministers of State to review the drug problem.  The committee will be having particular regard to the problem in the Dublin area.  I hope to have the committee's recommendations within five weeks.</P>

      <P>I have indicated that I am not satisfied with the present facilities. I have also indicated that the Government are taking this matter very seriously.  They have set up a ministerial committee, of which I am chairman, which is working to get out a report on the matter as quickly as possible.  We have also advertised in the newspapers for those who have an interest in this subject to send in their submissions.  I am happy to say that we have received very good submissions and tremendous help and we will be making recommendations to the Government along those lines.

Also, is the Minister aware that Jervis Street Hospital facilities are totally inadequate to deal with the problem of drug addiction, particularly as there is no isolation unit for hepatitis and no rehabilitation unit in Dublin for those under 17 years of age. Would the Minister accept that the urgent need for a rehabilitation unit and isolation unit for hepatitis in Jervis Street is not dependent on a report from the committee?  Will he take some action in advance of this committee's report to ensure that these facilities will be provided?</P>

Also, they have not an isolation unit and patients have to be treated in Cherry Orchard Fever Hospital for hepatitis. <Col N="1876" /> It is desirable that the patients be treated in the hospital which they are attending.  As the report will be before us pretty quickly, there is not much point in drawing up a line of action in advance of the committee's recommendations.

This is a matter which concerns all sides of the House, co-operation has been forthcoming and I assure the Deputy that it is being tackled in that co-operative spirit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 February 1983, I made amending regulations which provide that, for the purpose of assessing liability for health contributions, farmers' income will be determined on the basis of profits or gains from farming activities less expenses actually incurred in earning these profits.  This means that farmers' income and the health contribution payable will be determined on the same basis as for other self-employed persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The health boards have collected this money in the past and will continue to do so, as the Deputy is probably aware, for this year.  A committee have been set up from the Departments of Health, Finance and Labour and from the Revenue Commissioners and are meeting at present to work out a better way of collecting this money. When they report for the year 1984-85, that will be the new method of collection <Col N="1878" /> but for this year the method of collection will be as heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that in previous years it was not so difficult for the health boards because the amount payable was based on the poor law valuation?  This year it is based on profits.  Would the Minister accept that a letter went out from his Department explaining to the health boards how to assess the profits, this assessment being based on a system different from that used by the Revenue Commissioners? Would the Minister also accept that the health boards are obliged to collect the Youth Employment Levy, 1 per cent levy, as well as the health contributions? Would he also accept that those who hold general medical cards are not obliged to pay the health contribution at all? Finally, would the Minister accept that it should be no function of the health boards to be revenue collectors, particularly in the present situation when they are asked to collect the youth employment and 1 per cent levy from people who are not obliged to pay a health contribution?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the assessment of farmers, it is estimated that 60,000 farmers who are liable have been assessed for income tax on the basis of income for the year beginning 5 April 1983.  These will have assessment notices from the Revenue Commissioners and the health boards will seek the production of these notices.  There will remain about 29,000 <Col N="1879" /> not assessed in that way and in their case self assessment will be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have asked the Minister is whether he accepts that there is a basic principle of privacy <i>vis-à-vis</i> a person who applies for a medical card, the issuer of the card and the medical doctor.  Would the Minister not accept that that right to privacy should not be breached, that the holding of a medical card should not be common knowledge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who has a medical card has it as of right.  I see no reason for the holder of a medical card not displaying that card if he so wishes. It is like the bus pass.  In the matter in question there is no element of a breach of privacy right.  It is a question of a scheme.  A medical card is being used as the criterion in a certain instance.  I do not see any reason for people not producing medical cards in the same way as they would produce any other form of <Col N="1880" /> identification in relation to the question of entitlement to transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that a medical card is issued on the basis of health needs?  It is a provision of our health services that medical cards be granted to those who by reason of their means are unable to provide medical care for themselves.  In other words, the medical card is a recognition of a health need.  Therefore, would the Minister not accept that a medical card should not be used as a means of determining eligibility for school transport or for anything else?  Would the Minister accept also that under EEC regulations, persons working on oil rigs in the North Sea are entitled to medical cards and consequently, their children are entitled to free transport on school buses while a family living a short distance away from those children would not be so entitled because of the family income being perhaps £1 of £2 above the limit for medical card eligibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have asked each director of community care and medical officer of health to investigate whether any cases of AIDS have occurred in his community care area.  The Department have asked each director to indicate, in respect of any case, the mortality rate, sex, age, sexual history, nationality and whether the patient has travelled abroad and, if so, to what countries. The directors were also asked to ascertain if the patient had sexual contact in any of the countries he or she may have visited or whether a blood transfusion had been received while in those countries.  To date, two cases of AIDS have been reported in this country.  One of the persons died.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to liaise on a routine basis with the directors of community care and medical officers of health to ensure that up-to-date information about AIDS is available so that appropriate measures may be taken to protect the public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, medical practitioners are obliged to notify cases or suspected cases of sexually-transmitted diseases seen by them.  Unfortunately, the number of cases of sexually-transmitted diseases notified to my Department does not represent the true incidence of these diseases. In an effort to improve the notification <Col N="1883" /> and reporting of infectious diseases in general, including sexually-transmitted diseases, my Department recently reviewed the appropriate procedures. Following this review, a circular issued to the health boards laying down revised guidelines designed to facilitate the collection and dissemination of comprehensive information regarding infectious diseases, including sexually-transmitted diseases.</P>
    <P>In addition to the recent review of the notification and reporting of infectious diseases in general, my Department have initiated a review of the Department's control measures relating to sexually-transmitted dieseases.  This review is designed to evaluate as far as is practicable the problem relevant to sexually-transmitted diseases in this country and to develop a framework for their prevention and control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said that there was under-notification, but in 1978 in Trinity College a survey was done of the incidence of sexually-transmitted diseases and the notification of them and there they came up with the conclusion that only 18 per cent of cases of sexually-transmitted diseases in this country were being notified.  Are any specific steps being taken in the interim, other than the general ones in relation to possible future regulations, to ensure that we will know the true incidence of sexually-transmitted diseases in this country and whether it is high or low in comparison with other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally accepted that it is low, but a major reason for non-reporting of sexually-transmitted diseases in Ireland is that people attend private doctors and because of the confidentiality and intimate nature of the problem doctors do not seem to pass on the information; also, obviously, we have a particular attitude about it.  As the Deputy is aware, there was an increase in the fee from £25 to £150 in 1981 which we thought might be a little sugar on the pill to help them to report infectious diseases such as this, but it has not done so. The Deputy himself is a medical man and I suppose he treats patients for many diseases and as far as he is concerned it is purely a relationship between doctor and patient.  He would be able to answer that better than I would.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the urgency and that this situation in Mallow has been ongoing for a number of years and that no decision has been taken?

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it has been kicking around for some time.  In May 1977 the Southern Health Board submitted proposals to my Department for the establishment of a self-staffed maternity unit in Mallow.  At the same time the health boards applied to Comhairle na nOspidéal, the body statutorily responsible for the approval of consultant posts, for the appointment of two consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists and one paediatrician in the Mallow hospital.  In October 1977 Comhairle nainOspidéal informed the health board that they could not approve of these applications on the grounds that the potential number of beds in Mallow hospital for the catchment population would not justify a minimum scale maternity unit.  The Deputy will be aware that in 1976 the comhairle laid down guidelines that the minimum size consultant-staffed maternity unit should have from 1,500 to 2,000 births each year.</P>

Demands on the hospital are likely to increase as did those in Naas.

      <P>On a point of order, a suggestion has been made by the Deputy opposite that I paraphrased some question he alleges was on the Order Paper last week.  I put down this question on the Order Paper.  I have no knowledge of the Deputy's question.  I presume he had one which happened to find itself ahead of mine.  This is an aspersion on my behaviour in the House which should be withdrawn.  There is no question of my paraphrasing a question on the Order Paper for constituency advantage.  If that is the sort of behaviour the Deputy opposite gets up to, that is fair enough.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from my reply to a recent parliamentary question which she asked, the Midland Health Board have decided that elective orthopaedic facilities should be provided at St. Vincent's District Hospital, Athlone, in the short term.

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the Midland Health Board in the first instance.  Expert medical opinion is that it is safer to have babies delivered in a consultant staffed unit with support facilities such as specialist paediatric, gynaecological, medical, surgical, pathological and radiological services close at hand, and that this is essential for the well being of mothers and babies.  I might add that the number of births delivered in Athlone is very low and has declined from 294 in 1972 to 93 in 1982.</P>
      <P>Taking these considerations into account, the board decided that the maternity unit at St. Vincent's District Hospital, Athlone, should be discontinued for planned deliveries and a small number of beds retained for emergency cases and for post-natal care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not quite hear the first part of the Minister of State's reply.  Is the Minister aware that there is extreme disquiet among all sections of the community in Athlone over the proposed announcement of the scaling down of the maternity section of St. Vincent's Hospital?  Would the Minister of State convey to his Minister the general community disquiet and also draw his attention to the great service this section has provided for mothers and the community at large in the town of Athlone and surrounding areas?  Further, would he ask <Col N="1896" /> the Midland Health Board if they would review their decision in this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that there is very little, if any, local agitation. The medical officer attached to the hospital has expressed opposition all right. But, given the figures and the numbers of births, the appointment of consultancy staff and the retention of a maternity hospital could not be justified.</P>

      <P>Industrial action has been taken at the Department's Sligo office by agricultural officers grades who are members of the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants.</P>
      <P>The strike action has been taken because two officers in one grade who were engaged on two different sets of livestock schemes were instructed to exchange duties.  No physical transfer is involved for the two officers who continue to be headquartered in Sligo, and their salaries and working conditions are not affected.</P>
      <P>I deplore the inconvenience which is being caused to herdowners and others in the Sligo/Leitrim area by this unwarranted action on the part of the union. Efforts by my Department to have this strike called off have so far proved unsuccessful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week with the excellent co-operation, as always, of the Government Whip we worked out this very detailed motion.  This was done on the basis of the amendments which had then been put down to the Finance Bill. The Government amendments put down yesterday, to which Deputy Prendergast has already referred, substantially alter the position.  Some of these are very severe and change the position as we discussed it at our Front Bench meeting last Thursday.  Rather than changing or disagreeing with this motion, I would ask the Government Whip on the basis of a gentleman's agreement if we could sit later than 12 o'clock on either of the two nights or later than 4 o'clock on Friday, preferably later in the night sessions in order to facilitate Deputies, if we are making slow progress on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreement was reached on the total time to be given to the Bill.  I think the Deputy's party sought 32 hours and it is 31½, almost exactly what was sought.  If problems arise or if the Deputy visualises problems arising because the timetable as set out does not take account of the balance of debate which now seems desirable from the point of view of the Opposition in the light of the latest amendments, we will of course be willing to co-operate in adjusting the timetable.  The total time for the debate was agreed initially and I think that will have to stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach will accept that the wording of the <Col N="2003" /> amendments takes up more space than the wording of the Bill.  That was not the position last Thursday when we negotiated the time with the Government Whip.  To continue to co-operate, I am asking for a gentleman's agreement that if we find there is a difficulty and we become stuck for too long on some section the time may be extended beyond midnight on Wednesday and Thursday or after 4 o'clock on Friday.  I understand that the Bill must be in the Seanad tomorrow week and that it will have to be signed in two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be reluctant to agree to that at this stage.  Late sittings beyond midnight have generally been avoided if possible.  The position could be reviewed in the course of the debate. Adjustments to the timetable could be made if necessary and we can review the position.  If a serious problem arises we will look at it, but with some reluctance as to sitting beyond midnight for reasons which have been traditional in the House.</P>

      <P>We have some sympathy with the amendment moved by Deputy Bell and I see now that the names of Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa have been added to it.  This amendment deals with personal allowances for income tax purposes.  While we consider it would be desirable if personal allowances could be improved and increased, we consider that in this year a better way of doing it is to increase the 35 per cent band, the standard rate, as we have done in our amendment.  While we have some sympathy with the amendment put forward by Deputy Bell, we will not support it; but we consider, as an alternative, that Deputy Bell should support our amendment because it is a better way of dealing with the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to raise for this and subsequent years certain personal tax allowances by a considerable amount.  The total cost of the package of changes proposed in this amendment would be £112 million in 1983 and £173 million in a full year.  While many of us would have a deal of sympathy with the proposal, I must point out to the <Col N="2014" /> House at this early stage that the Bill is based on the taxation provisions of the budget and since it has to give effect to those taxation provisions, there is not the leeway to depart in such a major way from the budgetary arithmetic as set out on 9 February.  For this reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>As I said, I was issued with this document only a short time ago and since then I have been running from one section of the House to another in an effort to find out what has happened.  I got about 15 or 20 minutes' notice.  The package proposed contains a number of Financial Resolutions that were interlinked. Amendment No. 58 was intended to introduce a wealth tax which would help to counterbalance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we could help Deputy Bell, who is a new Member.  We should explain to him that from his own point of view he should press amendment No. 6 because that is his attempt to increase the personal tax allowances this year.  That is all we are concerned with in amendment No. 6.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy but I was trying to get the procedure correct in my mind.  The amendment is quite straightforward and clearcut, as the Deputy has said.  I am trying to establish at this stage whether I have the right now to move an amendment to the following resolution. Have I the right to move an amendment to the wealth tax amendment which was ruled out of order?  The answers to those questions will dictate what I have to say.</P>

I was one of the Deputies unable to gain admission to the House through the Kildare Street gate.  I have <Col N="2015" /> been a Member of this House for 14 years and it is the first occasion on which I have been advised by a member of the Garda Síochána that I would have great difficulty in entering the House by way of Kildare Street.

    <P>I will first give some background to why Fianna Fáil decided to limit ourselves to this proposal to broaden the tax bands, particularly those between 35 per cent and 45 per cent.  We deliberately refrained from putting down a motion to raise the exemption limits, the subject of motions already on the Order Paper.  We deliberately refrained from requesting increases in the tax allowances which, as the Minister pointed out, would have involved considerable expenditure for Revenue.  For the same reason we refrained from putting down a motion, which we were tempted to do, to index the tax bands at every point, in line with Fine Gael policy some years ago.</P>
    <P>We refrained from doing all those things because we are conscious, as we said yesterday, of the need to take account of the revenue situation.  Though we refrained from those things, we felt it appropriate and essential to put down an amendment to adjust the tax band range, to increase the tax band range in the 35 per cent to the 45 per cent range from £3,000 to £4,000 in Part I and accordingly from £6,000 to £8,000 in Part II of the Table.</P>
    <P>Before we come to arguing precise details I will give some of the background to this.  Before the Minister comes in I should like to point to circumstances outside this House which presented some problems for Members today.  We totally disagree with what happened out there but it must be said that in the past few months, particularly since the Minister made a statement in the House which did not disclose the full facts in relation to the PAYE dilemma, it has been conveyed to people outside that there is a huge amount of unpaid tax and that the PAYE sector are bearing the entire burden. We have seen reactions, protests, divisions in our society, the very last thing we want at this time.  We have seen heat generated, like we saw outside the gates here today, which prevented people from coming in here to discharge their democratic responsibilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2019" /> It might help if I mention in that context that the level of income tax as a proportion of total tax revenue in the last two years has increased by a huge proportion. In 1981 the level of income tax was 31.3 per cent and, two years later, the estimate for this year is a huge increase in tax revenue of 39.45 per cent. Income tax as a proportion of total tax revenue has risen by that huge percentage. While income tax has risen as a proportion of total tax, total tax revenue this year will have risen from £3,135 million in 1981 to £4,730 million this year. We are seeing a very much bigger percentage of a very much bigger tax revenue being claimed by Revenue.</P>
    <P>This is obviously having a very serious effect not just on those who have to face and to pay that burden but on the whole economic climate.  Clearly, the work incentive is being undermined in this area.  I am confining myself here to those who are fortunate to be in employment. The level of taxation they see facing them has gone too far.  This tax burden is so great that it has caused comment by objective outside observers.  The EEC, commenting on our general strategy and supporting the idea of reducing our deficit, make the point very clearly that we are going in the wrong direction because the level of increase in taxation is such as to slow down the growth of our economy and deflate the economy at a time when we need to maintain a level of activity. Other provisions, such as the 1 per cent levy and not adjusting the tax bands, are calculated to increase greatly the burden of income tax on the PAYE sector.  That is having a very damaging effect not just on PAYE taxpayers but on the economy generally.  This is very worrying.  Our taxes on income as a percentage of the total must be nearly the highest in Europe, next to Denmark and the United Kingdom.  We are very far ahead of the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands.  A Dutch banker came here recently and told us clearly that he thought our level of taxation was too high.</P>
    <P>What do we want to achieve in this Bill?  Is it purely a means of collecting extra revenue?  Is it seen as being appropriate <Col N="2020" /> to maintaining the work ethos, or is that being cast aside?  We are very concerned about the fact that under the existing provisions a person pays 25 per cent on the first £1,000, 35 per cent on the next £3,000 and then one jumps into the 45 per cent band.  These figures apply to a single person and they are doubled for a married person.  After £12,800 &mdash; exemptions of £4,800 plus £2,000 plus £6,000 &mdash; a married person comes into the higher tax band of 45 per cent.  Many people who reacted to this measure are in industrial employment.  Some of them have taken unprecedented steps recently because they are in the 45 per cent tax band.  Company executives say this Bill will have two effects: first, it will kill the work ethos and second, it will encourage people to stay away from work, particularly at the end of the year so that they can get tax rebates.  Anyone who is not aware of that is living in cloud cuckooland. I am not accusing the workforce of bad work practice, far from it.  The opposite is true.  If there is already a tendency for people to stay away from work, when they go into this higher tax band they may ask themselves why they should go to work.  Under the existing tax bands this has been happening but what will happen when the new rates are introduced, especially if under the new wage agreements there is a small increase of 10 per cent when many more people will be in the 45 per cent band?</P>
    <P>We have given this a lot of thought and I would like the Minister to give me a cost on this.  When I was Minister for Finance Fine Gael asked Fianna Fáil to index the tax bands in line with inflation. That was part of their election programme. They argued in this House at great length for this indexation and accused us of not being concerned, but we have refrained from going as far as that.  Deputy Bell was adjusting in line with Fine Gael policy, but we are not going that far.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to cover is the 65 per cent tax band.  We take the view that we need to encourage initiative and incentive and, where possible, a moderate degree of wealth which can only redound to the advantage of the <Col N="2021" /> community generally.  As a consequence of the climate in which we are discussing this legislation the direction of the Bill seems to be to move stronger, harder and more determinedly above a certain line. I wonder how many of the Minister's colleagues believe we need a 65 per cent tax rate at this time.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister say &mdash; and I support him &mdash; that the better road is to control public expenditure, but we will criticise him if later in the year he says he will need more money for public expenditure. If he exceeds the amount provided for public expenditure, revenue must be increased accordingly.  It is getting to the point where tax revenue is becoming an end in itself.  That must not happen.  As Edmund Burke said a few hundred years ago, any fool can devise new impositions of taxes.  In measuring these impositions we have to ensure that we keep within a range that is reasonable.</P>
    <P>Revenue for the first quarter of this year was lower in some areas, such as excise duty, than was estimated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In two areas, the estimates are running ahead, one of which is VAT with which I shall deal later.  The other area is income tax where already we have reached almost 25 per cent &mdash; 24.2 per cent to be precise &mdash; of the total estimate in the first quarter, not taking into account the impact at this stage of this Bill of the 1 per cent levy and the effects of the restrictive impositions of maintaining the present tax bands.  I await convincing by the Minister and events may convince me even more later on in the year, but that suggests that while there is a consumer resistance on indirect taxes in matters of this sort, the impact of the Minister's budget proposals now being introduced is such as to increase the estimates which the Minister provided at the beginning of the year.  In my considered opinion at this stage he has overrun what he estimated he would get at the end of the year from income tax.  If that is the case, there is room for adjustment in that part of the band to which I referred, where people jump into the 45 per cent band after the first £4,000 of their taxable income.  Having regard to the need to maintain productivity, <Col N="2022" /> work ethos, work incentive and so on, we can very reasonably and cogently argue that our proposal is deliberately a very moderate proposal, one calculated to lift the burden from where it hits hardest and, above all else, encourage what is vitally needed at present in our economy &mdash; the incentive to work.</P>

      <P>The Minister to reply on amendment No. 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 8, which we are discussing now, proposes to increase the present and proposed 35 per cent band from £6,000 to £8,000 for a married man and from £3,000 to £4,000 for a single and widowed person and to do away with the proposed new 65 per cent rate.  The Deputy raised the question of the cost of this amendment.  This would be £49 million in 1983 and £76 million in a full year.  The new 65 per cent band &mdash; that is the contraction of the 60 per cent band and the introduction of a new 65 per cent rate &mdash; would in this year raise an extra £7 million and £11 million for a full year.  That puts the figures in perspective. We would then be talking about a total cost for both measures of £56 <Col N="2023" /> million in 1983 and £87 million in a full year.  These are substantial figures.  Were we at this point to modify the tax structure in order to carry these out, we would have to make adjustments elsewhere in order to accommodate those figures within the budgetary targets which we have fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Just for clarification, are these figures net or gross?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>These are gross figures, to begin with.  We would then have to accommodate the adjustment for those figures within the overall budgetary targets. To do that we would have to raise a corresponding amount of taxation elsewhere or reduce expenditure by a corresponding amount, or have some combination of both of these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From Deputy O'Kennedy's remarks in general on taxation, I doubt if he would make the case that we could raise a corresponding amount of taxation elsewhere. Certainly, the general tenor of his remarks was that the tax burden is already heavy enough as it is.  What he had to say about inventing new impositions did not appear to indicate that he considered there was a great deal of room elsewhere for new impositions.  Were we to make the changes proposed, there would be a very substantial gap of £56 million in 1983 to be covered in one way or another and within the budgetary framework of this year it would not be possible to do that.  We do not have the third option of increasing borrowing on that scale.  In any case, it would not be desirable, given the overall picture of total Exchequer borrowing requirements for this year.  I would not intend, by means of the measures suggested by the Deputy, to add further to our borrowing requirements which, in turn, would add further to our requirement for revenue for future years.  That is the problem with which we are grappling at the moment, one which has built up over a number of years.  This is not a valid answer to the problem.  I am not quite sure what the Deputy meant when he referred to all the <Col N="2024" /> things which he and his colleagues refrained from doing in past years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify, I thought I had made it clear that the amendments being put down by others in the House asked for a lot more in increasing exemptions and much greater allowances in the tax bands than we had asked for.  Those were the things we had refrained from doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>To that extent, the Deputy is less far out of court than some of the other amendments would have been but, nevertheless, he is out of court in terms of the overall budgetary constraints with which we have to live this year.  What the Deputy said about overall levels of taxation and the development of these is a matter of fact, as is the total of tax revenue proportion of national income taken up by taxes.  These things must be dealt with year by year and on a medium-term basis, in the way which appears most appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's proposals do not fit in with what is possible within the budgetary confines of this year.  He referred to the perception of levels of taxation.  I would remind him that the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General setting out the situation with regard to taxation in each given year was published on this occasion in exactly the same format as in previous years, with the same notes and the same qualifications.  I leave it to the Deputy to draw conclusions from that. As I have said here before, I do not dispute that we could probably present it in a more concise and more immediately meaningful way but I reject utterly any suggestion that the presentation of the figures so far as I was concerned was anything other than clear or anything other than accompanied by the proper qualifications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the point that we have published those figures in exactly the same format as they were published <Col N="2025" /> in previous years and with the same qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says he supports moves to reduce expenditure.  Perhaps that is not a discussion that is particularly appropriate to the business in hand here but it is something that I will hold the Deputy to when that discussion takes place.  I hope that on that occasion he will take the same view as he takes now and that his party seemed to take in October and November last.</P>
      <P>Regarding the 65 per cent rate, Deputy O'Kennedy says that I am hitting hard at those above a certain level and he included the self-employed in that reflection. That is not in any way part of my intention.  The question of how equitable and efficient our tax system is in its operation is a separate one.  At this point I am outlining the constraints we have this year.  We have had to go for a particular balance between modifications on the expenditure side as well as on the taxation side.  Those modifications were set out clearly in the budget and passed by this House.  They are the measures that this Bill is designed to implement.  Without going into a long discussion on budgetary strategy, all I would say is that the amendment proposed does not fit into the framework of the budget as agreed by the House.  Deputy O'Kennedy seems to have the impression that on the basis of the evidence contained in the returns for the first quarter this year, the revenue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the basis of the Deputy's assumptions in making these forecasts but unless he has some new evidence of which I am not aware I do not think there is enough evidence to warrant him drawing that conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>My first question relates to the total number of taxpayers. The second relates to the number of people in the PAYE category and the third is the number paying tax in the various categories and within the different bands.  The second point arises from the Minister's reply to Deputy O'Kennedy regarding the inability to accept the new table as proposed in our amendment because to do so would bring the cost to £56 million, that is, the £49 million plus £7 million.  However, only a few weeks ago the Minister said this was not possible because he could not find the extra money within the existing system and that he could not borrow the extra money.  Deputy O'Kennedy has made the point regarding the additional revenue from income tax and VAT.  Taking into account the further imposition on the PAYE sector and also the 1 per cent levy, the least the Minister should do in the light of the situation that has developed since the budget is to accept the amendment. I am sure the figures I have asked for will reveal that a huge percentage of those in the PAYE sector are on the higher tax rates.  This will affect many people, both married and single, whose incomes are reasonably low.  Therefore, the Minister should give this amendment much more serious consideration than he has indicated he will give to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking into account the points made about not being in a position to adjust the budgetary figures by the amount that would be involved, it is obvious that the Minister is overlooking an action taken by him a short time ago when, with one stroke of the pen, he added hundreds of millions of pounds to our foreign debt by accepting, indeed promoting, the devaluation of our currency within the EMS. Did the Minister give as much consideration <Col N="2027" /> then to the impact of the level of borrowing or to the impact of these budgetary figures or is he not too concerned about a decision of that kind?  He is not prepared to give any consideration to the hard-pressed PAYE sector, a sector that this amendment would go only some way towards helping?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the information available to me at the moment, the total number of taxpayers in the PAYE system is approximately 904,000.  This includes people who benefit from marginal relief and some whose income tax is collected via the PAYE system but who are not strictly speaking within the PAYE sector. Excluding the marginal relief, the total number of people paying is 870,000.  This means that between 34,000 and 35,000 are benefiting from marginal relief.</P>
      <P>The figures in respect of the various bands are as follows: 25 per cent, 71,000; 35 per cent, 435,000; 45 per cent, 194,000; 55 per cent, 88,000; 60 per cent, 40,000 and in the new 65 per cent band, it is estimated that 41,000 will be included in the year 1983-84.  In each case, the band given is the top band that the people concerned will reach.</P>
      <P>Regarding the second part of the Deputy's question, I must make the point again that the realignment within the EMS will give rise to certain extra costs in debt servicing and that it gives rise to an increase in the total of our outstanding debt to the extent that it is denominated in foreign currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The day I made the statement about that measure I made the point &mdash; I will repeat it now &mdash; that it is not the intention of the Government that any consequential changes resulting from that devaluation will be allowed to affect <Col N="2028" /> the overall budgetary balance which we have targetted for this year.  We will take whatever measures appear necessary in order to stay within the limitations I set out in the budget.</P>
      <P>The devaluation impact is not felt only on the level of our foreign interest payments, nor is it felt only in terms of the outstanding level of foreign borrowing. It is felt in particular in the competitive capacity of Irish exports.  I am sure that Deputies on the other side of the House have heard, as I have, a number of firms who have made the point that they have now found their situation considerably eased as a result of the measures taken during that realignment.  We have all heard of the woes of firms that were in serious difficulty because of the previous position of our punt as against sterling. Now they have had a very substantial easing of that position and their competitive capacity has been increased.  It is their competitive capacity which in the end allows them to employ people to come into the PAYE net and pay their PAYE taxes.  That is something to which we must have regard.  It was for that reason that we followed the particular course of action we did during that realignment.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to accept, as Deputy O'Kennedy has said on a number of occasions, that there are the negative side effects of this realignment but I am surprised that Deputy O'Kennedy so far has not said one single word about the positive side effects of the realignment.  He has managed to remain silent on the positive side effects&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The only significant matter the Minister relied on in his reply was the question of the borrowing requirement in the budget deficit.  We accept that that is of significance.  It is the only reason the Minister gave.  The Minister deliberately avoided giving any reply to any of the other points raised. His statement was rather cold, was matter of fact but it is not a matter for the Minister for Finance, or the Taoiseach, to make a nice objective, cool comment and leave it at that.  The Minister acknowledged that it was a fact that the level of our taxation had increased to an extent but he did not go beyond that.  The Minister has confirmed what we already know.  His facts speak for themselves.  We want to impress on the Minister the impact of those facts and the role he has to correct that impact.  It is not enough for the Minister, or the Taoiseach, in such circumstances to acknowledge facts. We want them to go a little further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In giving the increase in the income tax rate I referred to how that fact is demonstrated. That is very serious at this stage.  The Minister relied only on the effect of the budget deficit.  He said that if he gives it here he will have to make it up somewhere else and he asked me to provide it somewhere else.  My first answer to that is that the Minister is the person with the responsibility.  Minutes after I sat down the Minister said that I did not give any basis for my opinion but that is all it can be at this stage, that income tax revenue at the end of the year would be more than he projected for in his budget.  I thought I had given the basis but I will repeat it.  I said that if already in the first quarter of the year the income tax returns are 24.2 per cent before the impact of the budget measures, the levy <Col N="2031" /> and the fact that we have no adjustment &mdash; the income levy in particular &mdash; that that suggests that the Minister will get more in income tax at the end of the year than he budgeted for at the beginning.  I have a feeling that the Minister is aware of that fact because today, and previously, the Minister said that the extra costs he had undertaken recently in relation to devaluation &mdash; we will not argue the pros and cons of devaluation today although Deputy MacSharry's point is relevant &mdash; will not be allowed to upset his budget arithmetic.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister guarantee that? The Minister has extra costs and he has his budget arithmetic and how can he tell us this will not upset his budget arithmetic? It would seem to follow that it would but perhaps the Minister is aware of something that we do not know.  Perhaps the Minister is in agreement with the recent report of the ESRI which suggests that the budget deficit is likely to be lower &mdash; of the order of £800 million &mdash; than the £897 million he budgeted for at the beginning of the year.  Perhaps he sees signs, for one reason or another, that that is the case.  Perhaps he knows that he can play around here and there having regard to the situation.  He has the advice and is aware of the trends from reports by the Revenue Commissioners every month.  He has available all the facts while we can only go on terms of indicators generally.  I suggest that in the light of the knowledge he has what we are asking is not such as to throw his budget arithmetic out of order and will keep him within the parameters he has set.  I do not wish to object to what the Minister has done.  He has had some changes of mind since his budget arithmetic was introduced. The one example I will give is sufficient, the relief in respect of hotels. In introducing his budget the Minister had a very orthodox, clear opinion based on the advice of his advisers in relation to VAT on hotels and other matters.  He has made adjustments there at some cost to his budget arithmetic.  I believe we are talking about something of the order of £20 million.</P>

There have been adjustments and the Minister is satisfied that it will not affect his budget arithmetic, including devaluation. Nevertheless, Deputy MacSharry is quite right to ask that question in terms of the budget deficit.  The Minister concentrated on that and that must be allowed for also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adjustments we are all talking about and the figures he has given us here today are interesting and I want to tease them out more.  The adjustment in the middle of the tax band at 45 per cent will, he tells <Col N="2033" /> us, be £49 million this year and the new top rate of tax at 65 per cent will be £7 million, a total of £56 million which I understood from the Minister was the gross cost.  If that is gross, unless things have changed a little since the Department of Finance advised me, you can reduce that gross considerably because when making a concession of this sort you get a buoyancy through your indirect taxation, it feeds into the general system and you can allow for reductions of, let us say, 25 per cent on the gross figure, maybe more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ignored completely the taxes on income and wealth here as a percentage of total by comparison with other countries, but it is very relevant.  I am going back some years <Col N="2034" /> because we have not the latest figures, but I think that as a consequence of indirect taxes and the level of indirect tax increases here now, we are towards the top of the league in Europe, with the possible exception of Denmark and the UK, and the Minister must bear that in mind.  He makes no comment on that, although I am not saying that he will not comment afterwards.  If the only answer is the budget deficit &mdash; an important one &mdash; we accept that.  We want to suggest to the Minister that because of the importance of our proposal for the reasons I have already given when I introduced it the Minister will have leeway.  It would not upset his budget arithmetic and some of the adjustments, as he himself claims, will not upset his budget arithmetic, and trends, particularly the quarterly trend for the first quarter indicates that that is the case.  If that is so then in terms of the interest of both the revenue and economic activity and the interest of what is regarded as a major issue now, equity in taxation and lifting the burden of direct taxation, our proposal here is framed for exactly that purpose.  It is a carefully calculated proposal to which we gave much thought, consideration and discussion and it does not measure up to some of the things that I, Deputy Mac Sharry or others have been asked to do in our time by the Opposition parties.  It asks for very much less for very good reasons.  The Minister should decide that he will have a look at it and come back with some suggestion on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has not answered the comment that it is at the middle of the tax bands that a major problem occurs, as is the case.  As I heard frequently when I was in the Department, people in the business world, the industrial world and fairly highly paid skilled workers will tell you that it has a very bad effect on productivity. I cannot produce day, date and case to prove it nor would it be appropriate that I should.  We move into a new rate of tax at 65 per cent when more than anything else &mdash; one is almost in despair &mdash; we need to encourage incentive, get up and do, get up and succeed and if necessary be wealthy; it is not a sin provided you recognise your role in society. <Col N="2035" /> At that very time we introduce a tax which is to bring in £7 million this year. This is an extra tax band.  The Minister should reflect seriously on this.  His disposition may be in that direction but I recognise that he has responsibility, that he is told to keep his books right.  I press him to reconsider on Report Stage this very reasonable proposal on our part which is not of such dimensions as to upset his arithmetic.  It will have a very major impact on the problems that have been expressed outside this place and elsewhere and it will be an encouragement to people.  Work is the answer to our problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House.  I want to make a few points on section 2 of the Bill and the Fianna Fáil amendment in particular.  It is absolutely lunatic policy to attempt to introduce a 65 per cent rate now and we on this side of the House are vehemently opposed to it.  When you examine it closely you will agree that it is a lunatic policy.  It is exactly wrong for the economy at this time.  Somehow the Minister has managed to get it wrong at both ends of the scale, at the top by killing whatever small incentive is left in the economy by upping the rate from 60 per cent to 65 per cent, and towards the bottom of the scale at the 35 per cent rate where he has refused to widen the band so as to allow people some take-home pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effectively the Fianna Fáil amendment, if accepted, would bring the bands back to where they were in the tax year 1981-1982, the year before last.  If you look at the suggested 65 per cent and the 2 per cent levies which are now on gross income you have a top rate of some 67 per cent.  The corresponding figure in the UK is 60 per cent.  I have not the US figure but it is certainly lower than ours. Therefore, some of our big competitors are put at another advantage by having a greater attraction for management skills and expertise.  This 65 per cent tax rate will add further to the number of skills, particularly at management level, the number of people with good management skills, leaving this country in vast <Col N="2036" /> numbers.  I say that having talked to many executives in Irish companies and throughout the Irish economy.  They are absolutely browned off with the crippling draconian level of taxation.  They will throw their hands in the air and say: &ldquo;This 65 per cent is the final straw, the final attack.&rdquo;  The Minister should think about one of our greatest assets &mdash; our management skills and expertise.</P>
    <P>The higher rate of taxation &mdash; the phrase used &mdash; now starts at 45 per cent. One would swear that the higher rate of taxation was to be applied to millionaires, but a single person with no mortgage and earning £5,450 a year will hit that rate with a personal allowance of £1,450, the first £1,000 and the next £3,000.  He is into what the Minister now calls the higher rate of taxation.  Why should anybody work when we have penal and draconian taxes like that?</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil amendment is an effort to slow down entry into the 45 per cent band, and should be accepted.  It is sensible and reasonable.  In some ways it is only a gresture, but it is a very important gesture to the people now in that tax band, 435,000 people.  Nearly half a million taxpayers would be keenly interested in seeing the Minister accept the Fianna Fáil amendment.  Our amendment recognises the difficult Exchequer situation to which the Minister referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Diminishing returns are just about to set in, if they have not set in already at this level of taxation. We ask the Minister to pause and consider that his failure to widen the 35 per cent band and his introduction of this draconian 65 per cent are the two wrong policies for the Irish economy.  Our amendment is pretty sensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy O'Kennedy the Minister said he could not give in on this because of budgetary measures, and so on &mdash; the usual answer.  His refusal to accept our amendment will do two things. By hanging onto this higher rate of tax he will reinforce the view now sweeping the country dangerously that we are <Col N="2037" /> anti-incentive, anti-investment and anti-enterprise, and that the energy and the initiative to work have left us.  There is also a feeling in the Government that the introduction out of the blue of a 65 per cent tax rate is giving in to the left, as it were, and giving in to those policies without having any regard to the need of the Irish economy.  The Minister should ponder on that.</P>
    <P>I ask him to accept the reasonable and sensible Fianna Fáil amendment.  It is a gesture towards common sense to leave the 60 per cent alone and widen the 35 per cent band.  If the Minister does that, he will encourage the Irish people to work.  He will encourage incentive and initiative and prevent the brain drain which is starting up again.  This is lunatic policy.  Ireland is quickly getting the reputation of being a country in which anybody would be crazy to invest.  By refusing to accept our amendment the Minister is adding to that widely held view and damaging our economy gravely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave us a breakdown of the total taxpayers amounting in all to 870,000 if you leave out the marginal relief people.  Could he give us a breakdown of the 870,000, or 904,000 if he wants to stay with that number, in the various categories as suggested in the Fianna Fáil amendment in the name of Deputy O'Kennedy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to the voices of my colleagues in support of this amendment.  I will be very brief because we are all under great time constraints in dealing with this very important finance measure.  I want the Minister to answer a query put by Deputy O'Kennedy.  If we are dealing here with a cost of £49 million plus £7 million &mdash; £56 million less the usual 30 per cent, as Deputy MacSharry called it &mdash; that would bring us down to about £38 million.  Is that in fact what the Minister says is the cost of our amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister as strongly as I can that he should accept this amendment.  The 35 per cent bracket is of very great significance for a very large number of very hard pressed <Col N="2038" /> employees.  The amendment is a very small movement.  As somebody said, it is more a gesture than anything else.  It is an attempt by us to be totally responsible. We could have framed this amendment and this table in a completely different way.  We could have looked for the moon. We might have made ourselves very popular with the taxpayers by asking for all sorts of outrageous concessions. We have not done that.  We have made a very restricted and limited plea on behalf of possibly the hardest pressed section of the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to consider the amendment favourably.  It would have an enormous effect in taking the heat out of the present situation and in damping down this very dangerous feeling of frustration, irritation and envy which is building up.  I want to blame the Minister and some of his colleagues very largely for the feeling which is rampant today among employees.  In an endeavour to protect their own political hides the Minister and his colleagues contributed to this feeling of envy.  They tried to persuade decent working class people that there was a great big pot of gold there and, if only the Government would do something about it, that would make their lot a great deal easier.  That accusation can be levelled very fairly against the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government contributed to that feeling. Much of the anger and frustration now making themselves evident in the PAYE sector arise from the deliberate policy of the Government in trying to create that feeling among basically very decent people who do not want to be on the streets, who do not want to be protesting, and who do not want confrontation.  The Government helped to engender the anger we are witnessing today.  The Minister should accept this amendment.  It is very limited in scope and it would help the hardest hit section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2039" /> I want to reinforce what Deputy O'Kennedy said.  The Minister can accommodate this in his budgetary resolutions. He has already given clear evidence with his very welcome concessions to the hotel industry and the motor trade that there is some flexibility there. Admittedly the two concessions he made in those areas were very limited and of very small dimensions, but they indicate to us that the Minister has a little room for manoeuvre, has scope for flexibility. I appeal to him to use that scope to accommodate this proposal of ours.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the ESRI report to which Deputy O'Kennedy referred.  That would seem to indicate that the Minister has £100 million at his disposal to accommodate concessions of this sort.  The Minister pitched his current budget deficit at £900 million and, according to the ESRI report, it will work out at £800 million. Without either increasing taxation or increasing the budget deficit planned, he could accommodate not just this proposal of ours but a number of others as well.</P>
    <P>That is the reason for my brief contribution. I want the Minister to look on this not just as an Opposition amendment which has to be rejected out of hand; it is more than that.  It is not an attempt by us to embarrass the Government or to put the gun to their heads.  It is an attempt by us to put forward a moderate, reasonable proposal in an effort to mitigate the effects of taxation on this section of the tax-paying public.  I would ask the Minister to consider it very much on its merits from the point of view of fairness, justice and equity.  Secondly, he might consider, from the point of view of his overall budget arithmetic, whether or not he has not really got scope in which to accommodate a concession of this size.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Fianna Fáil amendment.  It does not go quite as far as ours but something on those lines must be inserted into this Bill if it is to have any acceptance among the public. Our proposal would mean that those people earning under £6,000 would still remain within the 35 per cent tax band. The Minister's proposal is that once one <Col N="2040" /> reached £4,000 one moved into the 45 per cent tax band.  It must be remembered that that amounts to £80 a week, out of which probably there must be met payments into a pension fund, probably union dues, perhaps repayment of a loan to a credit union and so on.  That proposal is unbelievably bad.  I would appeal to the Minister to revise that provision. Under the Fianna Fáil amendment one could earn up to £5,000 before moving into the 45 per cent tax band.  At least that would constitute a fair improvement on the present situation.  Certainly, I add my voice to the appeal to the Minister to accept that proposal at least.</P>
      <P>We have no objection to the 65 per cent band.  However, we would not agree to its implementation where the Minister suggests: that once one earns £10,000 one is subjected to the 65 per cent tax band. Under our proposal one would be earning over £12,000 before entering the 65 per cent tax band.  The Fianna Fáil amendment would keep the rate down to 55 per cent under £9,000.</P>
      <P>I do not think that this Fianna Fáil amendment &mdash; or even if ours were accepted &mdash; will reduce the level of protest because that has accumulated over a number of years and has become firmly entrenched among PAYE workers.  As has been said here time and again, it is not so much the amount they pay but the small amount everybody else seems to pay and the fact that other people seem to get away without paying is the contention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the small pay increases allowable by the Government are implemented it will be found that for every pound a person receives almost 50 per cent will be absorbed by this tax proposal under which one enters the 55 per cent tax band once one earns over £6,000.  In other words, one will receive only 45p out of every pound of any wage increase. It will be found that when a worker receives a wage increase of, say, 5 per cent, 6 per cent or 7 per cent, having had a long struggle, and rather than receiving £5, £6 or £7 on every £100 he or she will receive only £2, £3 or £4, there will be an unbelievable reaction.  The Minister should take that into consideration.  The <Col N="2041" /> reaction to this will increase throughout the year, not just when this Bill is passed. As every pound increase in wages is received &mdash; whatever workers receive &mdash; it will be much too low to cover the current inflation rate and 50 per cent will be taken from them under this taxation proposal.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to look at the lower rate again and allow the 35 per cent tax band to apply at least up to earnings of £5,000, as is the case in Deputy O'Kennedy's proposal.  It is a minimal amendment of the Bill the Minister might accept and I appeal to him to do so.</P>

      <P>With respect, I feel the Minister is out of touch with the reality of the situation prevailing in the business community at present.  I say that realising the grave difficulty the Minister faces in his portfolio.  But business at present is literally under siege.  In regard to any incentive to employ more people, this penal taxation proposed to be introduced will be the last straw.  Rather than pandering politics of some kind, the Minister has a firm duty to the business community, to those struggling hard to keep businesses going, who appear to act as tax gatherers for the Minister's Department, in contrast to the PAYE people who are paying directly.  But there are tax gatherers in the form of employers who already have an enormous amount of paper work to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister estimated that 41,000 people would be paying this upper limit. Again, with respect &mdash; and I am sure it is merely an estimate of some kind &mdash; I do not feel for one moment that that yield will be forthcoming at all.  On the contrary, people will turn away from this form of taxation, will not expand their businesses or be encouraged to enlarge <Col N="2042" /> their scope in various areas they might otherwise do.  I am not optimistic on this one.  As the debate continues the Minister will see that there is a very valid case to be made.  Given the economic climate in which we now find ourselves, I hope the Minister will be seen to be a person who will give the incentive to business which is being called for all over the country at present.  This is where the gesture can be made.  The more equitable mix we have put forward in our composite amendment here has been commended at great length from both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Talking to the business community &mdash; I am certain the Minister has encountered this himself and will have read in this morning's papers about the Chamber of Commerce comments &mdash; it is felt that we are taxing ourselves out of existence.  It is a constant finger-pointing exercise against those people endeavouring to give solid employment here, not realising that all the time three fingers on the hand are pointing back at ourselves.  We are causing and compounding that problem. The introduction of a mad taxation of this kind, this upper limit, will cause untold damage to the business community. Having said that, I am sure the Minister could well argue: well, it will be only those people who can afford to pay who will have to pay this taxation, those who are qualified to pay.  Certainly, that is so.  But, apart from a civil service-type approach to framing legislation, one must consider in an open economy such as ours that the creation of wealth and its distribution is an integral part, the very bedrock, of our democratic system.  The time has come when the incentive must be given back to private enterprise.  The Minister will concede that this is how the system got under way in the first place. We have been overtaken by a Goliath of a taxation system which is throttling business houses to death.  The Minister has a golden opportunity to give a badly needed incentive to private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Regarding employment, disincentive on a continuing basis will add further to the numbers in the dole queues. That point has not been brought out fully. More and more people will become more <Col N="2043" /> and more frustrated with the system of paying enormous sums of taxation and will not employ people.  That will lead to dimishing returns.  I appeal to the Minister in good faith to accept this amendment in its totality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make a point which I would ask the Chair to consider in future.  What happened here today was unfortunate.  I am not blaming the Bills Office or anyone on the staff.  I know that many amendments were put down by the Government, The Workers' Party and Fianna Fáil.  I was ruled out of order at such short notice that it was most unfair. I am not blaming you because you are only exercising your powers under Standing Orders.  The amendments were lodged a week ago last Friday and I became aware of what had happened only a short time before the amendments were to be moved.  The dash to the Bills Office and the dash back here to try to get in this amendment before the motion was reached were unsuccessful, mainly due to the time limit involved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey suggested that the amendment or an amended version of it could be moved on Report Stage but there is not a great deal of difference between this amendment and the Fianna Fáil amendment.  There are differences in emphasis but the objective is basically the same in so far as it is an effort to improve the taxation position in relation to that category of the work force which is suffering greatly as a result of the budget and by the continuing burden of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who have worked in the trade union movement and have been deeply involved on the factory floor know that the demonstrations which have been going on will not go away.  Perhaps we could get changes by democratic means through the good offices of the ICTU or other unions in making representations to the Minister of the day.  The approach of the trade union movement to successive Ministers has been the same but very little has been achieved in relation to this subject.  It is not a matter of the trade union movement demonstrating outside <Col N="2044" /> the Dáil; that does not move me. What does move me is that the danger signals are there for us to see.  The very foundation of democracy could well be at stake.</P>
    <P>The industrial and commercial worker is the backbone of democracy.  He or she is the person who is paying the lion's share of the money needed to keep this State going.  My colleague, Senator Kirwan, recently said that this is the sector which is being milked.  There is no doubt about it.  Successive Governments have suggested various ways of raising capital such as the imposition of levies on other sections of the community.  They simply did not pay and nothing was done about it.  The fellow on the factory floor can see what is happening.  He can see that other sectors have been allowed to get away without paying the appropriate level of taxation because successive Governments did not do their job, did not tackle the problem of tax evasion, did not do anything about the sectors which do not pay tax at all and did not do anything in relation to the wealth tax except remove the tax which did exist.</P>
    <P>I make a very strong appeal to the Minister in regard to one sector.  In my constituency I have been inundated during the past few weeks with representations from old age pensioners and widowers.  Retired employees of one concern in my area, Cement Limited, are in receipt of a small industrial pension of between £15 and £20 per week, say £100 a month.  All of those pensioners have now been brought into the tax net, as have widows of deceased pensioners who are in receipt of small pensions ranging between £10 and £12 a week.  The Minister is responsible for the taxation of these people, men and women who have built up this State and worked for 40 or 50 years.</P>
    <P>At the end of their working life they receive an old age pension which is not sufficient to keep them and some of them may also get a small industrial pension. As a result of the provisions of this budget, all these people are now being taxed and they cannot understand it.  I know a woman aged 82 who is confined to bed and for the first time she was asked <Col N="2045" /> to fill in a tax form.  She has not worked for 50 years and her husband died about 30 years ago.  As a result of filling in the form she is now paying tax on a pension of about £5 a week.  That is one of the reasons I got very annoyed when I was ruled out of order in my attempt to introduce an amendment with regard to wealth tax.  It was an effort to get more money from those who can afford to pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>What is happening is that old age pensions and widows' pensions are being calculated for taxable purposes. The old age pension and the widow's pension are being taken out of the total tax allowance and total tax is being applied.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of the situation but in the past week I have been informed of 40 or 50 such cases.  The trade union movement is the only section speaking on behalf of the retired; many of them are former members of trade unions but now they have no voice and are not organised.  I am asking the Minister to keep this matter in mind and to make provision for people who have worked in industry all their lives.  I had many things to say in relation to the amendments we had tabled but the two most important amendments have been ruled out of order.  In my opinion if a vote had been taken on the first amendment it would have gone through.  A great opportunity was missed today, perhaps by accident.  I appeal to the Minister to give special consideration to the section <Col N="2046" /> of the community to whom I have referred, even if it means taking more from the people who are working and if we reduce still further the incentive to work.  The Minister should give some positive consideration to the old people to whom I referred.</P>

      <P>During the debate reference was made to the level of taxation here as compared to the level in other countries.  Deputies will appreciate it is not easy to lay one's hands immediately on information of that kind but I have here some information in relation to comparative levels of taxes on incomes and profits as a percentage of total taxation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows from his time as Minister for Finance and when he was involved in making international comparisons as a Commissioner of the European Community, it takes some time to get together information of this kind.  I give the following information with regard to 23 OECD countries for what it is worth.  Seven countries had a lower proportion of taxes on incomes and profits as a percentage of total taxation than was the case in Ireland and 15 had a higher proportion but to what extent the figures are significant in absolute terms is debatable.  For example, the difference between Ireland and the highest was as follows: we had about 36½ per cent as a proportion whereas the highest was New Zealand where the proportion was 69.9 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that.  I am talking about the proportion of taxes on incomes and profits to total taxation.  For <Col N="2047" /> the information of the Deputy, I would remind him that from 1967-68 and from 1973-74 the combined top rate of income tax and surtax was 80 per cent.  We had rather high rates of taxation in the past and they do not seem to have resulted in all of the difficulties to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey and Deputy O'Kennedy suggested that I had said that adjustments which I have made so far in the past few weeks do not upset the balance of the budget.  I should like to make this point very clear.  One of them does not, namely, the measures we have taken in relation to the motor industry.  As I said, that was intended to be a self-financing measure to the extent that the reduction in VAT on garage services is offset by an increase in excise duty.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that we spent a considerable time discussing that measure with the motor industry who had been making a case in relation to this matter since the summer of last year.  It took some time to arrive at the final balance between the various parts of the proposal. I am sure Deputy O'Kennedy appreciates that one does not jump in and find a readymade solution particularly when one's concern is to find a way of compensating for the effect on revenue.</P>
      <P>The measure in relation to the hotel industry is not self-financing in that respect because there was no other means by which we could make it so.  The cost this year will be in the region of £2,500,000.  When the Government announced that measure I said it would be necessary to take measures to ensure it does not affect the overall balance at the end of the year: having said that, obviously it will affect the overall balance and other measures will be necessary. Deputy O'Kennedy on a number of occasions has asked what this means and I have replied on a number of occasions that I cannot say now what that means. If Deputy O'Kennedy thinks back to events last summer he will appreciate what I mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey and Deputy O'Kennedy examined the cost of the <Col N="2048" /> measure proposed in this amendment. The various calculations they made conclude that the net cost is considerably less than the gross cost to which I referred of £56 million.  It is true that if we were to reduce the amount of taxation in the order of £56 million, there would be some factor of buoyancy to be taken into account.  On the other hand, the measures we would have to take to compensate for that to remain within the budgetary balance would have their own negative effects on buoyancy.  There would be a negative effect on buoyancy if we were to increase taxation elsewhere and, equally, there would be some negative effect if we were to take action to reduce expenditure.  The two sides of the balance have to be weighed up against each other.  It is not enough to say that because of the buoyancy factor the total cost of the measure would be less than the figure I have put on it.  There are compensating factors on the other side that would have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey and Deputy O'Kennedy referred to forecasts recently published by the ESRI.  The ESRI concluded, on the basis of their examination, that the budget deficit this year would come to rather less than the forecast we have at Government level.  I must point out to the Deputies that the ESRI forecast is based on a number of assumptions which differ in several respects from the assumptions I use in my forecast.  I do not propose to get into a discussion on the relative merits of the ESRI forecast as against those of the Department of Finance.  Suffice it to say, having examined it, that I do not have any particular reason to change my mind about my forecast of the budget deficit at this point.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that such would be my haste to tell him that he would not see me coming for the dust. I do not see that kind of latitude there at the moment.  It is extremely unwise to base proposals of this kind on those forecasts and that is another reason why I am not inclined to go along with the amendment before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy S. Brennan suggested that we are getting into the area of diminishing returns in relation to total returns.  It is probably not my business to say this but I invite Deputy S. Brennan and Deputy O'Kennedy to get together on this because they seem to be facing in different directions.  Deputy O'Kennedy is trying to make the point that I will collect more tax than I claim I will.  Deputy Brennan is making the point that I will collect less tax than I claim I will.  When <Col N="2050" /> those two Deputies can get together and face the same way perhaps we can resume the discussion later on.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with what Deputies on the other side of the House have been saying with regard to the total level of taxation.  I have made the same observations also.  We are, unfortunately, in the position where we are obliged to have a fairly high level of taxation.  I am not talking in comparative terms, comparing us with any other country in the world.  I am talking in terms of absolute levels of taxation here.  The reason we are in that position is that we have built up an enormous amount of foreign debt servicing burdens which we must repay.  The only people who can repay those debts are the people who live, work and pay tax in this country.</P>
    <P>We have seen that the option, which people seemed to feel was the proper one to take in recent years, borrowing to finance current expenditure on a fairly large scale, is not one we can continue with indefinitely.  We are now picking up the tab for that particular policy in past years.  That is what gets us to the point where we have our present levels of taxation. I believe Deputy O'Kennedy agrees with this.  Taxation is not the only side of the coin.  There is another side to it and, as I said earlier, I will be relying on Deputy O'Kennedy to keep to the opinion he mentioned earlier on about expenditure.</P>
    <P>I hesitate to return to this but Deputy Haughey deserves a reply.  He made an allegation that the Government have deliberately engendered anger among what he calls the PAYE taxpayers.  I utterly reject that suggestion.  If anything has engendered anger among PAYE taxpayers and elsewhere it is the fact that we have found ourselves, as a result of policies followed in previous years, with so little leeway in terms of the kind of policies we can pursue, if we are to meet squarely the problems we have to deal with today.  The tragedy of our situation now is that the policies which have been followed have left us with so little leeway that we find we must deal with them in the way we are following now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the Deputy in relation to incentives but I will not follow the policy of giving spurious incentives this year at the price of mounting up further debts in future years that will be required to be met by taxation in those years.  The point has been made that we have got to the end of that particular line.  Within the limit of our present budgetary constraints I agree we must try to organise things in such a way as to leave the greatest levels of incentives. That is what we are doing but those limits are very tight, very strict and do not allow a great deal of latitude for doing the kind of things this amendment proposes to do.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla made a number of points about the moment at which a taxpayer gets into particular rates of taxation. I would like to pick up those points in case there might be any misunderstanding in the House.  Deputy Mac Giolla made the point that a single taxpayer gets in to the 45 per cent tax band at £80 a week.  He is referring to a figure of £4,000 of taxable income.  A single taxpayer begins to pay 45 per cent tax at a total income level, assuming he has only the personal and PAYE allowances, at a total income level of £6,336 and not £4,000, as Deputy Mac Giolla said.  The same applies to the other examples he took in relation to the point at which the higher tax rate begins.  He was speaking about taxable income and not total income.  We have to add the total allowances to that.  Deputy Brady spoke about pandering politics.</P>

      <P>The Deputy also made the point that businesses are tax gatherers.  I invite the Deputy to consider what has been happening here for many years past. It happens in every other country in the world.  There is no country in the world where businesses do not gather tax for the State in one way or another.  All of the EEC countries have VAT collected by businesses.  All of the countries in the OECD have systems more or less akin to PAYE for income tax which businesses collect on behalf of the Government.  The fact that businesses are gathering tax here does not mark us apart from any other countries with developed economies.  It has been proved by experience that that is the most convenient way to collect those taxes.</P>
      <P>Realistically, there is not any way we can get out of that, and to make that point as a criticism of any Finance Bill is not in any way to be taken seriously.  I did not exactly understand what Deputy Bell meant when he spoke about a lady who pays tax on £5 a week.  Particular cases cannot be discussed across the floor of the House like this, but I would remind Deputy Bell that we have increased the overall exemption this year from £4,400 to £4,800 for a married couple and from £2,200 to £2,400 for a single person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more fundamental point made by Deputy Bell is a suggestion that, given what is going on around us, the foundations of democracy could be at stake.  I <Col N="2053" /> wonder if we have given enough thought to that claim.  I am not sure I would agree with that statement for the reason Deputy Bell gave.  It is up to us today to face the capacity of this country to continue to expand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot any longer avoid the kind of action that is required to do that.  I will give an illustration to underline the situation we are in and that we are dealing with.  The equivalent of approximately one third of total tax revenue this year will be required to pay the interest on foreign debt, roughly £1,700 million.  I am sure Deputy O'Kennedy will appreciate this point.  As Minister for Finance I find it a great pity that that much revenue is being collected from our people that we cannot use directly to deal with the difficulties we all see around us &mdash; to provide for investment and for current services.</P>
      <P>I find it a great pity, to put it mildly, that such a big proportion of our tax revenue should have to go to pay for yesterday's bread.  I do not intend to allow that to continue.  We must rectify it, and therefore it is most important, this year particularly, to stay within the kind of budget targets we have set.  For that reason alone I cannot recommend acceptance of an amendment of the kind put forward by the Opposition.  It does not fit in with the overall targets, which will be of fundamental importance this year, next year and the following year. We must regain our own capacity to use our tax revenue, which is produced by our own people, to provide on a continuing basis for future needs rather than to pay for our past mistakes.</P>

      <P>The issue here is very important.  The Minister has recognised it, the House has recognised it, but unless we can convince the Minister I do not think there is any point in prolonging it, due to the time constraint.  I will make some observations which may be of some importance for the record.  I am glad the Minister has acknowledged that he has a good deal of sympathy with the amendment. I do not think he is the only one on that side who must have a good deal of sympathy with the amendment.  The Labour Party, whose benches again are significantly vacant, as they sometimes are in debates like this, must also have a good deal of sympathy with the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will make some other points for the record.  As I have said, the Minister has a degree of sympathy with the case made by this side because of the impact higher taxes can have on incentive, the damage they can do and their effects on the work ethic.  It is also important to have on record that the Minister disagrees with the forecast for the budget deficit.  Time alone will tell who is right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's job is to make calculations that he will adhere to and that will be right.  The Minister does not accept that income tax revenue this year, on the basis of the first quarter's returns, will be in excess of the estimate at the beginning of the year.  They are the reasons why the Minister is not accepting our amendment.</P>

      <P>If the forecasts were wrong then the Minister would have much greater leeway to accept what he has frankly acknowledged would be reasonable and which in other circumstances he might be disposed to accept, but in these circumstances this year he cannot.  That is the first point and it is very important.  We are asking less at this time than any of our Fine Gael predecessors when in Opposition asked in money terms, much less in real terms.  That is a matter of very considerable importance. The Minister does not feel free to accept an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put these final points very clearly on the record.  The Minister must acknowledge that two statements he made in this House have had a very significant impact on what happened outside the House.  First, there was the reply he gave to Deputy De Rossa about the amount of outstanding tax.  He gave a figure in the region of £960 million and made a general qualification which is on the record.  If I thought the Minister intended questioning it I would have brought it into the House.  He said these were fair assessments but the actual figure which would become due would be substantially less.  Two months later in this House the Minister gave precise figures, which he should have given on the first occasion, because in his political judgement he must have known they were important.  He said the amount of tax outstanding at the end of this year would be of the order of from £80 million <Col N="2056" /> to £100 million.  He started with the figure of almost £1,000 million and came down to £100 million.  I remember Deputy Mac Giolla saying he wondered what the debate was about.  He said he knew it was to enable the Minister and myself&mdash;he thought we were in cahoots&mdash;to give a distorted impression.  I am not blaming Deputy Mac Giolla because it sounded strange that the precise figures which were very relevant on day one were only mentioned two months later.  If they had been mentioned on the first occasion we would not be caught in a strait-jacket.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have told us that 9 per cent of PAYE tax is paid by company directors.  I asked for that information by way of a written question some time ago.  It might have helped if that information had been made known, but it was not.  At a time when we are trying to promote cohesion in the community, as distinct from dividing the employee from the employer, the worker from the director and so on, these significant facts should have been put on the record from day one.  Now we find that comments we make can be misunderstood, misrepresented and so on.  That is a matter for concern.  I will not say that was a deliberate action by the Minister, but it had to be a lack of political judgment that, unlike his predecessors, he did not put all the facts on the record from day one.</P>
    <P>In refusing to accept the amendment the Minister pointed out that the net cost, which, understandably, he would not want to quantify, but which he said would be of the order of about £40 million and that is probably an over-estimation would be so marginal that it would not upset his budget arithmetic.  The Minister says he cannot upset his budget arithmetic, but it was upset when devaluation took place.  The devaluation costs have to be added and they will change the budget arithmetic.</P>
    <P>The Minister is providing £2½ million for the hotel industry.  We do not object to that but it would have been more beneficial if that had not been imposed on them at the start.  The Minister must know that hotel bookings were cancelled and that business was lost because of the climate generated here.  I wish the Minister <Col N="2057" /> could have shown the same degree of concern for the hotel industry on day one as he did on day 101.  If he had, the coming season would be much healthier. This is a simple fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister says other measures are necessary but we do not know, and he will not tell us, what they will be.  That being so, I press him to accept our proposal and if the other measures are necessary&mdash;they will not be major ones&mdash;perhaps he will consider what adjustments will be needed.  I can show him where he can save £7 million.  We are interested in keeping within the proposed figure for public expenditure.  The Minister could save an extra £7 million on the National Development Corporation.  Perhaps not everyone on the Government benches would agree but if public money is to be spent, it should provide an incentive for doers rather than dreamers.  This will help to bridge the gap we are talking about very quickly and renew the climate of confidence Fianna Fáil are very concerned about.</P>
    <P>The Minister is interested in foreign debts and so are we, but his actions earlier this year did not show that this was his only concern.  I urge him to accept this amendment because if he does the &ldquo;other measures&rdquo; may not be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give an estimate of the numbers that will slip into the higher rates of tax during the year?  We will reach the stage in the not too distant future when over 50 per cent of the PAYE taxpayers will be paying the higher rate of tax.  I do not think anybody in this House should accept that position. It is disgraceful.  It is no wonder the PAYE sector have once again raised their voices in protest.  One has to agree substantially with the case they are making, especially as 50 per cent of them will be paying income tax at the higher rate.</P>

      <P>About six weeks ago I wrote to the present Minister about the matter and he indicated that he would look into the question with a view to being able to introduce some alleviation for the categories of persons concerned.  The main reason for my proposing this amendment is that parents, whether they be unmarried, widowed, or separated, but who are rearing children single-handed, are treated for the purposes of taxation as single persons.  It seems to me and to those who have been in touch with me on the matter that it is at least as expensive for the single-parent family to meet their expenses in the way of mortgages or rent, food, clothing, travel, education and so on as it is for the family with both parents at home.  For that reason I am asking the Minister to accept the amendment or at the very least to indicate some good reason for not being in a position to do so.  The previous Minister indicated that he would endeavour to find some way around the difficulty but there is no proposal in this Bill in that regard.</P>

      <P>Acceptance of this amendment would have the effect of applying double rate bands to persons in the situation described by the Deputy.  This would create an anomaly in the tax system and would be likely to give rise to feelings of discrimination on the part of other persons.  It could create an interaction in the sense that other people who previously had an advantageous position compared to these people would wish to see that advantage restored.  We could have a tendency, too, for leapfrogging in terms of the total allowances that would apply to different categories of persons. As the Deputy is aware, there are already <Col N="2063" /> certain extra allowances for particular categories of persons.  For example, the income tax allowance for a married person at the moment is £2,900 and for a widowed person there is an allowance of £1,950.  For a person who is bereaved in the year of assessment there is an allowance of £2,900.  We already have built into the allowances to a certain extent figures which go in some way towards meeting the problem the Deputy has pointed out.  Single parents also have extra allowances but do not have the double rate bands.  The effect of the amendment proposed by the Deputy would be to add the double rate bands to those allowances.  For the reasons of the new anomalies that this amendment would create I would not be disposed to accepting it.</P>

It would seem to me that it is no less difficult for widows or widowers to survive in the following years.

      <P>I would be sympathetic to the sentiments in the amendment. Recently I had to deal with a case of a widow with three sons, aged 16, 14 and 12.  We all understand what it costs to feed and clothe boys of that age.  That person was in receipt of a widow's pension of £67 and a salary of £100 from her employer per month and out of her total income of £92 per week that widow had to pay £8 tax.  Something should be done about that situation.  Should widows be in the same category for taxation purposes as a married couple or should the allowance per child for a widow or widower be increased from the present figure of £100?  If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment before the House I would be grateful if he would give consideration to the problem because it causes difficulty to some people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation already provides to a certain degree for an increase in tax free allowances for people in situations described by Deputy De Rossa.  It was rather gratuitous of Deputy Haughey to hop up and make the type of remark he has made about my reply. However, the fact remains that the operation of the amendment proposed by Deputy De Rossa would give rise to a certain number of anomalies.  It could give rise to situations in which married couples would justifiably feel discriminated against because they would find themselves now, contrary to the present situation, getting smaller allowances than people in other situations.  For that reason the substance of the amendment is of a discriminatory nature and of a kind that would give rise to these anomalies. It is not one that would commend itself to me.  Deputy Haughey rightly mentioned the question of the cost and that is another reason why I cannot accept the amendment.  I fully accept the fact that people in this position have to face particular difficulties but I do not think this amendment is the most appropriate way of dealing with them.  I do not have a closed mind on the problem.  This amendment is not the way for dealing with it.</P>

I am not necessarily arguing that my amendment is the ideal one.  I do not have the resources that are at the Minister's disposal to produce an ideal solution, but I find it extraordinary that the Minister does not appear to be making any attempt to offer an alternative to meet the problem.  There are many people paying tax who in justice should not be paying because of their situation. There are widows and widowers with children who are paying tax.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the amendment is not the ideal one.  He should indicate that he will attempt to bring in an amendment of his own to relieve the people I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice to what Deputy De Rossa has said. I accept it is easy for us on this side of the House to press the Minister to do all sorts of things, but there is a case here.  If the Minister's only reason for rejecting the amendment is that it would lead to discrimination against married couples he is on very weak ground.  Certainly, while rejecting Deputy De Rossa's amendment in its entirety, he could agree that on Report Stage he will come along with a compromise.  There is a fair difference between £1,950 and £2,900.  I am sure <Col N="2066" /> Deputy De Rossa for this year would be satisfied if the Minister split the difference or brought in an amendment along those lines.  We must accept that very often a widow or widower who is in a position of being head of a family is in a more difficult position than a husband or a wife.  Particular problems and disadvantages attached to the situation of a widow or widower do not apply in the case of a husband and wife.  It is often very much more difficult and more expensive for a widow or a widower to run a household than it is for a couple to do so, particularly when a family of any size is involved. Acknowledging that it is easy from this side of the House to press the Minister to be a general sort of Santa Claus, on the other hand, this is something he should consider between now and Report Stage and if he is not prepared to accept the full implications of Deputy De Rossa's amendment he could very well go some distance, perhaps half-way to it.</P>

      <P>Kipling once said that &ldquo;If you could fill the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run&rdquo; and, in fairness to Deputy Wilson, he has at last made some proposals in relation to this matter which has been discussed at length in this House over the last number of years.  I wish also to congratulate Deputy O'Rourke on her appointment and I hope she will remain on that side of the House for many years.  I am disappointed that her colleagues, apart from Deputy Wilson, have not made a decent, constructive statement during this debate.  They have left it to Deputy Wilson to say anything constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being from a rural constituency, I know the school transport system has been riddled with anomalies since its introduction in 1968.  I never availed of it myself, I had my trusty bicycle to carry me to my second level school, for which I paid each term, and I was glad to avail of that facility.  There are at least five categories of pupils travelling on the yellow buses at present: medical card holders, junior cycle pupils who pay £14, senior <Col N="2068" /> cycle pupils at £24, the catchment boundary pupils at £24 and pupils who are technically deemed to be ineligible for transport but, because they live within a specific distance of the school and because there is transport available and space on it, are entitled to travel on paying a certain fee.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have disappointed me because they have hidden behind the words of Deputy Brady, when he was Minister for Education for a short time, in refusing to put forward any constructive suggestions and have failed to recognise what this Government have done.  We have faced up to the reality of the situation and have dealt with it as humanely as possible.  We brought about a reduction in the charge levied by Fianna Fáil of £5.4 million to £4.4 million.  I have listened with some sadness to suggestions that have been made that Members of this House, in various parts of the country, advised pupils to take steps that are not in accordance with normal behaviour of secondary school pupils.  I do not think that is good for their training and it does not give them a sense of appreciation of what is involved in all this.  It ill behoves any Member to carry on in that manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Wilson when he says that this matter should be looked at over the summer period. However, I should like the media to take note that parents should apply for the continuation of school transport prior to 16 June whether or not they have medical cards or whether they are eligible for transport under the payments scheme at present.  If parents do not apply, many routes will be deemed ineligible for transport as operated at present and that should be borne in mind by all parents. It should also be borne in mind by the Department that if there is any element of hardship created in relation to payments perhaps the fees could be paid over two or three periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It costs £33 million to carry 160,000 <Col N="2069" /> odd pupils to school, an average of approximately £200 per pupil.  I know in many cases that if the parents were given £200 in respect of each school going child, they would transport them to school or provide bicycles and allow them to cycle if the distance is reasonable.  It is no great hardship on any young person to cycle three or four miles and I know many pupils who cycle much further than that after school.</P>
    <P>Sympathetic consideration should be given to physically handicapped children and I am sure the Department will do that.  I have heard allegations of misuse and abuse of school buses and lack of appreciation by the students for something which, up to now, they have got for nothing.  In fairness to CIE, they have been flooded with work over the last number of years, especially in relation to the school transport system.  During the summer period it would be fair for the Department to contact the Private Bus Owners' Association to see if it would be feasible to adopt a pilot scheme in some catchment boundary area and to see if it could be operated at a more reasonable and practical cost.</P>
    <P>The question of paying the grants on a capitation basis to the various principals of second level schools could also be looked at.  In many cases the community supplement the Department by holding various functions, outings and so on for the assistance of schools in general.  The high degree of community spirit is evident throughout the country and is proved by the fact that over £1 million was paid in a very short time in respect of school transport.  In spite of what the Opposition Members say, people realise that they must contribute something towards a scheme which has got out of hand financially.</P>
    <P>When this scheme was introduced, the price of diesel was very low.  Houses were built without chimneys because the Government assumed that oil would remain cheap.  From all the diesel evaporated from the other side of the House, Deputy O'Rourke has emerged with her answer to the school transport scheme.  I want her to state loudly and clearly what Fianna Fáil think should be done because <Col N="2070" /> their Minister for Education said he intended to introduce a charge for school transport. It is imperative that we keep the school transport system in operation. Of course there are anomalies but it should be looked at in terms of community development, community assistance, a practicality of private owners taking on pilot schemes and the tightening up of the various administrative matters within CIE.  It is imperative that the routes be maintained and that the parents of pupils eligible for transport should apply before 16 June of this year.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy Kenny's contribution to the Fianna Fáil motion.  He is the first Fine Gael Deputy to say in public many of the things we have said.  It is quite obvious that he comes from a rural constituency.  He has the strength and conviction to state openly and publicly what many Fine Gael and Labour Deputies are saying at parents' meetings.  They are saying: &ldquo;How can I defend the indefensible?&rdquo;  I heard that remark myself made by Deputies. Yet they will troop like sheep or lambs through the division lobbies and vote approval for the present school transport cuts.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister said that the only confusion which existed was in the minds of the Opposition.  Within one hour I stood on a platform with the Minister in Wicklow.  We had a capacity gathering of concerned parents from schools in County Wicklow.  The Minister and I and other speakers put our points of view.  Person after person asked what would they do about school transport. One group said they paid their money and did not get their tickets.  Another group said they were discriminated against by the catchment boundary facility fees.  Another group had another story.  Practically the whole time given to questions and answers was taken up on the subject of the transport confusion which exists in County Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following day I received several phone calls here in the House from groups of parents who said they had paid for school transport and were told they would have to travel 30 miles to pick up <Col N="2071" /> their tickets.  I gave their names to an official of the Department.  Many of these people have not got transport to take them that number of miles.  The evening before the Minister and the Minister of State said there was no confusion and no chaos, that everything was operable and the buses were full of happy and smiling children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>At first I thought it was not deliberate policy, but I now believe that what we are witnessing is a deliberate anti-rural bias in the educational policies of the Government. Deputy Kenny quoted Kipling.  The words were appropriate in the circumstances. I want to quote the words of a poet from my constituency.  Oliver Goldsmith from Pallas in the Longford-Westmeath constituency said:</P>
      <P>Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey,</P>
      <P>Where wealth accumulates, and men decay.</P>
      <P>If the Minister continues to adopt the Pale mentality which she has adopted so far in her educational policy, we will be left with a depopulated countryside, and there will be a rundown in the educational facilities available to rural children.</P>
      <P>I want to go back to the catchment boundary facility.  In an article by Christina Murphy, the esteemed education correspondent of <i>The Irish Times,</i> Deputy Doyle, the Fine Gael TD for Wexford, said that everybody should pay up or else.  She also supported the introduction of some concession for catchment boundary pupils.  She said:</P>
      <P>I accept that they have opted to travel outside their catchment area to another school and as such are not in the same position as pupils attending schools within their catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cracks are beginning to appear. Deputy Doyle has become aware of the <Col N="2072" /> realities of which Fianna Fáil Deputies were already aware.  Rural Deputies are beginning to assert what they know is the actual position on the ground.</P>
    <P>The Minister said blandly: Let them change schools if they cannot afford to pay their catchment boundary fees.  The tripe and rubbish in the speech prepared for the Minister last week were unbelievable. I am surprised that she uttered it. In many instances pupils are attending a school because the school which would have been deemed to have been within their catchment boundary did not have a post-inter cert cycle, or did not teach the subjects which the pupil wished to learn.</P>
    <P>I want to put a case to the Minister clearly.  There is an area in my constituency in which children are attending a secondary school five miles from where they live.  A bus passes their door and picks them up.  They are the children of a medical card holder.  They were told they should be attending a school eight miles away.  They would have to cycle three miles to pick up the bus.  That cannot be a correct system.  Every rural Deputy knows that it cannot be right that a child should have to cycle three miles to catch a bus to a school eight miles away when a bus is passing the door to a secondary school five miles away.</P>

      <P>The scales dropped from Deputy Kenny's eyes on the road to Damascus or the road from Mayo.  He saw the children on the side of the road and he decided to speak in favour of our motion.  It would be marvellous if he would vote for it.  As I said before the by-election, there is confusion from Malin Head to Mizen Head.  When I was canvassing in Donegal I was located in the Finn Valley and Ballybofey.  Numerous deputations brought to my attention the enormous confusion which exists in <Col N="2073" /> the Finn Valley, in Glenties, in Pettigo, in West Donegal and in various areas.</P>
      <P>This confusion is caused by the policies the Government are implementing.  Last week the Minister said there was no confusion but that proves without doubt that there is confusion.  We read in the papers and hear on the radio every day about school transport problems.  The Minister is being fed information.  I do not know who is feeding it to her.</P>

      <P>I have very constructive proposals to put to the grinning Deputies on the other side of the House. I have had them since day one of my appointment to this spokesmanship.  I knew this would be a live hot issue.  The first such suggestion is that the Minister should scrap the scheme until the end of the current second level school year which will end for most pupils in the first week in June and for those taking the intermediate, group and leaving certificates some time between the middle and end of June.  Examination pupils particularly are facing untoward stress and anxiety. <Col N="2074" /> I say this in all seriousness to the Minister.  I have seen and spoken to them myself and I have spoken to their parents. There are many genuine cases of hardship, people who cannot pay the second level school transport fees, with pupils facing into an examination situation.  For that reason alone and to alleviate that misery, I say to the Minister: please, leave it for the end of this school year.</P>
      <P>My second proposal is that when the summer holidays begin the Minister should sit down immediately with interested bodies, with her officials, as Deputy Kenny has suggested, and I am very glad to echo his advice and take his words which were: &ldquo;Look at the scheme during the summer&rdquo;.  That is exactly what I said. I am on record as saying on last Tuesday night in this House: Yes, look at the scheme during the summer holidays.</P>

I said: let the Minister sit down when the school year is over &mdash; that is my second constructive point &mdash; and let her work out a scheme which will be effective, which will be equitable and will apply a waiver scheme. In all essential services in this country there is what is known as a waiver scheme in operation.  All of us who are members of county councils know that quite well. There is no waiver clause in this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>My third suggestion is that there be an area selected for a pilot scheme of some other means of school transport than the one being used at present. If this were done, if all the interested bodies in that area &mdash; and by that I mean the transport liaison officers, the parents groupings, the school management boards, departmental officials, the Minister and Minister of State with their input &mdash; put their minds to that, I am sure there could be a scheme devised and thought out which, if when tried out in one area was found to be successful, could be extended to a larger area and could prove to be most beneficial.</P>
      <P>Those are my three constructive suggestions. I have not access to the numerous advisory bodies or statistics that the Minister has.  Yet I put down questions today &mdash; Nos. 797 to 802 and Nos. 804 and 805 &mdash; and the last sentence of the Minister's reply read:</P>
      <P>Accordingly, my Department has not available to it the statistical information requested in the questions from the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In eight counties I requested the number of pupils debarred from availing of the second-level school transport scheme, whose parents had medical cards, because of the catchment boundary clause.  Lo and behold, I could not be told.  This is a very grave breach of Dáil procedure in that precise questions which I, as an Opposition Deputy and spokesperson, put down could not be answered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the decision of the Government to reduce the 1983 Public Capital Programme by £220 million and deplores its failure to fulfil the promise by the Minister for the Environment to provide £100 million extra for the construction sector and now calls on the Government to recognise the serious jobs crisis that has arisen and to introduce urgent measures to stimulate the private and public sector to avoid the collapse of the construction industry.</P>
      <P>Our reason for putting down this motion is to draw the attention of the Government to the serious state of the construction industry in the hope that we will get a positive response that will benefit the industry and those who depend on it for employment.  The construction industry is in a situation of serious crisis and my concern is the harmful effect this crisis will have on the economic and social wellbeing of our people.  Construction is our second largest industry.  It employed 105,000 people in 1981 but now well over 40,000 construction workers are unemployed. A continuation of the serious decline in the industry will have tragic consequences for thousands of other families unless serious steps are taken to arrest the decline.</P>
      <P>It is necessary at the outset to establish the extent of the problem and then to get an admission from the Government that they recognise the seriousness of the situation and the need for corrective measures. The Minister knows that confidence within the industry itself plays an important role and that lack of confidence results in an acceleration of decline.  The Construction Industry Federation for some time past have been carrying out their own survey of the industry and the most recent survey in March 1983 illustrates the depressed state of the industry and the overall lack of confidence in its future under present policies.</P>
      <P>More than 2,000 builders were consulted in this survey and 55 per cent of them expected a further reduction in construction activity in the period April-June 1983.  Some 49 per cent held this view in the residential building section, 61 per cent held this view in the non-residential activity section and 64 per cent held this view in the civil engineering section, whereas normally 73 per cent of them would have expected an increase in building activity in the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from the results of the survey that those actively involved in the industry now have a very pessimistic outlook on the future.  The survey confirms that more than half the building contractors expect to have less work on hands in the summer period than they had during the <Col N="2081" /> winter period.  Traditionally the summer months are a period of higher output in construction so we must conclude that the summer period will see a further decline and a worsening of the already bad winter situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote the opinion of the Construction Industry Federation on the survey as given in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 20 May.  Under the headline &ldquo;Outlook for building industry remains bleak&rdquo; it goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The construction industry remains in the doldrums and the outlook continues to look bleak, according to the Construction Industry Federation.  The March survey carried out by the CIF on behalf of the surveys division of the EEC &ldquo;reflects the attitudes of construction companies in the aftermath of the Budget, which saw a 15 per cent cut in the volume of Government investment in the industry, an increase in the cost of building work through the imposition of increased and additional taxes and levies, and no incentives to promote private sector investment in the industry,&rdquo; the CIF says.</P>
    <P>The March survey was carried out in the first three weeks in April and when combined with the December and October surveys during 1982 &ldquo;shows that a continuation of the dramatic fall-off in construction activity and employment is expected by the vast majority of construction companies during the second quarter of this year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My only wish in debating this motion is to seek a positive response from the Government to save this industry and those dependent on it from the dire consequences of the disaster with which they are now confronted.  Scoring political points has little merit when one realises the magnitude of the human misery and deprivation that will result if action is not taken.  My party are gravely concerned with the extent of the problems affecting the construction industry and we are alarmed that the Government may not yet have fully realised the extent of the crisis and the need for immediate Government action to avoid the danger of wholesale collapse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2082" /> All the economic indicators reflect the rapid decline in construction activity and the major fear is the danger of a more accelerated rate of decline.  Action now can avoid the danger of further large sections of the industry collapsing.  If action is delayed it will be too late to save important sections of industry from going to the wall.</P>
    <P>The construction industry is funded by public and private capital investment. Public capital investment levels are decided by Government and private capital investment is influenced by Government who can create a financial climate that will attract or discourage private investment.  Last November, Fianna Fáil took the unprecedented move of publishing the Public Capital Programme five weeks before the start of the next financial year and in the middle of an election campaign.  Those Estimates showed the clear commitment of my party to the construction industry in the capital allocations made for each Government Department.  The Public Capital Programme published by Fianna Fáil provided for a total expenditure of £2,110 million.  The Coalition's post-election budget provision was £1,890 million, a reduction of £220 million.  Their decision to reduce the Public Capital Programme by this amount was a deliberate political decision taken by the Government to reduce the overall borrowing requirement for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>Whether the Government were right or wrong in making this decision is what this debate is partly about because the resultant fall-off in construction activity is a contributing factor to the crisis now affecting the industry.  We argue the Government were wrong in making that decision because it represented too severe a restriction at a time when the industry was experiencing an overall shortfall in capital investment due to the serious recession affecting the economy generally.  I believe the Government would have been better advised to maintain the level of public capital investment proposed by Fianna Fáil in view of the decline in private investment which was known to have taken place.  I have not advocated, as stated by the Minister last <Col N="2083" /> week, that the State should deploy resources on a scale which would completely offset the decline in private investment. Such a course would be foolish in the extreme.  However I consider it foolish of the Government to have cut back so deeply on planned public capital investment at this time.  It was the wrong kind of move.  It has shaken the industry's confidence and has led to the belief that the Government were reappraising the importance of the construction section in the economy.</P>
    <P>It is thought that some Ministers believe that it is wrong for the State to support construction in time of recession and that jobs in this industry do not have the same value as in manufacturing. Regarding the cut of £220 million in the Public Capital Programme I believe this was a monumental blunder by the Government which will have to be rectified before the year is out.  My motion refers to a promise made by the Minister for the Environment that £100 million extra would be made available to the construction industry.  The Minister recently denied in the Dáil having made such a promise.  He made the denial at column 1137, Volume 342, of the Official Report of 12 May 1983.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from two newspaper cuttings to show that the building unions claim that they were told by the Minister that a further £100 million would be invested.  The first quotation is from a journal, which I mentioned during my Estimate speech, which is considered the favoured reading of some members of the Coalition Government. It is certainly very favoured reading of the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn.  This is <i>Liberty,</i> the journal of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, the April 1983 edition. It has a front page heading &ldquo;Construction &mdash; an industry in crisis&rdquo;.  I want to quote from an article on page 3 of that journal which is headed: &ldquo;Coalition ignores jobs crisis&rdquo;.  The article states:</P>
    <P>Group Secretary, Des Geraghty, has accused the Coalition Government of failing to recognise the serious jobs crisis in the construction industry.  In <Col N="2084" /> fact he said, the Government are actually making things worse.  He described the 300 proposed redundancies at Irish Cement as a graphic illustration of the severity of the problem ...The construction sector was originally promised an extra £100 million by the Government which was not forthcoming.  While we were all further disappointed by the drastic cutback of £220 million in the Public Capital Programme of the present Government we were assured that the Government intended other initiatives which would induce greater private investment in the construction sector.</P>
    <P>Mr. Geraghty is an important official in the Irish Transport and General Workers Union and he would not have made a statement that a promise of this kind was made by the Minister unless he had some reason to do so.  The official journal of the Transport Union has seen fit to publish his statement.</P>
    <P>I was not present at these meetings.  I understand that the Minister met the building industry in Dublin on 17 January 1983.  On that occasion he told them that he was committed to the maintenance of employment in the construction industry. We have since seen the Minister and the Minister of State preside over what is probably the greatest drop in employment the industry has ever experienced since that meeting.  He told the meeting, according to Mr. Geraghty and according to a large number of other people who were present at the meeting, that £100 million extra would be invested in the construction industry.  Of course, following that meeting, as spokesman for the building industry at Cabinet table he has been responsible for the cut of £220 million in the Public Capital Programme which I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>Another group of building unions, the Cork Building Group of Trade Unions, as indicated in the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> of Saturday, 23 April 1983, stated:</P>
    <P>The Cork Building Group of Trade Unions in a statement condemns very strongly the lack of initiative and investment in the construction industry nationally.  It would appear that the <Col N="2085" /> industry will be decimated by a further 16 per cent in the coming year and when one considers that 35 per cent of all building workers in the Cork area are unemployed there is very little hope for the future.</P>
    <P>The statement goes on to say:</P>
    <P>At a meeting, just prior to the budget, with the Tánaiste, Mr. Dick Spring TD and Mr. Ruairí Quinn TD, attended by all shades and representatives of the construction industry, an investment of £100 million was expected; instead a clawback of £220 million was introduced resulting in a total loss of £320 million to the industry.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Minister can deny having made this commitment to the building industry at that meeting or on a subsequent occasion when he was interviewed by the media.  In case there is any doubt as to what the Minister said the House should know that in the <i>Programme for Government</i> there is another reference to this commitment of £100 million.  On page 6 it is stated:</P>
    <P>There are a number of cases involving we believe up to a further £100 million of projects in which infrastructural work can be usefully undertaken on a joint public-private basis.</P>
    <P>We have not yet seen sight of that £100 million, whether it is the commitment entered into at the meeting which took place in Dublin on 17 January or at the meeting which took place prior to the coming together of Labour and Fine Gael to form the Coalition Government.  In the <i>Programme for Government</i>, on page 6 as I mentioned, the commitment is there.  The Minister confirmed that later at his meeting with the representatives of all sides of the unions.  Anybody reading that part of the booklet could not but conclude that there was an intention to provide £100 million extra.  I am told that this was a major factor in determining support for coalition at the Labour Party conference in Limerick.  Many of the delegates who attended there, representing building unions, were of the opinion that <Col N="2086" /> that promise was conveyed to them by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the House last week that he accepted that the building industry was going through a difficult period which in his view resulted from the growth in output in the 1977-79 period which he says he considered to be excessive. He then stated that the proper course is to maintain constructive liaison and dialogue with the industry and to seek through mutual co-operation to keep the industry on an even keel and prevent, as far as we can, the swing in output that has so bedevilled it.  Those are fine sentiments in normal times but they do not give any indication that the Minister is conscious that this industry is facing its worst crisis since 1950.  Dialogue with the industry is meaningless in circumstances where the responsible Minister fails to implement promises accepted in good faith, such as the promise of £100 million extra for construction.</P>
    <P>I would like to say to the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, who is in the House representing the Minister, that I do not believe that the industry is on an even keel.  I suggest that it has in fact developed a very dangerous list, that it is sailing in very turbulent waters and that many of its prominent members have already fallen overboard, lost without trace.  The remainder of the crew are looking anxiously towards the captain to see them safely through, but in this case some people are beginning to wonder if the captain is even at the helm.</P>
    <P>Nobody on this side of the House ever suggested that it was possible to insulate the building industry from what is happening in the rest of the economy, and it was facile of the Minister last week to imply that anybody on this side would subscribe to such simplistic views.  I accept, as stated by the Minister last week, that the industry has to rely for a large part of its output on the level of demand for its services from the private sector.  I had pointed out that the Government had deliberately cut back on public capital investment, but it is true that the level of private capital investment is being seriously curtailed due to a series of measures <Col N="2087" /> introduced by the Government.  I will list only some of them.</P>
    <P>I will start with the changes in VAT. The Government increased VAT in the building industry from 3 per cent to 5 per cent, an increase of 2 per cent, adding approximately £700 to the price of a house.  I have seen other estimates of the increase in the price of an average three-bedroom house following the VAT increase which is higher than that &mdash; I am not giving an exaggerated figure.  The House will find it extraordinary that a Government who continue to make grants available to encourage people to provide their own homes, a grant of £1,000, should introduce through legislation increases nearly equivalent to the value of the grant which they are giving to young couples and others buying houses.  It is very difficult to understand why the Government persisted in increasing VAT on new houses purchased by people buying their first homes.  It is a complete contradiction in terms &mdash; the Government continuing to pay a grant and at the same time clawing back its value through increases in VAT.</P>
    <P>No Minister in this Government has sought to explain the Government's policy in this respect.  No Minister has stated why they think it necessary to impose such an additional charge on young couples and others seeking to provide homes for themselves.  Surely it must be Government policy to encourage people to provide their own homes and, when circumstances, financial and otherwise, do not allow it, the State would come in and assist with local authority housing. Here we have one negating the other and it is not logical.  Can the Minister explain the thinking behind the decision in regard to new houses?</P>
    <P>This will also have a deflationary effect on demand by increasing the costs.  The Government also introduced new planning charges which are costing the industry £6 million extra per annum.  Here we have an industry starved of funds and a Government who introduce new measures that will take out some of the sums that are available for housing and put them into the Exchequer for other purposes. <Col N="2088" /> The level of the charges introduced by the Government are penal in many cases and it is difficult to justify the level of charges that have been introduced. The hardship that will cause and its disincentive effect on investment have not been fully calculated, but the estimate of £6 million has not been denied by the Minister or the Minister of State. Here again we see a complete reversal of the type of policy the Government should be encouraging, to encourage further investment rather than to be taking money away from the industry.</P>
    <P>Another move introduced by the Government which surprised the House and the country was the decision to reduce capital allocations to the Housing Finance Agency by £10 million, the value of approximately 500 houses, another extraordinary decision, especially at a time when the cash flow to the building societies and other sources of finance have been diminishing.  The Local Loans Fund has been playing a reduced role in the financing of house construction recently.  Other agencies, such as insurance and assurance companies, have been giving a diminished contribution to housing capital.</P>
    <P>The decision to establish the Housing Finance Agency was supported by this party in Government through the allocations they made in the Estimates published last November.  However, for some unexplained reason the Government decided to reduce that amount.  In his budget statement, the Minister for Finance announced PRSI increases which it is estimated will increase wage costs in the building industry by 3 per cent, again adding to building costs and making it more difficult for people to purchase homes, and in turn making it less attractive for people to invest.</P>
    <P>The Government also introduce restrictions on mortgage relief which will have the effect of reducing the cash flow to building societies.  We have seen that the building societies are proposing an increase of ½ per cent to compensate for this change.  The Government abolished the employment incentive scheme in the construction industry and the residencerelated tax incentive scheme.  They <Col N="2089" /> restricted the application of section 23, the tax incentive, which had been introduced by Fianna Fáil in the 1981 Finance Act.  This Government reduced the value of that concession.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Bill there is a failure to alter the clawback provisions in relation to stock relief at a time when the construction industry is in decline.  This has bankrupted many companies.  I have been informed reliably by many people who have been in the industry all their lives that the single most pressing problem affecting the industry at present is the potential effect of this clawback on stock relief.  I am told that many firms are facing a period of contracting stocks, and in many cases the clawbacks will mean that tax will be payable out of all proportion to current profits.</P>
    <P>This stock relief was introduced in the 1975 Finance Bill to give deferred tax relief on artificial increase in stock and work in progress, due to the very high inflation at that time.  The 1976 Finance Act was retrospectively extended to include construction operatives.  The 1977 Finance Act allowed stock relief claimed in the first two years as a permanent relief, that is, no clawback, and altered the method of computation for future years by restricting the amount of relief at 25 per cent after all allowances, balancing charges, losses forward, etc., had been claimed.  The subsequent Finance Acts, up to and including the 1983 budget, maintained the above position, and all reliefs claimed were treated as deferred tax.  Originally it was envisaged that the clawback of this deferred tax would take place when inflation had been brought under control in a reasonably buoyant economy.  However, the industry, now in serious recession, with consequent downturn in output, faces a clawback of stock relief at a time of rapidly diminishing profitability.  Indeed, there can be the ridiculous situation that a company that had not made a profit and therefore had not tax liability, because of the clawback could find itself liable for very substantial sums of money.</P>
    <P>At a time when it can least afford to meet charges of this type, the resulting negative effect on cash flow will have <Col N="2090" /> serious consequences for many companies' ability to continue to trade.  The 1983 budget proposals have decided to maintain the stock relief allowance for a further year.  However, this is not an advantage to construction because due to the downturn in output companies will not be in a position to avail of the relief. The budget and the Finance Bill, and all the amendments the Minister has introduced, do not deal with the serious problem of the clawback.  We have put down some amendments to the Finance Bill at present before the House in regard to the clawback, and we hope the Government will support our amendments, or else come forward with their own proposals. There is serious concern in the industry at the effects of this clawback provision. Unless some steps are taken by the Government to relieve the situation a number of companies will be forced out of existence.  I ask the Minister in his contribution to refer to the effects this clawback proposal is having on the industry and to state whether the Government are conscious of the extent of the problem, and if they propose to take any steps to alleviate it. I mentioned that two weeks ago on the Estimates debate but unfortunately in his reply the Minister did not refer to many of the important points made on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The other measures the Government have taken which are having a bad effect on the industry is the decision to increase the CRV charges by as much as 50 per cent.  It is not the effect of any one of these measures &mdash; except maybe the clawback provision which in itself will have a disastrous effect on the industry &mdash; but it is the combined effect of all the measures which will result in increased costs, reduced consumer demand, reduced profitability and disincentive for further private investment.  It is difficult to understand why the Government should introduce all these additional impositions on an industry which is already in serious decline.  Government cutbacks in capital expenditure, combined with this package of disincentives, is starving the industry of funds resulting in massive unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister castigates the private sector <Col N="2091" /> for the withdrawal of private investment in the building industry and says it is unrealistic to expect the State to match in full the reductions in private investment by a corresponding increase in public capital support.  I agree with him wholeheartedly, but I do not think anybody made such a silly suggestion.  However, what seems unrealistic to me is the action of the Government in introducing disincentives to private investment at a time when private investment had already dropped by 50 per cent in the period 1979 to 1982.  It is incomprehensible that any Government could conceive to do so much damage to such an important sector of the economy, upon which they should be depending for the creation of jobs, to relieve the terrible unemployment problem affecting the nation.  Unless there is a reversal of Government taxation proposals for this industry immediately, it is likely that half its work force will be unemployed by next December.</P>
    <P>In short, what I am suggesting is that cuts in the Public Capital Programme be restored and financed as planned by Fianna Fáil when in Government last November; that the Minister fulfil his promise to invest a further £100 million in construction; that the Government drop the planned increase in taxation in the building sector, as I have already outlined; that the Government restore the £10 million cut for the Housing Finance Agency allocation and that the Government introduce new incentives to encourage investment in construction projects, particularly in the residential building sector where the demand far exceeds the supply.  There are many options open to the Government in this area.  They have the obvious success of section 23 of the 1981 Finance Act to guide them, if they would only take a positive approach.  Other suggestions have been made, such as joint venture housing, equity sharing scheme and endownment mortgages.  Another positive suggestion is that deposit interest on special savings, such as building society savings accounts be relieved of Government tax as the money is eventually invested in <Col N="2092" /> construction work and helps to boost the economy.</P>
    <P>At present individuals wishing to save for a house must first pay income tax on their salaries and they must pay tax again on deposit interest earned on any part of that salary invested as savings.  The tax code discourages personal savings and affects the level of private investment in construction and other sectors.  For instance, the announcement today by the Minister for Finance that tax inspectors will in future be allowed full access to the building societies savings accounts of their clients on foot of a High Court order will result in large amounts being withdrawn from building societies and invested abroad.  The Minister's proposals that the High Court order must issue if the tax inspector states he is not satisfied with information given, is an extraordinary one and will destroy for all time the customer/client confidentiality relationship which has been the cornerstone of banking and building society business in this country.</P>
    <P>The worst affected areas in the building industry in this recession are possibly Cork, the Midlands and Galway, because they are in recession for longer than any other part of the country.  I have a knowledge of and interest in the Galway region.  The construction sector in the Galway area has been in a crisis situation for two years.  Public capital investment in the area is practically nil.  Private investment work has dropped off dramatically. Unemployment in Galway city and county reflects the steep decline in the construction industry in the area. There are a total of 3,800 persons employed in the construction industry in County Galway.  In June 1982 there were 1,015 unemployed; in September 1982, 1,130; December 1982, 1,316; March 1983, 1,448 and the projected employment for June 1983 is 1,648, 43 per cent of the total work force.  The projected unemployment figure for 9 August 1983, after the summer holidays is 2,100,55 per cent of those employed in the building industry in the Galway region.  One builder who had been constructing about 240 houses per annum is now building 45. A builder who employed 35 blocklayers <Col N="2093" /> is now employing one.  About 20 small builders have gone out of business and the large builders have reduced the numbers employed and some of them have closed down until things improve.  Some builders' suppliers have gone out of business and others are letting their staff go.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to tell the House why his Government persist with the wrong policies, why they impose disincentives instead of creating a climate for investment by dropping repressive Government tax measures.  Has the Tánaiste, the Leader of the Irish Labour Party, no concern for the plight of the unemployed blocklayer, plasterer, carpenter, electrician and builders operatives who are walking the streets suffering the frustrations and indignity of hopeless unemployment?  Nobody could blame him for the despair of the building workers' families if our present plight was solely caused by the international recession over which we have little control, but that is not the position.  The international recession is partly the cause of our problem but the situation has been compounded by direct Government action to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Surely it cannot be rigid adherence to strict Socialist principles that is responsible for the Government's reluctance to come to the aid of this industry?  One would hope not.  We in Fianna Fáil have no such reservations about the benefits of the private enterprise system.  We believe it should be encouraged at every opportunity.  The Labour Party decried the profit motive, yet now look to private investment, in the middle of a recession, to come to the aid of failing Government policies for the construction industry. It is the old problem of Socialist Labour in Coalition Government with conservative Fine Gael, contradictory policies, vying for influence in a compromised Government. This lack of clear sighted policy for the industry is sapping confidence and will lead to further failures.  We do not claim that the steps we suggest would restore the industry to full employment overnight but we do claim it would reverse the terrible decline which has now gripped the industry.  It would restore a measure of confidence and give <Col N="2094" /> the people who are so badly affected by this crisis some hope for the future.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate provokes a positive response and will draw from the Minister and his Minister of State recognition of the very serious decline which has gripped this industry.  I hope that they will realise that the measures introduced by their Government since January are having a detrimental effect on that industry. There is lack of confidence, bewilderment about the future and fear of investing money in construction because of the continuous flow of tax measures which the Government are imposing on them, making it unattractive to invest.  It is foolish and wrong to ask the private sector to save the industry when the Government are doing absolutely nothing to create the incentive which would bring a response from the private sector by way of increased capital injection into the industry.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;recognises the difficulties experienced by the building industry, appreciates that these difficulties are the result of the general economic recession, coupled with the failure of Fianna Fáil Governments to deal with the realities of the economic and financial situation, and supports the initiatives which the Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment has taken and proposes to take to promote the sound development of the industry and to ensure that employment in it can be maintained at the highest sustainable level.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am most happy to speak on this motion, as amended.  It gives me an opportunity to set the record straight with regard to the performance of the Opposition party when in Government and the appalling legacy inherited by this Government &mdash; and in particular by me &mdash; in relation to the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, the current recession would <Col N="2095" /> have been bound to create serious difficulties and problems for the building industry in any event.  Of that there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever.  For example, the reduced investment in commercial and industrial building arising from the existence of spare capacity and reduced demand for private houses because of the recession could only mean significantly less building work.  The beginnings of this situation became evident in 1980 &mdash; although it was checked in 1981 when there was a period of modest growth &mdash; and it showed itself again in a very big way in 1982 under the Fianna Fáil Party's last and mercifully brief period in Government.</P>
    <P>By the time this Government took office and I took over responsibility for the industry five months ago, the situation had deteriorated to the extent that employment had already dropped by 18,000 and output was down over 18 per cent from the peak years.  I want to emphasise this point at the outset because one would gather from statements made on the opposite side of the House that the decline in employment began only when the present Government came into office.  The facts are that the industry was already in a steep decline when we took over and had been in that situation throughout the whole of 1982.  The immediate cause of the difficulties in the industry was, as I have said before, the drastic fall off in private investment, down by 50 per cent in the period between 1979 and 1982.  There were, however, other very serious contributory problems which were compounding the situation and which were a direct legacy from the Fianna Fáil administration which took office in 1977 and then proceeded to unleash a disastrous inflationary boom.</P>
    <P>Among the consequences of this bonanza were, firstly, a steep rise in prices and costs in the building industry, as well as in other sectors and, secondly, a substantial increase in building material imports which were given a golden opportunity to develop new markets here and were and still are displacing employment in our materials manufacturing sector. <Col N="2096" /> Both of these factors were a direct result of the cynical and unwarranted promises made by Fianna Fáil as part of their high-flying and costly 1977 election manifesto.</P>
    <P>The irony is that the building industry in 1977 was actually doing nicely.  It was on a positive rising graph in terms of output and employment and there was a good balance between public and private investment.  Output rose in 1976 by 1.7 per cent and by a striking 8.7 per cent in 1977. Average employment, which fell in 1976 by 5,000, rose by 3,000 in 1977.  The balance between public and private investment rose from about 32 per cent of total investment in 1975 to about 37 per cent in 1977.  In other words, the graph was clearly rising and the industry was beginning to take off when it effectively met its Waterloo in the form of Greeks bearing gifts.  For no better reason than to buy popular support and regardless of the consequences, the Fianna Fáil Party promised greatly increased public investment and subsequently in Government more than doubled public capital investment in the years from 1977 to 1979.</P>
    <P>You do not have to be an economist to forecast the results of this irresponsible action.  Imports of building materials shot up since domestic manufacturers could not expand quickly enough to meet the artificially generated demand and building costs generally rocketed.  In the two year period between June 1977 and June 1979, the average price of new houses for which loans were approved by the main lending agencies increased by no less than 66 per cent.  All of this had the most damaging effects on the economy generally and on the building industry in particular. Apart from the escalation of costs and the resultant pressures on the available resources of materials and labour, the high cost of servicing the debt incurred through excessive borrowings in those years has since limited the degree to which the industry can now be financially assisted through public investment.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that I am dealing in facts, not in innuendoes or half truths, like the Opposition.  As Minister with responsibility for the industry, I have <Col N="2097" /> been saddled with this appalling legacy resulting from a combination of political opportunism and incompetence.  Even now, despite the damage that has been done, there is still a complete lack of any constructive approach and a poverty of ideas on the part of the Opposition in relation to this matter.  The only solution they can offer, apparently, is to pump in more capital, more public money, regardless of the consequences for other sectors of the economy, regardless of where the money is to come from and regardless of whether or not the resulting expenditure would give a reasonable return in either economic or social terms. As a responsible Minister in a responsible Government, I just do not see such easy options as providing an adequate solution to our problems.  Rather do I see them as simply compounding the problems we have inherited, postponing their ultimate solution and making them all the more difficult to solve.  The Opposition may take it that I will not be a party to such an approach.  Instead, my approach is designed to bring an era of lasting and stable development to the industry and help it to avoid the volatile swings between peaks and valleys which have been so damaging to it in the past.</P>
    <P>The Housing Finance Agency is a good example of the imaginative and positive approach that I want to see.  I have been most encouraged by the repeated reports which I have been getting, volunteered in most cases, from members of the Construction Industry Federation and house builders generally who have described the agency as a success story.  The agency represents a successful blending of resources from both the public and the private sectors.  Given that the public sector is already funding about 70 per cent of the industry's output, it seems almost unavoidable that the attainment of further growth in the industry will have to come about through the broadening of the scope for private investment, including investment in construction projects which are normally the responsibility of the public sector.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, I am aware that the industry itself attaches considerable importance to the taking of measures that <Col N="2098" /> will lessen or remove the constraints which often tend to delay or restrict the pace and timing of building development. These include, in particular, measures to restructure the Planning Appeal Board, steamline its procedures and guide local authorities in adopting a more flexible and positive approach to planning control. I am glad to say that I have set in motion a number of measures of this kind and am hopeful that the fruits of my efforts will become evident within a short period.  A further example of the kind of planned constructive approach which the industry needs at this time is the arrangement made by AnCO under which they effectively offer a guarantee against redundancies to apprentices in the industry and in this way ensure the training of an appropriate level of skilled operatives to avoid the shortages of a few years ago.</P>
    <P>Despite the picture that Deputy Molloy has stridently attempted to project, and notwithstanding the severe financial difficulties which they have had to face, I am glad to say that the Government have maintained a wide range of incentives for house-building and house improvements.  Lest there be any mistaken impressions around, let me make it clear that, in common with the building industry as a whole, house construction in the private sector was also in decline throughout 1982.  This again is a situation which has its roots well and truly in the period of office of the last Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Today in Question No. 1 on the Order Paper I asked the Minister for Health if he intends to remove further drugs from reimbursement under the General Medical Services Scheme and, if so, why.  The Minister replied as follows:</P>
      <P>The position will be kept under review but there are no plans at present to remove further items.</P>
      <P>That question had been down for some time.  Consequently, by way of supplementary, I asked the Minister of State if such items as dilopech which is a cough mixture or a stomach mixture such as aludrox had been removed from the prescribing list from 1 May.  The Minister replied that his information would not indicate that.  I have before me a letter from the General Medical Services (Payments) Board to pharmacists throughout the country.  This letter is dated 28 April 1983 and the first paragraphs reads:</P>
      <P>The following information should be noted in connection with GMS claims dispensed from 1st May 1983.</P>
      <P>The letter goes on to list eight different items, a number of which are either adding on drugs or replacing drugs but paragraph 7 outlines that such drugs as dilopect, dimotanes, pertussin, tussionex, vallergan, and vallex are not allowed, while paragraph 8 indicates that aludrox SA, gaviscon and pyrogastrone are not allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These items had been on the GMS prescribing list up to that point in time. When the Minister's predecessor had some items removed from the GMS list in October last the three white stomach mixtures to which I have referred, for example, were left on the list.  I do not have to tell the House the importance of having some sort of stomach mixtures available for those people who are in <Col N="2100" /> possession of GMS cards, people who are unable from their own means to provide for their medical care and attention.  The system was working quite well but now we have a situation in which there is no stomach mixture available so far as the holders of GMS cards are concerned. This puts these people in the position of having to buy their own medicines although that is an expense they cannot afford.  In addition this puts the doctors in a difficult position because they, knowing very often that the patients are not in a position to buy the medicine, are tempted to prescribe a more expensive drug for the stomach ailment, drugs such as tagomet that can cost from £15 to £20 per hundred.  This means also in effect that the patients are not getting the service as laid down under the GMS scheme.  The same applies to cough bottles. The previous Minister did leave on the list such cough bottles as dilopech which were readily available to patients under the GMS scheme.  This type of cough bottle was the simpler type but I am aware that the highly sophisticated preparations for specific conditions are still readily available.</P>
    <P>The Trident Report recommended that items which could be bought over the counter should be removed from the GMS prescribing list.  I understand it was intended to bring about a saving of £8 million.  I understand also that that is the level of saving which will be effected this year by way of the removal from the GMS list of the overcounter sales.  In the first month since these items were removed there was a saving of £1,250,000.  With that kind of saving it is difficult to understand the Minister's decision to remove further items from the GMS list.</P>
    <P>In addition, whereas previously only items that could be bought over the counter &mdash; and many of them could be bought in supermarkets &mdash; were removed from the list, the Minister has created a precedent in removing items that can be purchased only on prescription.  I should like to hear him explain this departure. It will mean that the patient who needs any of these items will have to pay for them but will also have to pay a prescription <Col N="2101" /> charge.  It is difficult to understand this change when the Minister is on target regarding his savings for this year. Indeed, it is difficult to understand why this Government should remove any item from the list in view of the various promises they made during the election campaign. I am thinking particularly of the Labour Party who during that campaign complained about items having been removed from the list.  I should like to quote what the Taoiseach had to say as reported at columns 113 and 114 of the Official Report for 27 October 1982.  He said:</P>
    <P>We have seen this again in cuts in the health services, including discriminatory withdrawal of hundreds of drugs from the least well off, those on medical cards, while the full cost of the same drugs, subject to small monthly deductions, is available to all of us who are better off.</P>
    <P>Again, during the debate on a confidence-in-the-Government motion of 3 November 1982 the Taoiseach said, as reported at column 661 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>By what possible standards of equity could any Government stand over that?</P>
    <P>He was referring to the removal of the 900 items from the list.  He continued:</P>
    <P>If there have to be cuts one could reasonably say let us start with the better off and spare those on medical cards.  To start with those on medical cards and spare the better off is a policy which no one on this side of the House, in any group on this side of the House whoever they may be, can possibly stand over.</P>
    <P>That was the Leader of the then Opposition expressing his attitude to the removal of some drugs from the GMS prescribing list but this Government have not only removed further items that were for sale over the counter but also items that were available only on prescription. On 3 November 1982, as reported at column 794 of the Official Report, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry <Col N="2102" /> and Energy, Deputy Eddie Collins, said of the then Government:</P>
    <P>They have blatantly brought in some cuts in a haphazard fashion.  The health cuts are designed to hit the poorest worst.  I came across a couple of cases in my advice centres where medical card holders and elderly people with chronic illnesses have not been allowed to get freely the basic medicines they require.  I would suggest that if there were to be changes in the health service to effect savings it would be only fair to ensure that the better-off would be hit more harshly than the less well-off.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister for Health did leave on the list simple cough bottles and three white stomach mixtures which this Government have now decided to remove from the list.  I should like to quote what Deputy O'Keeffe said on 27 October 1982 in the course of a debate on the nomination of members of the Government.  At column 134 of the Official Report of that date he said:</P>
    <P>What requires an explanation even more is the saving of a similar sum of £8 million by cutting the benefits to those in possession of medical cards, by taking 900 items off the list and by ensuring that many people will suffer hardship as a result.</P>
    <P>A former Minister for Health and a member of the Labour Party, Deputy Eileen Desmond, on 2 November 1982, as reported in column 596 of the Official Report, said:</P>
    <P>The Labour Party cannot accept that arbitrary cuts in basic health care available to the poorest and the weakest in our community is the answer to our current economic difficulties.  We cannot accept that chronically ill, pensioners and others on like income should have to pay dearly for essential medicines while public moneys are being frittered away on projects such as Knock Airport.  We cannot accept that the lowest income families in the country should suffer while modest tax proposals for taxing wealthy investors in discretionary trusts are abandoned <Col N="2103" /> by the Government.  This is the context in which we are putting forward our motion this evening.  If one were to pay heed to what one hears it would seem that the principle is accepted by all that those who can most afford to pay should carry the burden of coping with the difficult financial situation but we find that this is not the case.  It is the weakest and the poorest that are hit hardest.  This applies under the present system to every crisis that arises.</P>
    <P>Those quotations made by Members on the Government side show their inconsistency.  I should like to know why the information was not available at Question Time today when I asked what further items have been removed from the GMS prescribing list as stated in a letter dated 23 April 1983 from the General Medical Services (Payments) Board to pharmacists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. F. O'Brien) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. F. O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time today the Deputy asked a supplementary question if specific medicines had been removed from the prescribing lists.  I said that my information did not indicate that and my statement was correct. An order was made on 22 March to have the drugs mentioned removed but while the direction was issued on that date they were not removed until 1 May. The direction was sent to the pharmaceutical union, the Federation of Chemical Industries and the IMA.  The Deputy may say that that information should have been in my brief but it was not as I indicated to the Deputy.  I was asked the question if it was intended to remove further drugs from the scheme and I took that to mean from now.  There was no question of trying to conceal facts or gloss over the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the parties concerned were informed of the drugs being removed from the prescribing list they were also made aware that a number of drugs were relisted and there were additions.  In other words, we have improved the situation and the number of drugs available on the prescribing list is greater than prior <Col N="2104" /> to 22 March.  That improvement will result in a cost we hope to contain within the given figure.  There is no question of the Department cutting back in the real sense.  The decision to put more drugs on to the prescribing list represents an improvement.  Some of the drugs concerned were pain relievers for arthritis and iron tablets.  The Deputy, being a medical practitioner, will understand the reason for restoring the iron tablets.  There was a demand by the elderly for such tablets. The absence of eye preparations was causing a problem with the elderly also. Certain preparations for dyschora and dermatology were also involved.  We made an effort to get preparations back.</P>
    <P>With regard to the stomach mixture, aludrox, the Deputy will be aware that that is an over the counter saleable product. The phenobarbitone content was removed and it would be giving an unfair advantage if we did not remove it and removed others that are available across the counter.  That product was removed in fairness and the same would apply to the cough mixtures.  In the course of my reply I told the Deputy that at present we did not have any plans to remove further drugs but the Deputy will agree that the scheme which has been in operation since last October must be kept under review to ensure there is no great hardship imposed on anybody.  I am anxious to ensure that there are no real hardships. Obviously, if any product is removed from such a list some will suffer but we must look at this matter in the context of the overall health charges and how we can achieve savings while at the same time give a good service.  What we have done is equitable and reasonable but in our further reviews of the scheme if we find there is abuse or over-prescription we will deal with it.  If we discover that there is a lot of hardship, particularly with regard to the elderly and those who require special medicines, we will act immediately.  A number of old people require iron tablets but, cheap as they are and although they have an important part to play in their general health, they cannot afford to buy them.  Any changes made will be in the interests of the patient and better management.</P>

      <P>Persons who are not accommodated by the SDA loan scheme are catered for by the other lending agencies, principally the Housing Finance Agency and the building societies.</P>
      <P>Generally, there is no evidence at the present time that the availability of mortgage finance is preventing persons from buying their own homes or acting as a constraint on private housing output.</P>

    <P>We fully support the recent proposal of the European Commission to allocate emergency Community aid in the form of 5,000 tonnes of cereals and 94 tonnes of butteroil to Ethiopia in response to the drought there.  The food aid will be distributed through non-governmental organisations which are operating in the affected regions.  This is in addition to the 78,000 tonnes of cereals allocated to Ethiopia last year.  I understand that the <Col N="1905" /> commission are keeping the situation under riview and may provide further aid if the need arises.</P>
    <P>On 28 March the Government announced the allocation of £50,000 from the Disaster Relief Fund for the relief of the victims of famine and drought in Ethiopia.  The funds have been allocated to the Irish Disaster Appeals Committee which groups together several Irish voluntary organisations which are providing aid to Ethiopia.</P>

      <P>The fourth European Community-Association of South East Asia Nations (EC-ASEAN) Ministerial Meeting was held in Bangkok, Thailand, on 24 and 25 March 1983.  Ireland was represented at that meeting by the Minister of State at my Department.  The meeting was held in a friendly and constructive atmosphere and dealt with a number of major political and economic issues of mutual concern. These included, in the political area, the situation in Kampuchea, Afghanistan, and the Middle East, and in the economic area, commodity problems, global negotiations and the forthcoming sixth session of UNCTAD in Belgrade. The results of the meeting are set out in the Joint Declaration which was issued at its conclusion, copies of which are available in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Minister of State availed of the opportunity provided by his presence in Thailand to visit the refugee camps at Kow-I-Dang and Nong Samet on the border between Thailand and Kampuchea.  During his visit, the Minister of State met Irish personnel from CONCERN who are involved in a number of humanitarian projects in these camps.  The Minister of State was most impressed by the excellent work being done by these young people.</P>
      <P>Deputies will also be aware from newspaper reports that the Minister of State, on my instructions, spoke to the Foreign Minister of the Philippines about the Irish Government's concern at the reports of violations of human rights in the Philippines, and expressed the hope that measures would be taken by the Philippine Government to improve the situation in that country.</P>

With regard to the first part of the question, local authorities are prohibited by the obligations of EEC membership from including a clause in their building contracts along the lines suggested.  There is, however, a responsibility within the building industry on designers, specifiers and contractors to ensure that Irish materials are not denied a reasonable opportunity of participating and it is particularly important that the design of works is not such as to preclude the use of Irish products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department always seek the consent of any legal guardian of a minor before issuing a passport.  Where the Department are aware that a child, although not yet adopted, is in foster care, they also seek the consent of the body concerned with such placement, for example, a health board, adoption board or recognised adoption agency.</P>
      <P>As the purpose of this procedure is essentially to comply with family law (including the Guardianship of Infants Act, the Adoption Acts and the Children Acts) and of the relevant provisions of the Constitution, it is not proposed to change it.</P>
      <P>There may be exceptional cases where the Department can give sympathetic consideration to dispensing with one of these consents.  After careful scrutiny of the facts and supporting documents and of the implications of recent constitutional case-law in this area &mdash; and the existence or otherwise of a Fit Person Order under the Children Acts &mdash; the Department may be able to conclude that a passport may issue without infringement of the legal rights of an individual.</P>
      <P>The question of the term of the passport and of the person or body to whom it is handed depends on the circumstances of the case in the light of the above considerations.</P>

      <P>The obligation to take oil supplies from Whitegate rests on all oil <Col N="1924" /> importers but it is particularly difficult to identify all importers and to apply the obligations where the individual level of import is relatively small.  Following the failure of approaches in writing to several parties allegedly engaging in such trade, I arranged for an officer of my Department to visit them recently.  As soon as these investigations are completed, I hope to be in a position to apply the volume obligations on these importers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time I am considering what steps will enable me to receive, more urgently and automatically, <Col N="1925" /> detailed information on all imports of oil products into the State.</P>

      <P>I would however, point out that a 24,000 sq. ft. advance factory now nearing completion is being provided in Mallow under a private finance arrangement with the IDA.  In addition, the IDA have 21 acres in Mallow, nine acres in both Fermoy and Mitchelstown, and five acres in Buttevant which are all being promoted for suitable industrial projects.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Irish Life Assurance Co. Ltd. recently sold its entire shareholding in CP Glorney Ltd.  I understand that prior to the disposal of the shareholding the contractual relationship which the employees had was with CP Glorney Ltd., and that this relationship still exists.  I believe the Irish Life Assurance Co. Ltd. hold that, in these circumstances, the 1980 Regulations do not apply.  The matter is one on which I am seeking legal advice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 636 and 637 together.</P>
      <P>The parliamentary allowances payable to TDs and Senators at present are £13,802 and £7,619, a year, respectively. These allowances were last revised with effect from 1 June 1981.</P>
      <P>TDs and Senators have not received any of the three phased increases provided for in the Public Service Pay Agreement of December 1981.  In their case the implementation of the increases, 2% (or £4 a week, whichever is greater) from 1 December 1981, 6% from 1 March 1982 and 5% from 1 January 1983, was deferred last year and no further decision has been taken on the matter.</P>
      <P>Had the increases been paid, as was done in the public service and State and semi-State employments, TDs' and Senators' allowances would now be £15,669 and £8,713, a year, respectively.</P>
      <P>The procedures involved in the revision of parliamentary salaries and allowances are different from those in the public service and State and semi-State employments.  Increases for Oireachtas members can only be affected at present by means of an order which must lie before the Dáil for 21 sitting days, without an annulling motion being passed, before coming into operation.  In some instances TDs and Senators have not received the agreed increases for six to eight months after they had been authorised for civil servants.  I am therefore examining these procedures with a view to revising them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overnight and day allowances currently in operation for Members of the <Col N="1929" /> Oireachtas are £17.50 and £10 respectively. These rates were last revised with effect from 1 January 1980.  Details of the current motor mileage allowances which are operative from the same date are set out in appendix 1.  Details of the motor mileage and subsistence allowances payable <Col N="1930" /> to civil servants are set out in appendix 2.  As can be seen the two sets of allowances are structured differently.</P>
    <P>Mileage and subsistence allowances in other areas of the public service would be broadly in line with those in the civil service.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he will explain arising out of his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 684 of 17 May 1983 and to previous Parliamentary Questions Nos. 654 and 655 of 27 April 1983 how Bord Iascaigh Mhara made full repayments on foot of Central Fund advances to the Exchequer as at 31 March 1983, when in fact he has already stated that fishermen are in arrears with their payments to the extent of approximately £3 million; and from what source Bord Iascaigh Mhara were able to repay the arrears of £3 million to the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>The length of time applying to BIM loans to fishermen is always substantially less than the period available on loans from the Central Fund as received by the board from the Exchequer. Although substantial arrears are arising on fishermen's loan accounts repayments in each year to date by fishermen have been sufficient to meet repayments on Exchequer advances as they fell due.</P>
      <P>Of the IR£3 million arrears referred to approximately £1.2 million is represented by payments which are required to be made by the board to banks when fishermen default on bank loans which have been guaranteed by the board.  To service these payments additional Exchequer advances have to be drawn by the board.</P>

      <P>Loan agreements for new vessels are available for a maximum term of 12 years; loan agreements for secondhand vessels are available for a maximum term of ten years and are usually for a lesser term.  Loan agreements for other purposes range from a maximum of eight years down to six months.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to allocate arrears on loan accounts as between interest and principal.  The figure for interest and principal included in each instalment as it falls due is debited to a single current account.  Any receipts are credited to this account.  There is no necessity nor is any attempt made to apportion the receipts as between interest and principal and accordingly the information sought is not available.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 8 October 1981 and was paid continuously to 1 January 1983.</P>
      <P>From 3 January 1983 payment depended on his insurance record in a new contribution year, 1981-82.

      <P>The person concerned did not submit claims to disability benefit in respect of the two periods specified by the Deputy.  Following investigations it has been established that this person was employed during the period 25 to 27 March 1981 and consequently he is not entitled to disability benefit.  It has also been established that he was absent from work due to illness on 14 and 15 September 1981.  Even if he had claimed disability benefit for those two days he would not be entitled to payment as benefit is not normally payable for the first three days of a claim.</P>
