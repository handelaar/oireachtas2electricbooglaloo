      <P>asked the Taoiseach the responsibilities of Deputy Fennell, Minister of State at his Department; the number of staff for which she is responsible; the sections, if any, of other Departments that have been transferred to his Department and assigned to her area of responsibility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Minister Fennell has responsibility for Women's Affairs and Family Law Reform and is a Minister of State at both the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Justice.  The work arising in the Minister's area of responsibility is carried out by five people working directly with the Minister in her office and by existing staff of the Economic and Social Policy Division of the Department of the Taoiseach.  No staff have been transferred to the Department of the Taoiseach arising from the area of responsibility assigned to Minister Fennell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Minister of State made a recent statement to the effect that an inter-departmental <Col N="238" /> committee structure will be set up covering a number of Departments? Have that committee been established and, if so, what are their terms of reference? Will they be reporting to the Minister of State or to the individual Departments? Also can the Taoiseach give us some details?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question, but I can confirm that an interdepartmental committee has been established on women's affairs and on family law reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they have.  I can give the terms of reference but I am a little reluctant to do so.  I am not sure how far I should go.  It is a separate question, but I am more than anxious to be helpful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference are to review the existing situation in relation to measures affecting women's affairs and family law reform, identifying areas still requiring action, considering the best administrative structures for implementing a programme of reform, identifying measures to promote positive opportunities and facilities to enable women to participate more fully in the life of the community and generally monitoring developments and keeping progress under review.  The intention is that a programme of reform will be drawn up with the assistance of the working party within approximately one year and this will form the basis of a policy document to be submitted to the Government for approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether any Ministers of State continue to be members of local authorities; if he has requested them to resign; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The following Ministers of State are members of local authorities: Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Mr. Paddy Hegarty; Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Mr. Paul Connaughton; Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Mr. Joe Bermingham; Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy, Mr. Edward Collins; Minister of State at the Department of Transport and at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, Mr. John Donnellan; Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Mr. Michael Moynihan; Minister of State at the Department of Labour, Mr. George Birmingham; Minister of State at the Department of Health and at the Department of Social Welfare, Mr. Fergus <Col N="240" /> O'Brien; Minister of State at the Department of Education, Mr. Donal Creed; Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and at the Department of the Gaeltacht, Mr. Michael D'Arcy.</P>
      <P>On the appointment of the Ministers of State, they were advised of the practice normally followed by Governments in recent years.  The precedents set by the two most recent Fianna Fáil Governments show that from December 1979 to June 1981, a period in excess of 18 months, six Ministers of State did not resign at all during the lifetime of that Government and in the period March 1982 to December 1982, four Ministers of State and a Cabinet Minister did not resign from membership of local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Never show the white feather.  Regarding the 18 months the Taoiseach has just referred to, could he name any member of the Cabinet who did not resign his seat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said quite clearly that in the period March-December 1982 a Minister did not resign from membership of a local authority.  He was &mdash; I always say &ldquo;of course&rdquo;&mdash; Deputy Doherty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the Tánaiste should be a member of a local authority and should retain his position as such?  After all, he is a member of a local authority and Minister for the Environment at the same time.  Does the Taoiseach consider that that is an ideal situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>

      <P>I am aware of gross analogies between the practices of the Unionist Party in Northern Ireland with an absolute majority and those of the Fianna Fáil Party in this State with regard to co-options, but I am more than happy, as in Northern Ireland are the SDLP, to enter into discussions with a view to achieving a measure of power-sharing universally throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

      <P>I am more than happy to enter into discussions to get over the problems created by the actions of Fianna Fáil in certain areas in relation to co-options. Now I want to lower the temperature if I may and say seriously that we should look at this thing together rather than make party points about it. Problems have arisen in successive Governments and we should be able to sort it out together in the interests of Parliament and the local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the receiver of the McCartin Group in County Leitrim said that departmental approval was obtained for the receiver's fees and <Col N="243" /> expenses which were over £600,000 in respect of the receivership; if he will confirm that he received full details of this receivership account; how the sum of approximately £600,000 is broken down <i>vis-à-vis</i> fees and expenses; if he will give details of these accounts; if he is satisfied with the total fees and expenses charged; and if he considers that they were reasonable and in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Exchequer funded the receivership of the McCartin group for the period 19 March 1980 to 3 February 1981 and detailed accounts covering the expenditure involved were supplied to my Department prior to the payment being made.</P>
      <P>The total in fees and expenses paid to the receiver which relate to this period was £381,000 and this was met by the Exchequer.  No funds were provided by the Exchequer in respect of the balance of the cost of the receiver's fees.  The receivership fees met by the Exchequer were £316,500 made up of £275,500 for the management of the receivership and £40,000 for a special report commissioned by the Government on the viability of the group.  The total number of hours worked by the receiver and his staff in respect of the £316,500 was 14,200 and the average rate per hour was £22.30.  A further £64,500 was provided in respect of travel and accommodation for the receiver and his staff.</P>
      <P>The amounts involved are substantial but they cover an 11 month period and they are in line with charges for this kind of work.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, can the Chair tell the House why the name of the McCartin Group was mentioned in the question?  This is a departure from normal practice.</P>

      <P>First, it is a matter for the Deputy to put down the question. Second, it has been the practice to try to preserve the anonymity of the people about whom queries are made, but it appears that this firm has been before the public for some years and the item being queried was published on the papers some time before the question was put down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is not the receiver's name given?  We can look at the Order Paper and see in Question No. 5 &ldquo;a person (details supplied)&rdquo;, and this has been normal practice in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The receiver's name was not mentioned in the question as furnished and it would be improper for the office to include his name, which most people know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very serious public concern expressed arising out of the fees charged in this case, does the Minister agree that they were exorbitant? If so, has he any plans in hand to ensure that such exorbitant fees are not charged on all receiverships and liquidations?  In view of the fact that most people believe those fees were exorbitant, does he not agree that this is bringing the whole system into disrepute?  It must be realised that while these fees were charged other items were left outstanding such as tax, sizeable sums due to the ACC and so on. Would the Minister comment on those questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, the amount paid in this case by the Exchequer in receivership fees amounted to £275,500 for the management of the receivership and the balance of the total was made up of various expenses and the cost of the special report commissioned by the Government.  I also pointed out in my reply that the total number of manhours spent on that portion of the receivership financed by the Exchequer was 14,200 and the average rate per hour was £22.30, a level of fee which is in line with that normally paid for this kind of work.</P>

      <P>A question please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>A fee of £22.30 per hour for the principal of a firm is justified, but 14,200 hours were worked by that firm. Does the Minister consider that every person in that firm was entitled to £22.30 per hour for services rendered?  In his capacity as Minister for Finance, would he have this matter seriously looked at by an independent body to decide if those fees were exorbitant, and if they are, to have the receiver make a sizeable return to the Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept that there may be a case for asking if the scale of fees applicable in a case like this should not be examined again with the profession in question, although as far as I am aware the levels of fees laid down are common in that profession.  For some of the period 17 staff from the firm in question were engaged full-time on various aspects of the receivership and for much of the period during which the Exchequer financed the receivership there were seven full-time staff on the firm's premises, including high level management staff.  As to the question of fees, there may be grounds for taking up with the profession in question the level of fees charged for this kind of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the travelling hours to and from the firm been included in the hours charged for management time?  Would the Minister accept that a considerable amount of the exorbitant expenditure involved here was caused by the promoters of this firm because the receiver was unable to gain access to the premises?  We have all read the number of times the receiver went down there and the kind of action that was taken to prevent access&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As to the factors that led to the receiver having to spend the amount of time he did on the job, that is separate from the question which deals with the amount paid.  A full account of the expenditure involved was supplied to the Department of Finance before payment was made and it was found to be justified.</P>

      <P>The Minister has accepted that the fees for the time served were normal for the profession.  Would he care to comment on the reason for the receivership being involved for such a length of time?  Could he give the total cost to the Exchequer, including loss of revenue to the Revenue Commissioners, the ACC and generally to the Exchequer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out the total amount of time involved.  The Exchequer funded the receivership from 19 March 1980 to 3 February 1981.  The receivership in question was particularly difficult for a number of different reasons.  The figure I have given covers the total cost of the receiver's fees funded by the Exchequer.  As I said, the total was £381,000.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, on this question I am seeking your guidance following the discussion we had yesterday. The answer to the question is in the form of a tabular statement with explanatory notes which cover the full page.  I could give the Deputy the overall figures he requires, but I will defer to your ruling on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The way the Minister answers a question is a matter for himself.  The Chair will not direct how questions should be answered.  He felt yesterday, and still feels, that when a question is answered partly in a written statement and partly orally in the House, supplementary questions become both difficult and confused.  A supplementary question may refer only to the answer out of which it immediately arises.  Hence it is difficult to see how a Deputy can ask a supplementary question when he is unaware of the nature of the answer. That is the Chair's feeling and he does not think it is unreasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon, Deputy Durkan.  This is your question, but I want to raise a point of order on the <Col N="250" /> broad general principle.  A Cheann Comhairle, I feel we must raise this matter with you because it has been an established tradition as long as I have been here that, even though the answer is in the form of a tabular statement, Deputies were given some latitude to ask supplementaries in global terms, not asking for the details of the answer.  Very often Deputies were given permission to ask for the total figure involved, or some broad type of question like that.  I do not think we should depart from that, at least without discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey will agree that it would not be satisfactory to have a long discussion on it now.  If Deputy Haughey would like to have the matter considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I am sure that can be arranged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it merits anything as heavy as that.  I suggest that within reasonable limits you should allow the existing practice to continue.  It has not done all that much damage to our parliamentary proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair does not wish to force any issue on the matter today.  The existing practice was becoming more confused and leading to more difficulties by the question almost.  It is a matter for the Minister as to how he will answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <P> *The figures take account of the 10% refund to Ireland to cover the collection costs of Own Resources.  The figures do not include contributions to the EIB, the ECSC or Euratom Research Programmes.  These and other payments arising from membership of the European Communities amounted to about £20 million during the period 1973 to 1982. </P>
    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>FEOGA Guarantee Section.</P>
    <P>The EEC Commission advances money to the Department of Agriculture on a monthly basis for the payment of export refunds, MCAs, production and consumption aids.  However, where intervention is concerned, the EEC does not finance the operations directly but pays certain costs and expenses associated with the operation of intervention and also losses on sales of intervention stocks.</P>
    <P>Receipts under the Guarantee Section include amounts of £24 million in 1976, £128 million in 1977, £140 million in 1978, £78 million in 1979, £13.5 million in 1980 and £0.3 million in 1981 for the UK and Italian MCA import subsidies which have been administered by Ireland in respect of Irish exports to the UK and Italy since 17 May 1976.</P>
    <P>FEOGA Guidance Section.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on Guidance measures is incurred by a number of Departments and State Agencies. The Department of Agriculture (as the Irish Intervention Agency) co-ordinates annual recoupment of the eligible portion of this expenditure (except that relating to fisheries) from the EEC Commission. The projects which are assisted under the Guidance Section of FEOGA are as follows.<Col N="252" /></P>

    <P>EMS Interest Subsidies</P>
    <P>In the context of negotiations for Ireland's entry into the European Monetary System loans of 333.3 MECU (IR£225m approximately) and associated interest subsidies of 66.6 MECU per annum (IR£46m approximately) for five years were made available in respect of European Investment Bank and New Community Instrument borrowings over the period 1979-1983.  These loans and subsidies are paid directly to the Exchequer and are concentrated primarily on infrastructural projects.</P>
    <P>Other projects.</P>
    <P>Grant assistance under other headings such as research and investment projects, energy projects and various studies has also been received from the EEC budget.

However, as the taxpayer's income did not greatly exceed £4,600, and as it was to his benefit to do so, the tax liability for 1981-82 was calculated in accordance with the marginal relief provisions of the age exemption.</P>
      <P>Full details of the final income tax position for the year 1981-82 were issued by the inspector of taxes on 19 November 1982 and the matter was fully explained to the taxpayer in the course of a visit to the tax office on 10 December 1982.</P>

      <P>The pre-budget estimate for excise duties was £1,260 million. Budget day reductions amounted to £69 million, consisting of £43 million to offset the impact of the increase in the low rate of VAT on certain commodities and £26 million reduced tax buoyancy.  Budget day additions, exclusive of VAT, amounted to £25.3 million, including £5 million from changes in certain duty-free allowances.  The net result of these changes was a reduction of £43.7 million on the pre-budget estimate giving the post-budget figure of £1,216.3 million.</P>

      <P>The figures mentioned by the Deputy in his question were only part of the overall changes.  The pre-budget total for excise duties was £1,260 million. Budget excise changes amounted to £20.3 <Col N="258" /> million.  The changes in the duty-free allowances amounted to £5 million.  The alteration in rates of VAT on beer and spirits to compensate for the change in the excises came to a reduction of £43.7 million and there was a buoyancy factor of £26 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The total effect was to move from the pre-budget estimate of £1,260 million to the post-budget figure of £1,216 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it surprising that the VAT buoyancy element should be reduced by that substantial amount.  Is the Minister saying that reduction in the buoyancy element was because of changes made in the budget or was it based on economic projections for the year?  Normally buoyancy in revenue is based on economic projections of movements in the economy.  Is the Minister saying that that reduction in the buoyancy element was because of a revision due to changes made in the budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The figure of £26 million was the buoyancy effect of changes made in the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If we take excise duties and VAT together the total effect was to have an increase overall in total revenue <Col N="259" /> compared to the pre-budget estimates in respect of excise duties and VAT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated tax yield in 1983 from the rates of VAT is as follows: the 5 per cent rate is expected to yield £32.9 million; the 18 per cent rate, £273.1 million; the 23 per cent rate, £623.3 million; the 30 per cent rate, £61.7 million and the 35 per cent rate, £140.7 million.

Before the impact of the VAT increases has begun to bite, the first quarter returns indicate that 26 per cent of the projected figures have been realised already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement issued with the first quarter returns shows that a number of factors have to be taken into account in judging what the 26 per cent means in terms of forecasting for a full year.  For example, we have there a full quarter in this year when VAT at point of entry applies which did not apply during the first quarter of last year.  There are a number of factors of that kind that have to be taken into account in judging the precise meaning of the 26 per cent in the first quarter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not see there is a significant difference between VAT and excise duties?  My questions have not been inconsistent. The Minister said yesterday that extra expenditure this year in Departments such as the Department of Health and devaluation consequences would not upset the overall budget arithmetic.  Was that because he expects to get more from VAT than he projected at the beginning of the year?  Otherwise, is it not true that <Col N="261" /> the overall budgetary arithmetic will be upset?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has any proposals for strengthening the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to enable him, of his own motion, to prevent waste of public money betore it has already been paid away or contractually committed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I understand what precisely the Deputy has in mind here.  There would be clear difficulties in having the Comptroller and Auditor General involved in <i>a priori</i> decision-making as to public expenditure. This is a matter for Ministers and their Departments and I do not feel that a change in legislation to involve the Comptroller and Auditor General would <Col N="265" /> lead to any improvement, but could result in wasteful duplication.  However, if what the Deputy has in mind is a review of effectiveness of expenditure, then I would draw his attention to the Government discussion document of a year ago, <i>A Better Way to spend the Nation's Finances</i>, in which various possibilities for this were put forward, including a possible expansion of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This matter is still under active consideration in my Department in the context of reforming financial procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is stuck on the Comptroller and Auditor General as such but, in as much as he is a constitutional independent officer, would the Minister not agree that if his only control is <i>a posteriori</i> so that, in other words, he can criticise &mdash; for anyone who is bothered listening to him &mdash; only wastages which have already taken place, his useful function is very limited in the control of waste; and since Departments are evidently neither able nor willing to avoid waste themselves, there is very much room in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As I have said, I am not entirely convinced that the Comptroller and Auditor General would be the appropriate person to carry out that work.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that groups engaged solely in the provision of group water supply schemes are not liable to tax on these activities.  Other income such as investment income &mdash; that is interest on balances held on deposit prior to completion of a water scheme and, after such completion, in respect of moneys required for maintenance purposes &mdash; is, however, chargeable to tax in the normal way.  As an alternative to placing moneys on deposit with financial institutions, such groups might consider the possibility of investing temporary surplus funds in tax-free securities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the reason the European Regional Development Fund allocation to Donegal County Council has been reduced from £200,000 in 1982 to £80,000 in 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Special Border Areas Programme Fund which is being aided by the non-quota section of the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputy O'Hanlon on 9 March 1983 when I stated that there was an unexpended balance of IR£2.4 million in the Special Border Areas Programme Fund at the end of 1982.  Of this amount, IR£189,672 is available to Donegal County Council.  With the additional allocation of IR£80,000 provided in 1983, the total amount available for Donegal County Council in 1983 is IR£269,672.  In the years 1981 and 1982 combined expenditure on projects by the county council amounted to about £162,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that Donegal County Council have not been informed of anything in addition to £80,000 and would he furthermore accept that in October-November of last year the Department advised Donegal County Council to anticipate £200,000 for 1983 and that they should make plans accordingly?  As far as Donegal County Council are aware, would he accept that they have been advised that there is only £80,000 available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding Donegal County Council is as follows: In 1982, a provision of £352,000 was made for the county council, of which £162,000 &mdash; in round figures &mdash; was spent, leaving £189,672 as a balance unexpended in 1982, which is brought forward into 1983. That, together with the £80,000 allocated for 1983, brings the total available to the county council for this year to £269,672. That is the actual position as far as the allocation to Donegal County Council is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bring the good tidings to Donegal County Council, because they have not yet been advised about it.

    <Col N="268" />
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would he, on behalf of the people of Donegal, suggest that it is not necessary to go through the member state, that we in Donegal are prepared to pay pound for pound as against their money?  Would he put the case for us on that basis, rather than putting it through the member state?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's suggestion.  If Deputy Gallagher and, indeed, anybody else, has specific proposals to make as to how we might re-jig the operation of the Regional Development Fund, I would be happy to hear those proposals.  The situation as of now is that money is still not made available to an individual project.  Funding from the Regional Development Fund depends on the member state in question providing part of the funding themselves, so that it is not normally done on a specific project by project basis but on the basis of a certain number of projects put up by the member state in question.</P>
      <P>The situation in relation to the Border areas fund is slightly different, as I explained in the last few days in response to questions from other Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The cross-Border area of Donegal, Derry and Strabane is probably the blackest area for unemployment in the country.  Recently, at a meeting a Minister from another jurisdiction who has responsibility for a particular part of this island suggested that there did not seem to be the same commitment from the present Coalition Government to prosper cross-Border co-operation when they were not prepared to nominate a Minister for special responsibility in that area.  Would the Minister make that recommendation to the Cabinet?</P>

      <P>Until such time as the maintenance of a satisfactory and adequate water supply to Tuam is assured, there can be no question of the drainage of the Nanny river being proceeded with nor of the allocation of funds for that purpose.  The Commissioners of Public Works have agreed to contribute towards the cost of trial well borings to be carried out by the Galway County Council to determine the feasibility of an alternative source of water for the town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying it is generally Government practice that tender and contract prices are not given. I believe it is in the public interest that that should be so.  I should say there is protection &mdash; let there be no misunderstanding &mdash; plenty of protection is provided. For example, there is the Government Contracts Committee which must investigate any contract where the lowest tender is not accepted and they must also be notified of every contract and price. There is then the Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee, so the House will see there is adequate protection. The particular one about which the Deputy asked me &mdash; on the occasion he mentioned &mdash; was in respect of a contract placed during the term of office of his party.  I am sure he will be glad to hear from me that everything was above board and in order with regard to that contract.</P>

      <P>Discussions are in progress between the Whips on the establishment of committees.  These discussions relate to the whole body of committees. We are hopeful that we will be able to bring forward proposals to the House, by agreement, in the immediate future.  That would obviously be desirable. It is at the moment in the hands of the Opposition.  We are very anxious to proceed and I believe it is in the interests of the House and the country that our committee system in this Dáil should be got under way and there should not be further delay.  I am sure the Opposition agree with that and will want to co-operate with us on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities is concerned, we are agreeable to set up that committee in half an hour.  I do not think <Col N="304" /> the question of the overall committees has to wait for any final agreement on the whole package.  We could proceed with any of the established committees of the House.  It would be wrong to give the impression that we must wait to get agreement on all the new committees that were mentioned in the last few months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will understand, if we are establishing a number of committees &mdash; some new, some established, some <i>ad hoc</i> and temporary and some permanent &mdash; that before Members of the House are allocated and given the opportunity to offer their names for participation in committees they would need to know what committees are involved.  It has been my desire, which so far I have not been able to implement, that we would be able to agree on the package so that Members of the House would be allocated to them in relation to their interests in particular areas.  If we proceed piecemeal we will have a piecemeal allocation of people who subsequently may be unhappy with the committee, they are allocated to and would prefer to be on another one.  That is why we have tried to take them together.  I urge the Opposition to co-operate in relation to this in the interests of Members of the House.  There is no other interest in it except that, but there is an interest in Members of the House having the opportunity to serve on the committees of greatest interest to them. They cannot do that until they know what committees will be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of established committees in the House. The one Deputy Manning asked about is one of them and there is no reason why we cannot go ahead and establish those committees this afternoon.  There are other committees which the Government, through the Leader of the House, have put forward that are being considered by the Opposition's front bench.  In due course we will make our decision on those.  It is giving a wrong impression to say that we cannot proceed with committees, especially one like the committee Deputy Manning spoke about.  Only a <Col N="305" /> special type of Deputy would be interested in European matters, and, he would be unlikely to be interested in some of the new ones or, if he is, he could be on two committees.  We should proceed with establishing that committee. We have no objection to proceeding with establishing this committee this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is one for the Whips and the point I made remains valid.  Deputy Manning, for all I know, may be interested in this committee.  But if there is to be another committee on another subject which he is interested in he should have, like other Members of the House, the opportunity of offering for it.  I am afraid that the procedure of taking them piecemeal does not make that possible.  The committees we are now proposing to the House include committees which have been proposed for this House since the end of 1981 and we have been trying to get agreement on them.  After nearly 18 months it surely must be possible for the Opposition to agree on committees being established in areas where there is common concern to get progress made.  The work of this House could be so much more effective and seen to be more effective, where Deputies can work together on committees in their common interests whereas on the floor of the House, inevitably, more political and contentious issues tend to predominate and secure greater publicity.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the fact that this Bill is before the House. It is a measure I had considerable interest in, and before I was a Member of this House, for some years sought legislation <Col N="307" /> to provide for a system of community service orders.  I welcome the fact that this Bill seeks to establish such a system. I agree to some extent with my constituency colleague, Deputy John Kelly, who yesterday referred to the fact that it is very difficult to understand why a Bill of this nature has been in force across the water for over ten years and it has taken us until now to deal with this particular problem and provide for this type of Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House should be put in its proper context.  It is fair to say that its context has been somewhat lost in the remarks made by some Members of the House.  Some of their remarks seem to indicate a lack of understanding of the nature of this Bill and the problems it is intended to deal with.  In this context a most instructive document is the 1981 Annual Report on Prisons, which has just been made available to Deputies.  It reiterates some of the information contained in previous reports and highlights the need for us to find alternative mechanisms to deal with people convicted of criminal offences and to provide the courts with the possibility of a whole series of different remedies and different types of sentences to be used by them when a person is convicted.</P>
      <P>The problem that has faced successive Governments in the House is that, due to the increase of criminal offences in this country, there has been a lack of adequate prison facilities to provide for the expanded prison population and there has been insufficient room for the prisons to cope with the numbers of people who have been sentenced to prison for committing offences.</P>

    <P>The 1980 Prison Report, produced by the Department of Justice, indicated that in 1980 there were 891 prisoners released before they completed their sentence for no reason other than overcrowding in our prisons.  The 1981 report notes a decrease in the numbers and refers to 441 people who were so released.  However, it sounds a note of warning by saying that 1982 was likely to be worse.  No doubt, when we have the up-to-date report covering 1982, we will have similar, if not worse, figures indicating that when the <Col N="308" /> Garda have done their job and people have been properly prosecuted and sentenced in the courts, our system of criminal justice lacks the capacity to ensure that people serve the sentences imposed on them.  In this context there is a need to provide alternative forms of sentencing for our courts not, as has been suggested by some Deputies on both sides of the House, to provide an easy solution for criminals or a flabby liberal mechanism for dealing in some way with criminals without ensuring that society is fully and properly protected.  It is necessary to ensure that we do not have just a facade of a criminal justice system but that we have a system which is operating, workable and meaningful.  When the court passes sentence, there is a need to ensure that the sentences are carried out.</P>
    <P>The option of sentencing a person to carry out a form of community service is now available in a large number of jurisdictions and I believe it will be welcomed as a form of sentencing by our judges and courts.  It will ensure that some of those people who are at present sentenced to three or four months for committing offences will no longer find themselves in a situation where, when they arrive at Mountjoy to serve their sentence, they are told to come back next week as the prison is full, which is the height of idiocy, or, even worse, they are taken into Mountjoy and told at the end of a week that they have to be sent home because someone else is coming in and they have no room.  It will ensure that that sort of ludicrous situation does not continue and that some people at present sentenced to short terms of imprisonment will have a meaningful sentence passed on them that requires them to make restitution to the community, to some extent, for the wrong they have done and will also provide them with an incentive not to commit similar offences at a later stage.  It will also ensure that the sentence imposed is properly carried out and will, I hope, terminate the problem of the courts sentencing offenders who are then sent home by prison staff because there are no facilities to accommodate them.</P>
    <P>Much of what is contained in this Bill is the same as the contents of the Private <Col N="309" /> Members' Bill which I had the honour to introduce on behalf of Fine Gael last summer, and which is similar in content to the Bill which the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Seán Doherty, introduced. Some aspects arise more fittingly on Committee Stage but I would like to refer to two or three of them.  In this context, I also want to refer to the remarks made by the Minister in the House.  When introducing this Bill he indicated that he was inviting Deputies to indicate on Second Stage what other form of sentences or remedies of a practical nature they believed should be made available to the courts as an alternative to custodial sentences.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us effectively allows the courts to sentence offenders to a period of community service for something between 40 and 240 hours.  The Minister, when introducing the Bill, indicated that he had no ideological attachment to those hours and that he was happy for Deputies to contribute in this area and indicate whether they consider that is an adequate period.  We should increase the maximum that the courts can order by way of community service.  The 240 hours referred to in the Bill is unnecessarily restrictive and is, as Deputy Kelly said, copied from British legislation in this area.  In the Private Members' Bill which I introduced, unlike the Bill introduced by Deputy Doherty, I increased the maximum to 480 hours. The figure had no magical implications but it was done to afford the courts a degree of flexibility in making orders for community service and, in the context of different types of offences, a degree of flexibility in measuring how much community service is appropriate in the light of the seriousness of the offence or offences for which somebody is convicted. The 40 to 240 hours limit placed by the Minister is somewhat restrictive and there is merit in affording a greater degree of flexibility to the courts.  I have no particular ideological adherence to 480 hours but I suggest that the maximum of 240 hours, during which time community service can be undertaken pursuant to this Bill, is a relatively short <Col N="310" /> period and could be extended.  I hope the Minister will see his way to do that.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill which deserves to be looked at relates to the fact that as the Bill is at present phrased &mdash; and, in fairness to the Minister, the two previous Bills which came before this House were similarly phrased &mdash; it permits community service only in the context of someone who is liable to a sentence of imprisonment.  The intent of that is quite clear and the rationale behind it is also quite clear in the light of the figures I indicated.  In some cases, where short custodial sentences are at present imposed and where we do not have within the prison system the capacity to provide for these prisoners, it is important that some of these prisoners are diverted to community service.  One of the representations which I received following publication of my Private Members' Bill almost a year ago suggested that community service should be available in circumstances other than where a judge believes that a sentence of imprisonment would be appropriate &mdash; for example, the type of area where the courts at present simply impose fines or where an offender is given the Probation Act, effectively let off and told not to misbehave again. There is a role to be played for community service orders in this area.  I would like to see this aspect of the legislation extended and it could be amended on Committee Stage to do so.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the courts having the option of community service available where persons are convicted of offences, whether or not the judge believes that imprisonment is appropriate.  The legislation must clearly state that, where a custodial sentence would be appropriate, community service orders are available as an option.  I can think of many instances where young people, in their late teens, have come before the courts on a first or second offence and judges who were reluctant to send them to prison have said they will give them a chance.  They have given them the Probation Act and within a matter of weeks they are back before the courts again. Getting off under the Probation Act is <Col N="311" /> seen by many offenders as what it is, simply getting off.  It is not a deterrent and it is seen by people as an easy option. In those circumstances the option of community service should be available and would be seen as appropriate by many people who are familiar with the courts. It would not be seen as an easy option by many offenders and it could instil in them the type of responsibility that would be lacking and prove a deterrent from committing crimes again.  I would urge the Minister to extend this legislation beyond the area of offenders for whom a judge believes imprisonment would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the fact that he was considering the feasibility of establishing a committee to monitor the operation of the scheme and to advise on any problems which may arise in that regard.  It is worth stating that when schemes of this nature have been introduced in other jurisdictions &mdash; not just in England, but in Scotland, New Zealand, the United States and elsewhere &mdash; it has been the practice in the initial stages of the schemes to engage in a strict and very real monitoring of them to see where problems arise and to ensure they are met and when necessary to amend the legislation at an early stage.  I would urge the Minister to provide for the establishment of a body that would monitor the operation of the community service scheme.  I would see a body that has a statutory duty to do this composed of some members of the public with departmental representatives and representatives of the Probation and Welfare Service but also I would urge having some representatives of this House on it.  A statutory body of that nature would have a very real function in ensuring the uniform application of the scheme throughout the country, in monitoring its progress and seeing how successful it is, in highlighting defects in it.  A body of that nature would have more status and would be taken a good deal more seriously if it was given a statutory framework.  I urge the Minister to consider that as a serious possibility.</P>
    <P>In the last two or three years the <Col N="312" /> reports on the prisons seem to contain more information and are more comprehensive, but traditionally in operating our prison system and sentencing powers we have not carried out sufficient monitoring of a general nature and we have not had sufficient statistical information available or sufficient research carried out to ensure the schemes introduced are working properly.  Often these things are dealt with within the bowels of secrecy in the Department of Justice and the general public know very little about whether schemes are successful or not.  This is a scheme that could either be very successful or could fall flat on its face due to administrative problems or to a variety of other problems.  It is important that we have this sort of statutory monitoring committee that would have a duty to report annually to the public and to the Department on their view of how the scheme is working and to which members of the Probation and Welfare Service would have access to tell the members of such a committee of any difficulties they are experiencing or any amendments they would like to see to the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he wished us to comment on alternative mechanisms that might be available to deal with sentencing and the difficulties of offenders.  There is a tremendous need for us to carry out a comprehensive examination, by way of a specialist committee of this House or by way of a committee established outside this House, of our whole criminal justice system and our whole system of sentencing.  There is no coherent philosophy behind what we are doing and it is quite clear that to a great extent the system we are now operating is failing.  That can be seen from the statistics supplied in the report of 1981 on the prison service which indicate that 66 per cent of those persons sentenced to custodial detention in 1981 had previously been sentenced to terms of custodial detention.  Whether we regard our prison system as a rehabilitative mechanism or a deterrent to crime, it is not acting as either.</P>
    <P>We have an enormous problem in recidivism. It is something that has never been adequately and properly <Col N="313" /> researched.  We have changed and developed our prison system and our criminal justice system in a piecemeal way without any comprehensive philosophy or overview of what we are about.  We have often introduced changes in a piecemeal way as a reaction to circumstances.  I have no doubt that this present legislation is before the House, partly &mdash; and, it is meritorious in itself &mdash; because it has been forced on Government by the fact that the prison system cannot cope with the number of offenders who are being sentenced to terms of imprisonment.  This aspect of it has become a major embarrassment to Government.</P>
    <P>The time has come for us to start asking serious questions as to what we are at and what effect our prison system has.  If it is to have a deterrent effect it is clearly not working and if it is to have a rehabilitative effect it is equally clearly not properly working.  There is a need for us to redefine what we are about.  I am saying that as someone who fully accepts and recognises that there is a need to have a proper prison service and indeed to sentence many people to terms of imprisonment for some of the terrible crimes that are being committed.  My experience relates particularly to Dublin and daily one is hearing of burglaries and robberies within one's own constituency.</P>
    <P>It is not so long ago that my wife woke up at 3 o'clock in the morning to find a burglar in our own house, so I am well aware of the situation.  We are not tackling it in a coherent way.  We are introducing various forms of remedies without any clear insight into where we are going. I would urge on the Minister the establishment of a formal body, be it composed of Members of this House or people outside this House, to carry out a thorough examination of both our prison and probation services and our sentencing.</P>
    <P>There are two things having a demoralising effect on those to whom we look to provide protection for the community and on the personnel in the Department of Justice and the probation service all of whom are working day and night to <Col N="314" /> tackle the problems about which I have been speaking.  The Minister referred briefly to the intensive supervision scheme inaugurated some years ago which operates in a number of our prisons. Under that scheme members of the probation welfare service assess prisoners to see what offenders are most suitable for early release on the basis of integrating them into the community under a system of intensive supervision through the medium of regular contacts with those so released.  Members of the service carry out comprehensive examinations on individual prisoners to decide which are most suitable for release and most likely to benefit from the scheme of supervision.  Since the inauguration of this scheme those operating the service have suffered a major difficulty because of the overcrowding and accommodation difficulties within the prison service. Because they are employees of the Department of Justice they cannot speak out publicly about the problem.</P>
    <P>The scheme <i>qua</i> scheme is a very good one.  The social worker goes in to carry out an assessment on individual prisoners and comes to the conclusion that a particular prisoner is suitable for release into the community.  He or she suddenly finds that the prisoner has been released without any notification whatsoever to the welfare service and for no other reason than the fact that the prison is overcrowded. The assessment work done is an utter waste of time.  These unfortunate incidents have occurred continuously over a period of time since the scheme was initiated.  This has a demoralising effect on the personnel involved in the scheme.  Indeed, if the Minister looks at the turnover of personnel the reason why there is such a large and rapid turnover is that many leave the scheme out of feelings of frustration.  The scheme has an important part to play and should have the co-operation of all concerned in it.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is most demoralising for the assessment personnel to find prisoners released and sent home without any supervision whatsoever.  The effect must naturally be that many of these will land back again in our gaols some months later.  Serious questions can be raised <Col N="315" /> about the efficiency and the desirability of the intensive scheme being used in this way.  The present situation is not the fault of the Minister.  Neither is it the fault of his predecessor.  The failure of the scheme is due to the increase in crime and I hope the Minister is aware of the problem.</P>
    <P>Another problem is the demoralising effect of early release on the Garda.  They do their job properly, bring offenders to court and succeed in having them convicted and sentenced.  The offenders may be sentenced to six months.  To the dismay of the Garda those same offenders are seen walking the streets again within three or four weeks.  This is making the general public quite cynical about the ability of our criminal justice system to tackle the problem of crime.  To some extent it is turning the entire system into something of a joke.</P>
    <P>In the context of alternative remedies the Minister invited us to make suggestions. At the moment we have fines, terms of imprisonment, the application of the Probation Act under which offenders are required to visit the probation officer weekly or at longer intervals. Some of the steps now being taken should be incorporated into legislation. There is no coherent code in the context of sentencing.  The fines the courts may impose have long since become meaningless because of inflation.  There is need for legislation dealing in a coherent and comprehensive way with the sentences courts may impose.  There is need to increase considerably the amount imposed by way of financial bond.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the possibility in some instances of parents being required to pay fines imposed on juvenile offenders.  I agree with that.  That is a penalty the Minister might consider.  At the moment parents may be so required but the amount is derisory, so derisory as to be irrelevant, and so the power is no longer used by the courts.  The law in relation to the probation service is long out of date and under grave need of reform.  There are many things now provided by the probation welfare service which have no statutory basis.  There is <Col N="316" /> need for comprehensive legislation. Supervision is operated on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  According to the 1981 report something in the region of 50 per cent or 60 per cent of offenders sentenced are sentenced to six months or less.  The ordinary type of probation service, under which such offenders see the probation officer once every couple of weeks is not appropriate, and it does not provide protection for the community.  Neither does it assist the offender in integrating into normal social life or put some pressure on him to get out of his involvement in criminality. Should not the courts have power to order that a form of intensive supervision such as now operates for offenders who have served some portion of their prison sentence be imposed?</P>
    <P>We have also within our criminal justice system moved away from something that many centuries ago was part and parcel of it.  It was very much part of the Irish criminal law system that if a wrong was committed &mdash; here one looks at the Brehon Laws rather than across the water to English law which we ape regularly &mdash; that some form of reparation or compensation was paid or made to the victim of the crime.  We need to refocus on the victims, particularly of some of the assaults that take place as well as other types of crime.  I would like the courts to have far greater powers not simply to send people to prison or order them to pay fines to the State but to order offenders to pay a form of compensation to the victims of the crimes for which they are convicted.  This would to some extent restore the faith of the general public in the criminal justice system and concrete examples would be seen of people convicted of crimes paying back to the victims of crimes some form of damages for the injuries suffered.  This area has not been fully and properly dealt with in our criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>In the context of the short term of imprisonment being imposed we should look at another possibility.  The major disincentive or deterrent in the context of the prison system is the fact that somebody is deprived of liberty or certainly of free time.  At present many people convicted of criminal offences are in employment <Col N="317" /> at the time they are convicted.  They are sentenced to terms of imprisonment and their families then become dependent on the State immediately.  Large sums of money are being paid out by way of prisoner's wife's allowance and allowances for children to the families of offenders sentenced to terms of imprisonment. I am not suggesting that this money should not be paid out. Obviously, the families should not suffer, but there is a case to be made for a different form of prison sentence whereby somebody is sentenced, for example, to every weekend for a period of six months and then would be obliged to appear at a prison, perhaps in Dublin, on Friday evening and remain there until Monday morning.  That equally would have a deterrent effect.  It would mean that if a person was in employment he would maintain his employment and his family would not become dependent on the State.  He would be deprived of his liberty and free time in a way that would be perceived, certainly by the offender, as undesirable to him.  It would benefit the community and save the State money. Clearly a form of sentence of that nature would have to carry the proviso that if it was not properly being complied with the offender would be sentenced to a term of imprisonment <i>simpliciter</i>, uninterrupted. This form of imprisonment is being used in a number of states in the US in relation to certain types of offenders and it is proving successful as an option.  I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat what has been said by many other speakers but I urge on the Minister that he look at other aspects of sentencing.  There is a need for research into sentencing and its effects and to develop a coherent policy in this regard.  There is a very real need for uniformity of approach in our criminal justice system.  We had a debate in this House some weeks ago on what has become known as the Fairview case.  The judge in that case has been subject to a good deal of criticism.  As somebody still new to this House, I believe that this House and successive Governments have to a great extent abrogated their responsibility in this area by not at any stage <Col N="318" /> undertaking a comprehensive review of the criminal justice system, by never articulating any real policy of philosophy, by never at any stage passing legislation of any nature to ensure some overall monitoring by an independent body of the whole workings of the criminal justice system, and, most of all, by doing nothing to ensure that in any of the courts there is any uniformity in sentencing.</P>
    <P>All Members of this House recognise as essential that the independence of the Judiciary be preserved, but there is a role for legislation to ensure some form of uniformity in sentencing and to providing for a twice-yearly meeting of all members of the Judiciary to discuss sentencing. Some from of statutory obligation should be imposed on the Judiciary themselves to exchange information about sentencing and to develop some form of coherence and uniformity in the type of sentences passed.  Sentences on offenders vary widely from court to court, from judge to judge, within individual court jurisdictions such as the District Court and between courts such as the District Court, the Circuit Court and the Central Criminal Court.  This House has failed in its obligation to deal with this area.  A judge who makes a decision that appears incomprehensible to many people outside the court case is an easy target for criticism, but Members of this House have not always fulfilled their duties as legislators in this area, although they are always extremely quick to use problems of crime as good script material for getting publicity in the media.</P>
    <P>In concluding, I welcome the publication of this Bill.  I am sorry that some Deputies seem to regard it as some form of easy option for criminals.  It is not. Community service certainly involves a form of punishment in that regular attendance at placements where offenders are doing community service deprive them of free use of their leisure time.  It is hoped that in some instances it will have a rehabilitative effect.  This has proved to be the case elsewhere, but I do not over-emphasise that.  It also contains an indirect element of reparation in that the unpaid work which an offender does would benefit the community in genral <Col N="319" /> as well as specific areas within the community.  It enables a person sentenced to a term of community service to do something else that is desirable also, that is, to retain his job.  With the enormous unemployment problem that we have at the moment, when 200,000 people on the unemployment register are unable to find employment, it is virtually impossible for an offender who has served a term of imprisonment to find employment.  I am not saying that offenders should get any special privilege and be treated in any way better than the vast majority of people who never become involved in crime and never commit offences.  The difficulty with an offender is that if he is released from prison and has no job and very little or no real income the danger that he will go back to prison again after committing other offences is great.</P>
    <P>There is a need for us to redefine our objectives within our criminal justice system and the goals of the achievements intended by tems of imprisonment, to introduce new sentences, and in this context the community service order procedure which will operate under this legislation is one step along the road towards providing a new sentencing power to our courts, but it is only one step and I look forward to seeing what other remedies and forms of sentences the Minister will introduce in his term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> This has been a long and wide-ranging debate and I would like to thank all the Deputies who contributed. I thank Deputy Shatter for many of the ideas he put forward as alternative sanctions to the courts and I will examine the ideas he put forward.  A Bill along these lines was introduced as a Private Member's Bill by Deputy Shatter and he obviously has a great interest in the progress of this Bill through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies criticised this Bill as a solution to the crime problem but it was never put forward in that context.  I see it as only one instalment in a series of activities which must be taken quickly if we are to combat the very serious crime <Col N="320" /> situation facing us.  Deputy Skelly and Deputy Kelly made great play of the fact that this Bill is very similar to one pertaining in Great Britain.  The suggestion was made that it was almost a copy of the British legislation.  They have missed the point that the British took it from New Zealand, who first introduced it.  It is more appropriate that we should take the short journey and learn from British experience rather than go to New Zealand and learn from the original.  When we are examining how community service orders operate it is appropriate to study the situation in Britain because the norms of British society are closer to the norms of Irish society than any of the other countries where community service orders operate.</P>
    <P>Deputies criticised this Bill as being a soft option.  As I said when I opened this debate, I introduced this Bill for two reasons.  It gives an alternative sanction to the courts.  Instead of sending somebody to prison for a crime, if he is over 16 years of age he can be sentenced to community service work.  That gives the courts the flexibility to decide what in many cases might be a more appropriate sentence.  In many cases somebody in employment who is sentenced to prison can be punished twice for the same crime. As well as being sentenced to prison he can lose his employment.  Community services can be carried out during holiday time and at weekends.  This means that if somebody is sentenced to prison he could suffer serious side effects.</P>
    <P>Since this applies to people over 16 years of age it would be normal to expect that offenders brought before the courts and sentenced to community service work would be in full time education.  If they were to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, it would affect their education. Here, too, community service orders can be carried out during holiday periods or at weekends.  There is another benefit here.  It is not simply a case of taking the soft option.  Frequently judges faced with the dilemma of a young person doing the leaving certificate will refrain from putting him into prison because very often there is not an alternative sanction available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="321" /> These are some of the positive advantages of what we are proposing, but there are other advantages to which many Deputies referred.  We have a serious problem in our prisons at present.  On any given day it is true to say that our prisons are full.  If somebody is sentenced for a serious crime to five, six or seven years imprisonment, prison space must be found by letting out somebody who is serving a shorter period of imprisonment. This is not paroling prisoners or letting out prisoners under intensive supervision, this is simply shedding people from the system to make space for more serious offenders.</P>
    <P>In 1982 1,200 people were shed from our prisons without completing their sentences. If we had more prison space we would not have to shed, but that would involve a colossal building programme and new prisons cannot be put up overnight. Even if public money were available for the kind of prison space we need this is a long-term rather than a short-term solution.  Apart from the positive advantages of the Community Service Bill, I am saying that by keeping people out of prison and providing the courts with alternative sanctions it can reduce this problem of shedding in the prisons.  I stress that.  I am not talking about people being let out for good behaviour under the normal rules of parole or the very effective scheme of intensive supervision run by the probation and welfare section of my Department, I am talking about people being let out to make room for a more serious offender who has to be accommodated within the prison system on the day he is sentenced.  That is the crunch problem in our prisons, and that is why I have chosen this measure as the first instalment in a series of activities which I hope will go a long way to combating our present crime wave.</P>
    <P>When this Community Service Bill goes into effect it will be administered by the probation and welfare service of my Department, which will have to be extended.  It is important that I give an idea of the relative costs, especially at this time when there are many protests about taxation and the burden of taxation. <Col N="322" /> Crime costs a lot of money.  It costs the victims, the owners of property and the taxpayer, because prisoners have to be accommodated in prisons and frequently their dependants become dependent on the State while the wage earner is in prison.</P>
    <P>On the costings available to me, if the courts made 350 community service orders in the year the cost of each per week would be £36.26.  That is an estimation but it gives a general picture.  If they were to make 500 orders, it would cost £25.38 each per week; and 700 orders per year would cost £18.13 each per week.  I am saying 700 orders in the context of 1,200 people being shed from prison in 1982.  Do the Deputies know the cost of keeping somebody in prison? The average weekly cost is £424.  Those Deputies who have come here and said that this is some kind of wishy-washy liberal scheme, soft option, nothing to do with the reality of crime in the streets, are mistaken.  It is a positive measure which has worked very well in other countries.  It will give a positive sanction, an alternative sanction, to the courts to deal with the serious problem of crime. On its own merits, if there were no pressure on prison space, it would be well worth introducing as part of our legal system.</P>
    <P>Negatively it is also an important Bill because the shedding from prisons is bringing the law into disrepute.  It is dispiriting the Garda.  It is making the general public extremely anxious about the capability of our society to fight against crime.  I see this as a major first instalment in reducing pressure on prison space by putting people on community service orders who would normally be sentenced to prison, and who would be let out again in a very short time.</P>
    <P>In general, Deputies welcomed the Bill.  Some Deputies were very concerned that this was a soft option.  I have dealt with that.  Some Deputies took the view that the Bill would preclude the courts from making community service orders in respect of certain offences, particularly offences involving violence.  As it stands, the Bill excludes offences for which the law prescribes a fixed sentence.  During <Col N="323" /> the debate there were calls for mandatory sentences for particular offences.  If such a development were to take place, the community service orders could not be made in respect of these offences because mandatory offences are excluded from the Bill.</P>
    <P>As it stands, the Bill leaves a wide discretion to the courts.  It should leave this wide discretion to the courts so that the courts can judge the individual case on its merits, and decide on the appropriate case to which a community service order should be applied.  The courts will have the full facts surrounding a particular case.  They are in a better position to decide on the appropriate penalty for the individual case than we are to generalise on mandatory sentences which might not fit the circumstances of a case.</P>
    <P>Deputies wondered what work offenders would be required to do.  I can assure them that the tasks given to offenders will be worthwhile.  Naturally the courts will expect their orders to be given full and proper effect.  Although the courts will have no explicit say in the type of work which the offenders will be given, the Probation and Welfare Service, who will have the responsibility for providing the work, will be anxious to ensure that the courts will have full confidence in this new sanction.  As I said in my opening speech, I do not think it is necessary that there should be any close connection between the nature of the crime and the penalty imposed.  It would be quite appropriate, for example, where offenders are convicted of acts of vandalism that they should be required to repair the damage.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that community service orders might be appropriate for persons under 16 years of age.  I do not take that view.  I can see certain advantages in keeping youngsters under 16 years occupied, but I am not convinced that requiring them to work under court orders is the answer.  It may be that they should be required to attend some centre or other for the purpose of education or training.  That is a different matter.  The courts already have powers to require offenders to comply with a wide range of <Col N="324" /> conditions which they may include in a probation order.  In any event, we should await the introduction of the proposed Children Bill, which is being prepared currently by the Minister for Health, and not pre-judge or pre-empt that legislation by any action we might take.</P>
    <P>A Deputy raised the question of the necessity for bringing an offender back to court if he failed to carry out the work under the order and asked would that be the procedure.  The answer is yes.  Otherwise the question of whether an offender should actually serve a sentence of imprisonment would lie with the Probation and Welfare Service.  That would be totally inappropriate in our situation.  It is only proper that this function should be reserved to the courts.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that the Special Criminal Court should be allowed to make community service orders.  It was accepted that those orders would be availed of only in a trickle of cases before the court.  Apart from the fairly obvious objections, some of which were referred to in the debate, I would be reluctant to involve a civilian type service like the Probation and Welfare Service in the supervision, and possibly in the prosecution before the courts of breach of orders, of offenders who have associated with illegal organisations or other organised groups engaged in serious crime, however tenuous that association might be.  I do not think it would be appropriate for a civilian group like the Probation and Welfare Service to be involved with people sentenced in the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that the Bill might be amended on Committee Stage to delete the requirement that the offender must consent to the making of the order, section 4 (1) (b) of the Bill.  That matter can be considered on Committee Stage. I am not inclined to accept the suggestion. It is proper that it should have the consent of the offender because this would enable us to conform with international conventions to which we have subscribed.</P>
    <P>Unless the offender consented he would probably be very unco-operative. He would be unlikely to complete the <Col N="325" /> work in a satisfactory manner.  The fact that the offender consents to the order should make it easier to obtain placement for him with voluntary organisations.  If he did not consent to an order, I could see difficulties in supervision and in finding suitable work through voluntary organisations who would be reluctant to take somebody who was reluctant to do the work.  Consent is an important part of the scheme of things as proposed. Unless very strong arguments are put forward at Committee Stage which will change my mind, I intend to go ahead with that section of the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>As I said at the opening of the debate, there will be no unnecessary delay in implementing the Bill.  When the scheme is ready for implementation, the necessary resources, including staff, will be made available.  Obviously there will be teething problems in a scheme like this. It would be naive to think there would not be.  With the co-operation of various groups, including in particular the appropriate level of community involvement, I see no reason why the scheme should not prove effective.  It has proved effective in other countries, and I think it will prove effective here as well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly asked what the Garda reaction was to community service orders.  Mr. Daniel Ryan, President of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, said in his address to the annual conference on 29 March 1983 that it would be very satisfactory and very acceptable to members of the Garda Síochána if the problems of the criminal could be dealt with by advice, encouragement and schemes like the community service orders schemes.  So the approval of the President of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors is available.</P>
    <P>When the debate was under way people departed from the specific suggestions in the Bill and spoke about crime in general, and many aspects of crime.  I think I am in order in replying to some of the points made.  Deputies on all sides of the House voiced their concern about the level of crime.  I share their concern. There is no doubt that they are reflecting the feelings and anxieties of their constituents. <Col N="326" /> Tackling crime is one of the priorities of this Government.  The preservation of law and order is vital to any progress we hope to make on all fronts as a society.  The Government are fully determined to take whatever action is necessary.</P>
    <P>This is one measure which has been put forward.  I have already said publicly that I intend to have a new Criminal Justice Bill published before the end of this Dáil session.  This Criminal Justice Bill will give stronger powers to the gardaí dealing with crime.  It will also deal with the problem of offences committed while on bail.  If a new Criminal Justice Bill, which gives extra powers to the Garda, is effective, obviously the gardaí will be more successful in the detection of crime.  If they are more successful in the detection of crime more people will be sentenced by the courts to go to prison.  Our prisons are full at the moment and that situation will be aggravated certainly in the short term before the deterrent effects of the Criminal Justice Bill become apparent.  That is why it is important to see community service as a first instalment, a further sanction given to the courts to reduce the pressure on space in our prisons.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse the position taken by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána in relation to deployment of gardaí.  The Commissioner recently carried out a review of Garda deployment to take account of current needs and following that review he has arranged to have the strength of the uniformed branch augmented in the cities as far as practical.  There has been a large increase in the number of gardaí assigned to beat patrol duties and the general intention is to have an increased Garda presence in cities and towns so far as resources permit. That has been obvious in the past month.  Members of the public, especially in Dublin and the larger cities, will see many more gardaí on the beat.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I think there is massive public concentration on crime detection, with little attention given to crime prevention. The detection of crime is essential but when it gets to that stage the crime has already been committed.  There <Col N="327" /> is then the process of the courts and sentences. At that point possibly an individual has been injured, property has been damaged or destroyed and there is a long and costly process which society has to go through in retribution or in an attempt to rehabilitate the offender.  However, if crime could be prevented that would be a much better option for the individuals concerned and for society in general.</P>
    <P>I agree with the policy of the Commissioner with regard to deployment of the gardaí.  Uniformed gardaí can play a major part in the prevention of crime and high visibility of uniformed gardaí on the streets is a major deterrent.  The detective units and the plain clothes units also have a major part to play.  Gardaí on the beat can be a major deterrent to the commission of crime.  That is why I was glad that we were able to get enough finance to continue with our full recruitment campaign. The allocation for Garda recruitment will enable 700 new gardaí to be trained at Templemore from mid-summer onwards into the early part of 1984.</P>
    <P>Many of the young gardaí are assigned to cities and they work on a different rostering system.  They come to Dublin and other large cities and the urban environment is strange to them.  I endorse the deployment policy of the Commissioner who is inclined to assign to urban areas gardaí who were born and reared in city areas when they come out of Templemore and enter the front line in the fight against crime.  Obviously gardaí need leadership.  Young gardaí need the encouragement and support of people who have been in the job for a long time. They also need sergeants and that is why I am glad the Minister for Finance has authorised the appointment of 100 sergeants in 1983.  The young gardaí need the leadership of the sergeants.</P>
    <P>It is important that gardaí on the beat should have good relationships with the communities they patrol.  I know that the Gardaí, and especially the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, have been anxious that a kind of community policing be established.  The Commissioner, in response to this, to debates in this House and to submissions from the <Col N="328" /> public, recently assigned a chief superintendent and a superintendent on a full-time basis to Garda community relations work.  These officers will have overall responsibility for the co-ordination and development of Garda community relations activities and at present they are investigating ways by which such relationships might be promoted.  This is very important.</P>
    <P>There have been problems in the past in relation to Garda community relations with community groups.  Recently there have been newspaper reports that suggested vigilante groups were operating widely in the Dublin area.  I am assured by the Garda they are keeping a close watch on the situation.  They are satisfied that the reports have exaggerated the position to a great extent.  To the knowledge of the Garda there has only been a small number of incidents involving alleged vigilantes.  An assault by kneecapping allegedly carried out by a vigilante group has been investigated and the directions of the DPP are awaited.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that there can be no tolerance of vigilante groups.  There can be only one body to enforce law and order in this State and that is the Garda Síochána.  They operate within the law and by doing so provide the greatest safeguard for the rights of communities. People who take the law into their own hands are equally criminal, no matter their motive.  The only way crime will be reduced will be by the Garda Síochána and the community working together. Self-styled vigilante groups are to be deplored.  They have no part whatever in the scenario I see developing of closer community relationships between the Garda Síochána and the general public.</P>
    <P>The general intention is to encourage and promote community co-operation with the Garda Síochána in some structured way without making it too formal. In other countries a community watch system of relationship between the police and the local communities has emerged and it seems to be working reasonably successfully.  I am considering this matter. I know the Garda get co-operation from individual members of the public, but where a community rather than an <Col N="329" /> individual member becomes the victim of crime and vandalism there is need for an appropriate structure so that the community can be in a position to co-operate with the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I am laying great stress on the deployment of gardaí, of their going back on the beat and establishing close community relationships.  I am doing this in the context of the prevention of crime rather than simply the detection of crime.  If an individual garda knows people in a housing estate or in a particular street, he will be in the same situation that existed in years past in villages and towns where the local garda knew everyone.  Therefore, when a crime was committed he was in a position to form an opinion about the source of that crime and frequently was able to detect the offender very quickly.</P>
    <P>In the wider context of organisation of the Garda and general reform, the Government programme includes a commitment to set up a Garda authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> The difficulty in which I find myself is that I confined myself to the Bill when introducing its Second Stage.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I am confining myself to what has been raised.  I have been asked specifically to state the Government's position on these points, so I feel that I should do so.</P>
      <P>I referred to the point raised about the Government's intentions with regard to a police authority.  The Government programme includes a commitment to set up a Garda authority.  For a start, I want to make clear that that commitment will be honoured.  The exact type of authority which will best suit our needs has not, as yet, been finally decided.  What its areas of responsibility should be and how it should be constituted are still under consideration. These are matters which must be got right and which need to be thought out very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is required is an appropriate balance between the need for proper control and accountability on the one hand and, on the other hand, the need for the force to be able to go about its work unhindered by undue interference from any source.  One useful role which I see for the authority is that it should be able to act as a buffer to protect the force from any undue political interference.  The House should note that I am talking about undue political interference.  I must make it clear that there can be no question of handing over control of the Garda Síochána to a Garda Authority which would be independent of the Minister for Justice, the Government, or the Dáil. Any idea of responsibility for the force <Col N="331" /> being removed from elected public representatives is just not tenable in our democracy or, indeed, in any other.</P>
    <P>It is vital to come up with the proper solutions on this matter.  If and when a Garda Authority is set up it will affect the Garda Síochána for many years to come.  It is not something set up and dismantled over a short timetable. Obviously, if it is set up and the Garda will work under its ambit for many years to come, it needs to be considered very carefully.  It is under active consideration at the moment by me and my Department. However, I am ready to listen to any advice or suggestions in regard to it from Members of this House, in Government or in Opposition.  The Minister has certain statutory powers at the moment in relation to the Garda Síochána.  So have the Government and so has the Commissioner.  A Garda Authority would take over some of those powers, if set up.  Consequently, we need to examine the situation carefully within the constraints of what I have just said.</P>
    <P>The question of drugs was raised by many Deputies.  Obviously, there is great concern, shared by parents, teachers, and now by society at large about the problems of drug abuse.  The Garda authorities are giving a great deal of attention to the prevention and control of the misuse of drugs.  The drug squads are taking and will continue to take effective action against drug traffickers.  Since February 1981, intensive drug courses have been conducted at Garda headquarters for operational members of the force, with the express purpose of ensuring the greater involvement of the general membership in the drug enforcement area.  In addition, it is the policy of the Garda authorities that each member has a commitment in drug enforcement, irrespective of other duties he is normally engaged in.  Every opportunity is availed of to stress this to all members of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made at present to transfer the drug unit at Garda headquarters to Dublin Castle, in order to increase the effectiveness of the Dublin city unit.  The combined unit will <Col N="332" /> be under the direct control of a detective superintendent at Central Detective Unit, Dublin Castle.  The Garda authorities are very much aware of the increase in heroin availability in this country and take a serious view of present trends. They have reported that this is by no means a problem exclusive to this country, as heroin is becoming more widely available all over Europe.  Developments in the Middle East have influenced the situation and two other factors have influenced the domestic scene.  Firstly, there is now a very firm belief that gangs who were involved in ordinary serious crime have extended into the illicit drug scene. Secondly, there is evidence that some youths are now going straight on to heroin without going through an intermediate stage of less addictive substances.  The user of heroin will often become a pusher in order to support the habit.  As considerable sums of money are needed by addicts to procure supplies, an inevitable consequence is an increase in the general crime rate to fund the drug abuser's habit.</P>
    <P>There are good relationships between the Customs service and the Garda Síochána and between the two services they will continue to make life difficult for those who endeavour to import drugs illegally.  Customs authorities are prominent in dealing with this problem with skilled personnel for detecting illegal importation.  It is very important, however, that the community would be conscious of the growing incidence of drug abuse.  Again, relationships between the Garda and the communities are of vital importance here.</P>
    <P>There is a very important criminal dimension to the problem.  It is clear that the control of the problem requires a co-ordinated approach by several agencies. That is why recently the Government decided that a special committee of Ministers would be set up to direct and co-ordinate policy in this area.  In this area the Government have resolved that no efforts will be spared to eliminate this grave threat to our society, particularly to our young citizens.  It has reached the stage now of very serious proportions. The spin-off effects on the crime situation <Col N="333" /> in general, particularly in Dublin city and &mdash; as Deputy Woods has mentioned &mdash; in the Dublin inner city area, the situation is very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the Government's intentions in the area of law reform.  Many Deputies have raised questions which relate to the courts and the administration of the courts, which I will deal with at a later date.  In general the debate has been very wide-ranging.  It has gone through the whole gamut of crime, law and order, policing, police authorities and different forms of offences.  It shows quite clearly the great concern felt by the community at large and by the constituents of the Deputies who spoke in this House, who I have no doubt whatsoever were reflecting the views of their constituents.  I would like them to support this first instalment in an attempt to roll back the criminal influence in our society. I would say to Deputies that it is a first instalment but a very important one.  I should like the House to support it and to continue to support the measures I am bringing forward in this and the next session as further instalments in our fight against crime.</P>
    <P>I would also ask Deputies to support the Garda Síochána and, through Deputies, I would ask the community at large to support them.  They are the only force we have in our fight against crime and they deserve our support and confidence. Indeed, as they take on closer community involvement, they will be sensitive to the reactions of communities and of individuals in the communities in which they work and seek to prevent and detect crime.  Close co-operation between the Garda and local communities is vital.  It will be sought by the Garda in coming months and, I hope, will be returned by communities which see themselves under threat.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate and in a previous debate here sentencing practice in the courts has been criticised.  I am not going to reply to the points raised but, in common with many Deputies, I should like to see a more uniform sentencing practice throughout the courts.  I am sure <Col N="334" /> the courts and judges have the capacity to bring about that uniformity.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and thank Deputies for their contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a lot to say in that this is a most complex Bill and one in respect of which there is general agreement. <Col N="335" /> Indeed, it represents a consolidation of bankruptcy legislation and has taken some time to reach this stage.</P>
      <P>As we are all aware, bankruptcy is a feature of business life, perhaps one of the most unpleasant features that must be faced.  Once private individuals or partners set out to conduct business they are taking a risk.  While we are not inclined to think about the risk element, very often in some instances that risk leads to people becoming insolvent and bankrupt.</P>
      <P>This Bill attempts to organise and modernise legislation in relation to bankruptcy. Of course bankruptcy can have harrowing consequences.  I am sure we have all come across cases from time to time.  I have personally come across cases in which people have killed or shot themselves on finding themselves unable to handle the situation when they became bankrupt, could not meet their creditors, when faced with the shame of bankruptcy, when perhaps they had got themselves into a corner, did not turn to anybody at the time and instead just opted out totally.</P>
      <P>There are two sides to this question. On the other side there are the creditors who suffer in case of bankruptcy and who can in certain instances be much abused by hardened business people, or criminal people really, prepared to abuse them in that situation.  Nowadays it is not so common to have bankruptcies since over the years individuals on going into business have ensured that they provided themselves with limited liability.  The normal procedure then is to limit liability, protect the home, family and whatever personal possessions an individual may have.  We have seen from the history of events that the rigours of the law can be particularly severe.</P>
      <P>In the conduct of the business of bankruptcy it is necessary to order and arrange legislation so that a potential bankrupt and those who provide him with credit have reasonable protection provided in so far as it should go in both instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill covers both sole traders and partnerships.  It is concerned particularly with the equitable distribution of the <Col N="336" /> assets and property of a bankrupt.  Its provisions seek to distribute as equitably as possible the remaining assets.  That is perhaps its first object.  The second object is to release the bankrupt &mdash; and this is an important feature &mdash; from his debts and obligations, giving him a means whereby he can have the slate cleaned, if you like, in a formal way, allowing him to rehabilitate himself within society.  I understand that there are only of the order of 25 to 30 bankruptcies per annum nowadays, but of course in individual cases the amounts of money can be very great.  Consequently, in some cases creditors can suffer enormously.</P>
    <P>We realise that this Bill arose from work carried out as far back as 1962 when the then Minister for Justice, now Leader of our party, Deputy Haughey, set up a committee under Mr. Justice Budd to review the law in respect of the administration of bankruptcies and to make recommendations about legislation.  That committee reported in 1972.  The principal recommendations with which we are dealing here refer to preferential payments. They include one which covers wages, taxes and PRSI payments, ensuring that they will be given priority in claims.  Strangely enough, while that committee favoured abolishing that priority for reasons of equity the provisions of this Bill will ensure the retention of that priority in regard to wages, taxes and PRSI payments.  I believe that is the right thing to do especially since there is not another mechanism to deal with wages in particular.  Therefore, contrary to what that committee recommended, we are, under the provisions of this Bill, retaining the preferential payments system in respect of wages, taxes and PRSI payments.  These will continue to have priority in claims.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the minimum amount of an individual creditor's debts in bankruptcy petition is being raised from £40 to £500. This is a most reasonable measure because to petition in bankruptcy on the basis of a figure of £40 is not realistic. Indeed, I believe it has been done repeatedly in the case of a particular bank by one of its creditors who felt aggrieved and kept petitioning for a sum of that <Col N="337" /> order.  This tidying up is timely and the increased figure would appear to be a suitable one at this stage.</P>
    <P>When we talk about bankruptcies normally we assume that there are assets to distribute.  Sometimes people have the notion that there are very great assets, but when it comes down to their examination it is found that in present-day terms their value is not as great as may have been thought.  In many cases nowadays we find that the assets are very slim and may just consist of rented accommodation like offices.  If it is a service business there may just be an office and equipment leased and there may be very little by way of assets to provide even for wages and PRSI.  It is important to provide protection for employees in situations like that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour should consider the 1980 EEC directive which relates to providing protection for employees in the case of bankruptcy.  I understand this directive may be brought in fairly soon and under it employees' wages, salaries, holiday pay and pension contributions, which are due to private pension schemes, would be included in an extended redundancy fund.  The redundancy fund concept would apply in the case of employees where bankruptcy is involved.  This would be a very worthwhile development.  It is very important nowadays, since, in the event of a bankruptcy, assets in many instances may not be very great and in service companies and other such companies, may only consist of leased assets and there may be very little to cover the employees, especially if there are pension contributions involved for private pension schemes.  I urge, in conjunction with this Bill going through, that this directive be implemented and that the long promised Bill be brought in to ensure this protection for employees in the case of bankruptcy. If that protection is there then some of the measures in relation to priorities in the event of bankruptcy, the preferential payments, would not be as necessary.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill, which is due to come up for debate tomorrow, has a section in it which will make directors responsible for PRSI and PAYE payments.  It is interesting <Col N="338" /> to note, in conjunction with the Bankruptcy Bill, that in the case of potential bankruptcies, directors of companies will be liable under this new Bill.  What will the position of directors be in the case of companies like Waterford Glass if they are individually liable for PAYE and PRSI?  I understand they would be liable under section 83 for the maximum penalty of £10,000 and five years in jail. In the heel of the hunt we might find individuals who are directors of other companies becoming bankrupt because of their liability in that event.  They would need to watch that PAYE and PRSI were paid in time because the repercussions would be fairly serious for them.</P>
    <P>That presumably would also apply to worker directors and the less pecunious board members who might be involved. The liability which would be incurred there could be substantial for them.</P>
    <P>This Bill is essentially a consolidation Bill.  It is a very extensive one with many sections in it.  It brings together all this legislation and updates the language.  I would like to congratulate the staff involved in what must have been a very tedious job.  I was involved in updating the social welfare legislation which was quite a big undertaking.  The work done by the civil servants involved was extremely precise and valuable.  It must have been very tedious for them because of the great detail which had to be covered.  We are dealing with a fairly similar Bill here which has many provisions in it.  This is a very technical and specialised Bill.  I suggest it is a very suitable Bill to refer to a special committee. This would mean that too much time would not be taken up in the House with the detail involved in it, secondly, it is the kind of Bill particularly suitable to have the Committee Stage discussed in a special committee but, most important, in going through the Bill in a committee it is possible to get a concurrence of ideas with the officials present, which can be very valuable in finalising any of the smaller points in the Bill.  I found that very helpful and I believe all the members of the committee who dealt with the Consolidation Bill on Social Welfare found that process very helpful because the <Col N="339" /> officials were present to give views on why exactly particular measures were taken at particular stages.  I suggest that this Bill might be removed from the floor of the House for Committee Stage and dealt with in a special committee.  The Special Committee on Consolidation Bills is supposed to be standing at the moment.  I do not know what has happened it since the change of Government but I am sure that can be overcome fairly quickly.  As far as the Committee Stage is concerned I will certainly give the Minister every assistance in getting the Bill through that stage as quickly as possible.</P>

It is an Act to consolidate the legislation and this is long overdue.  I understand the previous one was in 1860 and there was another Act going back to the sixteenth century.  It also specifies procedures whereby bankruptcy will proceed more expeditiously.  We look forward to this and we are happy to give our support to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main criticism I have in relation to the Bill is that one could reasonably argue that it does not get the balance right between the protection of commerce and good trading on the one hand and fairness to the individual on the other.  This is suggested particularly in relation to section 7, which creates two new Acts on bankruptcy.  One of these proposed new Acts is somewhat unfair and that is why I am raising it this evening.  When the debtor's goods are seized by the sheriff and where there is a return of no goods made by the sheriff on foot of the execution order, a creditor will be proceeding against the individual to make him a bankrupt where the creditor has already <Col N="340" /> obtained a judgment against him in court and where he has sent an execution order to the sheriff on foot of that judgment. In such circumstances, there are at least five options open to the creditor, other than the bankruptcy route, which should be the last resort.</P>
    <P>The options are to send the execution order to the sheriff again, to threaten publication of the judgment by way of registering the judgment and having it appear in <i>Stubbs Gazette,</i> to proceed in the District Court by way of enforcement, to proceed in the High Court by way of a guarantee order whereby the creditor would seek to attach moneys which might be due to the debtor bankrupt from a third party in satisfaction of the debt due to the creditor and to secure the amount of the judgment by way of a judgment mortgage against the property of the debtor bankrupt.  On balance, it is unfair to the individual debtor that the mere act of the sheriff seizing his goods on foot of a judgment of the sheriff making a return of no goods should be an act of bankruptcy.  This effectively means that the creditor does not have to go through the due process of bankruptcy in these circumstances.  This process should be lengthened to two months after the judgment has been obtained against the debtor and with liberty for the creditor to apply to the court to abridge the time of the bankruptcy proceedings in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill should be deleted as inequitable and unfair.  Perhaps, as Deputy Woods suggested, that matter might be considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I should like to pay tribute to the work of the Bankruptcy Law Committee which was set up in August 1962 and submitted its report in March 1972.  The process which we are proceeding with today began 21 years ago and I am sure the officials who have been working on it will be very happy if we proceed to Committee Stage and get this necessary legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During that period the committee held 102 meetings and, in addition, a sub-committee <Col N="341" /> consisting of various members held 141 meetings to deal with matters of special complexity.  In 1964 an interim report, which dealt with certain aspects of bankruptcy administration, as well as with the winding up in bankruptcy of insolvent estates of deceased persons, was submitted to the Minister for Justice. Their recommendations were superseded by those in the 1972 report which represents a most comprehensive analysis of practically every aspect of the law and practice of bankruptcy.  It indicates the enormous amount of work and research which the committee devoted to this very complex and technical branch of the law.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, work on this Bill was completed before I took office as Minister for Justice and I should like to record my acknowledgment of the work of my predecessors in bringing this very important legislation before the House. One might wonder why it has taken so long, but on our entry into the EEC, we had to make our bankruptcy laws compatible with those of other EEC countries. Even though the report came out in 1972, there was a necessary delay until that position was established.  I think the present Leader of the Opposition initiated the process in 1962.  I hope we can have it passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas and into the Statute Books as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am glad the House is agreeable, in general terms, to my suggestion that Committee Stage should be entrusted to a special committee.  As the Deputies observed, this is a technical Bill in which detailed comment would perhaps be more appropriate on Committee Stage. For that reason, I do not propose to go through all the points raised by Deputies but I will mention a few.  I agree with Deputy Lenihan when he spoke about the undesirability of repeated adjournments to show cause and the resulting delays.  However, we are talking here about the exercise by the High Court of their equitable jurisdiction and it is questionable if any substantial restrictions could be placed on it by the Legislature. Obviously, there will be a great variety of individual circumstances in which it might be unjust to advertise the adjudication <Col N="342" /> of a trader and to compel him to cease carrying on his business.  For example, it could cause disproportionate hardship to third parties such as employees. It seems only right that it should be left to a judge to decide where the interests of justice lie.  The extra-statutory procedure has the advantage of protecting the bankrupt from the full effects of the bankruptcy procedure and of expediting his rehabilitation.  It can also be of benefit to creditors who may receive better dividends and have their claims settled more speedily than if the estates were administered in bankruptcy.  The Bill ensures that the court, in deciding to adjourn a show cause case, will be specifically required to have regard to the interest not only of the bankrupt but also of persons, especially creditors, who might be unaware of the insolvency of the person made bankrupt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mervyn Taylor expressed disappointment at the fact that the Bill does not contain a radical review of bankruptcy law.  It is important to emphasise that this Bill is concerned with the modernisation and reform of bankruptcy law, that is the law governing individual insolvency.  It does not purport to embrace, as is proposed in other jurisdictions, the unification and harmonisation of the entire area of insolvency law, individual as well as corporate.  It is a bankruptcy Bill, not an insolvency Bill.</P>
    <P>I share the view held by many people in legal and commercial circles that serious consideration should be given to a unified insolvency system in the not too distant future, perhaps when the draft EEC bankruptcy convention, which is at present being negotiated at council level, comes into operation.  Meanwhile the Bill will bring bankruptcy law up to date and align it, as far as possible, with the corresponding company law.  This should, in due course, facilitate the unification of the system when an appropriate time for such a step occurs.  I agree with Deputy Taylor that the system should be made cheaper, quicker and more efficient.  The Bill is expressly framed to attain this objective.  The suggestion to have the system removed from the High Court to the District Court would be very difficult <Col N="343" /> to implement.  The law is too complex and needs someone like an official assignee, who is an expert in solvency administration, to realise and distribute the assets.  Nowadays the amounts involved are frequently huge and it is more appropriate that they should be dealt with in the higher court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor referred to two other matters which were of concern to most Deputies who spoke.  The first point was that the Bill should provide a procedure which would enable a debtor to come to an arrangement with his creditors so as to avoid the indignity of bankruptcy, which should be reserved for fraudulent or dishonest debtors.  It is a fact that the procedure for debtors to come to an arrangement under the control of the court with their creditors and so avoid bankruptcy, has not been availed of because the fees involved are too high. The committee recommend that they be reduced in order to encourage debtors to seek protection and I intend to give serious consideration to this recommendation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor said that the family home should receive particular attention in the administration of the bankrupt's property.  As the House knows, I am at present considering legislation in relation to matrimonial property, the family home and the household chattels, which will enable most spouses to establish a claim to a share of that property, whether or not the spouse in question has made a financial contribution.  It will operate on the basis of a strong legal presumption of joint ownership.  That will substantially meet Deputy Taylor's point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richard Bruton expressed approval of the Cork committee's recommendation relating to the appointment of administrators who would have power to carry on the business of the debtor with a view to maintaining it or selling it as a going concern.  It is quite obvious that many Deputies would share this objective.  It appears that the new procedure was recommended primarily for corporate insolvencies and only where there was a business of sufficient substance to justify the expense of an <Col N="344" /> administrator and where there was a real prospect of returning to profitability or selling it as a going concern.  At present and under this Bill the official assignee has no power to carry on the business of the bankrupt, but a receiver or manager may be appointed with a view to selling it as a going concern.  Moreover, the whole point of granting adjournments and show cause applications is to allow the bankrupt to continue trading and so hopefully to get him out of his difficulties by reaching an arrangement or composition with his creditors.  In addition the Bill retains and streamlines the existing system of compositions after bankruptcy whereby the bankrupt can obtain a stay on the realisation of his property so as to enable him to enter into a composition with his creditors.  In this instance he is allowed to continue trading&mdash;again meeting the point raised by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy also suggested that ordinary creditors should have access to a greater proportion of the estate.  I sympathise with the dissatisfaction felt by Deputies at the system of preferential payments but the crux of the matter is that bankruptcy law cannot differ in this respect from company law.  One of the main objects of the Bill is to align as far as possible these branches of the law and in particular these preferential payments. The preferential status granted to wages and salaries, revenue debts and social welfare contributions is a fact of modern life.  The draft EEC Bankruptcy Convention to which I have referred recognises it and its relevant provisions are framed on that basis.  To align this Bill with existing company law and to align it with what quite probably will come from the EEC Bankruptcy Convention it is necessary to proceed in this fashion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan suggested that the word &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo; should be deleted from our law and replaced by the word &ldquo;insolvent&rdquo;.  I regret that any attempt to do this would lead to major difficulty. People who are in fact solvent are very often adjudicated bankrupt because they have neglected to pay a debt or simply refused to pay it.  Insolvency is not a prerequisite to being adjudicated bankrupt. <Col N="345" /> There will always be people, be they be called bankrupts or insolvents, who are in financial trouble through no fault of their own and others who are in trouble through fraudulent dealings or transactions.  There is no definitive way of establishing before adjudication whether one falls into one category or the other. Consequently it would be very difficult to meet the Deputy's point.  The term &ldquo;insolvent&rdquo;, if we simply talk of the semantics of it, would very quickly become as derogatory as the word &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo; as soon as the public realised that the notices in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> and the press had the same effect as advertisements of bankruptcy at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan and some other Deputies emphasised the importance of distinguishing between honest and fraudulent debtors.  The Bill takes a step in this direction in Part IV, where the new provisions governing arrangements under the control of the court extend the circumstances in which arranging debtors may be adjudicated bankrupt &mdash; section 105 &mdash; and also in Part IV which modernises the law relating to bankruptcy offences. A number of offences are created and heavy penalties are imposed on those who before or after adjudication commit them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan had a suggestion that bankruptcy administration should be localised.  It is difficult to disagree with this principle.  However in practice decentralisation would be difficult to justify. The total number of bankruptcies is comparatively small.  The committee recommended the abolition of the Cork local bankruptcy court and that was primarily because its services are very rarely availed of.  To localise something which is reasonably rare in our community would not have any advantage and can be dealt with much more expeditiously on a centralised basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan talked of an effort being made to sort things out before a person is driven into bankruptcy.  The show cause procedure that has developed in recent times does give people who have been adjudicated an opportunity to get themselves out of trouble and while this procedure is pending there will be no <Col N="346" /> advertisement in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of the fact that the debtor has become bankrupt.  All the debtor has to do is apply to the court to show cause against the adjudication in bankruptcy.  The court has full discretion to adjourn the case to give the debtor a chance to rehabilitate himself financially.</P>
    <P>Creditors have rights, too, and section 16 (2) of the Bill imposes on the court a specific duty to have regard not only to the bankrupt's interest but also to those of his creditors and anyone else who might give him credit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bernard Allen expressed disagreement with provisions relating to preferential payments, in particular with the position which allows a preferential creditor to force a person into bankruptcy. I have already mentioned the difficulty which would arise if different provisions existed in bankruptcy law from those prevailing in company law.  As regards the figure of £2,500 in respect of wages and salaries, this is identical to that agreed to by this House when passing the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982.  It is absolutely essential that the two are compatible.</P>
    <P>Section 81 of the Bill is designed to bring preferential payments in bankruptcy and the winding up of companies into accord.  So far as wages and salaries are concerned, the ceilings suggested in the Bill and the Companies (Amendment) Act will in all probability be a matter of further discussion by the House when the legislation giving effect to the EEC directive on the protection of employees and the insolvency of their employer comes before the House later in the year.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful to Deputy Woods for his indication of co-operation in processing this very important piece of legislation. I was delighted to hear him compliment the staff involved.  The staff of the Department and their predecessors have done an enormous amount of work in this area.  As the report was commissioned back in the 1962, obviously frustration might have grown among the people involved, who might have wondered if the fruits of their labour would ever see legislative light.  I endorse everything Deputy Woods said.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> Deputy Flynn raised an interesting point and we will be prepared to discuss it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to get the agreement of the House to this Second Stage.  I think there is general agreement that the Committee Stage would be taken by a Committee of the House, so the way to proceed would probably be to agree to the Second Stage now and we can make the arrangements for the Committee later.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputies may recall that at the end of May last year the House passed the Companies (Amendment) Act 1982 which was a short measure to improve the facilities and information available to the business community at the Companies Registration Office, to make some necessary revisions and to up-date the fines and some other figures in the Companies Act 1963.  That was the first measure in a planned programme of legislation to reform company law which I intend to continue and which will consist of a series of amending Bills.  The Bill before the House today is the second measure in that series and it is designed to amend and extend the Companies Acts 1963 to 1982 to give effect to the EEC Second Directive on company law and certain related matters.  That directive is concerned with the formation of public limited companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Companies Act 1963 is the basic statute governing the operations of different classes of companies in Ireland and prior to the short 1982 Act it was only amended twice in its 20 years' existence. The first change was by way of regulations in 1973 which gave effect to the First EEC Directive on company law which was concerned with the publication of documents and certain other information about various classes of companies.  Subsequently, the Companies (Amendment) <Col N="348" /> Act 1977 dealt with the transfer of title to securities on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>I would like to impress upon the House that the Bill before it today is an urgent matter.  Some Deputies will probably be aware that the EEC Commission brought Ireland before the European Court of Justice for failure to implement the Second Directive by the appointed date, December 1978.  On this point it is very relevant to mention that five other member states were brought before the court on the same charge.  The court in a judgment last October ordered that, as we had failed to fulfil our obligations under the Treaty of Rome, Ireland should pay the costs.  Incidentally similar judgments were handed down in respect of three of the other member states, the remaining two having recently introduced appropriate legislation.  It is worth pointing out even at this stage that the necessity for the proceedings demonstrated that the requirements of the directive turned out to be rather more complicated than was at first realised and called for complex adjustments of legislation.  Deputies will recognise that some of the member states involved have administrations and resources much greater than ours and yet the Bill which we have to produce as a consequence of the Directive is not any less complex than theirs.  It was really no surprise, therefore, that we took as long as those larger administrations to bring about the necessary changes in our legislation.</P>
    <P>It is relevant, in relation to the court proceedings, to tell Deputies a little about the EEC approach on company law matters.  The fact is that the Commission has made company law an area where there has been a very large number of EEC initiatives.  Eight directives, including that which dictates the Bill before the House today, have already been adopted and must be translated into Irish law.  There are various other proposals at different stages in the EEC negotiating process.  These put a considerable strain on the limited resources of my Department which must analyse and discuss them, and service a variety of meetings in Brussels in connection with them.  In general, the EEC approach is <Col N="349" /> one which seeks harmonisation in relation to different aspects of company law and sets out principles about those aspects to be included in an appropriate form in its laws by each member state. To put it another way, the complexity of the subject of company law accounts for the very big number of EEC initiatives.</P>
    <P>Outstanding among the directives already adopted as far as Members of this House will be concerned is the Fourth Directive which deals with the content, format, presentation and publication of the accounts of both public and private limited companies.  I can inform Deputies that work is proceeding on the implementing Bill and I intend to have it before the House later in the current year.</P>
    <P>Of more immediate interest to Deputies, I imagine, is another stage of the programme on companies legislation, which I have already mentioned.  This is another new measure designed to prevent or eliminate abuses and evasion of responsibilities in the operation of limited liability companies.  I can assure the House that, in accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government, work is drawing to a close on the drafting of a Bill which will strengthen some of the existing provisions of the Companies Act 1963 and introduce new measures the objective of which is to eliminate, deter or penalise the abuses and malpractices which are occuring all too frequently in the direction and management of companies.</P>
    <P>I think that it is as well for me to explain my intention with that measure in clear and simple terms.  I am going to spare no effort to try to put an end to the activities of fly-by-night operators in various sectors who make a mockery of the privilege of limited liability.  These are the people who deliberately close down one company leaving substantial debts to creditors and employees and form another company to repeat the same process again, perhaps more than once.  It is not relevant to the Bill before us today to go any further than to say that in the proposed measure to combat abuse I will be seeking among other weapons to increase dramatically the penalties in company <Col N="350" /> law as a whole and to pitch them at the highest level that can be imposed by law.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the detailed contents of the Bill now before the House I would like to ask Deputies to bear in mind one fundamental factor when they are examining it.  The principles of the Second EEC Directive have been discussed at length, have come through the administrative process of the EEC and have been adopted some years ago.  Consequently they are not negotiable at this stage. Therefore most of the provisions in the Bill are not negotiable either.</P>
    <P>The objective of the directive and, consequently, of this Bill is the protection of the interests of both shareholders and creditors in relation to the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance, increase or reduction of their capital.  While there is only slight reference to employess in the directive and in the Bill it is quite clear to me that the proper conduct of such companies in relation to their capital cannot but redound to the benefit of employees.  If public limited companies thrive and prosper then the position and interests of the employees are obviously secured.  The Bill is divided into six parts and most of the provisions of the directive are given force in Parts II, III and IV.  The remaining parts deal with ancillary matters and companies changing between limited and unlimited status.</P>
    <P>The directive calls for the creation of a new entity called a &ldquo;public limited company&rdquo; and attaches special requirements to it.  The new type of company is separately defined in section 2 of the Bill.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, in a report in 1978, recommended that the definition of a private company as in the 1963 Act should be maintained.  That recommendation has been accepted so that the definition in section 33 of the Companies Act 1963 will continue to hold for private companies. In summary, this is that a private company must:&mdash; have a share capital; restrict the right to transfer its shares; limit the number of members; and prohibit any invitation to the public to subscribe for shares.  It is important to leave <Col N="351" /> that definition stand because the private company so defined has long been the dominant vehicle for business activity in this country.</P>
    <P>The significance of private companies in the economy is best illustrated by the fact that in December 1982 there were about 69,000 private companies and 340 public companies registered at the Companies Registration Office.  The measures in the directive apply only to public companies limited by shares and public companies limited by guarantee and having a share capital and as there are only two or three of the latter type I am discontinuing any further registrations of them. The effect therefore is that with certain exceptions, to which I shall refer in relation to Parts III and IV, the Bill will have greatest impact on the 340 existing public companies which, as I shall explain, must change from their existing status.  It will also apply, of course, to any new public limited companies.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill implements the requirements of the directive as to the name and registration procedures for new public limited companies.  These are that:&mdash; the name of a public limited company should distinguish it from other types of company; the memorandum of such a company must state that it is a public limited company; and the allotted share capital of a public limited company must not be less than a specified minimum and must be paid up as to, at least, 25 per cent of the nominal value of the shares and all of any premium on them.</P>
    <P>To meet those requirements I am providing for the designation &ldquo;public limited company&rdquo; or its abbreviation &ldquo;p. l. c.&rdquo; or the Irish equivalent of these so that an incidental outcome as far as public companies are concerned is that the old identification of &ldquo;and company limited&rdquo; will be replaced by &ldquo;public limited company&rdquo;. However, private limited companies will continue to use the well recognised &ldquo;and Co. Ltd.&rdquo;.  I am providing, in section 19, for an authorised minimum share capital of £30,000 for public limited companies.  This figure takes account of all relevant considerations &mdash; and I shall touch on these later &mdash; and is, incidentally, <Col N="352" /> almost double the £16,000 required by the directive.</P>
    <P>Part II also sets out the re-registration requirements for any company wishing to change from its existing status to that of a public limited company.  Predictably, the key requirements imposed by the directive for changes are that such companies must meet the criteria as to name, authorised minimum capital and the payment up of the shares.  The main focus in this area is on the 340 existing public companies limited by shares, or limited by guarantee and having a share capital, which are defined as &ldquo;old public limited companies&rdquo;.  These companies, if they wish to retain their present status, must re-register as public limited companies within fifteen months of the appointed day and to the extent that they do not have the £30,000 authorised minimum capital they will have three years within which to bring their capital up to that level.  Alternatively, they may be re-registered as some other form of company.</P>
    <P>Part II also provides that private companies, as they may under existing legislation, may become public companies but if they wish to re-register as public limited companies in the new form they will have to comply with the requirements as to name, capital and payment up of shares. There is also provision in this part for a public limited company to change its status in the opposite direction, so to speak, and to re-register as a private company. If it does so it will, of course, have to meet the requirements of the definition of a private company to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill implements the provisions of the directive in relation to the share capital of public limited companies. Requirements are set out as to the issue of and payment for share capital, the maintenance of share capital, the rights of existing shareholders on the occasion of the issue of further shares in the company and the variation and registration of class rights attaching to shares.  Part IV deals with distribution of profits.  I have already mentioned that the second directive applies only to public limited companies. However, many ideas of the directive in relation to the share capital <Col N="353" /> and profits of a public limited company simply reinforce existing practice or have for some time been recognised as desirable for the proper conduct of companies generally.</P>
    <P>Therefore, and though there is no obligation to do so, I consider it appropriate, in the interests of the development of company law generally, to apply some of the provisions of Parts III and IV to private companies.  In doing this I am adopting the recommendations of various interested professional bodies who have made representations on the matter. In my approach I have been careful to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the desirability of developing proper commercial practice which would result in some benefits for members, employees, creditors and the business public generally and, on the other, the need to avoid imposing unnecessary and fruitless burdens on private companies which have a very significant role on the Irish business scene and provide considerable employment.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer again to the idea of an authorised minimum share capital for public limited companies which is dealt with in Part III of the Bill.  This figure is somewhat above the minimum requirements of the directive but, since the underlying principle is that small enterprises ought not seek to become public companies and that such companies should not be allowed to commence business without some semblance of financial viability, it would not be appropriate to fix a lower figure.  On the other hand when settling this figure it is necessary to consider the effect on existing public companies as well as on any new public limited companies which might be formed in the future.</P>
    <P>About 30 per cent of existing public companies have an authorised capital below £30,000 so that if they are to re-register as public limited companies in accordance with section 12 they must increase the capital and the amount of it that is paid up to comply with that section. The procurement of this amount may prove to be a difficulty for some of those companies whose capital is small and this is why I have taken advantage of an <Col N="354" /> option offered by the directive whereby old public limited companies may be given three years in which to attain the authorised minimum capital set.  Alternatively, they may re-register as another form of company.  I would ask the Deputies to note that section 19 enables the Minister to increase the authorised minimum capital by order.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision, new to Irish law, that directors of a company may not allot shares unless they are authorised to do so by the articles of association or by the company in general meetings.  Such an authority must state the maximum amount of shares involved and the duration of the authority given, which may be for a period of up to five years but can be revoked, varied or renewed.  This kind of control on the directors' issuing the shares has been mooted for some time. It should be to the advantage of shareholders in private as well as in public limited companies in so far as it should prevent directors making an offer to issue shares to some members of the company or even outsiders on terms below market value which offer, if taken up, would result in the value of the holdings of the remaining members being reduced.</P>
    <P>The application of pre-emption rights, which are the rights of first refusal when the capital of a company is being increased by a new issue of shares for cash, is not a new idea in this country as it is a requirement for those public companies which are quoted on the Stock Exchange.  It is an innovation, however, to have them provided for in companies legislation and the relevant provisions in this Bill apply to both private and public limited companies.  Those provisions set down the principle that such shares must first be offered to existing shareholders in proportion to the nominal value of shares already held by them.  These provisions will have the effect of safeguarding the interests of all the existing shareholders against any allotments which might change control of the company or damage their relative position in the company as represented by their holdings.</P>
    <P>Provisions, imposed by the directive and included in Part III, that shares may not be issued at a discount and must be <Col N="355" /> paid for in money or money's worth represent what is, in practice, the existing position and, therefore, they are being applied to all companies.  The directive makes it necessary, however, to impose a partial restriction on the existing position in that it specifies that an undertaking to perform work or supply services may not form part of the assets paid for the share of public limited companies. One of the innovations of the directive and, consequently, the Bill, is that, as I have already mentioned, the shares of a public limited company must be paid up as to at least 25 per cent of their nominal value and the whole of any premium on them before they are allotted.  For comparison Deputies will be interested to know that the Companies Act, 1963, requires that only 5 per cent is payable on application.  So as to encourage the participation of employees in the capital of public limited companies I am taking advantage of the option offered by the directive whereby the payment on allotment of at least 25 per cent of the nominal value of shares need not apply to shares issued in connection with employee share schemes.  The idea of employee share schemes is not, of course, new to our company law code.  Section 60 of the Companies Act, 1963, recognises the special place of such schemes by providing that financial assistance may be given by a company for the acquisition of shares in the company or its holding company to be held by its employees or the employees of a subsidiary company.  I understand that a number of Irish companies already operate share purchase or share option schemes for employees.</P>
    <P>Where shares are not paid for by cash, the directive introduces another new idea in that it requires the valuation, by an independent expert, of whatever considerations other than cash are paid for shares in a public limited company.  A further requirement is that such payment of non-cash assets for shares must be made in full within five years of the allotment. An expert's valuation is also required where a public limited company proposes to acquire non-cash assets from a subscriber to its memorandum within <Col N="356" /> two years of incorporation and the value of those assets exceeds 10 per cent of the subscribed capital.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that these provisions of the directive, which are reflected at sections 29 to 33 of the Bill, represent a serious attempt to get an objective assessment of the proper value of non-cash assets transferred to a public limited company.  This attempt is, of course, in line with the objective of the directive to preserve the capital of the company and to provide protection for all those involved with it.</P>
    <P>Part III also includes provisions preventing companies from acquiring their own shares either directly or through nominees.  At present there are provisions in section 60 of the 1963 Act which enable a company to provide financial assistance in certain special circumstances for the purchase of its own shares and while the directive requires the amendment of those provisions so that they will no longer apply to public limited companies, that section will remain in force for private companies.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the special attention of the House to the provision at section 40 of the Bill which requires that where it becomes known to any director of a company that there is a serious loss of the subscribed capital he must arrange for an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders to be held to consider what measures should be taken to deal with the situation.  I need hardly remind Deputies that in the present difficult economic situation there is an increasing number of company failures and it is now widely accepted by persons such as liquidators, receivers and financial bodies closely involved in such matters that almost all of these failures have a common factor, which is that company directors and managers do not take appropriate action when financial difficulties begin to appear on the horizon.  I believe Deputies will agree that this provision should be applied to all companies if only to encourage those concerned to consider all possible courses of action which might remedy the situation with a view to avoiding the failure of the company and all the attendant adverse consequences, partic <Col N="357" /> ularly the loss of employment.  I intend to watch closely the effects of this provision as an early warning system and I am encouraging directors and shareholders to do likewise by the amendment, made in the Seanad, of the Seventh Schedule to the 1963 Act which requires a comment by the auditors on the company's balance sheet position in relation to section 40.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill implements the requirements of the directive about distributions to shareholders, including in particular the payment of dividends. Section 45 states the basic principle that distributions may only be made from profits available for that purpose and that, in fact, represents the present position. It is in the definition of &ldquo;available profits&rdquo;, meaning a company's accumulated realised profits less its accumulated realised losses, that a change in relation to the present position is brought about. The requirement that a company may not make a distribution until accumulated losses have been made good clarifies a situation that has been in some doubt.</P>
    <P>The principles involved represent prudent accounting practice and I am accepting the recommendations of the accountancy bodies that they should be applied to all companies.  The directive imposes a further restriction on public limited companies in that they may only pay dividends where the amount of the net assets is not less than the aggregate of the called-up share capital and undistributable reserves and where the payment of the proposed distribution would not have the effect of reducing the net assets below that level.  The remainder of Part IV recognises the special position of assurance companies and investment companies in relation to those basic principles and specifies the accounts, and regulations concerning them, to which reference must be made by all companies before any distribution is contemplated.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned in relation to Part II that this Bill deals with the re-registration of companies and it is for that reason that I think it is appropriate to include provisions for companies changing between limited and unlimited status. The Companies Act, 1963, already <Col N="358" /> authorises an unlimited company to re-register as a limited company and I am merely improving that provision for the better protection of the interests of its creditors where an unlimited company re-registers as limited and, subsequently, goes into liquidation.  There is no provision in the 1963 Act to enable a limited company to re-register as unlimited.  I am making this facility available now in section 52.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned, in relation to Part II, that existing public limited companies must within a given period re-register as the new public limited company or, as an alternative, be re-registered as another form of company.  This provision provides such an alternative. Moreover, various representations requesting this facility have been made to me.  While I am providing the facility I am satisfied that a change in status from limited to unlimited is not one that will be lightly taken because such a change will require the assent of all the members of the company and will have serious consequences for all involved in that the assumption of unlimited liability means that the members will be responsible for the debts of the company to the full extent of their personal assets.</P>
    <P>On the one hand it is only right for me to signal to Deputies today that I will be introducing a number of amendments on Committee Stage and, on the other, to assure them that these are marginal and reflect reconsideration by the draftsman on one or two issues.</P>
    <P>Finally, Part VI of the Bill covers matters such as the publication requirements imposed by the directive, the use of misleading names, penalties and procedures for indictable offences, expenses and order-making arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that the complexities of the directive have called for a Bill which, Deputies will agree, is fairly complicated.  It has been formulated with care as to its consequences for existing companies and with regard to the views of various interested professional groups.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the groups concerned for their views and recommendations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> In conclusion, I need hardly remind this House that the enactment of this Bill is now a matter of urgency because of the judgment of the European Court.  I am sure that I can rely on Deputies to get it enacted with maximum speed.  Being generally dictated by the directive, the Bill itself is largely technical and, consequently, uncontroversial.  Therefore, I think it is reasonable to ask Deputies to refrain from pressing for amendments in relation to other general matters not connected with the second directive.  I am making this request on the clear understanding that I have given Deputies a guarantee that I will be introducing further stringent and comprehensive measures for the reform and up-dating of company law as soon as possible.  In those circumstances I look forward to the co-operation of Deputies in dealing with this Bill quickly and recommend it for the approval of this House.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús a chur in iúl duit go gcuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo agus is fáda atáimíd ag fanacht leis.  Tá géarghá ann leanúint ar aghaidh le reachtaíocht chun leasú a dhéanamh ar chomhlachtaí sa tír seo.</P>
      <P>In the recent past, more so than for many years previously, we have heard a considerable amount of talk about company law.  It appears to have taken on a new importance in Irish business life, and particularly Irish political life.  It is incumbent on politicians to react immediately to dealing with practices which leave a lot to be desired.  For that reason I am pleased to accommodate the Minister by giving this Bill passage through this House in the hope that he will deal with other domestic matters as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is considerable public disquiet about measures being taken by individuals and professionals in the area of company law as far as tax evasion is concerned and it is necessary to set at rest the minds of the public.  We must eliminate malpractice in all matters concerning the good and efficient running of commercial life.  The central issue attracting most comment in the media appears to <Col N="360" /> be the disclosure of information and the amount of information available to individuals and companies and the general public as to the formation and other matters relating to commercial enterprises. Many of these measures will be necessary in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I stand back from references in the media to imprisonment.  Reference to the fact that some people might be incarcerated for various offences has a very damaging effect on business in general and on the business community.  From experience I have gleaned in the recent past, it has considerable effects on boards of management of companies who have been playing their part in Irish commercial life over a long period, and who have been in no way infringing the rights and privileges granted to them by company law as framed in the 1963 Act and subsequent amending Acts which, as we all know, are based firmly on the 1948 British statute.</P>
    <P>While some people who made comments recently may have felt they were being helpful, those comments have a dangerous element attached to them.  We run the risk of creating an open season for labelling successful businessmen as crooks, or half crooks, or parasites in society, or manipulators of the system. Those are the kind of words which have been used.  They do not apply to the broad general sweep of business activity, and are inclined to create the impression that all businesses are being run in a cloak and dagger fashion, and that the likelihood of coming across a decent well-run business is remote.  That is very far from the truth.</P>
    <P>I have respect for professionals.  They operate company law as they find it.  If they find a loophole in it through which they can enhance their profit or improve their business arrangements, it is very difficult for us to find fault with them. The fault lies with us.  If the professionals can take advantage of a section or sections of company law, it is up to us, if they are acting against the common good, to introduce measures here.  I was heartened to hear the Minister saying he has other things in mind of an immediate nature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> We must always be careful not to sow the seeds of distrust between management and the factory floor.  Bad publicity somehow gives the impression to the work force that there is a different type of operation going on upstairs when, in actual fact, they are all part of the work force and should co-operate in the best interests of their business.  Some of the comments made recently were absolutely necessary and long overdue, but some of the language may have been a little intemperate.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years we spent a considerable amount of time in setting up agencies to promote enterprises, seek investment, encourage entrepreneurs and the utilisation of risk capital.  We provided the necessary framework to have the capital made available to them.</P>
    <P>We must not encourage people to go into business, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, suggest that there is some kind of bonanza to be achieved by manipulating the system or company law.  That is very far from the truth.  Comments in the media recently should not be taken as gospel.  Some of them seem to suggest that anybody who does well in business life is suspect.  That would be very dangerous, and it must be resisted.  It is incumbent on us to put the matter correctly. Nothing could be further from the truth.  The vast majority of companies are doing what they regard as being in the best interests of shareholders, owners and the work force.  If they are not, they should not be in business.  Companies with that attitude will be happy with any measures which are introduced, so long as they are fair and equitable.  That is important in all matters concerning businesses.</P>
    <P>It is important to say that we are fully in support of business.  We are fully in support of setting up companies under the regulations we lay down.  We encourage that.  Those who break ranks and manipulate the system we do not support. I am talking about manipulating the system quite apart from the professional who finds a regulation which he can utilise to his own best advantage.  He is entitled to do that and there is nothing wrong with that.  It is up to us to make the whole <Col N="362" /> system so water-tight that abuses are ruled out.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of businessmen and directors pay their taxes.  Many of them pay their taxes under the PAYE system. The general public sometimes feel that owners and directors of companies are paid in a different way, and that all the money coming in is divided in the board room.  It does not happen like that.  Most of these people are paid salaries the same as the rest of us, and they pay their PAYE.  I would like to think they all pay their just taxes, capital taxation, corporation tax, and so on.  It would be bad if the notion were to go abroad that a whole range of companies had slush funds stashed away in peculiar places, whether in accounts in far distant places or in financial institutions.  By and large that is a myth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at some of the political contributions and you wonder is it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that many of the political contributions appear in the balance sheets of the private companies. We cannot always see the finer points of that kind of thing.  If a company wish to make a contribution to a political party or parties &mdash; and many of them take the latter road rather than the former &mdash; I do not see anything wrong with that.  I would not like the idea to go abroad that companies and businesses should not support the institutions as we see them here, and that means the political parties.  The political parties frame the legislation to allow them to stay in business.  I do not see anything basically wrong with that. Anyway it is beside the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The oft-celebrated notion that slush funds of enormous magnitude are available is a myth.  Think of the hundreds of companies who have gone to the wall in the recent past.  If we are to believe the kind of statistics which are promulgated by some of the agencies promoting business, they are telling us that so many more hundreds are just there and, if there is a shift in the rate of exchange, or in the unit cost of production, if there is the slightest draught, they are out of business. That is what has happened. <Col N="363" /> Hundreds of firms go to the wall suddenly if there is a shift in international markets or trends.  It must be the last straw for any manager to see his company close down, if he has any care for his own name and that of his company, not to talk about the work force who are depending on him for a job in a situation where there may be no alternative work available.  A manager must suffer a considerable trauma when he realises his company is going out of business.  If money were available in these so-called slush funds, I am sure they would percolate out of such funds in support of the company concerned.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the number of companies who have substantial reserves is very small, and this applies to the public and private sectors.  We have gone some way towards bringing that about by eroding much of the reserves.  I would regard reserves as essential if a company is to stay in business and is to avail of modern technology and equipment.  We must be very careful in the kind of capital taxation we promote because, in trying to generate revenue in the short-term, we might be nailing closure orders on companies who may not be able to compete or reequip to stay in business.  I presume that matter can be dealt with on the Finance Bill but it has a relevance to company life in general and that is why a comment should be made on it here.</P>
    <P>In much of the adverse publicity there seems to be some campaign of envy and jealousy and this is dividing the community. It is an element I do not like.  We must do everything we can to avoid setting the self-employed against PAYE workers, setting farmers against industrialists and both of them against the other work force.  These divisions are manifesting themselves in various ways.  We should not be seen to support any section moving against another section because they consider they are being hard done by.  If I thought that marching on the streets in any town in the country would bring about a situation where I would pay less tax I would be foolish not to do it. However, that is not the reality.  If people were marching for the purpose of tax equity only&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It has a great relevance to it in that it concerns the 65,000 companies referred to in the Minister's speech who are registered with the Companies Office and who are responsible for many of the work force.  My comments might go a long way towards relieving some of the suspicion that has been aroused. Recently success in this country has been viewed with suspicion but that does not happen in other democracies.  Other countries welcome and honour the successful businessman.  We must not allow a situation to develop here where we isolate him, put him into another class and proceed to investigate him as though he were some kind of criminal.  We should encourage the businessman.  Our purpose is to promote legislation whereby he can do business and generate money.  When this happens more people are put to work, they pay their taxes and thus the social welfare system is maintained. If we have a situation where that does not happen, there will be no need for a companies registration office.  The same kind of attitude is creeping in as far as politicians are concerned and Deputy Prendergast is aware of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Just as company directors, managers and the owners of businesses are entitled to defend themselves, as a politician I also claim the right to defend myself when there is an effort being made to bring us into disrepute.</P>
      <P>The main objective of company law nowadays, which was referred to by the Minister, seems to apply to the concept of limited liability.  This has relevance to the 1963 Act and subsequent amendments. I presume that limited liability concerns the conditions for granting registration and the restrictions that may be put on access to registration.  I should like to think we would be more favourably disposed to the former rather than to the latter.</P>
      <P>The responsibility of directors is an important aspect in the whole area of limited liability, to their employees and to their shareholders.  We are concerned with the liability of directors with regard to outstanding debts, the share capital limits we would place on the companies and the restrictions that might be put on directors setting up companies when involved in liquidations or receiverships while owing tax arrears or PAYE deductions. That last item has attracted the greatest amount of attention and it is something we must deal with not just in the interests of the Revenue Commissioners but of business itself.  This is essential if the good name and standing of the vast majority of businessmen is to be maintained and until it is proved otherwise to me I will continue to believe in their good name.</P>
      <P>All companies should be obliged to prepare full accounts and to have an audit of such accounts.  There has been a certain amount of laxity in this area during the years.  Many companies do not comply with what might be expected to be a basic requirement of having the accounts made up to date and the audit prepared on time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder sometimes is it because there is reluctance on the part of management to have these things made known generally in that they might be interpreted <Col N="366" /> incorrectly or not read properly, perhaps particularly by some of their own workers.  If there were better relationships between management and the work force, company officials would be in a position to explain in clear detail precisely what the published figures mean. The reading of many of these documents, such as audited accounts, can sometimes be misleading if there is not a full knowledge of the background to some of the insertions in the accounts.  Such better understanding would relieve much of the tension between the work force and management &mdash; and they are all workers of the same company.  Sometimes the figures even at a casual glance could, given certain interpretations, lead to false hopes or expectations of moneys that would appear to be there in substantial sums but might not, in effect, in the proper reading of the thing, be there at all.</P>
    <P>There should be very strict control of unlimited companies converting to limited status, because it is a method which could and can be used for avoiding the payment of outstanding debts.  That must be carefully watched.  Full accountability is generally expected now in all walks of life, as an aspect of present day life.  In bringing about a happy situation there I would advise the Minister &mdash; and he probably would agree &mdash; to have as little interference with good established practice as possible.  Any changes might be brought about in procedure as long as the desired result is being achieved, but we need not throw out everything in the hope of getting something better.  That is not the way to achieve the best results.</P>
    <P>As far as I know &mdash; and I stand to be corrected on this &mdash; there has never been a case of fraudulent trading proven in this country.  That leads to disquiet, as it is well known, or suggested to be so, that fraudulent trading is and has been going on.  Cases may have been taken to the courts, but to my knowledge none has been proven &mdash; they would be very difficult to prove under the 1963 Act, anyway. However, an inspection of the liquidators' reports, particularly those of recent times, will show that they constantly refer to actions of directors continuing <Col N="367" /> to trade at a time when they knew that the companies were and could only continue to be insolvent.  The general public, seeing that liquidators are making these reports on a continuing basis &mdash; and with the closure of so many companies in the last couple of years it begins to mushroom &mdash; are entitled to ask why cases have not been taken against these people for fraudulent trading.  If they have, they certainly have not been highlighted or brought to a successful conclusion in the courts.  This is obviously because of something unsatisfactory in the 1963 Act and that is what the Minister must move to improve.</P>
    <P>The companies which hide behind the veil of incorporation should be made to produce annually audited accounts for public inspection.  Many companies going into liquidation have not had proper audits carried out for quite a few years. It is essential that creditors be protected by having easy and timely access to reliable financial data from customers.  These things are referred to on a continuing basis.  The Minister is quite right in his statement on Second Stage that it would be negligent of him in the light of the reports &mdash; and it is within the compass of his competence under the provisions of the Act &mdash; not to do whatever is necessary to bring about a situation where that cannot apply.</P>
    <P>I would be much happier &mdash; and I know that it is not the Minister's fault because he has given a commitment on it &mdash; if the question of dealing with the domestic problems had arisen before this one. However, this is an essential piece of legislation as well in the whole formula of dealing with the eight directives.</P>
    <P>Limited liability status should be granted only to reasonably substantialsized companies.  We are all aware of the £2 company.  Each company should have a minimum share capital, which should be disclosed.  Perhaps it should be disclosed on their headed notepaper, together with the names of their directors &mdash; maybe not.  That practice, as I understand, applies in some other jurisdictions and would be worth considering in the formulation of the new legislation which <Col N="368" /> the Minister is considering at this time. Legislation in the United Kingdom and certainly in some of the continental countries provides for considerably more information being made available by limited liability companies.  This provides better protection for the unsecured creditors. Legislation has moved ahead of us and we have been a little slow in dealing with the question of unsecured creditors. Reform is necessary in this area.  We have been talking about such reform for quite some time now and perhaps the time has come for us to move to implement it on a continuing basis.  If the amount of activity at EEC level is anything to go by, quite a sizeable proportion of their time has been given to the whole area of company law reform.</P>
    <P>While we are not the only ones tardy in implementing the directives or complying with what is regarded by all as necessary reform, at the same time the Minister will be making it his memorial in the Department in that he will have moved forward several of these directives with a view to getting them on our Statute Book.  The Minister implied that this legislation is of a complex and technical nature and is a large piece of legislation. It is aimed at translating into Irish law the provisions of the EEC Second Directive on Company Law.  That concerns the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital.</P>
    <P>In June 1981 the Commission of the European Communities complained bitterly at the failure of the Irish Government to implement this directive.  They notified their intention at that time of bringing us before the European Court. While it is no justification or excuse to say that there were five others, irrespective of the administrative size of their bureaucracies, and that we just happened to be one of them, we were brought there under Article 169 of the Treaty of Rome. The deadline for the implementation of national legislation to implement this directive, as I understand, was December 1978.</P>
    <P>It does not make the best of reading that we had to be dragged to the European Court, found guilty and that subsequently <Col N="369" /> we had to bear the costs.  We are all very conscious of costs in this Chamber.  Costs seem to be the major concern of everybody nowadays.  Taking a case to the European Court and defending it is a very costly business.  We should do everything in our power not to incur such costs as we have been incurring as far as this directive is concerned and, indeed, under threat of a whole range of other directives as well of which we are in breach and on which we have been given notice to move, or else.</P>
    <P>The aim of this second directive is to ensure minimum equivalent protection for both the shareholders and the creditors in relation to capital of public limited companies and that the law will provide for the change-over from limited to unlimited status of all companies.  Considerable activity in the EEC has been concerned with developments in company law, in regard to the harmonisation of all areas of company law.  It must be stated that we are being particularly tardy in implementing many of the directives. While I readily understand that one of the reasons &mdash; even from my very limited stay in the Department &mdash; is that the Department of Trade are under considerable pressure, we must admit that they have a very large range of responsibilities in very complex areas.  At the same time the Minister will have to seek whatever staff are required to get our company law, once and for all, into proper working order.  Certainly he will find me most accommodating if it is found necessary to do anything of a particular or unusual nature in order to bring up the staff complement to deal with that matter.  We do not want it to be believed that, because of recent pressures brought about through the recession or because of the failure of so many companies, we are now moving.  Be that as it may, a new initiative is necessary to give effect to the many directives.  While this Bill constitutes only a step in the right direction it is a necessary improvement in company law in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The second directive of the EEC which this Bill seeks to implement is concerned with securing uniform protection for investors and creditors of public limited <Col N="370" /> liability companies in so far as the formation of these companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital is concerned.  In Ireland, as I understand it, it applies to public companies limited by shares, and public companies limited by guarantee and having a share capital.  It is interesting to note that the Minister says he is terminating the continuation of public companies limited by guarantee and public companies limited by shares which are to superseded by a new form of company which will be known as the public limited company, the PLC.  I understand that description will have to appear in the name of the company.  I think it is incorporated in the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A lot of the provisions now being promoted by the Minister have grown up through good practice and experience. Some of these provisions only go to reinforce the practices that have grown up. Anything that will improve the overall conduct of companies is to be welcomed. I welcome the provisions of this Bill as a step in that direction.  It would be desirable that many of its good provisions &mdash; even though they are concerned here with public limited companies &mdash; would be applied with good effect to the better running of all companies, whether they be public or private.  I would ask the Minister to apply the provisions that have grown up, really through good practice and experience, and which can be incorporated into company law to good effect wherever necessary to both the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>In his introductory remarks the Minister mentioned that he was working on new legislation and regulations primarily concerned with private limited companies. This will be much welcomed.  It will be expected, because of public disquiet over some practices in recent days in this regard, that early attention will be given to that matter.  I am sure that every facility will be afforded by this side of the House in the introduction of a suitable package.  If this could be done at all before the recess it would be well received and would enhance the reputation not merely of the Department but would demonstrate also that we are concerned <Col N="371" /> about that public disquiet.  While I believe that disquiet may have been voiced to a greater degree than justified, at the same time some malpractices have been perpetrated in certain sections of commercial life here and the Minister has an obligation to move against them.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the second directive which form the basis for this Bill are, firstly, a distinctive designation; secondly, minimum subscribed capital; and, thirdly, subscribed capital paid up to at least 25 per cent.  One feature regarded as proper for universal application is the provision concerned with the issue and payment for share capital and the restrictions on distribution of profits.</P>
    <P>This Bill will form part of the whole package of the restructuring of company law here.  As the Minister says the principles of the second directive are not negotiable.  We must take note of that because the Bill implementing those provisions would not be negotiable either.  It may be necessary on Committee Stage to suggest to the Minister a few areas he might consider.  I understand that he will be moving some technical amendments by way of draftsman's input.  That will give us an opportunity of incorporating perhaps a few other ideas as well.  Traditionally amendments put forward by the Opposition are not tolerated.  I suppose there is a good political reason for that, but in an area such as this, if it can be sufficiently proven to the Minister that any amendment would strengthen his hand in dealing comphrensively with matters concerned with company law, I am sure he will be approachable in the matter.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the Companies Acts of 1963 to 1972 and 1982 form the basic structures covering the operation of the different classes of companies in Ireland.  These structures must be upgraded to provide the necessary security and protection for the various interests involved.  A considerable amount of our economic activity is conducted through the basic structures governing companies.  We must concede also that over the past 20 years the 1963 Companies Act has served this country well.  It <Col N="372" /> has formed a sound basis for the development of many commercial enterprises here.  If the company boat has been found to be leaking somewhat recently, it must be said that it has served us well.  When one considers the rapid growth of industrialisation that has taken place, the extent and complexity of business today, then it will be seen that it is desirable now to have an overhaul of the whole of company law.  This Bill constitutes a step in the whole process of that restructuring.</P>
    <P>The first directive that we brought into law here some time ago improved the publication of documents and information on companies generally.  That was supported by a short Act in 1977 which dealt with the method of transferring securities on the Stock Exchange.  While this directive and the implementation of others is of an urgent nature, there will be need also for the introduction of special measures to deal with domestic considerations. They are the ones about which I am concerned primarily, in particular the overall pattern of private limited companies and their operation in the present economic climate.  The first directive and the supporting Companies (Amendment) Act, 1981, had many worthwhile provisions.  They could be summarised in three ways: first, the efficient operation of the Companies Registration Office.  I mention this for a particular reason, even though it is legislation still there and being implemented by the Department and the Companies Registration Office.  The second aspect has to do with people who may act as company auditors and public auditors.  The third area is the provision of preferential payments in winding up companies.  The whole thrust of that Act was to make the 1963 Act more relevant and to provide for better observance of the law on requirements such as filing of documents, returns and statements, meetings and other information, with the Registrar of Companies.  It is a matter of some anxiety that provisions put on the Statute Book and not subsequently followed up can lead to considerable abuse.  It would be interesting to know if the provisions of the first directive have been implemented in full.  I regard as essential a number of <Col N="373" /> minor adjustments that were effected in order to facilitate the efficient operation of the Companies Registration Office. The good and efficient running of this particular office is essential to the overall control of company development in Ireland.  The Minister should make every effort to streamline and modernise this particular area of registration with whatever modern techniques he feels necessary.</P>
    <P>The first directive also concerns improving the interests of employees, the provision about preferential payments in the winding up of companies.  There is considerable public disquiet concerning a lack of information on some of the provisions of former legislation.  Every assistance should be given to the registration office to speed up their processes to enable them to have the necessary powers for enforcing the law.  As far as I am concerned that simply means that it can be sometimes futile to promote legislation and give new powers to new areas of activity concerning all aspects of Irish life when the ones already promoted and established here and put on the Statute Book are not being implemented.  While it is purely our function here to deal with current application&mdash;I use that word guardedly&mdash;by Ministers to promote legislation for our perusal with a view to getting it on the Statute Book, I often wonder about some of the measures that subsequently become law because that is the last we or any of the people affected by them hear about them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, whatever we do here, to take on to himself the necessary functions, powers and inspectorate to implement the law.  The 1963 Act is an enormous volume of law.  It was based on the 1948 Act in Great Britain which goes back a long time.  Broadly speaking, it covered every aspect of it but the provisions of it were allowed to go by default and other provisions were not promoted as they did not seem appropriate to the particular circumstances that applied in our case.  I am convinced that a lot of the companies that have got into difficulty and have caused public disquiet because of some disclosures of an unseemly <Col N="374" /> nature attached to them in the recent past, might well have been averted if we had implemented the rule of law as it was already on the Statute Book.  It is in the public interest that the maximum information of relevant clauses attached to company registration be available to the public at the earliest possible time. There is no doubt that registration of a company with limited liability bestows considerable advantage &mdash; the Minister hinted at this and I concur &mdash; on the promoters and the shareholders.  I believe they have a corresponding responsibility and obligation in regard to the filing of returns.  It must be admitted that these are not too onerous.  People are negligent in complying with existing legislation and regulations.</P>
    <P>I believe if we could bring about a happier relationship with the total number of companies &mdash; it is very large as the Minister says &mdash; then perhaps we would be in a better position to deal with some of those who are bringing the law into disrepute.  I would regard it as reasonable and essential that the registration office would demand that people in such companies would make available all the necessary information at the earliest possible moment.  It appears to me that if the registration office had to be continually seeking information which is due to them in law, it would be necessary then to pay due note to those companies which were not complying with the demands of the registration office.  It would be entirely unfair that the registration office should spend an enormous amount of time in administration following up something which the companies are obliged in the first instance to provide in order to continue their registration.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the first directive which is now law in this country, must be implemented to guarantee and secure more regular and faster filing of annual returns of these companies.  To put it bluntly, there must be a much improved observation of the law in regard to all matters concerned with companies. There are very strong penalties for failure to comply with the requirements of the 1963 Act, including matters such as filing <Col N="375" /> of documents, returns and statements, holding meetings and providing other information to the registrar of companies. I would expect that these regulations would be implemented rigidly.  It would be interesting to hear from the Minister what experience he has gleaned from the registrar's office since the implementation of the first directive and subsequent legislation in support of it, what experience has been gained now subsequent to the legislation already there and if he can point out serious areas that companies are not complying with. I believe when he has a quick look at the 65,000 the Minister said of limited liability companies and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that the figure is the total number registered in the country and is not the number actually trading at this time.  I venture to say that perhaps the number trading and those that need to be looked at first would be somewhere around 50,000 to 55,000.  Perhaps it is in the area of the intervening 12,000 to 14,000 that the problems arise.  That is why monitoring by the registration office to see that companies registered are bona fide registrations in the first place might very well be the area the registration office could apply themselves to in relation to getting a good idea about what is going on relative to company law and company practice at this time.</P>
      <P>The legislation to implement the Fourth Directive of the EEC, which the Minister also referred to, is of particular interest.  The Fourth Directive must be regarded as a major directive and a major change in direction which it is expected will be incorporated into our company law to comply with our obligations under the treaty.  As we all know the Fourth Directive deals with the content of the format of company accounts, their presentation and publication.  It also embraces both public and private limited companies.</P>

      <P>Question No. 2 on the Order Paper today in my name was answered by the Taoiseach.  Unfortunately I could not be present in the House at that time as I was attending, with a deputation from my constituency, at the office of the Minister for Transport.  In reply to subsequent supplementary questions regarding the continued membership of a local authority which applies to the Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment, the Taoiseach could have implied that I, when Minister for Local Government, now Environment, had continued as a member of a local authority for a period of ten months after my appointment to the Cabinet.  I wish to refute this implication.  I did not remain on as a member of a local authority after my appointment as Minister for Local Government.  In fact, I resigned my membership at the first opportunity as I and the Government, of which I was a member, considered there would be a serious conflict of interest were I to seek to fulfil my statutory duties as a member of a local authority as laid down in the Local Government Acts and at the same time fulfil the statutory duties of the Minister as laid down in the same Local Government Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment on this motion yesterday evening I was voicing my criticism of statements made by the chairman of the Sugar Company concerning Tuam sugar factory.  I was particularly critical of two statements that the chairman made in his annual report.  He asked farmers to increase beet acreage by 20 per cent in the western catchment area, but when the acreage sought by the Tuam area was of the order of 10,000 acres this was refused by the Sugar Company.  They would not allow a greater acreage than 8,500.</P>
      <P>I also want to criticise a statement by the chairman of the Sugar Company in which he justified the closure of Tuam factory by referring to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee. I am sure the House and anyone who has studied that report are well aware that the committee also stated that Tuam should not be closed until alternative employment was provided in the town. The employment situation in Tuam is serious and, unfortunately, we have not got the industry we were looking for, let alone replacing the jobs of people who would be made redundant by the closure of the sugar factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to mention the losses which are supposed to have been incurred by the Tuam factory.  In the annual report of the Sugar Company a figure of £2½ million was mentioned as the loss for 1982.  I met the workers' action committee concerning this matter and they informed me that the losses at <Col N="378" /> Tuam last year were £1.4 million.  They are hopeful that the projected loss for 1983 will be just under £1 million.  I understand that the Sugar Company have now accepted this figure and it should be seen in the context of their total loss for 1982 which, the annual report states, was £22 million.  We must immediately ask where were these losses in the Sugar Company when only £1.4 million was lost in the Tuam operation.  I hope the Minister of State will reply to that question.</P>
    <P>Another very important point relates to the loss to the Exchequer in the event of the closure of Tuam factory.  The figures I have available show that with payments of PAYE, PRSI, VAT and unemployment benefit, the total amount of money would mean a loss to the Exchequer of £2.86 million.  It is imperative that we get a commitment from the Government to Tuam factory.  Fianna Fáil in Government gave that commitment and when Deputy Lenihan, as Minister for Agriculture, allocated £30 million to the Sugar Company in 1982, he spelled that out very clearly.  I should like to quote from the debate on the Sugar Manufacture (Amendment) Bill, 1982, in the Official Report of 29 June 1982, volume 337, column 236:</P>
    <P>What is true of the company in general is, of course, true of the Tuam factory in particular.  In deciding that this factory should remain open the Government are affording an opportunity to all concerned to ensure that the necessary efforts are made to guarantee its future. </P>
    <P>The effort has been made and beet acreage has increased over the last two years.  The catchment area could, in fact, produce much more beet than was allocated to them.  The workers in the factory have agreed to a voluntary redundancy scheme which means that the work force has been cut from 376 to 318.</P>
    <P>The tonnage per acre and the sugar content in the Tuam catchment area was very close to the national average.  When I was quoting from the Official Report, I noticed that Deputy Hegarty contributed to that debate and I am sure that he, as a man associated with the <Col N="379" /> sugar industry, knows that the factory was located in Tuam for social as well as commercial reasons.  I ask him to consider the great benefit that this factory has been to County Galway and to the west generally.</P>
    <P>I note from reading various reports by the Galway County Committee of Agriculture, now known as the ACOT Committee, that the advisers have stated on many occasions that more beet can be grown in the western catchment area. They have stated that this can be done without any adverse effect on livestock productivity.  This is the case in many other European countries and I have no doubt it can also be done in the Tuam catchment area.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the benefits to the west with regard to the income from the sugar beet industry.  In 1981 it was reported that £6 million was directly derived as income from the sugar beet crop and indirectly many people benefited from it.  One can have rationalisation without closures but I am afraid the Sugar Company are adopting a policy of closures to solve our problems.  This is not the the correct way to deal with this problem.  Tuam set a good example by accepting voluntary redundancies.  There is also scope in other agricultural based industries to have redundancies but not to have an immediate decision by the Sugar Company to close down these types of industries.  I hope the Government will use their influence to see that these industries will not be closed.  They should look at how savings can be made and also at rationalisation but let us not have these precipitate closures before full investigations have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The welfare of our food processing industry is a subject in which I have had for a long time a deep interest, an interest which has been intensified since I became Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture. I fully realise that while the production at farm levels must be the first priority, the failure of our processing sector would create serious difficulties for our <Col N="380" /> farmers.  To be successful, however, our processing must be efficiently conducted in terms of costs, packing, presentation, marketing and acceptability by the eventual user or consumer.  In the present world of keen international competition our processing industry has to get all these factors right or go under.  That is the stark reality of the position, and one to which we must face up if we are to survive.  We have many food processing units in which we can have the utmost confidence as to their viability &mdash; this applies particularly to the dairying industry &mdash; and we have many more which, I feel sure, could with greater effort come into that classification also.</P>
      <P>Last evening Opposition spokesmen were somewhat dismissive of the work of the committee which the Minister established recently to monitor imports of foodstuffs, the extent of which in more recent years has quite understandably caused concern to all who are interested in the welfare of our agriculture industry and the agri-business.  I would like to say here that the objective of the committee's work is to pinpoint the imports which are supplanting home production and to ascertain the real reasons why such imports are taking place.  Until we find out precisely what the problem is that is confronting us we will not know exactly how we should combat it.  I would hope that, armed with this detailed information, we will be in a position to see what action might best be taken with a view to ensuring that home produced goods would replace the imports to the maximum extent possible.  We can all talk about the possibility of setting up embargoes and making a big row about imports of horticultural products but we must bear in mind that we, as a nation exporting £700 million worth of food, are very vulnerable.  Our future must lie in being competitive and there is no good reason why we should not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point I would like to refer also to the Horticultural Development Group, which was set up in 1980 to identify potential areas of development in the horticultural industry and to make recommendations to the Minister on the measures needed to achieve such development <Col N="381" /> as well as on specific programmes and projects.  The group was asked to give special attention to the potential for creating new jobs in the industry with particular reference to enabling trained young people to become established in commercial production.  The group was originally appointed for a three year term of office which has recently come to an end.  I propose to appoint the group for a further three year term from the nominations of all the different interests represented on the original group.  At the request of some Members of this House we will be including ladies from the country markets.  However, there are still one or two bodies which have not sent in to me the names of the people they wish to nominate to the group and when these are all in I will consider whether some additional independent people should also be directly involved in the work of the group.  We hope to be on the way by mid-May.</P>
    <P>So far the group have made valuable recommendations on the tomato, processed vegetable and apple sectors.  I understand that the group had been working on a further report on the processed vegetable sector and on the production and marketing of fresh vegetables. I would like to see the new group complete these reports as quickly as possible and look at other aspects of the development of the horticultural sector, in particular policies that would meet the threat of imported fruit and vegetables of a kind we can produce ourselves.</P>
    <P>I would here like to express my thanks to the members of the committee, which is now ceasing to function, for their excellent work, which is much appreciated. The committee has been working diligently behind closed doors since 1980 for the horticultural sector.</P>
    <P>In contributing to this debate I want to put on record my involvement in and commitment to the food processing industry.  Many Deputies are in fact aware that I was in no small way involved in the setting up of East Cork Foods.  I travelled through the highways and, mostly, byways of the area to get the local people working together to set up an indigenous industry which provided local <Col N="382" /> employment and gave an income to the farmers in the area through the processing of locally-produced vegetables.  I maintained my involvement with the company after it was set up and up to the time I became Minister I continued as director.</P>
    <P>This Midleton plant is owned by East Cork Foods Ltd. which is 97 per cent owned by CSET.  CSET purchased most of the local shareholding and we have now very few local shareholders.  During my period as director of East Cork Foods right up to the time I became Minister I was under the impression that the company was paying its way and even making a small profit.  It was not until I became Minister that I learned that the accounts of East Cork Foods do not in fact represent a true picture of the profitability of the Midleton undertaking.  All production is sold to CSET at a break-even price.  Losses are carried in the overall accounts as divisional losses by Erin Foods.  And, as the Minister pointed out last night, these losses are a threat to the very existence of our sugar industry and the highly profitable beet growing enterprises.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I might refer at this stage to Deputy Kitt's complaint of last night that Tuam growers looked for 10,000 acres and got only 8,500 acres.  He omitted to mention that this 8,500 acres represents a substantial increase over previous years &mdash; some 21 per cent increase in fact. Indeed it was something the Mallow growers and I am sure the Thurles and Carlow growers were not that happy about.  With the success of the 1982 campaign there was considerable grower pressure for increased acreage but except for Mallow, where an increase of 18 per cent was granted to bring levels back after the grow no beet campaign, no increases were granted.  No increased acreage was granted to Carlow or Thurles although warranted on a commercial basis. Nobody got extra beet except Tuam. They believe they were entitled to a fair amount of extra beet and did not get it. That is a good trend now and it is certainly a good thing that farmers are interested in beet growing.  The crop has been a success.  Let us hope that 1982, with its <Col N="383" /> extraordinary yield, will be repeated this year because for the tillage farmer the sugar beet crop still constitutes a very substantial slice of his annual income. Substantial cheques from his sugar beet acreage can be of vital importance.</P>
    <P>To get back to Midleton, the situation is that the losses for the year ended September 1982 were £1.4 million.  As a result of a deputation the Minister had these figures checked and, regrettably, they are correct.</P>
    <P>The huge deficits of CSET as shown by recent years' accounts are mainly due to Erin Foods which accounted for some £13 million loss in 1981-82.  The basic fact that losses of this magnitude cannot be sustained has to be faced and, to be fair to our predecessors in office, it is clear that that grim reality was being realised. Evidence of such realisation is the agreement to the closure of the Skibbereen and Carlow food undertakings in the period November 1980 to May 1981. Unfortunately, as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies had indicated and the consultants' report confirmed, this action was not enough to safeguard our sugar industry or the remainder of the Erin Foods operations. It was clear that further action was necessary and the Minister has last night indicated the basis and reason for such action.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to the House here how vegetable growing is now an established feature of our own East Cork farming.  We do have farmers there who are willing and able to grow top quality produce.  There is terrific potential if the new technology of the 1980s can be adopted satisfactorily, but the viability of any undertaking, the capital investment, lead-in time to profitability, marketing <i>et cetera</i> need careful study.  It is an unfortunate fact that multinationals have enormous advantages in these areas.  However, I can assure the House that this Government have a positive commitment to the development of a viable food processing industry and I, as Minister of State with specific responsibilities in the food area, will be co-operating fully in this.  There have already been discussions <Col N="384" /> with interested parties with a view to the creation of viable profit making enterprises in Midleton and Limerick in replacement of East Cork Foods and Mattersons canning operations.  I have been involved in, and have in fact been responsible for, getting some of these discussions under way, and I shall continue with my commitment to do all in my power to ensure a satisfactory end to negotiations with regard to a new food enterprise.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to tell the House that we are getting the full co-operation of all the State agencies and the full co-operation of the local farming community.  In October 1982 we sent a deputation &mdash; I was away at the time &mdash; to the then Minister.  That deputation was received by him.  The request was quite simple.  We requested a year in which to do something with this industry and we got the year.  We have our peas and our beans and we will be working right up to the end of September.  We have that time then in which to make a success of a new operation.  I am more than optimistic. The House will be the first to learn about the development when it comes right but it would be premature and prejudicial at this stage to develop it any further.</P>
    <P>Deputy M. Ahern is fully aware of what has taken place.</P>
    <P>With regard to problems in the potato sector, I would like, first of all, to refer to imports, about which there has been much publicity in recent months, and to state that as members of the EEC we are obliged to allow access to our markets in accordance with Community rules. Potato imports largely depend on domestic supply.  For instance, last season, when domestic supplies were only about 85 per cent of requirements, large imports &mdash; 92,000 tonnes &mdash; mainly Dutch, took place.  On the other hand, this season domestic supplies are adequate to meet demand and consequently because of the lower prices there has been a dramatic reduction in the volume of imports.  For some considerable time there has been pressure from producers' representatives and others to set up some sort of overall body to regulate all sides of the potato industry.  The most recent <Col N="385" /> approach has been from the IFA and the chairman of its commodity group, John Ahern.  They have done considerable work in consulting all sides and now have proposed the setting up of a self-financing Potato Authority.  The IFA have been told that their proposals, including the legal implications, would be examined and this is being done.  It will involve legislation and a further meeting with the IFA is envisaged.  Unfortunately, our seed potato exports have been decreasing in recent years, mainly due to intense competition from new varieties being marketed by other countries and to our own high costs of production because of inflation.  The future for the traditional varieties such as King Edward, Arran Banner and Up-to-Date, even Pinks is bleak.  Fortunately Irish Potato Marketing Ltd., which is the sole exporter to third countries, has developed, in collaboration with An Foras Talúntais, a comparatively new variety, Cara, which is selling well on export markets and there are also some promising new varieties such as Claustor and Mizen following on.</P>
    <P>One of our problems has been that we have not a suitable processing variety with shallow eyes of tonnage large enough to make it a viable operation from the farming point of view.  I believe that Cara measures up to this requirement and if that is so it will open up very substantial new avenues for the growing of potatoes for the processing market. IPM have plant breeders' rights for these varieties.  The quantity of Cara seed being produced has increased dramatically in recent years and last year it formed 60 per cent of our exports.  The 1983 acreage of the variety is 50 per cent up on last year.  With the change over to Cara it is hoped that IPM can in the near future increase our share of export markets and thereby procure an enhanced income for the growers.</P>
    <P>The market for processed potatoes &mdash; frozen chips, crisps, flake and so on &mdash; is growing but much of the market is being supplied by imports.  The whole potato processing sector is labouring under considerable difficulties such as arranging successful contracts with growers and with regard to high production costs.  A <Col N="386" /> frozen chip factory and a crisp factory established here in recent years are reported to be in financial difficulties. Perhaps the best hope for this side of the industry is the development of potato producer groups and their involvement in the processing sector.  This could help to secure a steady supply of raw material, which is an abiding problem.  The decrease in our inflation rate should also be a factor in bringing down production costs.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general supply in the market place of fresh potatoes, one big problem is that of presentation and quality control.  The IFA themselves have come up with their own solution to that in so far as each grower marketing potatoes in future will have his bag clearly identified with a number or a name.  That in itself will solve that problem because each individual grower must stand over his own grading, marketing and product.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to reaffirm the Government's commitment to a policy which is designed to ensure that adequate supplies of raw material for processing are produced here on our own farms as efficiently as possible and that adequate assistance is available from the IDA and other State agencies to expand viable food processing ventures to deal with that raw material.</P>
    <P>As Deputy De Rossa has an amendment, I would like at this stage to forego some of my time to facilitate him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the time given to me by the Minister of State.  In speaking to this debate we are anxious that problems in relation to East Cork Foods should be dealt with in the motion. For that reason I appeal to the parties in the Dáil to accept the amendment put down by The Workers' Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three items before us &mdash; the motion, the Government amendment and our amendment &mdash; are not contradictory in any way.  The Government amendment is probably more realistic than the Fianna Fáil motion in that it refers specifically to a most important element in relation to the food processing sector: the production of raw materials. As has been mentioned a number of <Col N="387" /> times in the course of the debate, this is one of the key areas which will either make or break the food processing industry. The Minister of State indicated that they are working to try to iron out that problem.  He also mentioned the number of factories which had in recent years been established.  He was probably referring to factories in the Donegal area which were dealing with frozen chips, crisps and so on.  Perhaps the difficulty then is that they were attempting simply to replace imports, which is important, but because of their structure and the level of capital which was available to them they had not the ability or capacity to go for export markets.  It must be accepted and understood by everybody in relation to all areas of industry that the Irish market is far too small to support any area, be it food processing, engineering or anything else.  It must sell abroad.  For this reason I oppose any suggestion that imports of food should be banned.  We must export or the economy will just shrivel up.  Banning imports will simply result in other countries, in turn, banning our exports and that would be of no use to us in the long run.</P>
    <P>I appeal particularly to the Fianna Fáil Deputies from Cork to support the amendment which Deputy Mac Giolla and I have put down urging the Government to keep the East Cork Foods factory open.  The food processing industry clearly is in trouble and in that I refer as much to the private food processing industry as to the State industry.  A quantity of £600 million or thereabouts worth of food imports is being brought into the country.  The State food processing industry is probably the more important in the sense that it has the necessary capacity and in the past has aimed as much at exports as at serving the home market.</P>
    <P>The problem in relation to the production of raw materials is serious.  We have numerous examples of the manner in which the farming sector for short-term gain has not fulfilled contracts it entered into with both State and private industry for the supply of raw materials.  No industry which has large capital investment can survive unless it is sure of its raw material. <Col N="388" /> It is well known that the acreage under vegetables is falling and at the same time the import of vegetables of all kinds is increasing.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to discuss this area without also referring to the manner in which the cattle industry is organised and the falling cattle herd.  Large fortunes are being made out of the export of live cattle while meat processing factories are closing down.</P>
    <P>In relation to the food processing industry a number of constraints are holding back its development.  The potential for jobs in that industry is enormous, not merely in direct employment in the processing factories but also in the service industries to that area.  Apart from the production of raw materials, and having a stable and constant supply of them, we have the question of energy costs.  We must recognise that we have the highest energy costs in the EEC.  If the Government are serious about developing the food processing industry and many other areas in industry, they must set about tackling the question of high energy cost.</P>
    <P>In reference to that area and as it affects the food processing industry, I draw attention to the Telesis Report which says:</P>
    <P>Energy can be a significant cost in processed foods, also.  Energy is more expensive in Ireland than in many competing countries.  Within the EEC this has been particularly the case versus Holland &mdash; because of its natural gas fields &mdash; and progressively so versus the UK.  Again, the importance of this penalty can be put in perspective by analysing cost structures.  Dehydration is a typical example of food processing for which the higher cost of Irish energy is a severe competitive penalty. Energy cost may represent some 20 per cent of the total ex-factory cost of consumer packaged dried vegetables. </P>
    <P>This has particular importance to the East Cork Food plant.</P>
    <P>Another area which is very important to food processing is not only a steady supply of raw materials but also quality raw materials.  If the Government are <Col N="389" /> serious they must set about establishing an effective way of carrying out research and development in this area.  The whole area of export marketing does not seem to be organised.  There are a number of areas which are doing a very good job but no serious attempt is being made in the vegetable processing sector to increase export marketing.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to consider adopting my amendment and appeal to the Fianna Fáil Deputies from Cork to support it.  I ask the Government to pay particular attention to cheap energy, and organising dependable supplies and effective marketing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Fianna Fáil motion and having listened to the Minister for Agriculture last night and his Minister of State this evening, I have no reason to change my mind.  The Minister's speech was only padding and did not get down to the nitty gritty of the Government's amendment which reads &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann supports the efforts of the Government to increase the production of raw material for the food processing industry and to promote the development of the industry along the most efficient lines&rdquo;.  He did not spell out how that would be done, but I would love to hear what they intend to do to implement that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal primarily with East Cork Foods Limited.  Over the life-time of that firm I am led to believe profits were being made, but in the last two or three years that trend reversed to a loss-making position.  In 1982 the loss amounted to £1.4 million.  I have been informed that the Mallow factory made a loss of £1.4 million or £1.5 million.  The number of workers in East Cork Foods Limited was approximately 120 and in Mallow about 60.  It was held that the land and the conditions in the East Cork Foods and Midleton areas are much more suitable to vegetable growing than the Mallow area.  I find it very difficult to understand the <i>raison d'etre</i> behind the closing down of the Midleton plant under those circumstances. I have no doubt the next stage will be the closing down of the Erin Food plant in Mallow.  This will be detrimental <Col N="390" /> to the food processing industry because we will not have any Irish food processing industry.  A great deal of food is being imported at present, but what will happen if the Mallow factory is closed?  We will be almost 100 per cent dependent on imported vegetables.</P>
    <P>Prior to the recent election Fine Gael gave a written commitment to keep East Cork Foods open and to improve the efficiency of that plant and the Erin Foods plant in Mallow.  No sooner was there a change in Government than this commitment, as well as the written commitment of the Tánaiste, was committed to the shredder.  On 29 June 1982 the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, in a speech on the Sugar Company Bill, stated that East Cork Foods were established for social as well as commercial purposes. I do not hold with the idea that factories losing a great deal of money should be kept open just for the sake of keeping them open.  I believe there must be trimming down, increased efficiency and so on.  Under the circumstances, the closure of East Cork Foods will take approximately £5 million out of circulation in that area.  The social aspect of the closure of this factory will be much greater than the loss that would have to be sustained by the Government if the factory were to be kept open.  This social aspect is vitally important.  The Government's action is further evidence of their lack of social conscience.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party 's concern at the pending closure of East Cork Foods is laudable in itself but it must be viewed with a certain amount of scepticism when one recalls the inactivity of their former colleague, Mr. Joe Sherlock, in the constituency I represent.  When it was first mooted that East Cork Foods was to close, Mr. Sherlock kept very quiet and did not come to a number of meetings in Midleton which were dealing with that closure.  I believe he considered the keeping open of Erin Foods in Mallow more important.  I can assure The Workers' Party that their concern will not fool the people of East Cork and no votes will be garnered by their posturings.</P>
    <P>How do the Minister of State and the Government intend to seriously tackle <Col N="391" /> the virtual dumping of vegetables and other products on our markets?  How do they intend to put the vegetable producing industry on a sound and valuable footing?  These are fair questions and deserve answers.  These are the issues on which the election campaign was fought. Now is the time, not during elections, to produce answers.  At election time we tell the people what we will do.  I call on the Minister and the Minister of State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They are now in the driving seat and I ask them to drive. I know the Minister of State is working hard to establish another industry in place of the industry which has been closed down.  I wish him the best of luck.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of this motion.  This is a prime agricultural country, but maximum use is not being made of our tremendous land resources. Last year we imported <i>circa</i> £75 million worth of vegetables at a great loss to the Exchequer, to the disadvantage of our balance of payments and with a loss of revenue from employment contributions to the Exchequer which would have been available if these vegetables were produced at home.</P>
      <P>We must take urgent and immediate steps to ensure that the incentives are available to farmer producers to grow vegetables and potatoes, and that the marketing structures exist within which there will be a guarantee that the necessary investment in time, labour and raw materials will be supplemented with a decent profit for our industrious farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer specifically this evening to the Tuam sugar factory in the west of Ireland which has been part of the Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta operations for the past 50 years.  There has been much debate about its viability within CSET.  The economic implications <Col N="392" /> for the west should be seriously examined before an attempt is even made to consider the closing of this factory, apart from the finances of the Sugar Company. The Government should not seek to hide behind consultants.  All the facts are known.  The Sugar Company were investigated thoroughly by the Oireachtas Joint Committee some time ago.  Apart from the effects on Tuam, the closure of the beet factory would probably also mean the closure of the railways and in particular the Sligo-Limerick line.  Farmers would not grow any more beet west of the Shannon if there were no factory in Tuam.</P>
    <P>Experts have stated consistently that tillage has a considerable future particularly in the west.  Beet is also a relatively profitable crop.  Land leasing, which we hear so much about at the moment, for beet growing in the west, through the operations of the Sugar Company has been very successful.  This should be continued. The fact remains that 318 people are employed permanently in CSET in Tuam.  In 1982 they paid £1.2 million in PAYE and PRSI to the State.  A further 300 people are employed annually on a seasonal basis which means a great deal to the economic life of the west.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the farmers in the Tuam beet catchment area is total and absolute.  Over 10,000 acres were available to the Tuam sugar factory this year. The board of CSET would allow Tuam a quota of only 8,500 acres, while the other factories have <i>circa</i> 30,000 acres allowed to them.  Surely it is reasonable to expect that Tuam should be allowed 10,000 acres to ensure its viability.  The fact that the factory in Tuam was not allowed this 10,000 acres, in spite of the fact that they were available, brings in question for me and the farmers of the west the sincerity of the board of the Sugar Company in their commitment to Tuam as one of their four factories.</P>
    <P>In October 1982 instructions were sent by the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture to CSET to have Tuam included in all feasibility studies within the operations of CSET.  In March of this year a letter was sent by a Mr. Dooney in the Department of Agriculture stating <Col N="393" /> that Tuam should be omitted from the feasibility study.  This is a clear indication to us that the Department and the Government have not got the commitment to the continuing operations of the sugar factory.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to state that on 28 April a letter issued to me from Mr. Maurice Sheehy, the managing director of CSET, saying that the examination of the Tuam turbine had been completed by the experts and they were satisfied the action which they had recommended would ensure that the turbine would be in a satisfactory working condition for the foreseeable future.  I hope that future will be permanent and that the Government will ensure that the Tuam factory remains in operation.  It is vital to the future of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>There has been much ado about the location of Tuam and the fact that the maximum amount of beet does not come from the Tuam area.  I should like to point out some facts and figures to the House.  As one who has been 15 years involved in the agri-business, and coming from the west where we are generoushearted people by nature, I believe we have made a major contribution in the west of Ireland to the development of agriculture.  Weekly we send millions of pounds worth of livestock from the west to the midlands, the eastern part of the country, the south eastern part of the country, and to Northern Ireland.  We do that on a continuous basis, obviously because it is profitable to do so from an agricultural point of view, and also because we have the commitment to production in the west, agricultural production and the production of livestock. There are no complaints from any sector of the agricultural industry about the location of the west when it comes to producing various agricultural products.</P>
    <P>That commitment should be balanced right across the country.  The Department, CSET and the Government should acknowledge the fact that the Tuam factory has been in operation for 50 years. When the farmers have that commitment there is no reason why a campaign which lasts not more than two months should not be backed up with support from outside <Col N="394" /> the Tuam catchment area, if necessary, to ensure that this factory remains viable.  I appeal to the House to support this motion and I appeal in particular to the Government to ensure the future of the Tuam sugar factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion because in my view this is one of the serious problems which has not been tackled by any Government since we became a member of the EEC.  When the negotiations were in progress on our entry into the EEC, great play was made with the fact that many benefits would come from EEC membership.</P>
      <P>In this country we have one of the best raw materials in the world, but we have failed to make any impact on EEC markets where there are 900 million people, because of our consistent failure to process and market food properly.  That failure can be attributed to this House and to successive Governments who failed to take action since we became a member of the EEC.  I have already called for the setting up of an agricultural development organisation to promote food processing and marketing along the same lines as the IDA promote industry.  Unfortunately that call has fallen on deaf ears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In supporting this motion, I ask the Minister if he would consider proposing to the Government the establishment of a post of Minister for Food?  We have the finest raw materials but we are importing food to the value of millions of pounds.  As a food-producing nation we are incapable of making any impression on EEC markets with the exception of Kerrygold butter.  It is a pity we are unable to export value-added Irish beef, bacon and other meat products.  I have had discussions with people involved in the promotion of Irish meat.  We are able to hold great trade shows in German supermarkets and in other countries, yet when it comes to the matter of exporting top-class Irish meat, the food processing and meat processing factories are not capable of fulfilling the orders.  We are looking for employment and it seems ridiculous that we are unable to add value to the raw materials we have and gain <Col N="395" /> maximum benefits in terms of jobs and exports.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government to look carefully at this whole area.  I am satisfied there is vast potential for the development of our food processing and marketing businesses.  I am convinced the reason it has been a failure up to now has been the lack of Government action and lack of co-ordinated policy.  We need a high-powered sales team in Europe to sell Irish food and we need a high-powered processing industry to produce that food in Ireland and give it its full added value.</P>
    <P>We might be able to do something constructive in this area if the Government gave one Minister full responsibility for the promotion and development of Irish foods.  The time has come for the appointment of a Minister for Food: I use that term for want of a better one.  I agree with the motion and I ask the Minister to consider specifically the proposal I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I should like to express my thanks to the Deputies who contributed to this debate, to the Minister for Agriculture who spoke last evening and to the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, who spoke this evening.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed at the response of the Minister, and that is putting it mildly. In my contribution last evening I said the Minister would have an opportunity of highlighting the Government's commitment, programme and policy with regard to the development of the food processing industry.  As Deputy Michael Ahern rightly pointed out, the contributions of the Ministers were just padding and waffle. They have given no hope to this major industry which employs so many people and which has had a considerable impact on the social life of the areas concerned.</P>
      <P>The amendment in the name of the Minister for Agriculture reads as follows:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;supports the efforts of the Government to increase the production of raw material for the food processing industry and to promote the development of <Col N="396" /> the industry along the most efficient lines.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa has an amendment in his name and he has asked us to support it.  As I said last night, actions speaks louder than words.  The Minister for Agriculture has stated he was only 18 days in office in 1982 but he has now been in office for the past five months.  However, there is no indication of any action by the Government.  There was no indication of a commitment by the Minister in his contribution last night or by the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, the person responsible for the promotion of the food industry.  They have not given any hope for the future and that is why we cannot support the amendment in the name of the Minister.  We consider it is just an excuse for inaction, that it is a delaying tactic so far as our motion is concerned.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister when referring to the EEC price negotiations said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is regrettable that in spite of all my endeavours, the price negotiations in Brussels have not yet been finalised but I am confident that the eventual package will be a worthwhile one and will show a considerable improvement over the level of the increase that had been anticipated earlier this year&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The Minister used the words &ldquo;all my endeavours&rdquo; but I am at a loss to know what this meant.  The breakdown of the price negotiations, the annual agricultural review on the morning of 28 April last, is responsible for further losses to Irish farmers.  These losses are increasing by £500,000 per day because of the failure of the Council of Ministers to come to a decision.  The loss is hitting all farmers but it is affecting to a great extent the dairy farmers who are responsible for a major part of our food processing industry.</P>
    <P>This and previous Governments have encouraged early calving and most of our progressive farmers have pushed early calving back to January in response to the national demand.  They are now being unfairly penalised by the delay in the negotiations and have been badly let <Col N="397" /> down by our Minister for Agriculture. The farmers who are suffering are responsible for a major input into the food processing industry.  The most amazing feature of the situation is that the British Minister, Mr Walker, has greatly outwitted our Minister.  He can now block even the most reasonable decision in favour of Ireland.  Our Minister has let himself become isolated in regard to many aspects of these price negotiations, particularly in regard to the British variable premium.  This is a financial advantage enjoyed by British exporters which is not only unfair to our interests but also contrary to the very principles of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Minister should now call the British bluff by taking the initiative to bring the talks to an end, even to the extent of using the ultimate weapon.  He might take a leaf out of his predecessor Mark Clinton's book, a colleague of his own party, who took the necessary action during the price negotiations in the mid-seventies by walking out of talks.  This is the tough approach which the Minister should adopt with regard to these negotiations. Every day of indecision is costing our farmers dearly.  I hope that this necessary action will be taken because the negotiating table at Brussels is no place for amateurs.  We have an old saying&mdash;there is little point in sending a boy in a man's place and that is the situation with regard to the present Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Government's second aim for our agricultural sector is to encourage increased efficiency at all levels, not least on the farm itself.  An abundant supply of raw materials efficiently produced is essential to the welfare of any processing industry. This is certainly the case with our own food processing sector, which constitutes a major part of the Irish manufacturing industry as a whole.  Contrast those laudable words with the absence of action. Action speaks louder than words, but action is lacking.  The reverse is happening in so far as agriculture is concerned. It is downgraded by this Government, who have destroyed any prospect of economic recovery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> Government mismanagement of the whole economy, not alone in the agricultural sector, has undermined the farmers' confidence and prolonged the dreaded farm recession.  That is the reality of what is happening.  There is little point in the Minister expressing laudable sentiments that there should be greater production and greater efficiency but not giving the farmers the backing of the Government. Perhaps the Minister has the goodwill of our farmers at heart and is not getting support from his Government.  Time will tell and we shall see what happens in the future.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that agriculture is Ireland's most important industry, contributing at least 50 per cent of our total net exports and employing half of the working population, directly or indirectly.  The agricultural sector have demonstrated their ability to contribute to the economic growth in the past and I have no doubt, provided the commitment is there, that it can do so in the future. We in Government have created and will again the economic environment conducive to revitalising the farming industry, which will generate increased output and improve income.  This, in turn, will hasten our economic recovery.  Above all, it will recreate job opportunities, not alone for people employed in agriculture, but in all other sectors.</P>
    <P>I give the example of our four-year plan for agricultural development.  This was being put into operation when we left office in December of last year.  That plan contained the ingredients for the restoration of confidence in farming.  It was long-term planning which is so vitally needed in the development of agriculture at present and in the development of the food processing industry based on agriculture. Lack of interest by the Government has been highlighted by the action of the delegates of the farm organisations representing their associations in the previous Government's working party. Their recent resignations are further evidence of this Government's complete abandoning of the farming sector.</P>
    <P>The budget recently introduced by the Minister for Finance, who should be aware of the problems affecting agriculture, <Col N="399" /> is costing farmers in the region of £3 million a week because of the level of taxation.  It is inhibiting farming enterprises. In addition, lack of decision by the Council of Ministers with regard to the settlement of agricultural prices is costing our farmers in the region of £½ million per day.  Then the Minister came into the House last evening and outlined the importance of more efficient and increased production.  This can be effected only by incentives, by the Government giving the necessary assistance and wherewithal to achieve that efficiency.  What can we expect when the Government have reneged totally on their commitment to the development of agriculture?</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the course of his remarks last evening also that he wanted to emphasise that the setting up of a committee was not the solution to the problem.  The Minister of State made reference to this matter again this evening when he said that I was somewhat dismissive of the work of the committee. What I said was that there was little point in setting up a committee to examine a problem about which we all know.  I said it was necessary to take action now rather than set up committees or commissions to examine the problem, that what is required now is action.</P>
    <P>In regard to the production of raw materials at farm level the inflation factor is crucial.  In this respect it is interesting to note the Minister's latest estimate of the rate of inflation for 1983 which he put at approximately 12 per cent.  Of course this inflation is caused by the budgetary strategy of the Minister for Finance.  I hope agriculture will be fully compensated by increased prices from Brussels. However, I doubt that such increased prices will be forthcoming at present.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise again greater output and efficiency at farm level, as outlined by the Minister last evening.  Government action is not consistent with those laudable words, more particularly their action in the recent budget showing no support at all for agricultural development. There have been also the suspension of the farm modernisation grants, <Col N="400" /> the farm retirement scheme and many of the other aids to agriculture introduced by this party when in Government.  Yet the Minister can come into this House and say we must be more efficient and produce more while the Minister for Finance and the Government remove the aids to do that vital work.  Surely that is not consistent with good Government policy in regard to agricultural development? I would appeal to the Minister of State &mdash; whom I know has a commitment to the development of agriculture &mdash; to bring that message to his Minister.</P>
    <P>Much has been said in this debate with regard to the Sugar Company.  What was said by the Minister last evening and the Minister of State this evening gives no indication of positive action in this regard.  Indeed their words were very inept, indicating no positive action for the development of this vital sector of our economy.  The Minister's remarks gave no great hope.  Something should be done immediately to save and secure present jobs.  I was glad to note that the Minister of State this evening accepted the facts I put forward with regard to the whole of the food processing industry. However, the Government have not given the Minister the necessary support. It should be remembered that the whole of our agricultural industry can provide the wherewithal for the recovery of our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister last evening referred to a deputation he had received from Limerick with regard to Mattersons and said I had stated that he was very discourteous to that deputation.  Those are not my words alone.  In this respect I want to quote from the <i>Limerick Echo</i> of <i>April</i> 2, from an article entitled &ldquo;Minister Goofs Jobs Appeal&rdquo;, which said:</P>
    <P>A deputation from Limerick was &ldquo;shocked&rdquo; to discover that the Minister for Agriculture didn't know enough about Mattersons.  And now local union chiefs have asked whether a deal was done to save a factory elsewhere by closing our historic cannery.  It was revealed today that Mr. Austin Deasy, Minister for Agriculture, had believed Mattersons to be privately owned.  It <Col N="401" /> is, in fact, part of the State-owned Sugar Company. </P>
    <P>Even the Minister for Agriculture did not know that Mattersons was State-owned. The article continued:</P>
    <P>The union leaders have now stated that they were treated with &ldquo;scant courtesy&rdquo; by the Minister when he met the Limerick deputation. </P>
    <P>Those are the facts.  Indeed I have news for the Minister of State present &mdash; when the Minister was contacted by the same paper the following week, speaking at his Waterford home, he is reported as saying that there had never been a question of a deal to keep East Cork Foods open while closing Mattersons.  He said both <Col N="402" /> were to close and the idea of a deal was nonsense.  That is in sharp contrast with what the Minister of State said this evening when referring to East Cork Foods.</P>
    <P>It is sad to note the Government's lack of commitment to the agricultural sector and the food processing industry.  I ask the House to support this motion bearing in mind the continuation of the food processing industry in East Cork and, most important of all, the provision of the wherewithal to ensure that the Tuam sugar factory remains open.  This party have given that commitment because we feel there is a social aspect involved in these processing industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the matters arising out of a reply to a Dáil question which I put to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and which was answered on Tuesday.  The reply establishes quite clearly that the telephone system in the Dublin area is in a state of chaos.  The reply I received establishes that in the Dublin area there are 47,500 outstanding applications for telephones. Of these, 25,700 relate to applications for telephones for business purposes and 21,800 relate to applications for telephones for people's homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The state of the telephone system in Dublin &mdash; and I presume Dublin is a mirror image of what is happening in other areas &mdash; is now causing serious economic damage.  It is effectively impeding the establishment of new businesses, it is frightening off many foreign business concerns from establishing bases here and is seriously preventing the expansion of existing businesses.  It is also damaging the industries which have export potential and who find it impossible to operate a proper import-export business without <Col N="405" /> adequate telephone and telecommunication services.</P>
    <P>It is causing major social problems for many people, especially the elderly and sick, who are often dependent on the telephone as a lifeline to the outside world.  It is also creating major difficulties for many people whose professions and businesses require them to be contactable for 24 hours a day.  I am not saying that this is the fault of the present Minister. This is a problem which he has inherited from his predecessors and I do not think it is something with which we should play politics.</P>
    <P>It is a major irritant that it seems to be impossible for ordinary members of the general public to get accurate information as to when telephones will be supplied to them and what the position is in relation to the provision of telephones generally.  Anyone who has a telephone problem does not try to resolve it by contacting the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  They get in touch with their Deputies and TDs are spending hour after hour, week after week, trying to get information as to when people will be supplied with telephones and when repairs will be carried out.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of this House for three successive administrations.  It has been my continuous experience that when I contact the Department of Posts and Telegraphs by way of telephone call or letter to find out when constituents or businesses will be supplied with telephones, I get gobbledegook civil service replies which are utterly meaningless. At one time the only course open to a Deputy to find out any information was to put down a Dáil question and at least that often elicited the brief but useful reply that a telephone would be supplied at a specified time.  If nothing else, it gave some indication to the poor applicant when the service would be made available to him.</P>
    <P>The position now is that the Deputies cannot even rely on the replies to these Dáil questions.  When one put down a Dáil question a year-and-a-half ago one was told that a telephone would be supplied in about a year but we are now getting civil service gobbledegook in <Col N="406" /> reply to Dáil questions.  When we ask why the telephone was not supplied we get more gobbledegook about massive cabling that has to be laid and the amount the Department have to do and that hopefully in about another year the telephone will be supplied.  The situation is not good enough and it should no longer be tolerated by Members of this House of any party.  The general public have reached the stage where they despair of anything sensible emerging from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. It often appears that if one gets one's telephone it is more by accident than by design.  The same applies to the carrying out of telephone repairs.</P>
    <P>The implications for Government of the present situation are worth noting.  If 47,500 applicants, some of whose applications date back six years, were today the proud possessors of functioning telephones &mdash; the fact that a telephone is installed does not, of necessity, mean that the damn thing will work &mdash; and if each of these applicants was paying a telephone bill, on a bi-monthly basis, of £70 that would generate the princely sum of £200 million per annum.</P>
    <P>There is a very grave problem in this area.  Perhaps a Minister of any Government cannot articulate this in public but I have no doubt that a portion of the problem relates to the work practices within the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which I think are a matter of grave concern.  I appears that in the context of the telephone service very often the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing and I sometimes suspect that each finger of each hand does not know what is going on.  If a Deputy seeks information by way of a letter and then, in despair, puts down a Dáil question, it is not unusual to get a reply ultimately to one's letter, two months after the Dáil question has been answered, the letter stating the exact opposite of the reply to the Dáil question.</P>
    <P>The state of the telephone service in Dublin is a national scandal and I do not accept that a transfer of the telephone service to An Bord Telecom will result in an automatic improvement in the situation. Whatever Minister happens to be <Col N="407" /> there when An Bord Telecom finally gets its responsibility will merely be fortunate enough to be protected from some of the political flak by disclaiming responsibility in the future.  Such a transfer will mean that no longer will this House be able to bring the telephone service to account in this House.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to take urgent action to tackle this problem and in particular to tackle the problems of some of the work practices in his Department.  It is not unknown for ten different people employed by the Department to attend at a house at various stages during the installation of a telephone.  That is something I do not understand.  I would ask the Minister to indicate when telephones on demand will be available in Dublin.  I do not believe they will be available in the next 12 months or indeed in the next two years. I want to know when all outstanding applications will be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="408" /> cannot adequately deal with the number of points made by Deputy Shatter but I would like to say first of all, that I and my Department are fully conscious of the fact that the telephone service in the Dublin area is unsatisfactory in a number of respects.  I will explain to the House the particular problems that exist in Dublin and what is being done to improve the position but before doing so, it is necessary to put this matter into context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their report which was published in 1979, the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group &mdash; an eminent group chaired by Dr. Dargan &mdash; stated that the telephone service was at that stage in a state of crisis.  They were of the view that even if the reorganisation which they recommended was implemented, and the management freedoms which would flow from this were available, it would take at least 5 years to provide a fully efficient telecommunications service here.  The five-year accelerated telecommunications development programme was launched at the beginning of 1980 and we are now almost mid-way through the fourth year of that programme which is not due to be completed until the end of next year.  It is unrealistic for anybody to expect that a civil service Department which of necessity could not be given the management freedoms described by the review group would succeed in achieving all of the aims of the programme before the end of 1984, that is in a shorter period than the period of at least 5 years mentioned by the review group.  Those are the facts of life which we must all recognise however unpalatable they may be. Coming now to the position in Dublin, it is true to say that development there has not been as rapid as in the case of some of the provincial districts in which telephones are now available on demand in many areas and the repair service is generally satisfactory.  There are a number of reasons for this but the main ones are, firstly, Dublin is by far the largest engineering district with a much greater amount of old plant; secondly, there was a shortage of staff including skilled staff such as jointers who maintain and repair cables and join additional cables for new subscribers and, thirdly, there was a shortage <Col N="409" /> of accommodation in which to house and train extra staff.  The first step was to provide the necessary additional accommodation. In many cases this involved acquiring sites, which as Deputies know were scarce in the 1980-1981 period in the Dublin area.  Extra staff had to be recruited and trained for planning and execution of development plans for the city, including in particular underground plant, additional subscriber exchanges, trunk switching centres, etc.  All of this work is now only beginning to bear fruit.</P>
    <P>The position at present is that about one-third of all applications for telephones are being met on demand, that is within a matter of months.  A major scheme of preventive maintenance of the older underground plant is being undertaken this year, and special attention is being devoted to improving the repair service.  The average time taken to repair faults has been halved during the past six months and most faults are now being cleared within 2 working days of their being reported.  But the position is by no means satisfactory as yet.  Further gradual improvement is expected in the coming months and by the end of the year it is expected that the position should be fairly satisfactory.  In fact provision of a satisfactory repair service has been set as the first priority for achievement by the district this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> Next in order of priority is clearance of the back-log of applications for telex and data facilities because of their importance for the business community.</P>
    <P>Finally the district has been given a target of 35,000 new connections this year, with priority being given to business applications.  Many of the older applications in Dublin will be dealt with within the targets mentioned but not all of them. A decision could be made to deal this year with all the applications that are outstanding for a long time but it is hoped that by the end of 1984 the general situation here in the Dublin area first of all in relation to repairs will be satisfactory and secondly in relation to the installation of telephones will also be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to queries raised by Deputies by parliamentary question or by letter.  I know it is the right of Deputies and of individuals to get information as to what is happening within the service but a lot of time is wasted by the staff of the Department because they have to concentrate their efforts on providing information sought by Deputies when their time could be better employed in providing the type of service that has been requested by Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5 May 1983.</P>

      <P>Following a detailed study completed in mid-1982 it was decided that at a later stage, the trunk switching functions for the subscriber digital exchange at Longford should be transferred to an E10B exchange at Mullingar which would provide a more economical and equally effective arrangement.  The change will not be made until two independent high capacity digital transmission systems between Longford and Mullingar are in service which would provide adequate emergency protection.</P>

    <P> *In the South Eastern Health Board area children in 6th class in primary schools are afforded priority and are generally given treatment within a few weeks of examination. </P>
    <P>In all health boards emergency treatment for the relief of pain is available on demand.</P>
    <P>The information relating to numbers awaiting treatment in the Eastern Health Board area will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the delay in providing treatment for children is the shortage of dentists in the health board dental service.  Apart from the question of the adequacy of the number of posts in the service it has proved difficult to recruit dentists to fill vacancies in most areas.  Competitions are in progress at present for the filling of a number of vacant posts and the indications are that the position in relation to the supply of candidates is improving.</P>
