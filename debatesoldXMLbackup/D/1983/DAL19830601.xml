    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised at the Deputy, I must say.  The Minister to continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall commence again, a Cheann Comhairle.  The purpose of the Bill is to raise the ceiling on the amount of loans which may be issued from the Local Loans Fund.  The fund was established almost 50 years ago as a channel for the provision of loan capital for local authorities.  The resources for the fund come from the Exchequer by way of repayable advances.  In turn the local authorities draw on the fund to finance direct expenditure on the construction of housing, sanitary services and other projects and to provide loans for house purchase under the Small Dwellings (Acquistion) Acts.</P>
      <P>Such spending forms part of the Public Capital Programme and the allocation for each service is decided each year when the PCP is being formulated.  Out of a total PCP of £1,890 million in 1983, £375 million or 20 per cent will be paid through the Local Loans Fund.</P>
      <P>The vast increase in the PCP in recent years is reflected in the programmes of expenditure financed through the fund. Accordingly it is necessary to adjust the statutory ceiling on issues from the fund from time to time.  The ceiling was increased to £1,500 million in 1978 and to £2,500 million in 1980.  It is now proposed to fix a new ceiling of £3,500 million.</P>
      <P>The fund provides the entire capital for local authority housing and sanitary services.  These are the big elements representing 98 per cent of the total this year.  The allocations are £208 million for housing and £97 million for sanitary services.  Expenditure in these areas has risen dramatically.  The figure for local authority housing increased from £85 million in 1978 to £186 million in 1982.  The corresponding figures for sanitary services were £29 million and £82 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision for housing loans in 1983 is £80 million, of which £64 million will come from the fund and the balance mainly from the sale of local authority houses.  This allows a reduction on 1982 because loan facilities are now available from the Housing Finance Agency which has an approved budget of £50 million for 1983.  Hence there is a substantial <Col N="261" /> increase in the total amount of mortgage finance available.</P>
    <P>Other projects which are financed in part from the fund are the construction of fire stations, libraries and swimming pools.  Previously the fund also provided capital for vocational educational committees for the building of schools and for health boards for hospital building. This no longer applies.  Such projects are now financed by way of direct grants from the Exchequer paid from the Votes for Post-primary Education and Health.</P>
    <P>Loans from the fund are repayable on an annuity basis.  The normal period of repayment is 25 to 30 years.  The rate of interest chargeable at present is 15 per cent &mdash; the current Exchequer lending rate &mdash; with the exception of SDA capital which is made available to local authorities at 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>In practice the Exchequer meets a large proportion of the loan charges on advances from the fund, both capital repayments and interest.  For example, it meets the full loan charges on local authority housing and 40 per cent to 60 per cent of the charges in respect of sanitary services.  The annual cost is shown in the Vote for the Department of the Environment.  The amount provided for 1983 is £128 million for local authority housing and £29 million for sanitary services.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned above, the existing ceiling on loan issues from the fund is £2,500 million.  Total issues to date amount to £2,300 million.  The ceiling would probably be reached by late summer. A revised ceiling of £3,500 million is proposed to meet requirements over the next two to three years.  I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Bill and we will not seek to delay its passage through the House.  It has always puzzled me that the administration of the Local Loans Fund should be the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  I have never found a satisfactory answer as to why that continues to be the case, especially when one considers that this fund is the principal source of funding for the major part of the programmes undertaken <Col N="262" /> under the auspices of the Department of the Environment and by local authorities throughout the country.  The Minister of State has given details of the extent of that expenditure in 1983.</P>
      <P>Public interest in this area lies principally with the availability of finance for housing loans.  The only questions I should like to raise with the Minister are in regard to that area which I recognise is not his direct responsibility.  It is clear that the number of persons benefiting from loans under the Local Loans Fund has been diminishing in recent years in direct ratio with the increase in the average cost of houses funded by loans under this scheme.  Looking back over the years, one can see that this relationship has always existed.  When the Minister of the day delays increasing the loan limits and the income limits, the number of persons seeking loans under the scheme drops fairly dramatically.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to this, and I hope he or one of the Ministers in the Department will indicate to the House whether there is any intention in the near future to raise the loan limits and the income limits to qualify for those loans.  I should like to put on the record of the House this morning the fact that the number of local authority loans approved has been dropping fairly dramatically.  In 1980, 10,381 loans were approved.  In 1981; the figure dropped to 8,971, and in 1982 it dropped to 7,595.  One can see that there is a relationship with the diminishing value of the loans because of the increase in the price of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1980, the average price of a house funded by a loan under this scheme was £20,903.  In 1981, it was £23,859 and in 1982, it was £26,300.  Last year the average price of a house funded under the scheme was £26,300 and the loan was £14,000 which meant the applicant had to make up the balance by way of his own deposit and possibly a bridging loan of £12,300.  In 1981, the gap between the average price and the amount of the loan was only £9,859.  The year before it was £6,903.  The gap has doubled within a period of two years.  It is obvious that the Minister and the Government should <Col N="263" /> agree to increase the loan limits from £14,000 to a more reasonable figure, and to increase the income limits to allow people to qualify who have been disqualified due to the fact that their salaries have increased and the income limits have not been increased correspondingly. I appeal to the Minister to impress upon the Government the necessity for an immediate change in the size of the loan and the loan limits which apply.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will answer me by stating that the Housing Finance Agency has been established and now provides another source of funding for young couples and others who wish to purchase a home with the assistance of a State subsidised housing loan.  I accept that that is so, and I welcome the establishment of the Housing Finance Agency.  I am pleased that there is a substantial demand for the loans being provided under that agency.  I have already stated in this House that I was disappointed that the new Government decided to reduce the amount of capital available under that scheme for the figures proposed in the Estimates published by the outgoing Government &mdash; a reduction of £10 million.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that the loans available under the Housing Finance Agency can be quite expensive on the applicant when one looks at the total amount which will have to be repaid over the full period of the loan.  People who are willing and anxious to obtain loans under the Housing Finance Agency will find in succeeding years that they will become less and less attractive to them.  Because of their financial circumstances at the moment they are prepared to enter into an agreement to obtain the loan.  Over the period of the loan the cost is much greater to him than it would have been if he had obtained the loan under the Local Loans Fund scheme because of the level of repayments required under that scheme.</P>
    <P>It would not be fair of the Minister to make too much of the fact that the Housing Finance Agency have now been established and therefore he may happily reduce the capital available for the Local <Col N="264" /> Loans Fund and refuse to increase the limits.  That would be very bad social thinking.  I appeal to the Minister to continue to update the level of the loan and the income limits which applied, as has been the practice over the years.  There is a direct relationship between the drop in the number of people applying for the loans and delays by various Ministers in increasing the limits.  The loan limits can become meaningless when there is high inflation.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister of State to tell us why this scheme is operated under his Department.  What special role has he to play in the work of the Department of the Environment?  He has separate responsibilities.  When I was Minister it puzzled me why the Minister did not have full control over schemes whether water, sewerage, public housing or whatever. The Minister for the Environment is restrained by the Department of Finance. I suggest the Minister should have autonomy in his Department and full control over the financial allocations which have been agreed by the Government.  He should have full discretion with regard to releasing these moneys during the year. After all, the Dáil voted these moneys to the Minister for the Environment and not to the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  I am sure Deputy Bermingham is surprised to be bringing in this Bill because he has nothing whatever to do with the programme for housing, water or sewerage schemes operated through the Department of the Environment or the local authorities.  We are willing to give our support to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what I have to say has already been said by Deputy Molloy. I protest in the strongest possible way at the fact that the Minister for the Environment or his Minister of State have not found it possible to be in the House.  This is a debate which concerns them and in just another example of the ridiculous situation which pertains in the House with regard to procedures.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Board of Works introduced this Bill.  I mean no <Col N="265" /> disrespect to the Minister of State but I cannot see what involvement he has with the Department of the Environment.  The expenditure of money from this fund is the most important function of the Department of the Environment.  The Minister for the Environment is treating the House very badly when he does not consider it worth his while to stay in the House for this short debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but I am concerned about the way in which money is being spent from the fund.  Why did the Minister find it necessary to reduce the money coming from this fund by £32.4 million? On 12 May I put a question to the Minister for the Environment.  I asked him the reason why the estimated expenditure for 1983 for SDA loans was £74.5 million in view of the fact that the 1982 allocation was £106.5 million and if he would ensure that this trend of reducing expenditure on SDA loans and replacing it with Housing Finance Agency loans will not continue.  The reply I received was that the reduction in SDA loans reflected an expectation that some borrowers would opt for loans from the Housing Finance Agency in preferance to SDA loans in view of the higher loans available and the most attractive repayment terms in the early years.</P>
      <P>As we all know, thousands of young people have been able to build their own homes in rural Ireland with the aid of an SDA loan.  If they had not done this the State would have had to pick up a large tab for the construction of more local authority and corporation houses.  I view with the greatest concern the decision to phase out SDA loans and replace them with totally unattractive Housing Finance Agency loans.  I am opposed to them.  A married couple between them must earn less than £7,000 per annum in order to qualify for an SDA loan and that explains the slick answer given by the Minister when he said some borrowers would opt for loans from the Housing Finance Agency.  They have no option but to do so because the Minister has refused to increase the income limit which is totally unrealistic.  He has also refused to increase the amount of loan available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> This was an attractive loan with a 12 ½ per cent fixed interest rate.</P>
    <P>The Housing Finance Agency loan is totally regressive.  I accept that repayments in the early years are low but they are tied to inflation.  A young person borrowing £22,000 will find, because of interest, that he owes the Department £60,000 in ten years' time.  The position could well be that the debt would far outstrip the asset.  That is not acceptable.  A young married couple should expect to have the burden eased in ten years' time when they have a growing family.  When they should be using their money to educate their children they will have a rope around their neck because 18 per cent of their income will be linked to inflation.</P>

      <P>I object in the strongest possible terms to the way in which this money is being spent and the way the Department of the Environment have found it necessary to remove the SDA loan using such a back door method.  It is no wonder that the Government find pickets at every gate because of the way they are treating the House.  The Minister or his Minister of State should have been here this morning to discuss aspects of this Bill.  It is frustrating to be in the House.  Anything important is ruled out, why I never understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the increase in the Local Loans Fund.  It enabled many young people to buy their own property. Reference was made by the previous speaker to the elimination of the SDA loan which was extremely beneficial in <Col N="267" /> the past.  There is no doubt that. However, it was highly subsidised and we cannot afford that now.  I do not agree that the Housing Finance Agency loan has no merit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a considerable measure of merit in the Housing Finance Agency loan and perhaps with a few minor improvements it could be a good deal better.  The Opposition when in Government discontinued what I regarded as an exceptional measure in making funds available for house purchase. I refer to the low-rise mortgage scheme.  However, Fianna Fáil realise now that that was a mistake but the Housing Finance Agency have taken up the slack in that regard.  This body has been very valuable in terms of helping people to acquire their own homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill and support its passage through the House.  However, I cannot agree with what has been said by Deputy Dowling regarding SDA loans.  Representing a Dublin constituency and being a member also of a local authority I regret very much that the Government seem to be taking the course of abolishing the SDA loan scheme, a scheme that has served the people well throughout the country but particularly in Dublin.  I shall not attempt to refer to the HFA loan scheme since the Chair has ruled on that except to say that the Government appear to favour the HFA loan as against the SDA loan.  This is very regrettable.  It is obvious that Deputy Dowling does not have a HFA loan.  he does not seem to be aware of the many problems associated with that kind of loan.</P>

      <P>I did not start the argument but I might say that when you were on this side of the House you got a fair bit of mileage out of that, too.  It is regrettable that the Government should take the course of phasing out SDA loans.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the low-rise mortgage scheme.  So far as I can recall this applied only to local authority tenants or to people on local authority housing lists.  There were not a great number of applications under that scheme.</P>

      <P>I should like to inquire as to the amount of money local authorities are getting for the payment of these loans.  We all realise how beneficial is the SDA loan.  It would appear that local authorities in general have a backlog of applications for such loans but that the money is not becoming available readily. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the money in this respect reaches the local authorities so that it can be paid to <Col N="269" /> the large number of people who are waiting for the loans.</P>
      <P>I would be very concerned that the SDA loan scheme would be undermined in any way by lack of funding.  This type of loan is the most beneficial that young people particularly can avail of.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could publicise the fact that local authorities have large numbers of private sites for sale which I expect are reasonably priced compared with the open market value.  If more publicity were given to this situation and more money made available we would be in a position to help many young people waiting for SDA loans.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions but I would emphasise that this is a very limited Bill, that it is merely an enabling measure to raise the statutory limit on issues from the fund which provides the mechanism for channelling funds to local authorities. The Bill provides for an increase of £1 billion to meet the requirements of the next two or three years but I must stress that the new limit has no implications for programmes financed under the fund. The amounts of the funds allocated to each capital programme is a matter for Government decision and is determined by expenditure policy in force at the time. Comments on the precise level of funding for particular services are matters that should be raised appropriately during the debate on the Estimate for the relevant Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were reaching the stage where it became necessary to raise the limit of the amount of money that can be paid out. Similar steps were taken in 1980 and prior to that in 1978.  I am not prepared to take a debate on the Department of the Environment. I am bringing in a bill merely to ensure that we have statutory legislation to advance the moneys being provided this year and which will be provided next year and the year after.  Of the total expenditure, the allocation of 98 per cent is decided by the Department of the Environment.  There are other Departments involved, too.  Deputy Molloy asked why the Office of Public Works should administer the fund.  Traditionally <Col N="270" /> that has been the procedure and I might add that during his time as Minister for Local Government the Deputy, in introducing Bills to raise the limit, did not attempt to change that procedure.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to have the Deputy's suggestion examined. The Department of Transport are involved also in that they are financed in some instances under this legislation. Previously some Department of Education projects were financed too under the legislation.  That is why perhaps the Office of Public Works have been administering the funds down through the years.  Deputy Kitt made the point about delays.  There are statutory requirements to be complied with by the local authorities before funds are paid out.  When these requirements are complied with I will ensure that the moneys are paid promptly.  The reason for this Bill is that we could reach a stage during this summer where the limit would be reached if we did not have the legislation.  I have no function in the amounts of money provided by the local authorities or in the manner of limits on SDA loans.  That is a matter entirely for the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <P>In his budget statement the Minister for Finance informed us that £35 million extra was being raised through the Housing Finance Agency.  In fact the total amount being increased for all finance for housing purposes in 1983 is only £3.86 million.  How can the Minister state today that there is a substantial increase in the total amount of mortgage finance available, despite the fact that in my view, there is only a £3.86 million increase available to all loans.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It has often been said in recent years that local authorities have become over dependent on the State for their revenue and have resorted to coming cap-in-hand seeking assistance from the State.  This is an unfair reflection on local authorities. The facts are that the State imposed on the local authorities the obligation to give relief of rates in respect of domestic premises and certain other premises under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978, and took upon itself to compensate the authorities in full for the cost of the reliefs given.  In order to protect itself from unreasonable rate increases and consequent demands on the Exchequer, the Government of the time took to itself power to limit the increases in rate poundage levels, and this power has been exercised each year from 1978 to 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the local authorities' main source of revenue thus brought effectively under central control and with their independence and discretion in relation to financial matters largely removed, it became commonplace to hear them criticised for being a drain on the resources of the State and called on to cut back on expenditure and on services.  There is no doubt that meeting the cost of rates reliefs has become a major demand on the Exchequer and that the demand is especially difficult to accommodate at a time of severe economic difficulty.  But the local authorities cannot be blamed for that situation. I am not suggesting that local authorities can be in any way relieved of the prime need, which is relevant to all public bodies under present conditions, to curtail their expenditures by all practicable means, consistent with giving effect to their responsibilities, and to <Col N="274" /> ensure that their programmes are carried out with efficiency.  That being said, the time has come to set the record straight as to how the local authority finances have come to be as dependent as they are on central provision, and to set about restoring to them a proper degree of financial independence.  I have already taken one step in this direction by leaving it to the local authorities to decide for themselves on the level of the local rate increase for 1983.  This Bill represents another step along the way.</P>
    <P>The central purpose of the Bill is straightforward.  It will give local authorities a general discretionary power to charge for the services which they provide, where they lack such power at present. It will remove restrictions on charges specified in existing enactments.  The services for which charges will be made and the levels of charges will be left to the discretion of the local authorities. This is an important feature of the Bill. As Deputies know, standard charges have been introduced for planning applications under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1982. Because of the nature of that particular service it is necessary that the relevant charges should be standardised for all areas.  There is no good reason, however, why the charges to be introduced under this Bill should be fixed centrally.  On the contrary it is desirable that the local authorities should have a discretion so that account can be taken of what is needed, and what is fair and reasonable, and also of the best means of applying the powers in the local circumstances.  In line with the provision for an increased local revenue for local authorities the Bill will amend the provisions of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978 dealing with the payment of grants in respect of rates reliefs.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide a general framework for the arrangements for local charges, which has not been there before. At the moment, there is a variety of provisions relating to charges and there are many anomalies.  While in general local authorities have power to make charges, there are cases where there is no power in law to charge, there are cases <Col N="275" /> where charges for particular services are specifically prohibited, and there are even a few cases where charges are specified in Acts of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before us will have the effect of overriding provisions which have led to such anomalies.</P>
    <P>The basic responsibility for deciding on the amount to be raised by charges will fall to be exercised by the council members in the context of their decisions on the estimates.  It will be the function of the manager to give effect to those decisions in terms of the specific levels of charge to be applied.  This arrangement of functions is in line with that already existing including that relating to the determination and operation of existing charges.  There is no question, therefore, of taking from the elected members the fundamental policy role and responsibility which they have at present.  Moreover, there is a well-developed tradition of consultation and communication between the councils and managers in regard to the exercise of local authority functions. I expect that there will be appropriate advice and consultation between them in the implementation of this legislation as well.</P>
    <P>The meaning of the expression &ldquo;service&rdquo;, for the purpose of this Bill is defined in section 1.  This definition has been framed so as to cover the widest possible range of the services which are provided and to give local authorities power to charge for any of these services. The range of services is, however, confined to those provided on an individual basis, or, in the words of the Bill, &ldquo;to any person or in respect of any premises&rdquo;. This means that services, such as street lighting, which are provided on a general or community wide basis are outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the approach which has been adopted in this Bill is to give local authorities a general power to charge where they lack such power at present.  This is done in section 2 of the Bill which provides that any existing enactment which requires or enables a local authority to provide a service, but which does not contain a power to charge <Col N="276" /> for the service, shall be deemed to empower the authority to so charge.  This power to charge will apply even where the existing enactment does not allow of charges being made.  Under this section, statutory restrictions on the level of charges will be removed.  The effect of these provisions will be to supersede all the provisions which currently restrict local authorities from charging for services or from charging realistic amounts.</P>
    <P>I know that local authorities will welcome the additional powers which they will have under section 2 to make realistic charges.  I know, too, that they will welcome the discretion which they will have under section 3 to determine different rates of charge in respect of different classes of consumers or of services.  This will enable account to be taken of such criteria as rateable valuation, type of premises, quality or frequency of service and so on and, when taken with the provision for payments by instalment in section 6, will provide a considerable flexibility.</P>
    <P>Despite this flexibility, I am fully aware that there will be cases of persons who will not be able, because of their circumstances, to pay charges, even with the provision for instalments.  I have, therefore, provided in section 5 for waiver of charges on grounds of personal hardship. The Bill does not attempt to define those grounds or to restrict the exercise of this power because this is an area where the decisions must be made on the basis of local knowledge and experience.  I have no doubt that local authorities will adopt a humane and considerate approach in dealing with any cases of genuine hardship and I am sure the local authorities will approach the question of waivers in that spirit.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the question of water charges is dealt with separately in section 8.  The existing law provides for the making of charges for water except for water supplied for domestic purposes by urban sanitary authorities.  It also contains provisions relating to the administration of these charges.  With the abolition of domestic rates, the justification for the separate treatment of urban areas <Col N="277" /> has disappeared.  Indeed this situation is now unjust as well as anomalous.  It means that those in the urban areas have enjoyed greater benefit from the domestic rate grant than those in county areas. It also means, for example, that corporation or urban council tenants' houses in a county area are paying the county council a substantial water charge in many cases while the corporation or urban council themselves have no entitlement to such revenue from any householders in their own area.  It has been decided, therefore, to extend the existing law to cover all water charges.  We are also availing of this opportunity to provide for payment of water charges by instalment and for waiver of these charges.</P>
    <P>Section 8 also removes certain restrictions on the level of charges specified in existing enactments or agreements.  This is necessary to overcome a situation where Dublin Corporation are required under old laws and agreements to provide water to consumers in certain districts outside their administrative area at charges which bear no relationship to today's values.  There is no justification for continuing this situation, hence the provisions in section 8.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the central control of rate poundage increase was a blow to the independence of local authorities.  I feel that the need to protect the Exchequer could have been met in a more flexible and imaginative way.  I believe we are now moving in that direction for 1983 by allowing local authorities to decide for themselves on the rate to be fixed for those who pay rates by giving them the additional powers to charge contained in this Bill, and by limiting in a corresponding degree the amounts of rates support grants.  The necessary amendment of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978 to validate the current arrangements in relation to the domestic rate support grant, to cover the shortfall in this grant in 1982, and to make consequential provisions in relation to rates, is contained in section 9 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>While I am on the question of rates, I would like to refer to various suggestions that the introduction of a wider range of <Col N="278" /> charges for services is in effect a reintroduction of rates by the back door.  I want to make it absolutely clear that this is not the intention and will not be the effect of this Bill.  What we are doing is essentially up-dating, extending and adapting to modern circumstances, the legal basis for direct charges for services which have always been a feature of local finance and which, over the years, have existed side by side with the rating system.</P>
    <P>As I say, I believe we are on the right track in getting back towards a sensible system of local authority financing but I would not claim that all that is needed can be done at once.  We are in a transitional phase.  We must look beyond the immediate problems and try to devise a system of local authority financing which will satisfy the basic needs for the medium and longer terms.  These include the need for adequacy of funds for the various programmes; the need for a significant degree of local financial independence and discretion, and the need to limit the demands on central funds for local services.  As I said in my recent Estimates statement, I am arranging for a special examination of this matter to be undertaken in my Department at present.</P>
    <P>The question of charges is one which has been discussed in local government circles over a long number of years and one to which the present Opposition have declared their commitment on many occasions.  I feel sure, therefore, that these proposals will have the full support of this House and I look forward to a constructive and positive debate.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill contains the Coalition's long promised proposals to give power to local authorities to make charges for services they provide to individuals and to premises owned by individuals. We on this side of the House recognise the need to broaden the revenue base of local authorities.  We agree that local authorities should have the power to charge for services to supplement present revenue sources.  However, we are concerned at the far-reaching proposals <Col N="279" /> contained in this Bill which will have very serious consequences.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains three major proposals: firstly, that the Minister will notify each local authority as soon as possible of the amount of the annual Exchequer grant and the local authority must then make provision by way of charges to make up any shortfall between the amount of the grant and the amount of the rate relief local authorities are required to give under sections 3, 4 or 6 of the 1978 Act.  Secondly, this Bill proposes that the decision to levy charges and the introduction of a waiver scheme will be an executive function, that is that it will be a managerial function, that the elected members will have no say whatsoever in the levying of the charge or in the operation of the waiver scheme.  The third major proposal is the removal of the obligation on the Minister to recoup to local authorities a specific amount in lieu of the domestic rate as provided for in the 1978 Act.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes the introduction of radical new local taxation measures without dealing with the most urgent problem facing local authorities of having to pay for services provided by other public bodies, such as health charges and welfare payments to which local authorities must contribute, drainage maintenance charges which they must pay to the Office of Public Works and the payment of education grants which is a charge on local authorities because the Department of Education delay in recouping the money.  Many local authorities carry heavy overdrafts because of this.  One could refer to other areas where local authorities are being asked to fund schemes for which they have no direct responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill enables the Minister to require the manager to levy charges for services which would generate revenue equal to the combined poundage of the domestic and agricultural rates, irrespective of the wishes of the local authority members. This is a serious prospect and represents a major change in taxation legislation, opening up a whole new area where additional penal taxes will be levied by <Col N="280" /> ministerial action through the county manager.  We are very unhappy with the main provisions of the Bill and go so far as to question the Government's decision to delay Dáil debate on this Bill until the prescribed time for the preparation of estimates has passed.  The Minister prescribed the final date for the preparation of estimates as 15 May 1983.  We are now at the beginning of June and this is the first occasion on which the local authority members have an opportunity to hear what is behind this Bill.  Different impressions have been given at local authority meetings throughout the country as to the power of members and statements by the Minister on numerous occasions have given the impression that the power to levy charges will be a reserved function of elected members.  This is not true.  We are concerned because the Minister is proposing a fundamental change in the method of financing local authorities which will have far-reaching effects.</P>
    <P>When the idea was first mooted the public were led to believe that the Government were extending the power of local authorities to enable them to make charges for some of the services they were providing.  This was first advocated by Deputy Peter Barry when he was Minister for the Environment. Assurances were given that this would not be the reintroduction of rates by another means and the Minister has reiterated that assurance today.  It rings hollow when one examines the extent of the power which the Minister and the manager will have under this Bill.  When Deputy Barry advocated the levying of charges for services it sounded reasonabble that local authorities should have power to charge for some of the services they provide in order to supplement their income, and some local authorities had already been charging small sums for services which they were making available to individuals.  The thrust of Deputy Barry's proposal was that the power to levy charges would represent an additional revenue source for local authorities but we now see the Minister's intention to replace the existing revenue source by the introduction of charges.</P>
    <P>It is clear that as time goes by the <Col N="281" /> Minister will rely and more on the provisions of this Bill to fund all the services provided by local authorities by way of charges on householders.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>...I would not claim that all that is needed can be done at once.  We are in a transitional phase.</P>
    <P>The transition is the Minister's intention to enable most, if not all, local authority services to be paid for by charges levied on householders and others.</P>
    <P>It was felt when this idea was first mooted that the revenue from these charges would help local authorities overcome some of their financial difficulties. We must remember the assurances given that these charges did not represent the reintroduction of rates in a different form.  The local authorities have had financial difficulties in each year since the obligation to collect the domestic rate was abolished under the 1978 Act.  That Act made provision for a direct grant in lieu of the domestic rate to be paid to local authorities and also made provision to limit the rate poundage that could be struck by each local authority.  There were two reasons for this, the first being to provide the local authorities with the money they would otherwise have obtained if rates on houses had continued. The second reason was to put a ceiling on the level of the rate poundage which could be struck in order to protect the owners of commercial property who would continue to pay rates.  Once the restriction on the level of domestic rate was removed from local authority estimate meetings there was the belief that there might be some maverick local authorities who, not being answerable to householders who would represent the bulk of their electorate, might seek to impose penal charges on the owners of commercial property.  It was thought fitting therefore to place a limit on rate poundage to protect such people.  The Minister is now removing the obligation on a local authority to limit rate poundage and they can proceed to impose a high level of rate poundage on commercial and non-domestic property.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Minister is not <Col N="282" /> providing the local authority with money in lieu of these rates.  He is telling them that he will provide them with a fixed grant and they will have to make up the difference themselves by way of the introduction of charges for services.  The Minister can in future reduce the amount of the direct grant because it is not related to any specific amount and there is no base year.  In reducing it substantially each year he is increasing the obligation for higher charges at local level.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether council members or the public generally are aware of the full implications of this Bill.  There is reference in the Minister's speech to provisions in existing legislation for the levying of charges for services.  As I have stated the level of charges for services up to now has been very low and it was almost recognised under the Acts under which those charges were levied that they were merely an additional minor source of revenue for the local authority.  Here we have a proposal where the charges are intended to become a main source of finance to the local authorities in the years ahead.  There will be this major transition &mdash; the Minister said we are in a transitional phase &mdash; and it is obviously the Minister's intention that this transition will take place over the years with the result that a very heavy imposition on householders and others will take place in each local authority area.  This will become a major new source of revenue to local authorities and it is nothing less than the introduction of new local taxation which will have far reaching effects.</P>
    <P>As I said, the public were led to believe these local authority charges for services would supplement the existing revenue and the levy would be at the discretion of the members in each area.  In fact neither of these things has been done.  It could be accepted as reasonable, and was by most fair-minded members of the public, that local authorities might charge something to supplement their income, because, with the fixed level of grant emanating from the Department since domestic rates were abolished and in view of the fact that the limit which the Minister put on the rate poundage did not allow fully for the rate of inflation <Col N="283" /> and for the increase in costs which took place affecting the services which local authorities were providing, a deficit appeared and there was general agreement that there was need for some measures to be introduced to deal with that ever-increasing deficit.  It was suggested that a charge for services would be sufficient to allow local authorities the discretion to provide themselves with additional revenue, thus eliminating these deficits but, rather than that simple procedure, we now find it is the Minister's intention not just to provide them with money to deal with the deficit between his grant and the increase in costs locally but to replace his grant completely eventually.</P>
    <P>This Bill supplants the existing Exchequer revenue sources with direct charges to local householders in replacement of existing Exchequer revenue funding as provided for in section 9 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 35) Act, 1978.  The Minister also proposes that all decisions in relation to the levying of charges shall be solely at the discretion of the manager.  The Minister referred to that in his opening speech in which he says:</P>
    <P>The basic responsibility for deciding on the amount to be raised by charges will fall to be exercised by the council members in the context of their decisions on the estimates.</P>
    <P>Any normal person reading that could not but come to the conclusion that the Minister is stating that the basic responsibility for deciding on the amount of the charges will be that of the elected council members.  That is what is there in black and white.  But that is not what is in the Bill.  That is a complete contradiction of the terms of the Bill.  In a circular which the Minister issued to county managers on 10 May 1983 &mdash; it is numbered FIN 9/83, page 3, No. 10, under the heading of &ldquo;Functions&rdquo;&mdash; the wording used by the Minister when explaining his Bill to county managers is quite different from his explanation here.  He uses much more straightforward language:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> The charges functions assigned to local authorities under the Bill will as executive functions fall to be performed by the manager.</P>
    <P>In his opening speech to the House this morning he says the basic responsibility for deciding on charges will fall to be exercised by the council members.</P>

      <P>Let the Deputy read it. Why not stand up here and say exactly what the Government are doing?  Why does the Minister not tell the elected representatives of local authorities clearly what he intends to do?  Why has he not done so up to now?  Why does he continue to give the impression that elected members will have this as a reserved function: the decision would be theirs to decide on the level of the charges.  That is the impression he gave. In his speech here today, and I want to pinpoint the difference in the language he uses here and the language he uses outside the House when he has attended public functions.  In the document he sent to the county managers he states specifically that it is their function and the members will have no power whatsoever to decide on the level of the charges or whether any charge should be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I oppose that very positively and, unless there is some indication from the Minister of a change of mind here, we shall have to vote against this when the time comes.  It is quite clear that the locally elected members will have no say whatsoever as to when charges are to be introduced or the amount of such charges.  We agree in principle to broadening the revenue base of local authorities and we could support the Bill if that were all that was asked for but there are fundamental aspects here to which we are opposed.  One is the removal of the obligation on the Exchequer to recoup the amount of domestic charges to be at the sole discretion of the county manager. We believe the commitment to recoup domestic rates should not be <Col N="285" /> reneged upon.  The present arrangement should continue whereby the Minister is required under section 9 of the 1978 Act to recoup local authorities an amount equal to the revenue on domestic rates.</P>
    <P>The existing arrangements have operated fairly satisfactorily and should continue. The limit on the rate to be struck acted as a safeguard to owners of industrial and business property which was not derated.  That, of course, is now being removed by the Minister.  Any charges levied should supplement existing revenue sources and whatever requirements are necessary should be introduced to facilitate this.  It is well within the competence of the Minister and his Department to devise a means whereby there would be a relationship in the amount of the direct grant from the Department and the amount which previously would have been collected under the previous rating system.</P>
    <P>Unless there is some device, whether a continuation of the existing provisions of section 9 of the 1978 Act or some other device which the Minister may come forward with in the course of the debate, then we are entering into a situation where in each succeeding year the Minister, now no longer bound to recoup local authorities the amount of the rate on domestic houses, will be able to reduce substantially the amount of the grant from his Department.  He will thereby increase the amount to be collected locally through the charges.  The charges he suggests this year should bring in £65 million.  I would like him to indicate whether there is any possibility at this stage of the £65 million being collected in 1983.  I have not the information that the Minister would have on every local authority but those about which I have information have not been levying the type of charge which the Minister was suggesting initially and a very substantially reduced charge has been introduced where one has been introduced at all. There is now a serious doubt as to whether the amount, which the Minister estimated at £65 million, will, in fact, be collected in the various local authority areas.  The Minister might refer to that matter when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> As I mentioned, the level of rate limit fixed in the past allowed for increases, in some years 12 per cent, in some years 11 per cent and in some years 10 per cent. In 1982, the figure was 15 per cent.  These fixed amounts were paid to the local authority in lieu of the domestic and agricultural rates.  This year the amount recouped is in many counties substantially lower.  I think there was some mistake made in the Galway allocation.  At one stage the manager estimated that the amount being recouped in lieu of the rates to the local authority was 3 per cent. There was some small increase afterwards which may have brought it up some percentage points but it was not a great deal over 3 per cent.  So, they had got 15 per cent last year and 10, 11 and 12 per cent in previous years.  Following this change the recoupment was down nearly as low as 3 per cent but I understand that the rate that the manager in that county is proposing should be struck shows an increase of 20 per cent on commercial and industrial properties because the limit has been removed.  So, the Minister's contribution is decreasing and the contribution of owners of commercial and industrial properties is being increased very substantially and, of course, in many cases these people will also be asked to pay for the services for which an individual charge is about to be imposed.  It is a continuation of this Government's obsession with taxation. One wonders where it will lead.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a deliberate attempt on the part of Government to stifle initiative and enterprise, to choke it with taxes and at the same time a refusal on the part of the Government to replace with Government funds the investment lost by their own action.  So, we are in this terrible recession and the Government are making matters worse and are contributing to a substantial increase in unemployment which is the biggest single crisis facing the country now and for the years ahead.  It is difficult to see how the Government's policy will succeed in creating new jobs in the years ahead because of the many punitive measures they are introducing and which act as a serious disincentive to investment in every sector <Col N="287" /> of the commercial and industrial life of the country and which also affect wage earners in the levels of PAYE, PRSI, charges for services, the huge increases in VAT and the continuous flood of taxation increases.  The community are becoming punch drunk from tax increases and unless there is a re-think on the Government's part the prospects for the nation are not bright.  However, that is for another day's debate.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill proposes the introduction of radical new local taxation measures.  It enables the Minister to require the manager to levy charges for services which will generate revenue equal to the combined poundage of the domestic and agricultural rates.  That is a very serious proposition.  There is evidence that the Government are obsessed with taxation.  Every possible means is devised to extract contributions to the Exchequer out of the wage earner's pocket.  This Bill represents a major change in taxation legislation and opens up a new era where additional penal taxes can be levied.  The Exchequer obligations to fund local authorities as laid down in existing legislation are being removed in this Bill.  The effect is, of course, to leave an open-ended situation where the Minister can apply the squeeze and the county manager must respond while the elected members of local authorities look on and play no useful role in the imposition of taxation other than to observe the manager's actions.</P>
    <P>Our other major objection is to the decision to make the levying of taxation an executive function.  The Ceann Comhairle will agree that this is a complete negation of local democracy.  It is the opposite to everything the Minister's party and the Coalition parties have stated in this House and in policy documents over the years.  It is dishonest to suggest that the proposals in this Bill represent a devolution of power to local authorities.  In a democracy the power to levy taxes must always lie with the elected representatives of the people.  There should be no taxation without representation. The elected representatives of this parliament will never allow the civil <Col N="288" /> service to decide taxation measures.  The elected members of local authorities should not be expected to allow city and county managers to decide taxation measures in their local authority areas.</P>
    <P>I understand that the General Council of County Councils made a draft available to the Minister on their ideas of financing and the powers of local authorities. I do not know whether the Minister has made any response to the suggestion as yet.  In their submissions they quote from an ESRI report on local taxation &mdash; No. 84 &mdash; the following extract:</P>
    <P>The arguments that are advanced in favour of maintaining a significant role for local taxation as a source of finance for local expenditure seem to require that genuine accountability and answerability in fiscal matters to a local electorate exist and this in turn seems to require that the local authority at the very least controls the rate at which local taxes are levied.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that the manager is the local authority.  The legislation is drafted in such a way that the Minister can say that when he refers to the local authority he is referring to the manager but most members of the public feel when the Minister makes reference to the local authority that he is referring to the elected members. Many people do not understand the division of power that exists at local authority level between the manager and the members.</P>
    <P>If there is one power that I and members on this side of the House consider to be essentially a matter for the members of local authorities as distinct from the manager, it must be the power to levy any form of taxation.  The introduction of these new charges cannot be considered as anything other than taxation.  If we are imposing new charges we are imposing new taxation and all decisions in relation to their introduction and the level at which they are imposed should be made only by the elected members.  The members of Fine Gael and Labour who form the Coalition Government should realise that if they support this Bill they are destroying a long-standing principle which has applied in regard to taxation <Col N="289" /> measures not just in this democracy but in most democracies throughout the world.  One cannot equate the previous provisions for the charging for services, which represented a very minor amount of money, with the provisions in this Bill to levy charges which will bring in amounts equal to the rate poundage.  We are talking about very heavy levels of taxation.  It cannot be called anything other than taxation, penal taxation, in fact, as will be proved to be the case.</P>
    <P>We find ourselves in the position that in general we subscribe to the principle that local authorities should have the power to charge for services but only to supplement their income, to supplement existing revenue sources.  One of the principal sources of revenue has been the direct grant from the Department.  In abolishing section 9 the Minister is abolishing the Exchequer obligation to continue to fund local authorities in that way. He is replacing it with a very unsatisfactory instrument which will be the cause of much dispute at local authority meetings in the years ahead.  It is well known throughout the local authority service that county managers and senior officials in local authorities were opposed at the outset to the introduction of these charges.  They held special meetings and insisted they would resist them.  However, their resistance melted overnight. As I understand it, a meeting was held between the managers and the Minister &mdash;I am open to correction on this because I was not present &mdash; and at that meeting the Minister gave an assurance to the managers that they would have the authority to decide on the charges; in other words, it would be an executive function.  Once they got that commitment from the Minister their resistance disappeared. They realised that when the Minister had got his Bill through the Dáil they would have one of the most powerful weapons county managers had got in their hands since the establishment of the county managerial system.</P>
    <P>County managers have not said one word in opposition to the levy of these charges, whereas all last year they were very unhappy and critical of the notion <Col N="290" /> that they should have to impose charges. Their opposition disappeared because they got their way with this Minister and with this Government.  Under a Fianna Fáil Government they would not have got this power.  Fianna Fáil would have ensured that the true principles of taxation would have applied: no taxation without representation.  A county manager is not elected by anyone.  Taxation should be levied only by those who have to face the electorate, who have to put their names on the ballot paper for election or rejection.  They are entitled to levy taxation because they are answerable to the people.  A county manager is well protected within the system, where he cannot be made answerable to any section for his actions, other than if he absconded with money or if he broke the law in some other way.  However, he will now have power to levy charges on the people.  I know the Minister's answer will be that the estimates have to be adopted by the council members but that is a weak response.  The Minister has diluted the whole principle of the levying of taxation and I say shame on him for doing it.  On this side of the House we will not support him in this matter.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have had financial difficulties.  It would have been satisfactory to allow them to bring in these charges if the existing sources of revenue were to continue so that they could overcome their financial difficulties by levying charges as was originally intended and as was originally understood before this major change took place.  They would have been able to meet their full financial commitments by the levying of these charges.  They would have been able to work off their overdrafts and possibly to recoup the health boards and the Office of Public Works from whom money is being withheld.  The financing of local authorities is in a critical state.  The Minister knows that many of them have only been able to strike a rate by refusing to pay the health boards or the Office of Public Works for drainage works carried out by that office.  They have statutory obligations to pay other public bodies moneys for services in which local authorities themselves are not directly involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> In this House it is difficult to get time to bring in reforming legislation but it is in this area that the Minister should have been concentrating his energy and his thoughts.  There is a great need for new legislation, for reform of the local taxation system and the financing of local authorities.  That area is full of anomalies and it is the cause of much frustration to members of local authorities that they continue to be burdened with these charges.  They existed when Fianna Fáil were in office and when the former National Coalition Government were in office.  These statutory obligations have been with local authorities for 30 years. I find the Minister is inclined to answer points by saying that similar situations existed when Fianna Fáil were in office. We are here to try to improve the system and if we can do that jointly everyone will thank us for it.  However, nobody will thank us for dealing with small, petty political points across the floor of the House.  I am anxious to make a positive contribution and to assist the Minister to improve the operations of local authorities. That is the matter we are discussing here and for which he has responsibility.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had proceeded along the lines we intended and which were originally enunciated by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Peter Barry, it would have been possible to do some of these things.  It would have been possible for local authorities to consider expanding existing services and the introduction of new services.  They could have facilitated the implementation of new legislation.  We passed legislation dealing with litter but the local authorities did not get any substantial funds to implement the main provisions in that Act.  We also passed legislation with regard to water pollution but, again, very little money was given to implement it.  The effectiveness of such worthwhile progressive legislation has not been seen on the ground because local authorities have not had the funds to administer properly the new legislation.  We had long and useful debates in this House on these various measures but when the measures passed into law the local authorities were able to <Col N="292" /> make only a token gesture towards their implementation because of their financial situation.</P>
    <P>It was thought in view of the new charges being imposed that the extra revenue would allow local authorities to be more positive about legislation.  At the moment they cannot carry out fully their responsibilities in this area.  The point is that we are not getting extra revenue under this proposal.  We are replacing existing revenue sources and that is the kernel of the Minister's intention.  What started out as a good idea to provide local authorities with more financial freedom to undertake new services, to expand existing services, to carry out their responsibilities more fully and to meet their financial obligations in a realistic way has come to nothing.  All the great hopes have been dashed.</P>
    <P>A useful progressive measure has been transformed into an instrument that will replace the responsibility of the Exchequer to fund local authorities in lieu of domestic and agricultural rates which this House abolished.  In doing so this House placed an obligation on the Exchequer to fund local authorities in respect of those amounts.  In deciding that, this House proposed to change the onus from direct taxation such as rates to indirect taxation by way of funding through the Exchequer, with the Exchequer collecting the money by way of VAT and PAYE.  These forms of taxation were increased substantially to fund the Exchequer in order to enable it to replace the moneys the local authorities had obtained through the rates.  We have suffered the increase in taxation but now we are going to impose charges locally and relieve the Exchequer of the responsibility of funding the local authorities.  At the same time, the Exchequer will not make a corresponding reduction in the increase of taxation introduced to provide that money.  It is a continuation of this wave of taxation measures which the Government are hell bent on imposing on the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware that local authorities regard the full cost of domestic rate relief as being the responsibility of the Exchequer.  Any additional charge to be levied to relieve Exchequer liability <Col N="293" /> can only be seen as rates introduced under a different guise.  No words of the Minister can change the reality of that, the Minister is now reneging on the Exchequer responsibility and in doing so he cannot expect the support of this party unless a commitment is given in this Bill to pay a fixed amount each year in lieu of domestic and agricultural rates, otherwise the managers' charges will be used to replace the rates as the main source of local authority revenue.</P>
    <P>In regard to the charges themselves I would like to ask the Minister some questions. Could he clarify whether he proposes that any of these charges could be imposed on a country-wide basis without regard to whether the householder has the benefits of the service for which he is being charged?  Otherwise it would seem that the local authority may introduce a charge only where a person is benefiting from a service provided by the local authority.  I would like the Minister to clarify that that is so and that if I have the benefit of a refuse collection and the local authority decide that they will introduce a charge for refuse collection I will be obliged to pay it.  If I am in an area where there is no refuse collection will I in any way be charged for a service from which I am not benefiting?  It would seem that that could not be so, but you never know with legislation.  I would like to hear the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>I would like him also to clarify whether a householder can opt out.  If I decided that I do not want to pay £30 or £50 a year&mdash;or whatever the figure is; it might be £200 or £300 from the way the Minister is going&mdash;the local authority may decide that I am not a person who would qualify for a waiver.  I may feel that I am not able to pay the charge but the local authority may not agree.  I decide that I do not want the service because I cannot pay the charge and I put the stuff on the back of a trolley and take it off to burn it or dump it myself.  In a case such as that has the householder the right to opt out?  Many people are concerned about this because if a substantial number of householders in a street or an area adopt that attitude and decide to opt out it will not be economically viable for a local authority to <Col N="294" /> continue to provide a refuse collection service in many of these areas and the other householders who had agreed to pay the charge would be without a service.  The Minister must have given some thought to this because the question has been raised in a number of local authorities.  I would like to hear what he proposes in this regard.  I understand that one county manager informed his members that if a certain percentage of householders &mdash; I forget the percentage &mdash; refused to take the service in an area then no such service would be provided. He was referring to refuse collection. Does the Minister agree with that?  Has he made any provision for this type of situation?  How does he propose to collect these charges from people who do not want to pay them?  Is it his intention to bring all of them to court as is provided somewhere in the Bill and will we arrive at a conflict situation over these charges in that way?</P>
    <P>In regard to water supplies in urban areas there is no doubt that the reaction from large sections of the community, people who are already paying what they consider substantial rents for local authority houses, is that they are not at all enamoured of the notion that they should now have to pay up to £50 or £100 to a local authority for water which traditionally has been supplied free of charge to householders in urban areas. Will the Minister turn off the water if the householders refuses to pay the charge or, <i>vice versa,</i> if the householder turns off the stop tap outside his hall door will the liability to pay stop also?</P>
    <P>What administrative arrangements are being entered into at local authority level to ensure the smooth introduction of these charges if the Minister intends to proceed with them?  Who will collect the charges?  Are we establishing a whole new set of employees and range of jobs at local authority level for the collection of these charges, bearing in mind that employed in every local authority are rate collectors who have very little to do following the abolition of house and agricultural rates and also in many local authorities the amount collected in rates and the cost of collecting them?  I recall <Col N="295" /> one local authority area where the cost of collecting the rates was £0.25 million and the amount of rates collected something like £1.2 million.  Where are the economics in the system?  Where is the Minister's intention to ensure efficiency and value for money, as he mentioned in his Estimate speech here some weeks ago?  I have asked these questions in my contributions. Since then I have had no response.</P>
    <P>I ask again what the Minister's intention is with regard to rate collectors. These people are employed at a very substantial salary.  They have a very small workload and their job in many cases can be done in a few weeks or months of the year.  Now we have the Minister's intention to impose the collection of charges on householders.  Who is to collect them? Will the rate collectors be involved in this?  After all, these charges are only replacing the rates and there is no point in saying that that is not so.  What estimates has the Minister got of the cost of collecting these charges to enable us to see the full value to each local authority and the net income to be derived from the charges, having paid the cost of collection and the cost of office work etc. which will arise.</P>
    <P>Also I would like the Minister to inform the House whether public bodies will have to pay these charges.  Will the health boards, hospitals and old people's homes have to pay them?  If so, what provision has been made in the 1983 Estimates to enable them to pay these charges to the local authority?  In the Estimates which have been published has any provision been made for wage increases in this year?  It seems to me an anomaly that no provision is made for wages increase and the Minister is deficit-budgeting in a big way in regard to each local authority in that respect.</P>
    <P>What arrangements will be made exempting certain categories of beneficiaries from the charge and what arrangements will be made under section 5, the waiver of charge on the grounds of personal hardship?  Will this be a reserved function?  I understand that it will.  I intend to put down an amendment along the lines that, as well as the power to <Col N="296" /> decide whether charges will be introduced and the level of the charges being reserved functions, the making of the waiver scheme would be a reserved function. It can be administered by the manager but the scheme itself must be adopted by the elected members.  Section 9 is one of the principal sections of the Bill.  In this section it states that the Minister shall make to a rating authority a grant not exceeding the aggregate of the allowances made by the local authority under sections 3, 4 or 6 of the 1978 Act.</P>
    <P>In reply to Parliamentary Question No. 662 in the Official Report, Volume 342, of 17 May 1983 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Fixed allocations have not been made in respect of rates support grants. In the case of the domestic rates grant, the voted provision for 1983 will be divided among local authorities on the basis of rateable valuations of the relevant domestic property in each area and, in the case of the grant in lieu of rates on land, on a basis equivalent to land valuations.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister state what the exact mathematical formula is on which he made his decisions in regard to the grants to be made in each local authority, because there is no requirement in the Bill to divide a fixed grant in the way in which the Minister stated in reply to the parliamentary question?  The Bill merely says the grant shall not be greater than the aggregate of the allowances in sections 3, 4 or 6 of the 1978 Act.  Section 9 gives the Minister wide discretionary powers in determining the amount of the fixed grant each year.  The parliamentary reply seems to indicate that the amount of the fixed grant is based on rateable valuations of the relavant domestic and agricultural properties but there is no such provision in the Bill and one of our major objections is the fact the this wide discretionary power is available to the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious contradiction in what he informed me on 17 May and what is contained in the Bill.  It is obvious that the Minister can reduce substantially the amount of the grant each year and then direct the manager to impose charges to make up the shortfall.  That is <Col N="297" /> clear from line 17 of subsection (2) which states &ldquo;shall include in such manner as the Minister shall direct a provision in respect of such excess&rdquo;.  That is a very important part of the Bill and gives the Minister power to direct the manager to introduce charges and the members have no say whatsoever.  That is again in contradiction of what the Minister stated when he introduced this Bill.</P>
    <P>In reply to Parliamentary Question No. 662 in the Official Report, Volume 342 of 17 May 1983 I was also informed that local authorities had been given a preliminary estimate for the payments they may expect to receive this year. However, when the Galway County Manager presented his estimates to the members he stated that there would be no upward adjustment of fixed State grant in respect of domestic and agricultural rates during 1983.  Which statement is correct?  Is the Minister right in saying the the estimates he has notified are merely preliminary estimates and that there can be an upward adjustment during the year, or is the Galway County Manager correct in the information he received from the Department that there will not be an upward adjustment of the fixed State grant?</P>
    <P>The local authorities are expected to pay for services for which they have no direct involvement or responsibility. They provide funds for sheep dipping, which is obviously a matter for ACOT to whom that responsibility should be transferred. We would welcome legislation which would carry out major reforms in the local authority system, not this imposition of a tax to replace rates.  The administration and the funding of grants for school meals and higher education are strictly matters for the Department of Education and the local authority should not be involved.  Weights and measures, courthouses, coroners and inquests should all be the responsibility of the Department of Justice.  The responsibility for abbatoirs, slaughterhouses, meat, milk and dairies should be transferred to health boards.  The whole question of malicious injuries is obviously the responsibility of the Department of Justice and those charges should not fall on <Col N="298" /> local authorities who do not have the resources or the responsibility for the levying of malicious injury claims.  The question of the cost of arterial drainage is a matter for the Board of Works and I urge the Minister to transfer the costs to them.  Welfare cost allowances should also be transferred to health boards.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Government to consider transferring from central administration to local authorities the administration of schemes with which they are directly involved, where they have an active responsibility and where they participate in administration locally. Schemes continue to be administered centrally at a huge cost to the taxpayers. I urge the Minister to consider transferring the administration of new house grants, home improvement grants and group water supply schemes to the local authorities, away from Dublin, this second layer of bureaucracy which feels it has the right to oversee all decisions in regard to the administration of grants which they are funding.  It is an unnecessary cost on the taxpayers and a waste of their money.  I know the Minister of State agrees with me.  I hope he has convinced his Minister and the Government. He will get full support from this side of the House for any measures to transfer the administration of housing grants and other schemes of that nature to the local authority where the real knowledge in these matters exists.  The Board of Works supply money for local loans for water and sewerage schemes and they are administered from Dublin.  I suggest that the Department of the Environment should control the allocation of funds to local authorities and the administration of schemes, house grants, etc. should be carried out in each council area where there is established staff and administrative procedures perfectly capable of dealing with the successful administration of these schemes.</P>

      <P>O'Connell Bridge House should be handed back to its owner &mdash; I think it is rented by the Department of the Environment &mdash; and many of its functions transferred to local authorities.  In that way you would not have to rent one extra square footage of office space and would not require many additional staff.  If you did a cost analysis on that programme there would be a huge saving.  I know the Minister of State has an interest in the subject but there is no use in only expressing interest, he must do something about it.

      <P>In examining the terms of the 1978 Act and the debate which took place here when the Bill was being introduced I see that these matters were raised.

      <P>Deputy Quinn should not talk too loudly about what he said when in Opposition.  If he cares to refer to the Official Report of the Dáil of 22 November 1978, Volume 309, column 1643, he will find that he asked that all water charges be abolished.  The Minister of State today is supporting a Bill which not alone proposes to introduce water charges but extends them to all local authorities.  The Bill is using the water charges as a device to replace the household rate, as a method for imposing major radical new taxation proposals to apply to householders and others in local authority areas.  The Minister of State should be careful before he makes another gaffe.</P>
      <P>I find it extraordinary that the Labour Party who are in charge of all Environment legislation, with the Leader of the party as the Minister in charge and another eminent member of the party, as the Minister of State, differ on this matter. The chairman of the Labour Party, Senator Michael D. Higgins, has stated that he is opposed to the introduction of the charges.  Is there unanimity in the Labour Party about the introduction of these charges?  Is the Minister of State about to challenge me as to whether Senator Higgins holds that view or not?</P>

      <P>In <i>The Connacht Tribune</i>&mdash; the only source of truth in the news down my side of the world &mdash; of May 27, after referring to the introduction of a reduced level of charges it was stated that Senator Higgins was not at the meeting of the corporation because he was voting on the constitutional issue in the Seanad. That was a reasonable excuse for not being present from his point of view but the newspaper quoted Senator Higgins as saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would oppose these charges were <Col N="301" /> I at the meeting in full knowledge of the consequences.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there is some difficulty in the Minister's party and he should not be seen to be wholeheartedly in favour of the terms of the Bill presented to the House.  The Bill would benefit from some worthwhile amendments and become a useful instrument in strengthening local democracy, if local members were allowed to make the decision in regard to charges and if the charges were only to be introduced as a supplement to existing revenue sources.  There is no point in abolishing one major source of existing revenue and then introducing the charges to replace it.  That is not the way forward; it is not progressive.</P>
    <P>The last Coalition Government decided to allow local authorities to increase their rate poundages by 15 per cent for 1982 and to provide £138 million as a grant in relief of rates.  That provision was £12 million short of the amount necessary to fully recoup local authorities for the rate reliefs they were required to give. That Coalition Government were the first to leave local authorities short of the full amount of the rate reliefs.  There was no legislative authority enabling them to do that at the time.  The Bill under discussion is retrospectively legislating for that move.  The Coalition Government lost a vote on the budget providing for that and in the following election Fianna Fáil were successful on a policy that they would make some major changes in a small number of the items in the budget which were causing difficulty.  However, we had to carry on with the rest of the Coalition Estimate and that is why we implemented the matter concerning local authorities.  As a result local authorities were left short and had to run up overdrafts. Their finances here have been getting into a tangle and that is why we should be together on this and supporting the introduction of charges to enable local authorities to work their way out of their financial difficulties by allowing them this increased revenue.  However, these charges are not an increase in revenue; they are simply a replacement.</P>
    <P>The position of my party is that we <Col N="302" /> agree in principle that local authorities should have the power to charge for any services they provide, provided the revenue from such charges is used to supplement the existing revenue source of local authorities and provided the decisions to impose charges is a reserved function, a members' function.  We also require that the adoption of a charges waiver scheme be a reserved function.  Therefore, we will oppose section 9, unless it is suitably amended and we will introduce our own amendment making the introduction and levying of charges a reserved function. We will also introduce an amendment making the adoption of a waiver scheme a reserved function.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  In 1978, with the passing of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act it would appear to have been acknowledged by the House that county councillors could not be trusted.  All parties in the House agreed with the main aims of the Bill in 1978 but under section 9, the section it is now proposed to amend, a long argument on various points of principle on the future of local democracy and the curtailment of powers of local councillors ensued.  At the time we were in Opposition and many members of my party, and Labour Party colleagues, argued violently against certain sections of that Bill. I am disappointed that we now appear to have taken up where Fianna Fáil left off in 1978 and are going down the road we argued against at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of merit in the Bill before us, but one area that worries me is the principle of undermining the powers and functions of democratically elected members of local authorities.  We have 1,500 councillors and we have taken yet again another step to turn them into rubber stamping robots.  We have cries from all sectors to cut back on public expenditure and the man in the street points all the time to the various layers of bureaucracy, to red tape and the difficulty in getting answers or his rights.  If we do this to our locally elected county councillors, if we curtail their basic right to raise their own revenue and decide how that revenue <Col N="303" /> should be raised, how can we justify keeping them or justify the continued existence of local authorities as we know them?</P>
    <P>I am extremely worried.  I know why the Minister is doing this; he has to be sure these charges will accrue to the local authorities.  It would appear he cannot trust the locally elected members to implement these charges and decide their various levels.  In 1978 during the debate on this Bill the present Ceann Comhairle was one of the strongest opponents of the Bill and deplored the shackles imposed on the elected members in the exercise of their most important and basic function: fixing the level of local taxation.  That is still the most important basic function of elected members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of that Bill obliges the Minister to recoup local authorities the full amount lost to them by the derating of domestic dwellings.  Nobody disagrees with the derating of domestic dwellings. Deputy Molloy suggested that we are reneging on our commitment to recoup domestic rates and suggested that this should not be done.  We are not reneging on that commitment.  Unfortunately, that commitment was not implemented in last year's Book of Estimates left to this Government by the Fianna Fáil Government of the day.  Wexford County Council were left £134,000 short last year under the domestic rates relief grant.  If it were law, how come all the local authorities were left short?  We are putting on record what has been happening all along.</P>
    <P>I object strongly to the general principle of the Bill which makes the raising of these local charges an executive function of managers and not a reserved function of elected members.  The whole principle of local government appears to be at stake.  The Bill appears to be largely a matter of convenience to ensure the collection of these charges.  It does not accord with any general principle.  It reserves to the manager exclusively the right to impose such charges as well as the amount to be paid in any one year. As these charges are not designed or intended to be a tax, there will be many <Col N="304" /> problems.  Can people decline to pay for them and refuse to use the council service?  Consider garbage collection and the problems that could arise if this were so.  Even if a garbage service is available in an area, can people opt not to pay for that service and dump their garbage anywhere they like?  That is a horrific possibility. On the other hand, legally it would appear that a householder could not be obliged to pay for a service if he does not use it.  If he must pay regardless of use, he is being taxed; but the tax will not be imposed by the councillors.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;taxation with representation&rdquo; was mentioned.  It is the basic premise of all taxation in this country. there should be no taxation of any kind, particularly in local government, if it is not directly controlled and mandated by the locally elected members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Very true, but that has yet to be decided by the Supreme Court.  I am extremely worried because there is no recourse by the councillors to the managers. I know there is great co-operation between managers and councillors in most, if not all, local authorities; but the principle is wrong.  There is not even recourse to a section 4 in this case because we are talking about the general, not the specific.  I am not a great believer in section 4 because I believe most problems which necessitate section 4 can be solved before they reach that stage if there are proper lines of communication.  I have been a member of a local authority in County Wexford for ten years and I have only seen section 4 used twice.  I would not like to see that power strengthened, but if councillors do not agree with the type of charges they have no recourse to a higher court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see these local levies as contractual charges but they are so related to the <Col N="305" /> Estimates that they are really part of taxation.  The councillors agree to strike a rate with built-in charges, yet we are going to let managers decide all the charges.  The Minister is afraid that members would strike a rate but not approve of charges &mdash; with one eye on the ballot box this year &mdash; so he is taking this line. In my view we are opting out.  We are encouraging a lack of responsibility and a lack of accountability.  This is a short-sighted view.  A continuous erosion of the power of local government will leave us with 1,500 rubber stamping robots soon to be deemed dispensible.</P>
    <P>We will have a very difficult job justifying the existence of the local authority structure as we know it.  We have a broken down British system of local government, without the legal framework of our European colleagues or the autonomy of the British system.  I believe we should all be looking to our Constitution for the preservation of the autonomy of local government.  The Belgians were the first to enshrine autonomy of local government in their Constitution.  The new Spanish Constitution does likewise.  It includes very strong clauses, but none of the older European Constitutions enshrines the autonomy of local government. We should get to work immediately and see what we can do before it is too late and this system of local government is deemed to be dispensible.</P>
    <P>We must preserve and strengthen local government.  It is the basis of democracy. I support the view that local government is the building stone of natural democracy, of our political party system.  A strong healthy system of local democracy is the best answer to many of the problems which beset us today.  If people had a forum to air their grievances, a forum where their views are represented and where there is direct accountability on a one-to-one basis between the local councillor and the constituents, we would not have so many people on our streets today shouting and usurping the normal democratic process.  We must preserve local domacracy for the future of this country.</P>
    <P>I support the view that local government is an expression of democratic natural rights.  People have the right to say <Col N="306" /> how they shall be governed.  Nationally this right is bound to be of limited application, but local government multiplies the opportunities of participation and converts a notional right into something of a reality.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, Article 21 says: &ldquo;Everybody has the right to take part in the government of his country directly or through freely chosen elected representatives&rdquo;. A resolution of the Council of Europe, May 1969, says that the autonomy of a local community is the right of that community to manage under its own responsibility its own affairs with a freely elected assembly.  The principle of direction is what we need in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>I do not believe what the Minister is proposing will make much difference in practice.  The way I would like to see it work is that the manager would recommend the rates of charges necessary to balance the local budget but the final decision should be left to the councillors. What the Minister mentions will not affect that in practice in most cases &mdash; I accept that argument &mdash; but the principle is wrong when it undermines the strength of local government and the functions and powers of the local councillor.</P>
    <P>Local government, unfortunately, is neither local nor government.  It is not uncommon when something costing a lot of money needs to be done in an area for the first thought to be to send a deputation to the relevant Minister for a grant. In this House the time of Members is spent increasingly solving local matters, whether by way of parliamentary question or other system.  Why so?  Because local authorities are becoming increasingly irrelevant &mdash; a great tragedy for democracy.  The local budgetary process is the most important function reserved under the Management Act for exercise by elected members of local authorities, and we erode it at our peril.  As Deputy Molloy has said, the basic premise of no taxation without representation still holds true and is very dear.</P>
    <P>Firstly, I urge the Minister to consider the principle involved in this Bill of not leaving the discreation of levying these charges as a function of the councillors <Col N="307" /> and to alter that part of the Bill.  It is the essence of proper management of local government.  If he cannot do so now, would he consider a two-year life span for this Bill?  There would be less hurt if it were felt that it was not going to go on forever and be the path along which local government directed.</P>
    <P>I know that a review of local government is about to be undertaken and that the Government are considering the matter seriously.  I am confident that, at the end of the day, we will have a strengthended and more relevant system of local government.  While that review is going on and before we Members of the House have the benefit of what might be in that review, would the Minister consider limiting the life of the Bill to, say, two years? The idea of these charges would have been accepted in areas where there is difficulty in accepting them now.  Then we could hand over the function of striking and determining these charges back to where they should always be, in my book &mdash; with the locally elected members. We should not legislate for the irresponsible, for the council that do not want to take the responsibility of saying what charges should be levied locally and how they should be spent.  Some councils are having difficulty in accepting this idea at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is time that we accepted the premise of paying for services.  We have always accepted the idea of paying for goods. There is here the peculiar notion that every service is free when it does not directly come out of our pockets.  The much beleaguered taxpayer has always had to pay for these services through his or her tax contribution.  We are now asking that the general tax and the general Exchequer be relieved somewhat and that anyone benefiting from these services be asked to pay a contribution towards them.  That principle is very correct and all parties of this House stand over it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision to make the striking of these charges an executive function of the county manager and not a reserved function of the councillors, as it should be.  I <Col N="308" /> consider section 9 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978, which today we have before us to amend, an insult to councillors.  Let us not add insult to injury.  Let us see that the future of local government is in sound hands. Apart from this Bill, I await eagerly the outcome of the general reform and restructuring of local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Molloy and Deputy Doyle gives some credence to what Deputy Molloy said earlier.  The main purpose of the Bill is to confer a general discretion on local authorities to make charges for services which they provide to persons or in respect of premises.  Two matters stick out a mile in this Bill.  One is that the executive function being given to the county manager will make the county concillors, as Deputy Doyle has said, rubber stamps.  The second thing is that this is clearly rates in by the back door once again.  The Minister this morning declared that that is not so.  He said:</P>
      <P>While I am on the question of rates, I would like to refer to the various suggestions that the introduction of a wider range of charges for services is, in effect, a reintroduction of rates by the back door.</P>
      <P>Clearly, that is what it is.  We already have planning charges and Members on this side of the House know that they are justified to some extent.  We are now bringing in water charges, sewerage charges, refuse collection charges, charges for chimney fires, for use of swimming pools and many other smaller charges.  How are these charges to be collected?  For instance, will the householder receive one bill annually for all these charges or a separate demand note for each charge annually?  The administration will eat up any revenue which accrues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Meath on a number of occasions last year there was no water in places like Ashbourne, Ratoath, Clonee &mdash; one could say from Clonee to the sea. All these areas depend on what is known as the East Meath regional water supply. Unfortunately, this happened on bank <Col N="309" /> holiday weekends such as Whit and Easter.  This lack of water resulted from the failure of the East Meath scheme. People may not mind paying for something they are getting but if they must pay for something they are not getting, that is altogether a different kettle of fish.  Also, some people do not want their refuse collected.  They prefer to bury it in their gardens or fields or use the public dump. If their refuse is not being collected, why should they be asked to pay for this service?  At the moment, the only people in the rural areas who are rateable are the commercial people, small shopkeepers and industrialists.  All these categories are going through a traumatic time endeavouring to survive.  Yet, the Government propose to impose these extra charges on them at a time when they can ill afford them.  These sectors are carrying the can as regards the raising of finance for local authorities.  There is no doubt that they are being crucified.</P>
    <P>This year, the Minister gave to the local authorities the power of putting no limit on the extent of the increase in local authority rates, whereas in recent years the Ministers have been endeavouring to control the rate, for example, last year by a ceiling of 15 per cent.  Many county managers, as a result of this measure, have suggested to their councillors that the rate should be substantially increased from 15 per cent to whatever they could get.  In Meath County Council, the county manager was looking for an increase of 17 per cent.  The councillors knew that the people who were rateable, the small shopkeepers and other commercial and industrial people, were in extreme financial difficulties.  We knew that to agree with the manager and increase the rate to such an extent would do harm to those people.  We rejected the manager's suggestion and adopted the same increase as last year, which was 15 per cent.  I do not know what will happen when people get bills for these services. They will not be popular with people who are already carrying the can.</P>
    <P>The whole scheme will require extra administration.  How will the local authorities get extra staff while there is an embargo on taking on extra staff in <Col N="310" /> the public service?  That has not been considered.  Local authorities have been looking for permission from the Department of the Public Service to employ extra staff in some sectors, and especially in the area of planning.  It has been very difficult to get agreement on that.  The local authorities will need extra staff to administer this Bill when it is enacted. Central Government will say they will not allow more people to be employed in the public service.  That problem will arise and will have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Molloy said, a fixed percentage of the national cake should be given to the local authorities.  This would cut out a great deal of administration. Block grants should be given to the local authorities to enable them to provide services.  Executive functions are being given to the managers.  A circular sent to the local authorities was quoted by Deputy Molloy.  It says that charges and functions assigned to local authorities under the Bill, as executive functions, will fall to be performed by the manager. The next sentence says that, in practice, the amount of revenue to be raised by charges will be determined by the estimates adopted by the elected members, and it will then fall to the manager to levy charges accordingly.  There seems to me to be a contradiction there.  On the one hand it states that the manager has the executive power, and on the other hand the councillors will still be responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no contradiction. The local authorities decide the total amount of money to be collected and the manager comes back with the details of the way in which that money will be collected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had agreed <Col N="311" /> to a 17 per cent increase in the commercial rate, the amount of money his manager would have had to raise would be less and, therefore, the individual charges would be less proportionately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  We will see how it operates when it comes into action.  As Deputy Doyle said, once again councillors are to be used as rubber stamps.  They are being given the dirty jobs to do, for example, the selection of an area as a refuse dump.  Everybody wants the refuse collected but nobody wants a dump beside him.  The county councillors will have to decide where the refuse is to be dumped.  They will have to make the nasty decisions.  We were duped last week in the Finance Bill.  Now we are being duped and &ldquo;duked&rdquo; and dumped once again.  Councillors will react to this because they will not like it.</P>
      <P>There are many matters for which local authorities should not be responsible. For instance, courthouses should be the responsibility of the Department of Justice. On the Boyne drainage, Meath County Council saved the Office of Public Works a considerable amount of money.  That should not have fallen to be met by Meath County Council.  Deputy Molloy mentioned various other matters. These should not be the problems of the local authorities.  They should be the problems of the relevant Departments.  I said this before on the Estimate for the Department of the Environment.  Nothing seems to be done about it.  Everybody agrees it is not fair that the local authorities should be responsible for problems which should be dealt with by the relevant Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Molloy and I are on the one wavelength about local authorities handling grants.  New house grants, house improvements grants and group water scheme grants should be handled by the local authorities.  Without being uncomplimentary to the people in O'Connell Bridge House &mdash; it has been extremely difficult for them to cope with all the new schemes and grants in recent years &mdash; may I say that time and again Deputies have complained about files <Col N="312" /> being lost, and so on.  This was raised at Question Time.  Meath was used as a pilot scheme by the former Minister for Local Government, Mr. Tully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>The electorate did not say that at the next election, and they are the people who decide.  Meath was used as a pilot scheme and it was working out quite well.  Then the Department decided that the £1,000 new house grant would have to be handled by central Government. We would support the Minister in a decentralisation plan so that this type of grant and scheme would be dealt with by the local authorities, where the local engineer or inspector on the job, in contact with the local councillors, could deal with them more efficiently and at less cost.  At the moment an inspector from the Department of the Environment could be living in Wicklow and have to travel to Meath to carry out inspections and back again.  The whole thing is absolutely crazy.  We agree on that and I am pleased about it.</P>
      <P>Road tax is collected by the local authorities and sent in to the Exchequer. Would the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment consider allowing the local authorities to retain the road tax collected?  They could use the money and there would be no further administrative costs.  This would cut out the problem of having to send the money to the Exchequer and having it sent back out again for the roads every year.  It is worth looking at.  The county councils, the association of municipal authorities and county managers' associations got very palsy-walsy in recent years about retaining their autonomy.  I am aware, as Deputy Molloy said, that the county managers' associations and the Minister have met very frequently, more so than they ever did before.  The Minister seems to have said to them: &ldquo;I will give it all to you.  You collect all the money down there&rdquo;.  There is a new relationship between the county managers' associations and the Minister.  They have been given this power and are delighted with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> Deputy Molloy covered so much in his contribution that there is very little left for me to say.  If the Minister makes a special charge of, say, £60 for water rates, how will the money be spent?  In the UK, local authorities have been given powers in relation to law enforcement.  The London Borough Council are responsible for looking after the London metropolitan police.  That would be a big change if it was introduced here.  We must look to other countries to see what powers local authorities have been given.</P>
    <P>It was suggested some years ago that we abolish local authorities.  It was suggested that urban councils should not function at all because they had little or no responsibility.  As Deputy Molloy said, there are sections in the Bill we cannot support.  We will be putting down amendments and I hope the Minister and the Minister of State will see the points we have raised and be prepared to concede our amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a Bill which is capable of becoming a cornerstone in the revival of local democracy. It is an opportunity and a challenge for local politicians.  For many years politicians from all parties have been supportive of the idea of charges as part of our system of controlling, managing and financing local services.  We all agreed on the idea of charges for three reasons and my comments on the Bill are set in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first reason is that there is a clear awareness that the benefits of many of the services provided by the councils are privately enjoyed and do not have the social virtue of involving the people who enjoy them in having to pay for them directly, in other words the taxpayer's purse finances them.  Any subsidies or waivers of the charges in relation to these services should be under the scrutiny of the local authority and decided on their merits and not be automatically there for users.  The second attraction is that charges can give a new element of local autonomy in deciding priorities in different areas of spending.  Local authorities should be able to raise extra money for specific services and so improve them. <Col N="314" /> That is a very important element of local autonomy.  The third reason is that charges must be seen as part of the decentralisation of control.  They are an important tool in the efficient management of services.</P>
    <P>It is well known that where services are entirely free there is a very high demand for them regardless of whether the value people derive from them justifies the cost involved for the council.  I can see that charges could be a very efficient way of managing scarce resources.  The prime attraction of charges is not the sole one of raising extra revenue.  It is unfortunate that this side of these charges is getting undue attention from public comment. That is not their most important function. Having said that, anyone who is realistic about local finances since the demise of domestic and agricultural rates must recognise that the Minister has to put some form of limitation on Exchequer subventions that would be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we see a reasonable response by the Government to the question of limiting central subventions and at the same time giving local autonomy. The Minister will give a block grant to local authorities, namely the domestic and agricultural rate grant.  That will be available to them to spend as they choose.  They will be in a position to do one of three things.  The local authority can supplement their income from charges; they can supplement their income from increasing rates on commercial property or they can cut back on certain areas of spending.  This kind of local discretion is important for local authorities.  Since domestic rates were removed there was a restriction on the rating ability of local authorities.  They were permitted only a certain percentage and it was not decided locally.  They found they were unable to supplement their income from any source and were in the invidious position of having only the option of cutting back on services. That reduced real local autonomy and democracy.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome in that it restores a much wider range of options for local authorities.  While welcoming the restoration of discretion to local authorities, <Col N="315" /> I cannot help but sound a very severe warning on the revenue-raising attitude that seems to pervade the Bill.</P>
    <P>I note that the block grant to be provided is to be decided on the basis of central Government finances on a year by year basis.  This year a certain percentage of the previous domestic rate and the previous agricultural rate product is being provided by central Government. In future when money is scarce central Government might find they must cut back.  Essentially, the context in which these charges are coming in is very much by way of a shortfall to be made up by charges or by rates.  Many local authorities are likely to regard this as being a recipe on the part of central Government for strangling their services by asking them to take up an increasing share of what was there previously and utilised at their discretion.  Local authorities will fear that central Government will take the opportunity to shove down the line responsibility for cutbacks.  I do not accept that view but I can see that there are certain elements in this Bill that will encourage such a view.  I should like to see those elements changed.</P>
    <P>The block grant should not be a simple flat amount to local authorities on the basis of their domestic and agricultural rates.  Anyone who has discussed the idea of block grants in other countries has encouraged always that there be an element of matching in any system of block granting and that, if a local authority are willing to make a greater tax effort or a greater effort in raising charges, there should be some element of compensation to them by way of getting more money from the State.  That would do a lot to turn around the criticism that I can visualise being levelled at this Bill.  A matching element can allay the fears of local authorities in this regard and can give much more constructive ability to them to use their revenue-raising powers in a positive way.</P>
    <P>The second point I should like to make is by way of a word of warning.  While I welcome the fact that discretion is to be given back to local authorities on the question of charges and rating and deciding <Col N="316" /> on expenditure priorities, this is partly being frustrated by the fact that the decision on charges will be an executive function.  Not only will this take the charges out of the realm of democratic control&mdash;and that is disappointing&mdash;but it will reinforce the revenue-raising approach to the charges.  Many managers will see the charges solely as a way of filling the gap between what resources they have and their existing gross outlays. If these charges are looked on solely in that way the potential for using them as an efficient way of managing resources in local authorities will be lost.</P>
    <P>On the question of democratic control, the Minister of State has said that councillors will have the ultimate control in deciding on what is the aggregate to be raised in charges and that the manager will be the one to decide the structure of the charges to bring in the amount of revenue necessary.  However, my experience from estimates meetings of the one council that I served on does not support the idea that this gives democratic control to the councillors.  Time and again managers come in with estimates that would include an aggregate of so much revenue to be raised from charges.  The councillors are put in the very difficult position of saying either they cut back on the level of charges in question or that they cut back on spending. There is no opportunity for the councillors to discuss the specific area at great length.  It is always on a time-scale basis and the threat that if changes are made in the manager's estimates spending must be cut back has meant that time and again estimates meetings have not afforded councillors real democratic control. Perhaps this is their own fault in not having opted for special committees to discuss the estimates but we must take into account that this is the situation in many councils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was my experience on Meath County Council, though I strove to have some element of <Col N="317" /> discussion on the estimates before we reached the gun-to-the-head situation. However, I never really succeeded in that.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned also about what is happening in local authority chambers. Time and again they have become talk shops with the result that attention is devoted to all sorts of topics that are not germane to the authority of the councillors. If we are to rely solely on the estimates meetings we are encouraging a form of abdication of responsibility on the part of councillors.</P>
      <P>In the setting of the structure of charges local representatives have an expertise that is second to none in deciding on what is the most appropriate structure. It is not acceptable that that decision be handed over to the manager once the councillors have decided an overall level.  For example, questions relating to the benefit being derived from commercial users and of what the market will bear are ones that the councillors know more about than the manager.  Again, the question of what is a fair charge and also of who should be exempt from charges is one better left to the councillors rather than to the managers.</P>
      <P>Experience would suggest, too, that the councillors are the ones who will know the best way of setting charges that are efficient in using resources.  In the area of refuse collection, for instance, a flat rate per house would not make for the most efficient use of resources.  Councillors would recognise that a better system perhaps would be a charge per bag because there is no doubt that in many councils, particularly those encompassing built-up areas, the problem of the disposal of refuse is becoming increasingly difficult.  Time and again councillors are faced with the unpopular decision as to where refuse is to be dumped.  It would be a worthwhile development to have built into the charging system a clear incentive for people to cut down on the amount of refuse they leave out for collection. Councillors will be the ones who put forward imaginative-type charges, charges that produce the more efficient use of resources.  The council chamber is the place for discussion of these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that the criteria used for deciding eligibility for contributory old age pensions, namely the average contribution record from the date of entry into insurable employment until the date of retirement, favours people who entered into insurable employment late in life compared with others who were in insurable employment for a long period but did not maintain their contributions when their means exceeded a certain figure; and whether he will consider having a simple absolute number of contributions as the criterion for eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="322" /> Nos. 3 and 4 together.  The existing contribution conditions for receipt of contributory old age pension provide for (1) entry into insurance before a certain age, (2) a minimum of 156 weeks covered by paid contributions and (3) a specified yearly average number of weeks of contributions over the period from entry into insurance to pension age.</P>
      <P>These conditions were devised to ensure that the scheme is confined to those who have been genuinely insured persons in the period to pension age.  The scheme was never intended to cater for persons who at one time or another were insured for a short period or had a minimal insurance record.  To do otherwise would affect the financial viability of the scheme and would have serious repercussions by way of additional costs.</P>
      <P>The average test can be satisfied by a minimum of 20 contributions paid or credited over the test period.  Any worker who was in insurable employment for a long period should, therefore, normally satisfy this particular condition.  Any worker with more than three years insurable employment who for any reason ceased insurable employment always had the option of becoming a voluntary contributor paying contributions which would preserve pension rights.</P>
      <P>I will be examining this matter in greater detail in the context of the National Pension Plan which is at present being drawn up and I will be paying particular attention to the conditions for receipt of pension to ensure that there is equity for all in the plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put two questions to the Minister.  The first is: is he aware that the contributory old age pension was brought in in 1961 only so that referral back to a pre-1961 date in order to decide eligibility is not only anomalous but unfair because people who were contributing before that would not have been making contributions towards the scheme?  Secondly, would the Minister not consider that a person who entered insurable employment back in 1950s, who was below the income which forced him to make contributions but later moved out of that, is discriminated against under this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is: would the Minister not accept that an absolute criterion of a number of contributions would be much fairer than an average contribution record since, for people who might have fallen on hard times during their contribution period, the averaging period might have been extended even though they were not contributing in every year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If one were to give a contributory pension to everybody with a minimum number of contributions paid, irrespective of the time in which they were accumulated, there would be very considerable cost implications. Therefore, the precondition has been laid down that the average test condition from the point of entry into insurance until pension age is taken as the criterion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  But if one were to take a situation in which people could come in and out of insurance, not be insured for extended periods but accumulate contributions over a <Col N="324" /> period of a working life, the cost implications would be very considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider allowing the pre-1953 contributions to be taken in respect of a pensioner who does not satisfy the full requirement of contributions for entitlement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The second thing is: if somebody has been in insured employment, leaves it and subsequently comes back into insured employment, will the Minister allow that person to make a lump sum purchase of contributions in order to be fully eligible for benefits subsequently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the answer at this stage must be &ldquo;no&rdquo; because it is a contributory scheme, self-financing, a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; scheme.  If one were to give credits for periods of employment prior to 1953, when there was no such scheme in existence and no such contributions were being made, then the scheme would simply collapse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, it would destroy the fundamental principle we have been endeavouring to develop, namely, that a person should pay on a weekly basis over the period of his lifetime, Unfortunately, many people discover in their early sixties that their prospect of getting the full pension has been destroyed.  There is no way that one can finance an insurability scheme on the basis of periodic lump sum contributions. They have to be paid on a weekly basis, on a yearly basis, and then paid out to all intents and purposes on an actuarial basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely satisfied at the extent of information people are entitled to, or that the extent of that information is always readily available.  On the other hand, we do have employers, we do have workers, we do have trade unions and a whole range of social services.  One would imagine that there is hardly a worker in this country who would not by now be fully aware of all his social insurance entitlements. There is a wide battery of people, including 220 Members of the Oireachtas and 220 secretaries, to advise approximately only 900,000 people of their entitlement, but I accept that there should be more information available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I might particularly refer to the fact that when the limit was abolished in 1974 many who had earlier been insured but who had gaps in their insurance record found that for the period from their first entry into insurance over the average test period they did not satisfy the regular contribution condition.  I think that particular anomaly could be referred to the commission and I will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of a double payment next Christmas to recipients of long-term social welfare payments would be about £18 million.  Provision for such a payment was not made in the Estimates for 1983 which were based on those drawn up by the previous Government and published in November last.  The question of providing a double payment would depend on financial constraints and the availability of funds to meet the cost at the appropriate time.</P>

In fact, on the ordinary unemployment payments I am short of money so that, come next Christmas, it will be a matter of paying our ordinary month's payment of unemployment benefit and pensions.  At present we do not have £18 million nor are we likely to have it in December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>1980 was the first time since 1955 that double payments were made at Christmas.  In 1980 it was done in accordance with the provisions of the Second National Understanding for Economic and Social Development. In 1980 the cost was £8.8 million, in 1981 £12.5 million, then in 1982 there was a double payment for child dependants <Col N="327" /> only of £4.2 million and a double payment generally of £15.3 million.  The cost is approximately £18 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I might put it to the Deputy that last year the payment was made but there was no money available and the Government borrowed £18 million. The only reason it was paid last year was the election.  There was no provision in the 1982 Estimates for the money and then, as the Deputy well remembers, the then Minister for Social Welfare announced some weeks prior to the election that it was intended to pay it.  This year our Estimates are on a different footing.  If I can get the £18 million I will most willingly pay it, but as of now probably I will be short £10 million to £15 million on the ordinary social welfare side, because we have 193,000 unemployed, we have 10,000 on short time, our PRSI receipts have inevitably dipped somewhat, and their is no money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of ways in which young people aged 16 <Col N="328" /> to 18 who are unemployed can benefit from State schemes.  A young person who has been in insurable employment and who becomes unemployed can qualify for unemployment benefit in his or her own right.  The various benefit and assistance payments made by my Department can include increases to parents in respect of qualified children until the children reach the age of 18.</P>
      <P>Supplementary welfare allowance paid by the health boards can also include increases to parents in respect of children to the age of 18.  Supplementary welfare allowance is not however normally paid to persons under the age of 18 unless it can be established that the applicant is not living at home and is not supported by a parent or guardian.  The day-to-day administration of the scheme of supplementary welfare allowance is a matter for the health boards and I do not propose to intervene in the existing arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Department of Labour Work Experience Programme caters for school leavers in the age bracket mentioned. Such young people are also covered by schemes operated by AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency and it is normal in these cases for payments of one kind or another to be made.</P>
      <P>I would much prefer to see young people who are unemployed availing themselves of the schemes that have been specifically set up with them in mind and I would be happy if they were encouraged to look in this direction as the more positive and hopeful approach towards developing their training, their skills and their initiative.</P>

      <P>I do not have the information available in regard to the second question but in the Department of Labour work experience programmes, about 5,000 young persons between 16 and 18 participated last year.  Under that <Col N="329" /> scheme young persons are placed in firms to gain work experience.  They are paid £30 per week for the duration of the course.  Likewise, as the Deputy is aware, there is a major scheme operated by AnCO for unemployed young persons and allowances are paid to them for the duration of their course.  The Youth Employment Agency has a series of schemes as well.  Nevertheless I am very concerned about the large number of school leavers who are still unemployed. The Department of Labour survey last year showed that the number of unemployed was about 30 per cent.  I imagine it will be somewhat higher this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether a wife who is separated from her husband under the terms of a deed of separation which provides for weekly maintenance payments to be paid by the husband to her is entitled to the deserted wife's allowance if the husband ceases to make maintenance payments and cannot be compelled by the courts to do so; and, if she is not so entitled, if he will amend the deserted wife's allowance scheme to enable wives in such circumstances to claim the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations governing the deserted wife's schemes provide that a woman is to be regarded as having been deserted by her husband if, (a) he has of his own volition left her, (b) he wilfully refuses or neglects to contribute to her support and maintenance, (c) she has made and continues to make reasonable efforts to trace his whereabouts and to prevail on him to contribute to her support and maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a separation agreement is entered into, and there is no question of desertion by the husband prior to the <Col N="331" /> agreement, the parties would be held to have separated by mutual consent.  In such circumstances desertion does not arise and the woman would not be entitled to payment as a deserted wife.</P>
    <P>The suggestion of the Deputy would alter fundamentally the nature of the scheme administered by my Department for deserted wives and a situation would arise where my Department would be expected to assume responsibility where a maintenance agreement freely entered into by both parties lapsed for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>I do not propose on the basis of the hypothetical situation quoted by the Deputy to alter the basic conditions of the scheme specifically designed for wives who have been deserted.  The scheme of supplementary welfare allowances would be available to a person suffering hardship arising from the circumstances described by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate precisely what he regards section (c) as covering from the point of view of one spouse making reasonable efforts to trace the other?  Would he agree a considerable number of deserted wives are refused the allowance on the ground that they do not make sufficient effort to trace the other spouse?  What would he regard as sufficient effort?  Notifying the Garda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can gather, the inquiry officer interviewing the applicant generally seeks a statement &mdash; not a sworn statement &mdash; as to the efforts on her part to contact her husband, to ensure a maintenance order has been taken out by her, and that there was failure on her part to contact him because of total unawareness of his existing residence. In that case he would be deemed to have deserted her.  But desertion as a criterion for eligibility inevitably must have a degree of subjective assessment by the officer concerned and in many cases not all the information essential is readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in quite a number of desertion cases it is <Col N="332" /> virtually impossible for the spouse to carry out the search as suggested by the Minister in that many of the spouses go to another jurisdiction?  Would he agree that in the meantime the investigating officer should give immediately the benefit of the doubt to the applicant and certainly go so far as to arrange full supplementary welfare allowance until such time as the decision is taken?  Is he aware that quite a number of deserted wives find it impossible to comply satisfactorily with the requirements of the investigating officer in so far as section 3 is concerned and would he advise investigating officers to be more flexible in their dealings in these matters?</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's point of view but the Ceann Comhairle will understand that a question such as this is relevant to circumstances that exist today and is very beneficial in making information available to applicants who have had difficulty in this regard.  The Ceann Comhairle has been very generous in allowing a certain amount of flexibility in supplementary questions and replies which can be of enormous benefit by way of information to the general public and that is the reason I ask him to be generous in respect of this question.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is time to reconsider and broaden the concept of desertion to cover situations such as this and, indeed, other situations where it may be necessary for the wife or the husband to tell the spouse to leave because of the conditions they are living under, that the concept of desertion should be widened to include such cases?</P>

      <P>It may not be widely known that where a husband behaves in such a way as to force his wife to leave him because, for instance, of violence, habitual drunkness or cruelty on his part the wife is regarded as being deserted because of being forced to leave.  In the case of a wife having a barring order against her husband forbidding him access to the house, that also would be regarded as constructive desertion.  If there is mutual separation and mutual agreement, I would hold the view, and I am sure the Deputy would also hold the view, that there was an obligation on his part to provide maintenance for her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals made by Dublin Corporation's school meals committee would involve considerable additional expenditure including additional expenditure on equipment and staffing costs.  The legislation dealing with the existing school meals scheme enables my Department to pay up to half the cost of food supplied under the scheme.  There is no provision for providing equipment or meeting staffing costs.</P>
      <P>The proposals of the school meals committee would constitute a significant departure from the scheme at present in operation and there are no funds available to my Department to meet the extra cost involved.</P>

      <P>I do not have that information readily available.  I have information for 1981 in relation to an examination of the scheme in St. Kevin's school and St. Laurence O'Toole school. For example, the cost of equipment for schools availing of the scheme could run to £2.27 million.  The heating of meals would need infra-red ovens requiring a three-phase electricity supply.  The ESB charge sums up to £1,000 for a transformer <Col N="339" /> for a small national school.  Other equipment such as ovens, tables and cutlery could cost up to £5,000.  The cost of supplying full meals to children at present receiving school meals would be about £10 million as against the present cost of £1.2 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred in my question to the very low cost involved.  I am simply asking the Minister to tell us the cost.  I understand from Dublin Corporation it is minimal in the case of these two schools.  One of the schools has the equipment referred to by the Minister.  I do not think he is being open and honest with the information requested.  I know that is not the business of the Ceann Comhairle but I am asking the Minister if he can give details which relate to the specific question.  I ask, what would be the cost in the two schools referred to, details of which have been supplied to the Minister?</P>

      <P>In 1981 the cost for <Col N="340" /> each of the two schools I mentioned &mdash; St. Kevin's and St. Laurence O'Toole &mdash; was £6,627 and £28,779.  My own view is that if Dublin Corporation wish to operate a pilot scheme in the two schools it could be argued that they could operate if from their own resources and see what would be the out-turn.  If one of the schools has equipment already, why should it not operate a pilot scheme with local voluntary assistance?  Surely people are not bereft of that kind of initiative?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if guidelines have been issued to social welfare officers investigating claims for, or reviews of, unemployment assistance especially in the west of Ireland; if he is aware that excess means have been assessed in respect of board and lodgings to applicants living with relations; if he is satisfied with a system that leaves an applicant who is without means and lodging with relations approximately £2.50 per week; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Guidelines are issued from time to time to all social welfare officers dealing with the investigation of applications for qualification certificates for unemployment assistance purposes and the review of the means of those <Col N="341" /> already in receipt of such assistance.  The guidelines are up-dated as necessary to take account of any legislative changes. No special or separate guidelines are issued in relation to the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the assessment for board and lodgings on applicants living with relations is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants living in relatively better off circumstances and those whose circumstances are poor.  In the absence of this form of assessment the sons and daughters of better-off parents would be entitled to the same amount of unemployment assistance as those of poorer parents, which would not be an equitable situation.</P>
      <P>An applicant who considers that the amount of means assessed against him is excessive has the right to appeal and to have his means determined by an appeals officer.</P>
      <P>The amount of unemployment assistance payable is calculated by reducing the appropriate maximum rate of unemployment assistance by the amount of the additional means.  The scheme is financed entirely by the Exchequer out of general taxation and it is essential to ensure that scarce resources are allocated as fairly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that a sum of £22 per week for board and lodgings which has been assessed in many cases by social welfare officers is outrageous?  In the case I have mentioned it leaves the applicant, a brother, with the paltry sum of £2.50 per week for various expenses.  Can the Minister really condone a system like this which treats these people with contempt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on whom the Deputy is talking about.  That is the basic problem I have in replying to him. Very clear-cut criteria are laid down for wage-earning families and also for farming families where the applicant's parent is a farmer.  In that case the procedure is to estimate the yearly income from the farm and divide the amount between the parents and all the dependent members of the household on a weighted basis.  In calculating the amount to be attributed <Col N="342" /> to each a weighting of 1.5 per cent is attached to each parent and 1 per cent to each non-earning dependent including the applicant.  In this instance, in the case of farming families consisting of parents and three non-earning children the diviser would be 6.  It is a complicated system of calculation, but the maximum limit taken into account is no more than 12.5 per cent or one-eighth of family income. There must be some system of assessment.</P>

      <P>The Minister in reply to a question of mine yesterday, which process took him in excess of two minutes, confused rather than elucidated.  Would he agree that the <i>modus operandi</i> determining eligibility in these cases is cumbersome and archaic and needs updating? It assumes that the parent of an applicant seeking unemployment assistance is going to be generous to his son &mdash; or daughter &mdash; and in effect it takes no account at all of personal circumstances that might exist in the family.  I would ask the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is discrimination there.  Let us take a large farmer in the Deputy's own county who has a son at home who is unemployed. Surely the Deputy does not suggest that no account should be taken by the investigating officer of the board and lodgings attributable by way of income to the son &mdash; or daughter &mdash; in question.  Likewise, in relation to a wage or salary earner where a father may have £15,000 a year income, is the Deputy suggesting that no account whatever should be taken of the <Col N="343" /> fact that he maintains a son or daughter who may be unemployed and that there should be no relativity?  We are saying though the regulations that the relativity should be no more than 12.5 per cent or one-eighth of the income.</P>

Would the Minister agree that some change seems to have occurred in the manner in which his officers are carrying out these assessments in recent times?  The number of cases coming to our notice has increased substantially.  Is the Minister aware that in many cases the figure of £22 per week which has now been assessed as board and lodgings for single people thus deprives them of everything except a few shillings of the unemployment assistance money?  Finally, would the Minister give the Deputies here who have an interest in this matter copies of the system which he has sought to read out in explanation of how this assessment is made?

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment, I pointed out that this Bill is welcome as it restores local discretion, not only for local authorities to decide on spending priorities but also in deciding once again the rating for commercial property and this new area of charges. However, I questioned two points, the <Col N="383" /> first was that the block grant which is being provided in the Bill has no matching element, in other words there is no local tax effort that would be rewarded by greater State subvention.  I also regretted the fact that democratic local control is being frustrated by making the charges an executive function.  I suggest it should be made an executive function for this and perhaps for next year but the Minister should explicitly provide that the responsibility for deciding on these charges will become a reserved function in two years' time by Ministerial order and I also strongly urge the Minister to make explicit on the county managers an obligation to come before the council each year and have a discussion on the level of charges to be made.  Those two provisions would be worthwhile and I should like them explicitly mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried about the form these charges will take, that the manager has control over the charges and that they are to be decided upon residually, depending on resources available from central Government, that this will encourage a very facile revenue-raising approach to making up the shortfall over growth outlays and that this attitude to charges cannot but damage their potential economic value.  If you asked an economist what he thinks of when a charge is mentioned, he would think in terms of supply and demand curves and the fact that the purchaser could decide what the aggregate payment he makes would be, depending and reflecting his usage.  The other element is that the charge would reflect the supplier's costs in some way.  The notion of a charge is quite different from a levy. A levy tends to be based on a fixed amount, a flat-rate charge which is easy to collect; it would tend to be indiscriminate as to whether the person avails of the service or to what extent he avails of the service.  It would also tend to increase yearly without any reference to the costs. I am worried that some of the elements in the Bill point more towards the introduction by local authorities of levies in this form rather than true charges.  For example, it is clear in the Bill that the <Col N="384" /> councils will have the power to collect these charges, whether or not people avail of the service if the service is provided to the premises.  If a refuse collection was being provided on the road, all would be liable to a charge, regardless of whether they were availing of it or not. There is a possibility of increases year by year, without reference to the specific conditions of the service being examined, because the requirement to raise charges on aggregate will be decided by central government.  I see grounds for concern in this regard and, if it is the case that they are levies rather than charges, we are missing a great opportunity to use this Bill in a proper fashion to get value for State money.</P>
    <P>I see two big dangers if we settle on a levy.  It will be very difficult to impose yet another charge on hard pressed householders in the form of a levy which they cannot evade or influence.  The other danger is that the potential of charges to be a management tool for efficiency will be lost.  I should like to give a few examples of how I could see a big difference between levy type charges and true economic charges.  For example, in the area of pollution emission, the simple accounting approach in trying to raise revenue is to levy a percentage of turnover, whereas an economic charge would be related to the level of emission that the company would be making.  I am worried that the opportunity will not be taken for that more sensible approach to charging.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been complaining for the past hour that Question <Col N="385" /> Time was being turned into a debate, now the debate is turning into Question Time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of roads, I fear that a simple, straightforward levy would look for fixed tolls whereas proper economic charging would depend on off-peak pricing.  I do not see any difficulty in councils or local authorities evaluating off-peak pricing as against flat rates.  In the case of refuse, the levy approach would go for a fixed poundage flat rate per house and some councils have already brought this in.  An economic charge would go for quite the opposite, in a charge per refuse sack, and there would be an incentive to people to minimise the amount of wastage.  Possibly, it would be sensible to subsidise people who are willing to segregate their rubbish and make it available for waste recovery.  I am afraid that an opportunity will be missed to use charges flexibly in that area.</P>
      <P>In the area of development and planning, the tendency has been to go for flat-rate charges to recover some of the infrastructural costs to councils and local authorities, whereas economic charges would clearly go for discrimination to achieve the objectives of the development plan.  For example, there would be lower charges for clustering of houses, if that was an objective of the development plan, there would be higher charges in the event of high rise if they wanted to avoid high rise buildings.  I should like to see this sort of flexibility brought in and I am afraid that, under the present system, it will not be there.  I suggest to the Minister and the Minister of State that some advice should be made available from his Department or from other informed sources as to how the charges can be used in a fashion which will promote efficency in services.  A proper price structure can be valuable and most local authorities would need some assistance and advice on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another suggestion is that each service for which a charge is levied be established <Col N="386" /> into a separate management unit of some sort with, year by year, an explicit debate within the council on the affairs of that unit.  The merit of that would be that it would allow the changes in charges to be set in a context of how costs were moving for that service and that there would not be excessive charging or cross-subsidising, with money being taken out of one service and put into another, which is not the purpose of charges.</P>
    <P>It would also allow councillors and public representatives to discuss how much of the fund from charges had gone into incremental improvements of the service.  People could be persuaded of the value of these charges where improvements were being made.  Another matter which could be considered for annual discussion would be what complaints procedure was in force and whether a market-like service was being provided. An efficient service must be provided, without the delays which have been a feature of some areas of local authority service at a time when they were inundated with work, partly because there was no charge to be paid.  Those delays must be ironed out if we are to have charges acceptable to the public at large. For example, in the planning permission area I could not see people being willing to wait for long periods or to have questions put at the last minute which they would regard as purely a stalling mechanism if they were going to be charged for that service.  I would advocate scope for annual public discussion of the charge and the changes in it and the service to which it is being put.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider not excluding subsidies for efficient styles of usage from the scope of this Bill.  It is, after all, a Bill dealing with pricing and, philosophically at least, there is no difference between subsidising people to do something the correct way and charging them for doing it the wrong way.  I instance the case of refuse collection. There is an argument in some areas for subsidies to go towards certain users.  I would not like it to be ruled out because the Bill dealt solely with charges.</P>
    <P>I now turn to another element of this Bill, which is the whole question of the <Col N="387" /> block grant involved in State support of local authorities.  Under the Act the Minister will be paying a block grant to local authorities which is based on the rate product of both domestic and agricultural properties in the local authority area.  I understand that it is intended that the same percentage of that rate product will be paid to each local authority.  There is absolutely no reason to believe that this is a fair way to distribute State money available for local authorities with the best results.  The rate product of domestic and agricultural properties will not necessarily produce the proper distribution of these funds in line with regional policy.  There is a <i>prima facie</i> case to suggest that it would be quite a long way from being a fair system of sharing out revenue.  For example, it is well known that there are enormous variations in the agricultural income generated per £ of agricultural valuation.  That was at the back of the High Court case which was brought and is now, I understand, under appeal.  The lesson I would draw from that is that the rate product also implies big differences in the ratio to the rate product and the agricultural income.</P>
    <P>I have taken the trouble to look at some relevant data and there is an enormous difference in the percentage of income arising which is constituted by the rate product.  The year in question is somewhat out of date, being in the seventies, but the range will be indicative.  It ranges from 9 per cent of income arising in Kerry, 11 per cent in Kildare and 12 per cent in Cork, up to &mdash; at the other end of the scale &mdash; 28 per cent in West-meath, 24 per cent in Longford and 20 per cent in Roscommon and Leitrim.  If we give a State subsidy on the basis of those figures we will be favouring the high percentage counties such as Westmeath and Longford and disfavouring the low percentage ones such as Kerry and Kildare.  Favouritism of that sort is not in line with regional policy.</P>
    <P>The same is probably true of the domestic rate, although I have not been able to get a look at that data.  Probably the domestic rate arbitrarily favours certain counties which would not be chosen <Col N="388" /> if we decided to allocate moneys available on the basis of some more rational scheme of revenue sharing &mdash; for example, one that would have an eye to population, to income per head, to local tax effort and to local needs.  Indeed, it would not be difficult to see the sort of structure in our present subsidy.  All one need do is look at the rate product for domestic and agricultural rates and compare that with the total county income.  I looked very roughly at some figures and can identify quite severe discrepancies.  With the pattern I indicated, some of the southern counties would seem to be doing badly compared with some of the others.  I would be concerned about that if it were to become a permanent feature of support of local authorities.  In this Bill we are not really discussing the regional policy element of rate grants, but I strongly urge the Minister to bring to the House some scheme which would allocate revenue on a more rational basis.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to consider a number of amendments, one being the reversion of the function of making charges to the county councillors after a couple of years, when the system is well and truly established and seems to be operating well.  Secondly, I would like the Bill to explicitly require county managers to consult with the councillors on the making of these charges at a public meeting.  This should be done annually for each service, so that there would be a proper discussion.  Thirdly, I would like the possibility of subsidies as well as charges being involved in this Bill. Finally, I suggest that if the Minister uses the power in this Bill to waive certain charges, he should at least offer some form of compensation to the local authority involved.  The Minister has the power to decide, in the national interest presumably, that certain charges should not be made and if he so decides he should ask the national Exchequer to compensate the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that the abolition of rates on private dwellings was originally fully justified. One would gather from the Minister's speech that this was not necessary. <Col N="389" /> He said that it became commonplace to hear councils criticised for being a drain on the resources of the State.  I do not accept that.  If rates were in existence today a householder with a valuation of £20 in Kerry would pay approximately £450 in rates.  The vast majority of householders could not afford to pay that much today.</P>
      <P>Unless the council as a body agree with the charges it will be very difficult to collect them.  Central guidelines should be laid down by the Minister and the Department.  It is not right that there should be varying charges in different local authority areas.  Councils should work within those guidelines.</P>
      <P>The services for which charges will be made and the level of the charges will be at the discretion of the local authority. We must bear in mind that when managers present the elected members of local authorities with the book of estimates the die is cast.  At that time the expenditure is decided on by the manager and his staff.  The council are presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i>  The onus is on the councillors to say where there should be a cut-back in the estimates and if charges and levies are to be reduced.  This could give rise to the implementation of section fours directing county managers to provide for an estimate of expenses not exceeding a certain sum in any year.  This would be undesirable.  I should like to see a system where managers, staff and councillors would work together and decide on the level of levies and charges which would be appropriate to the capacity of the people to pay.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the proposal to charge for refuse collection particularly in rural areas.  In my county we are very proud of our environment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The environment in Kerry is fundamental to the economy of the county and to the livelihood of the people.  The fixing of charges for domestic refuse collection could lead to dumping or the over-filling of bins in central locations by people who could not afford <Col N="390" /> to pay the charge.  Perhaps the councils could be asked to investigate the possibility of having pick-up points in certain rural areas rather than stopping at every gate.  It is impossible to have an extension of the domestic refuse collection in any area due to financial restrictions.</P>

      <P>The reason the legislation has been brought in is to enable the councils to collect money.  The Bill provides for the introduction of rates by the back door.  It is quite obvious that levies and charges fixed this year will be increased as the years go by.  There is no point in saying these matters will be reviewed two or three years hence and that perhaps the levies will be reduced. I do not know of any tax or charges which were imposed and later reduced.</P>

      <P>What is the position regarding the collection of charges from hawkers in towns and villages on fair and market days?  The Minister said that the range of services was confined to those provided on an individual basis and that the charges would be collected mainly in respect of premises and not people. Hawkers in towns and villages often leave a trail of refuse behind them.  How will the money be collected from them?  As regards people who operate off-sale food shops what arrangements have been made to collect the charge from them?</P>

      <P>This Bill will give powers hitherto unknown to managers to implement charges and levies as they think fit without prior consultation with members of local authorities.  The functions assigned to managers under the Bill should be assigned to the elected members of the councils.  The elected members of local authorities would be more than delighted to handle these charges. I am aware that there is provision for hardship cases in relation to the collection of the charges and levies but there are none who know the local scene better in terms of hardship cases than the local councillors.  If the Minister is not in a position to amend the Bill so as to transfer these functions from the executive function of the managers to the reserved function of the councils, he should at least make arrangements for consultations on a regular basis between the members of the local authority and the management and staff side on the matter of deciding who is to pay these charges.  In addition, there should be a scale of charges based on how much each individual can pay.  The proposed charges will impose serious hardship in some cases.</P>
      <P>Regarding the charges for planning permissions I can see very good reason in this in terms of major developments where it is necessary for a local authority to seek consultant advice and so on.  But it is somewhat unfair that this charge should apply to persons seeking planning permission for individual dwelling houses or for outoffices or farm buildings.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with this Bill for the reasons I have stated.  It is a Bill that the Minister should give serious consideration to amending on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary is a man for whom I have considerable regard and one whose judgment I would have been inclined to trust in the past but having listened to him today, all I can say is that I am satisfied now that virtually every member of Fianna Fáil is on the way back <Col N="392" /> from <i>The Way Forward.</i>  After a lot of effort in trying to persuade Fianna Fáil that expenditure had to be provided for by revenue in some way or other, I am surprised to hear Deputy O'Leary's comments about the Bill.</P>
      <P>I find provisions in the Bill that are unattractive and I am sure that goes for everyone else but these services must be paid for in some way or other.  If Deputy O'Leary would refer to <i>The Way Forward</i> and to the Estimates which his Government came up with last year and if he would admit the shortfall they were allowing for for local authorities this year and if he would at least recognise that these services must be paid for, he would be more acceptable in speaking to this debate.  We might have had more regard for him if he had told us constructively where we were to find this money.  If he is suggesting that we should raise the money from central funds, since we know that there is no provision in the budget for this, he might have suggested, for instance, that we increase VAT rates or excise duties.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary tells us there should be no charge for these local authority services but he has not put forward any suggestion as to where the alternative finance might be found.  He is acting like a mealy-mouthed county councillor who is afraid to make any proposal on the revenue side but who has lots of ideas on the expenditure side.  If Fianna Fáil are running away to that extent from <i>The Way Forward</i> I sincerely hope that the people will see them for what they are and that after all their wild profligacy of 1977 to 1981, their conversion to responsibility in dealing with national finances seems to be shortlived.  One got the impression from Fianna Fáil spokesmen in the last few months that they were being responsible in their utterances about expenditure, whether local government or national expenditure, but I am disappointed at this recent change of trend, examples of which we have had from Deputy O'Kennedy on the Finance Bill.  Their irresponsibility in this general area of expenditure is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not welcome this measure <Col N="393" /> I recognise the necessity for it.  I appreciate that it is expedient at this time and that having regard to the amount of time the Minister has had in office and to the Estimates for expenditure this year, he has had very little option but to introduce a measure of this kind.  This way of raising finance is not acceptable or at least it is acceptable only as an expedient for this year and perhaps the following year, but it is not acceptable in the longer term. Charges such as those proposed are inflexible, whereas the old rates system whereby those with the bigger houses paid most was much fairer.</P>
    <P>In addition, the administrative costs involved in collecting relatively small sums of money make the operation nonsensical and is a bad idea in the short term.  Another point is that most people are beleaguered with tax, with PRSI increases, the youth employment levy and so on.  They will look on this new charge as an additional tax and will not relate it closely enough to the logic of services.  There are some services such as refuse collection in respect of which it is unreal to say that charges can be collected. That will not work.</P>
    <P>The Bill is acceptable to me only as a short-term measure, a measure for the next year or two until such time as we have our basic system of financing local authorities on a sound and sensible basis. We can then proceed from there.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister of State has just left because on a couple of occasions I have had the opportunity of discussing with him his ideas for the reform of local authorities and particularly for the reform of local authority financing.  I am aware that the Minister for the Environment referred in his Estimate speech to his wish and his intention to bring about this reform.  I welcome that general approach.  Fortunately, there are in the Department a Minister and a Minister of State who are committed to such reform. This is something that is long overdue but it must be faced up to.  It is nothing short of disgraceful that for the past ten years, since the rot of local authority financing started, when a Coalition Government in 1973 began to remove health charges <Col N="394" /> from the rates, no alternative co-ordinated system has been worked out.</P>
    <P>We started in 1973 and worked through progressively to 1978 in removing the health charges from the rates.  In 1977 domestic rates were abolished and in 1981 there was a reduction in farmers' rates.  In 1982 the High Court decided that the PLV system should be abolished as it applied to farmers but up to now we have not brought forward any alternative system of financing local authorities.  We are now in the position where local authority financing consists of a mishmash of non-co-ordinated schemes.</P>
    <P>In my short contribution, I hope to show that this situation has had a very serious effect so far as many areas of the country are concerned and that overall it has done a lot of damage to our system of local government.  It is time we called a halt and came up with an alternative system.</P>
    <P>Whatever we might have thought about the rates system, when we abolished rates we left intact the collection system.  This would seem to be extraordinary. We have the same rates collection system in North Tipperary now as we had ten or 20 years ago.  The proportion of the area's revenue that came from rates was about one-third.  Today it is 4 per cent but we still have the rate collectors. It is estimated that in this year we will be spending more than £200,000 in order to collect a total of £430,000 in rates from just more than 1,000 ratepayers.  That represents about 50p in every pound by way of expenses.  This is not the fault of the rate collectors, of those people who have been employed in good faith down through the years and who have worked the system but it is the fault of successive Governments who have interfered with the system, who have failed to devise an alternative way of financing local authorities and have not come up with an alternative way of using rate collectors or letting them go and properly compensating them for going.  Unfortunately, because of their status they cannot be made redundant in the ordinary way. There are steps which should have been taken which now need to be taken.  It is scandalous that half the money collected <Col N="395" /> in rates in my county is absorbed in collection. That situation is repeated in every county which has a significant farmer ratepayer content in their rates collection system.  This should have been tackled before this.  I asked the Minister for the Environment to take urgent steps to rid us of this inefficient system.</P>
    <P>I want to move on to what I regard as the most serious aspect of local authority financing since 1978.  In 1977 rates were struck throughout the country on a basis which related to the different counties' needs at the time.  Very few local authorities, managers or councils could have anticipated that the decision they took that year would determine their local authorities' well-being for the years ahead.  That is exactly what happened when rates on domestic dwellings were abolished after Fianna Fáil came to office in 1977.  The Fianna Fáil Ministers and subsequent Ministers placed a limitation on the increase in rates by local authorities and also placed a limit on the annual increase in the rates compensation contribution to be made by central funds.  I estimate that in the five years from 1978 to this year the increase has been of the order of 58 per cent whereas the increase in the consumer price index has been of the order of 90 per cent.  Local authorities have had the differential there as a shortfall in the resources available to them.</P>
    <P>This has not hit every local authority uniformly.  I was very pleased to hear Deputy Richard Bruton make the point that some local authorities are being discriminated against because of the system since 1977.  If local authorities were left to their own devices they would have the money to provide services since 1977. The fact is that because of interference by Government local authorities have been given an increase of 58 per cent in the revenue they need to provide their services notwithstanding the fact that the inflation factor in providing those services has increased in the order of 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>I want to give an example of how this has affected one area.  Obviously, I am more familiar with my own area but this must repeat itself through the country.  It <Col N="396" /> is estimated that in North Tipperary in 1983 the effective level of funds available for maintenance of all road categories &mdash; I am picking road categories because the maintenance of roads is something councils have to pay for, as is the case also with sanitary services &mdash; will be 34 per cent below the 1978 level.  We are spending 34 per cent less on the maintenance of roads in North Tipperary than we did five years ago.  It is extraordinary that we could tolerate this for such a long period.  It is extremely dangerous to have allowed this to go on for that length of time.  In North Tipperary we estimate we have over 1,700 miles of roads of all categories.  We estimate that the capital value to us of those roads is well in excess of £120 million.  It is probably now of the order of £150 million.  If those roads are destroyed or damaged they will have to be replaced.  They are being eroded.  If the present means of maintaining them continues it will not be too long before the foundations of those roads are so destroyed that they will have to be replaced.</P>
    <P>Roads represent the most valuable infrastructure available to North Tipperary.  The same must be true of every county.  It is the one area where Governments, particularly Fianna Fáil Governments, must take the blame &mdash; although, given our current economic difficulties, the present Government are tempted to do the same thing, and have done this year.  It is an easy way out for politicians in difficulty or for public servants, who have to come up with proposals in difficult economic circumstances, to cut back on this, not provide money to local authorities and then the local authorities will not maintain the roads. We find ourselves in my county this year spending 34 per cent less on road maintenance in relative terms than we did five years ago.  This is a recipe for disaster, as far as infrastructure is concerned, and it must stop.</P>
    <P>I would like to give an example of how this manifests itself.  For various types of roads there is a desirable dressing cycle. For national primary routes the desirable surface dressing cycle is every five years: every five years surface dressing should <Col N="397" /> take place.  I am sure our area is typical of every local authority.  In my area the attainable cycle this year will be eight years.  For national secondary roads the desirable surface dressing cycle is six years and the attainable cycle in 1983 is ten years.  For regional main roads the desirable surface dressing cycle is seven years.  In 1983 the attainable cycle, because of the economics of local authority government, will be 13 years.  For county roads, which are very important, the desirable surface dressing cycle is nine years but the attainable cycle this year is 23 years.  This means that instead of surface dressing our roads every nine years this can be done only every 23 years.  That situation has been getting progressively worse over the last few years.  It is clear that somebody must shout stop, that we must examine the whole area of local authority financing. That should not be done for the sake of country councillors meeting their constituents or for the sake of Dáil Deputies, who realise it is not so easy to get a turn taken off a road or to get lighting put somewhere.  It is simply because we are eroding our assets and destroying the basic infrastructure of the country.  We must put a stop to this without any further delay.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to something Deputy Richard Bruton referred to briefly.  The system of financing local authorities we have had since 1978 has been inherently discriminatory so far as some local authorities are concerned.  Some local authorities in 1977 were enterprising and were prepared to risk the wrath of the public by striking high rates.  This is true of Dublin Corporation at the time as well as some other local authorities.  It is equally true that many councils throughout the country, because of conservatism among the councillors or council management, were slow to pile on any rates increase.  The year 1977 has been taken as the base year on which all increases from then on have been determined. There were some areas which, prior to 1977, had a lot of development, perhaps major water schemes, major sewerage schemes.  Because of the council's obligation to provide 50 per cent of the interest <Col N="398" /> on capital borrowed from the Local Loans Fund, for which they had to make provision in their rates, they happened to have a particularly high rate at that time. Notwithstanding the fact that some of those loans could now be repaid, because that rate was high in 1977 their entitlements to an increase each year are determined on the basis of the 1977 rate.  It is also the case, and certainly true of my end of the county, North Tipperary, that there were not that many schemes in existence, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle well knows.  It is also the case that since then North Tipperary County Council have undertaken one major scheme in Borrisoleigh and want to undertake major schemes in Thurles and Nenagh, regional water supply schemes to which I have referred.  But the actual financing of those schemes, so far as the county council is concerned, can prove to be crippling.  Because of the system of financing, because we are entitled to 10 per cent or 15 per cent on our 1977 rate, because no account is taken of development by way of regional water supply schemes, sewerage schemes or whatever, because we are not given any particular allowance for this, North Tipperary County Council will do worse than a county that had made plans for these prior to 1977.</P>
    <P>I pose the question: what was so magic about 1977?  What was so important about 1977 that every decision taken by local authorities in the years following &mdash; and six years have gone past in the meantime &mdash; has been based on the rate obtaining then?  Why should 1977 have been so important?  Are we not all aware that decisions taken, decisions planned in 1977, like the abolition of car tax, like all of the economic madnesses and niceties provided by Fianna Fáil planned in 1977, have now been reversed because all of us have seen how stupid and silly they were? Even Fianna Fáil &mdash; apropos <i>The Way Forward</i>&mdash; now admit that those policies were stupid and dangerous ones.  Because the domestic rate was abolished in 1977 and an alternative system of financing was never devised, an accidental system arose that has remained there ever since. Why should that remain sacrosanct?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> This system of financing local authorities by way of contributions from central funds, simply on the basis of the 1977 rate, must be abolished.  It is discriminatory and damaging.  It means simply that those areas that were developed in 1977 have become better developed since.  It means also that those areas that were not developed, or that were under-developed, relative to their neighbouring counties, to Dublin Corporation or to other areas, have done particularly badly since then.  It is against regional policy, it is offensive to people who live in areas that are, relatively speaking, disadvantaged or deprived and a stop must be put to it.</P>
    <P>Implicit in all I have said is the call for a review of our system of local authority financing.  I accept this Bill on the condition only that it is an expedient there for a year or two.  I regard it as necessary because of the condition of the finances of local authorities at present.  We must start now to review our system.  I am aware from comments made already in the House by the Minister for the Environment and his Minister of State that they are interested in reform.  I accept the sincerity of their remarks and know they will strive to bring about these reforms. I hope what I have said will highlight the urgent necessity of bringing about those reforms.  It is not an easy job; it is one that will require a lot of effort.  It is a debate to which local authorities and their members throughout the country should be invited to contribute.</P>
    <P>I want to mention a couple of things which I think should be considered in the context of such a review.  First of all, on the expenditure side, it is a nonsense that local authorities should have to provide finance for health boards, for the drainage schemes of the Office of Public Works, for vocational education committees and agricultural groups like ACOT.  Local authorities should have to provide finance for the services they provide themselves and nothing else.  Let us stop being silly and nonsensical about it. Let us stop finding tolerable and acceptable this mish mash we have, this maze <Col N="400" /> of systems of financing one or other operation, one or other service.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I would appeal to Ministers to stop imposing new obligations on local authorities for which finance is not going to be provided.  I might mention one, namely, pollution control which went through since I came into the Oireachtas. It is great fun passing measures and discussing them in this House &mdash; for example, as to what we are going to do about pollution control &mdash; and then saying the local authorities will operate the system and go on to provide no funds whatever to local authorities for so doing.  Another that occurs to me now is the operation of the malicious injuries code.  It is stupid asking local authorities to administer things like that unless one is prepared to provide the finance for it.  All it means is that local authorities will be rendered more inefficient in their operations if they are not allowed to continue to carry out their own work.  It also means that a strain is put on their funds.  It means too that there is no logic or sense to funding various bodies &mdash; if the funding is coming from the local authority &mdash; when there is no liaison between the local authority and the provision of the services I have mentioned.  I make those points on the expenditure side.</P>
    <P>On the revenue side we have a major decision to make.  We must decide that either it is going to be a local tax or a central tax.  I would favour a central tax. I say that because I believe that in a country of this size it makes more sense to collect money centrally rather than locally.  The amount of money we would collect locally would involve us in collection costs not warranted by local authorities. If we want to run a rates system, or a system that draws funds purely from central funds, it should be done centrally. In the North of Ireland this year they have computerised their rates collection system; they have reduced their rates offices by, I think, half.  They have a £1 million computer installed and they will now offer discounts to people who pay their rates promptly.  That seems to me to be an eminently sensible approach to the problem and seems to be going in the <Col N="401" /> opposite direction from us, albeit on a temporary basis, in this Bill here today.</P>
    <P>I would urge that we have a centralised system.  I am not particularly fussed whether the tax comes from property, from income, from charges for services or whatever.  My inclination is to keep things as neat and tidy as possible.  Apart from specific services like planning, for which a charge can and ought to be made, for general services such as sewage disposal, water supply, collection of refuse, whatever, there is nothing wrong with a central system of collection.  Equally there is nothing wrong with the capital for sanitary services schemes coming from central funds provided it is recognised that different areas have different needs; provided it is recognised that an area, for example, which has not had the benefit of a regional water supply scheme, is going to need one that the allocation from central funds will be based on criteria that take factors like that into account.</P>
    <P>If that is done we could devolve a fair system, one that would not militate against an area that has been undeveloped in the past.  I have no great hangups about it.  I am quite prepared to listen to suggestions.  I only wish we could have a full debate on the subject.  There are very many county managers and council officials with a great many ideas.  I trust the reform referred to will be manifested in a very real sense and that some kind of paper will be published and invitations issued for suggestions and ideas.  In a year or so &mdash; I do not go any further than that &mdash; I hope proposals will come before this House designed to change the whole system. As it is at present the system will not survive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support everything Deputy Molloy said this morning.  We recognise and accept charges are necessary so that revenue will accrue to local authorities and enable them to meet the shortfall.  Like other speakers, I totally disagree with the way in which what the Minister proposes is being done.  Power is being taken from the elected representatives of local authorities and given into <Col N="402" /> the hands of the county managers.  I strenuously object to that.</P>
      <P>When this matter came up for discussion in Dublin County Council there was total confusion.  Members believed they were entitled to make decisions.  That was the belief on the part of every member irrespective of political affiliation.  It was very difficult to get from the acting county manager whether or not he was involved.  Some members brought in motions to the effect that it might not be necessary to introduce charges if savings could be effected in other directions.  It was at this stage that members realised that the power to make these charges lay with the county manager.  It was, in other words, an executive function.</P>
      <P>This morning the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The basic responsibility for deciding on the amount to be raised by charges will fall to be exercised by the council members in the context of their decisions on the estimates.</P>
      <P>Council members believed they had the power of making charges.  A circular sent out by the Minister &mdash; FIN 9/83, page 3, No. 10 under the heading of &ldquo;Functions&rdquo;&mdash; states.:</P>
      <P>The charges' functions assigned to local authorities under the Bill will as executive functions fall to be performed by the manager.  In practice, however, the amount of revenue to be raised by charges will be determined by the estimate adopted by the elected members.</P>
      <P>That is totally contradictory to what the Minister said here this morning and I disagree with the manner in which this is being done.  As I said, there was utter confusion about the whole situation and, when the Minister comes to reply, he has a duty to clarify the position.  In one statement the powers are vested in the manager.  In the statement here this morning the impression is given that powers lie with the members of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speech made by Deputy Avril Doyle was almost a copy of that made by Deputy Molloy.  She appeared to endorse the bulk of what Deputy Molloy said. <Col N="403" /> This represents a total erosion of the functions of members of local authorities. The powers of local authorities at the moment are based on democracy.  Now it is proposed to remove those powers. What encouragement will there be to anyone to stand for local election?  Councillors give valuable service and a great deal of time to the affairs of the council. If what the Minister proposes is passed what part can they play in the future?  I trust the Minister will reconsider this.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem lies in the difficulty experienced in getting the required information.  Had this debate taken place prior to the confused discussions to which I referred the position would have been clear.  What the Minister proposes is the re-introduction of rates in a slightly different form &mdash; I shall not say by the back door.  It is stated that it is not possible to do away with rates entirely.  It follows from that that something else must be in mind.  I have the greatest respect for Dublin city and county managers but, if this power is vested in the manager, it will be open to him at any time to introduce a charge, a charge that should be the responsibility of the elected members. Such a charge might entail a certain degree of unpopularity but, if an elected member cannot face some degree of unpopularity, then he should not be a member of a local authority.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the building industry last week I referred to planning charges. I am sorry the Minister for the Environment is not himself present at the moment because I should like him to know the point I am about to raise.  We all know there are many community centres operated by local committees and I would ask that planning charges in regard to these centres be waived.  I trust the Minister will deal with this when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony referred to what Deputy John O'Leary had said.  Deputy O'Leary was opposed to the system.  He made no reference to the charges. Deputy Molony referred in detail to <i>The Way Forward.</i>  I fully recognise that some charges are necessary in order to generate revenue for county councils to meet <Col N="404" /> the shortfall but I am coming back to the point that I am totally opposed &mdash; and I hope we will be putting down an amendment &mdash; to powers being taken from the members of local authorities and invested in managers.  This is wrong and a total denial of the rights of members of local authorities.  I would hope the Tánaiste would see fit to change the provisions of the Bill in this respect.</P>
    <P>I accept that some new system must be found.  Reference has been made to the rates having been abolished in 1977 and the failure to find a proper system of financing local authorities.  I accept that this situation must be remedied.  It may be that the funding is to be from central funds.  If decisions are left to local authorities, the powers should be restored to the members.  I would hope that new legislation will emerge arising from the discussion on this Bill.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about Dáil reform.  If this Bill is an example of reform, in which powers are taken from members of local authorities and vested in managers, I have to confess to grave dissappointment.  I would hope that a new system of financing will be found in the near future.  There is a great shortfall to be met, a great deal of work to be done.</P>
    <P>Every speaker to the debate has mentioned rates.  Work cannot be carried out without adequate finance.  It is a question of making the finance available.  It is a matter of disappointment that there were considerable cutbacks in the Estimate for the Department of the Environment this year.  Possibly during the year this matter will be remedied.  I would hope that when the Tánaiste is referring to the debate he will indicate that the position is being reconsidered.  I make a special appeal to the Tánaiste in regard to charges for planning applications for community centres and community halls.  I would hope that such charges would be waived.  That would be in the interest of everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that due to commitments earlier in the day I had not an opportunity to pay as much attention to this debate as I would wish and perhaps as a result I may repeat items that have <Col N="405" /> already been discussed by other Members of the House.  Perhaps it will not be too bad if I do that because obviously the persons most concerned about the introduction of this Bill are members of local authorities.  I have been noticing from the monitor that those who have been contributing to the debate are for the most part members of local authorities with the dual mandate of being Dáil Deputies also.  They are the persons most experienced to speak about this Bill and the general problems besetting all local authorities at the moment.</P>
      <P>With hindsight it is easy to be wise. Probably every Member of this House and the majority of local councillors and certainly the majority of city and county managers would say, with hindsight, that in 1977 the implications of removing rates were not studied sufficiently.  But perhaps it was expedient in 1977 to remove the rates; the removal of rates was something that was politically desirable; there was a movement from the people themselves for the abolition of rates and equally there was a problem that the implementation of rates was unconstitutional in its form at that time.  All these matters combined to bring about the abolition of rates without a real understanding of what would happen.  Around the year 1977, certainly in the greater Dublin area, an enormous amount of development was taking place and of all the times to abolish rates that was the worst time because the responsibility and the onus on Dublin city and county council became enormous with the development taking place in the city and, more particularly, in the county, where the three new satellite towns were being planned and commenced.  If the implications of what would happen in the running of local authorities had been studied more closely perhaps we would not have this Bill before us today.  We might have had a change in the rating system but perhaps not a Bill such as the Bill before us today.</P>

    <P>I agree with what Deputy Sean Walsh and other speakers have said, that making these charges an executive function of managers is regrettable from the point of view of local councillors.  I would like to remind the House, however, that the <Col N="406" /> implementation of water charges by county councils has always been an executive function of the manager.  The confusion that arose at county council meetings in Dublin was not so much the fault of the manager or anybody else as of the councillors because the water charge had been so small &mdash; £4.50 is what I was paying in Dublin.  Very little discussion took place about it and in my time on the council nobody bothered to ask about the water charge except to discover that it cost half the amount of money that was brought in to collect and one of the comments made to anybody who delved into the matter was that it was the manager who imposed that charge.  So far as the imposition of a water charge or an increase in the water charge was concerned that was always a manager's function. This Bill is extending that function to give managers authority to raise other charges and to give local authorities who had not that authority the power to raise water and other charges.</P>
    <P>I would say, and I have already said it to the Tánaiste, that he should put a time limit on the provisions of the Bill.  That would allay the fears of many local authority members that they will have very little role in the running of local authorities.  I do not think that is what the Tánaiste envisages.  I do not think any reform of local government should have that intention.  We should consider the words &ldquo;local&rdquo; and &ldquo;government&rdquo;.  The thrust of local government reform must be to make local government more local. This is what I hope will happen when we come to apply ourselves to discussing local government and I hope this House will have an opportunity to thrash out how best that can take place.  Many Members of this House have enough experience from their work on local authorities to come forward with a new structure that will be more applicable to the day-to-day living of people in housing estates, of schools and youth groups.</P>
    <P>Some people may consider that this Bill is taking powers away from councillors that they have at the moment.  However, they have not, for instance, authority to strike a water rate: this power resides with the county manager.  All <Col N="407" /> local authorities are burdened with enormous debts.  Councillors do not have powers to expand services unless they cut back on other services.  When we deal with the estimates all we are doing is moving draughts on a draught board.  The Minister is trying to get the whole system of local government back on the rails again so that it can become local.  As a councillor, I should prefer that all financial matters remain reserved functions but I accept the reality of the situation. This Bill will improve matters.  As I have told the Minister of State privately, there must be a time limit on this Bill to allay the fears of councillors and to ensure that we mean what we say when we talk about local government reform. A time limit will ensure that this reform is carried out.  We do not want the matter to stretch out <i>ad infinitum.</i>  If I am standing in years to come for election to a local authority I do not want us to be still talking about local government reform. It must become a reality in the next few years.</P>
    <P>I do not think the implications of the abolition of rates were properly examined. While abolition of the rates may have been of benefit to the ordinary people, with hindsight it has been accepted that it was an undermining of our democracy.  The abolition of rates took from local authority members the powers they are asking for now.  Perhaps people did not examine that aspect sufficiently at the time: if they had, a different decision might have been made.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to planning charges.  Naturally people do not like additional charges being imposed.  However, if one contracts a plumber to do a job in one's home one has to pay a fixed charge before the work is done.  The planning charges were a legitimate way of ensuring a better service in the planning departments of local authorities.  Cases have been made that community halls and similar projects should be exempt from planning charges.  When the finances of local authorities become healthier I would agree with such a proposition. Any project of a community nature has a good case to make for waiving <Col N="408" /> planning charges or for reducing the charges, but I do not think it is realistic at the moment to start exempting people when the finances of most local authorities are in such a bad state.</P>
    <P>Among reasonable people there is an acceptance that money is scarce.  For a number of years we thought there was a magic wand that could be used when money was required.  There was no question about the source of the money: there was a magic pot with money for every project.  It was rather like Jack and the Beanstalk, with a pot of gold at the top. Unfortunately the beanstalk was chopped down and cold hard reality is facing people now.</P>
    <P>Perhaps for the first time members of local authorities are really examining their estimates.  I was elected as a member of a local authority in 1979 but for the two years it took me all my time to make sense of the estimates books.  I was quite prepared to be a little more than a rubber stamp because I did not really understand all the problems.  The money was available and members were content to nod through estimates.  Dublin County Council deal with 450,000 people.  This year it took us five meetings to strike a rate.  I was impressed by the depth of discussion on the part of every councillor. It was an either/or situation: either we raised revenue or we began to cut back on services.  There was no other choice. For councillors who were first elected in 1979, this year was the first time they really faced up to the reality that they had a function to play in striking a rate and in examining estimates thoroughly. We decided that next September a special committee of the council will sit down with the manager and heads of departments and go through the estimates.  We do not want a situation next year of just nodding through the estimates.  The councillors will have a role to play in finding areas where saving might be made.</P>
    <P>If the imposition of charges were to become a reserved function of councillors the possibility of putting a time limit on councils should be considered.  Perhaps they should tell the manager in <Col N="409" /> October that they want to look at charges and the maximum amount of money they will allow the manager to raise by way of charges.  They should tell the manager that a certain amount of money will be raised which will work out at, perhaps, £50 per house.  Thus, the manager will know he will get, say, £3 million in charges and if he needs more money he must make savings, he must cut back on services and become more efficient.  In other words, we must ensure that councillors have to take the decision because there is a danger that councilors facing a decision in the teeth of striking a rate and preparing their estimates will be told by somebody: &ldquo;Hold it, cut that thing over there but do not cut in my patch&rdquo; or &ldquo;Put a charge on such and such a service&rdquo; because some councillor knows that it will have very little relevance in his constituency. We must take it out of the realm where each councillor is fighting for his own corner.  In September or October before we even know what structure the estimates will take we must plan for, say, 1985-86, to raise £2 million or £3 million on charges at the rate of £30 or £40 a house.  Thus the manager will know the parameters within which he must prepare his estimates.  Deputy Flynn might look at that when he is going over his plans for local government reform.  It is important that powers be vested in the councillors and that they be masters of their own destiny, because whether it is the managers or the councillors who put on charges the public will blame the councillors anyway.</P>
    <P>For many people councillors and council are synonymous.  The people do not see the difference between an executive function and a reserve function.  If it is explained to them at meetings they will see it, but generally speaking it is the body corporate of the council.  Councillors, albeit locally elected, become one with the council when elected.  Perhaps there is a fudging in the minds of the general public and whether the manager or council bring in these charges it is on the heads of the councillors and any acrimony that arises will fall on the councillors. The suggestion to give the responsibility back as a reserved function in a <Col N="410" /> couple of years, perhaps when the finances of councils become more healthy, is worth looking at.  Perhaps written into any Bill or any new structure should be the provision that prior to the year of striking the rate the council would come together as a body and decide how much money they will raise the following year in charges.</P>
    <P>Most reasonable people who are trying to build homes for themselves, run businesses, go to jobs and colleges and so forth realise that there is a need to pay for services.  There is no need to go overboard and say that you can gather in millions of pounds by charging, but most people will realise the need for a service charge of some sort if the service is to continue and be efficient.  Deputy Molony talked about the burden on local authorities.  I have mentioned this at many council meetings.  It would be better if this House did not continue to bring in legislation which in turn is put on the backs of local authorities with none of the finances necessary to implement the measures.  It would be better if we were not blinding the public by saying that we brought in this Bill or that Bill for the local authorities to implement, so complain to them.  That is central Government closing their eyes to the reality of what they are doing and bringing unfair criticism on local authorities because something is not working when, in turn, they cannot make it work.</P>
    <P>Examples are the Casual Trading Act, 1980, the Litter Act, 1982, various Acts relating to the control of dogs, social welfare payments &mdash; although local authorities get back grants on that.  The Casual Trading Act, 1980, came to my local authority, Dublin County Council, and it is probably more relevant in Dublin county than anywhere else in the country, particularly in view of the enormous numbers of travelling people and itinerant population in County Dublin.  The local authority in County Dublin have not done one iota to implement that Act, nor can they do so because they have not one single penny left over after striking their rate and preparing their estimates.</P>
    <P>That is where the advantage lies of a <Col N="411" /> Bill such as this, despite complaints levelled against it.  If at local authority level we could get the power back into our own hands and not leave it in the banks or the lending agencies perhaps we could start to tackle some of these provisions of good Acts which have to be implemented by the local authority.  We continue to get complaints from local residents about all the problems associated with casual trading and that will continue for years because Dublin County Council have no money to implement the Act.</P>
    <P>The Litter Act, 1982, was a fine Act welcomed by everybody in this House.  It is absolutely essential to raise the stupid fine of £5 for somebody who pollutes or litters the countryside and is brought to court.  It is worth the fiver to him because that is less than the cost of petrol to take him to the tiphead and it is worth his while to dump in the ditches and roadside, in north county, south county, east county and west county and into the sea. The Litter Act was good legislation but it was put into the hands of the local authority.  After a few months Dublin County Council from the on-the-spot fines &mdash; the only financial provision available to the county council to implement the Act &mdash; had raised £35.  That is seven fines at £5 a go and it would not pay for even the printing of the tickets they had to give out to people on the spot and certainly would not pay the salaries of the litter wardens who had to implement the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see a maximum fine of £500 imposed on somebody convicted in the courts under the Litter Act and that money should have come straight into the coffers of the local authority on whose back the job of implementing this Act was laid.  I hope that central Government will see the wisdom of that and when they hand these Acts to the local authority to be implemented they will allow the local authority to get the revenue from such implementation.  Thus the local authority will not end up with the nasty part of it, with all the funds going into central Government.  At least the local authority then would have the power, having obtained £X,000 from fines, to make <Col N="412" /> available depots for cars and so on, so that people who have finished with their cars can bury them at the local depot and not leave them on the side of the road for the litter warden to collect.</P>
    <P>These extra burdens which have been put on local authorities without the finance necessary to implement them have given rise to unfair criticism of local authorities and of local authority members, because all they can say at meetings is that, while we have a Casual Trading Act, and a Litter Act, they have not the money to provide the people they represent with the various advantages of these Acts such as special dumping grounds for old cars, old television sets and so on that we find in the ditches. Present policy is somewhat shortsighted. If those Acts could be implemented properly savings would accrue elsewhere and litter wardens and other staff in the administration would not spend weeks writing to councillors saying that such a car should be removed and so on.  I would prefer that we did not continue to pass Bills here unless we can make local authorities work on them.</P>
    <P>The Bill we are dealing with is giving an executive function to the manager, but it is a discretionary executive function.  In other words, there is not automatically an onus on the manager to impose charges on any county council, city corporation or urban council area.  It is discretionary &mdash; in other words, if a county council are already dealing with their financial problems properly and have managed to balance their books, there is no need for these charges.  It is a discretionary executive function which I hope will soon be on the Statute Book, but the discretionary element would come into play when the manager had balanced the books but may want to bring in a new scheme.  The charges will come into their own when, perhaps, the public would like to see a golf course built.  If there was no money, there would be a good case for introducing a small charge so the public could see what they are getting for their money, because people complain about having to pay when they are not getting a good service.  We can all recollect times when we did not get a <Col N="413" /> good service in water and so on but, generally speaking, most of us are satisfied. Nine out of ten times our bins are collected, water comes out of our taps and we are able to flush our toilets.  Local authorities provide a good service in most areas.  I had someone complaining to me this week that two bags of garden refuse were not collected.  Dublin County Council do not normally collect hedge and grass cuttings.  After she had complained for some time I asked her how many times her bin had not been collected in the last six years and she said that, in fairness, it had happened only once.  It would be wrong to imply that local authority services of the kind that are most relevant, the provision of water and bin collections, do not work properly.</P>
    <P>There is a wider aspect to the services that people have come to expect and do not always associate with local authorities. They provide for the maintenance of graveyards, community grants systems and so on and they give a human face to the local authority.  Local authorities are no longer synonymous with sewers and drains, roads and pot holes.  They provide a community grant for scout dens, play groups, tidy garden and art competitions, things which are relevant to day-to-day life.  That is the best part of local government and we should be capitalising on that aspect.  Last Sunday I was present at the Dublin County Council civic award ceremony involving a number of youth groups.  This scheme was introduced last year and there were 30 entries from schools with children whose ages ranged from 11 to 16 or 17 years.  Two of their projects have been selected to get further financing through a community grants scheme.  If we not get rid of the debts that exist in local authorities these will be the first schemes to suffer because, strictly speaking, they are not essential services. You cannot close all the sewerage works in an area because you are short of money but community grants would almost certainly be cut.  These are the schemes which give the most satisfaction to all hard working councillors in the county. We must not have a situation where money put aside for community grants is <Col N="414" /> used to fund more essential schemes which do not give so much pleasure to the community.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on the manager to introduce charges but he must be very careful to recognise that there will be people who literally will not be able to afford them.  Undoubtedly, in any scheme there will always be a need to waive charges for some people.  Humanity must be shown to people who cannot afford charges.  In Dublin County Council, where we have increased our water charge to £30, we have introduced a scheme recommended by the manager which will allow people on certain State benefits to apply to have the charge waived.  It would be a sad day if an elderly person felt that because they could not pay for water they could not use it and perhaps, as a result, would suffer ill-health or death.  However, some of the schemes we have introduced over the years have perhaps left a little bit too much leeway and have cost more to implement than the revenue they raise.</P>
    <P>We must look at the advantages of this Bill because any local authority member who is doing his or her job has to face up to the fact that we are no more than rubber stamps until we get our county council finances into a healthier state. City and county managers have a very strong, active organisation and they should use it to ensure that there is uniformity of ideas as to how charges will be implemented so that we do not run into further serious problems.  In a case where a city and county border on one another, or where a dividing line between the two areas is between No. 60 and No. 61 on a road, we must ensure that the occupant of No. 60 is not paying more than the occupant of No. 61 for what appears to be the exact same service.  One of the advantages to be gained from this Bill is that the city managers are a smaller body than that of councils and local authorities and perhaps there is a better chance of having fewer problems related to the introduction of charges if they discuss this matter very carefully before they come to the council and say they are putting on a charge.  City and county managers should sit down together and decide how <Col N="415" /> best to implement these charges in the most humane of ways.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the day when this Bill becomes redundant and when even the introduction of charges could become redundant except in cases where a new type of service or scheme is being introduced into a council area.  In other words, the charges would be in the background as a way in which, for a short time, a county council can raise money to buy, perhaps, a public park for an area, open a golf course, a new graveyard or provide some new libraries.  The public could then see that these funds were being used properly.  If local authorities got down to the job, they could make many savings in present expenditure.  It is a fair comment and a warranted criticism that many areas in public spending at local authority level are not giving good value for money.  The many councillors who are also Members of this House have a special duty because of this dual mandate and know how difficult it is to get any more money for anything.  We have a responsibility at local authority level to carefully scrutinise expenditure.  There may be areas of waste and inefficiency.  Perhaps banks of land are building up which may never be needed for a productive purpose at council level.  Now is the time, when faced with the introduction of charges, for councillors, managers and staff to examine acreages of land which have been owned by the council for many years and which they will never be able to develop because they are landlocked or waterlogged.  If this land were sold for a more productive purpose that finance could be used in a better way at local level.</P>
    <P>I do not welcome any diminution of the authority and power of local authority members.  However, this Bill at present is essential.  If councillors examine their consciences they will realise that it is needed.  I hope the Minister will amend the Bill to make it of limited duration and follow its introduction with sound proposals for local government reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think that I would have anything in common with <Col N="416" /> the Fine Gael Deputies, but we appear to have something in common.  I oppose the manner in which this Bill was brought about and am delighted that so many of the Fine Gael backbenchers have done likewise.  I hope that we will not have to wait one or two years but that they, through the parliamentary system, will exert as much pressure as possible on their Ministers and the Cabinet to ensure that this legislation will not be implemented. This is a change from a democratic system for local authorities to a form of dictatorship by local authorities, possibly at the end of the day resulting in the abolition of county councils.  If we allow the county managers more executive functions than at present, apart from the 1968 function in relation to water charges, they will have the power to charge for all services except street cleaning and public lighting which would be the sole responsibilities of the councillors.</P>
      <P>At this stage, prior to the local elections in 1984 we must decide whether the councillors will have power or not.  This Bill would give the manager functions which he should not have.  Anyone in favour of this must believe that the councillors are not responsible enough.  Many councillors are Deputies of this House and they are responsible enough.  If we believe that extra finance is required, we are capable of discussing the question of charges.  This is rates, not by the back door but by the front door.  It is a substitute for the shortfall in the domestic relief and the agricultural grant.</P>
      <P>This Government and their Department of the Environment owe Donegal County Council £800,000 and they are asking us to increase our water charges and various other charges to make up that shortfall.  We have no intention of doing that.  If it is possible to institute proceedings against the Department, we in Donegal will take the initiative.  The quicker the Minister repays us that £800,000 the less chance there is of our taking the Minister to court.</P>

      <P>We must again look at the executive and the reserve functions of the manager.  There is much ambiguity between the circular sent out to the various councils on 10 May 1983 and this morning's speech of the Minister for the Environment.  The council suggested that the functions would be executive functions and the statement today to the House is as follows:</P>
      <P>The basic responsibility for deciding on the amount to be raised by charges will fall to be exercised by the council members in the context of their decisions on the Estimate.</P>
      <P>That certainly contrasts with the circular of 10 May which states:</P>
      <P>The charges functions assigned to local authorities under the Bill will, as executive functions, fall to be performed by the manager.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State, when replying to this debate, to clarify the position. This appears to be another way of introducing a monthly budget through the councils.  Practically every week there is a budget through increases and ministerial orders, apart from the budget itself. The county manager is being asked to collect taxes on behalf of the Minister for Finance.  It is unfair of the Government and the Minister to pass on these charges to the county manager and ask him to act as Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The councillors are responsible for the maintenance of courthouses, piers and harbours and sheep dipping pens.  The charges in relation to courthouses should be the responsibility of the Department of Justice or of the Office of Public Works.  The return from these buildings to the council is practically nil.  Piers and harbours should be the responsibility of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and possibly, in Gaeltacht areas the responsibility of Roinn na Gaeltachta.  In regard to sheep dipping pens, it is unfair <Col N="418" /> that these should be the responsibility of the councils.  They should be the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture under ACOT or the local offices.</P>
    <P>On the question of roads, the Minister should seriously consider the block grant situation.  At the moment, particularly in my county, it is practically impossible for councilors or the county engineer to decide where the money should be spent. The decision comes largely from the Department of the Environment.  I hope the Minister will consider favourably the suggestion to allow the councillors to decide how the block grant should be allocated.  Nobody knows better than the councillors, the county engineer and county manager where that money should be spent.  In Donegal we have a national primary road from Bundoran through Ballyshannon, Donegal town and on to Ballybofey and Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>There is an area in west Donegal where we have largely main and regional roads. These are the main arteries from east to west, from Gweedore and Dungloe through to Ballybofey and Letterkenny and from Gweedore to Kilmacrenan.  We have no money to improve these roads to any great extent.  I ask the Minister to make money available to us so that we will have a main artery from west to east. The Minister has promised to come to Donegal and I hope that when he does he will not stop on the national primary roads.  When he sees the roads I am sure he will be in favour of making money available to repair and improve them.</P>
    <P>Industrialists are deterred from coming to this part of the country.  We have a very high unemployment level and are not proud of the fact that 10,000 are unemployed.  Most of this is in west Donegal.  One of the contributing factors is the infrastructure, particularly the road system.  I cannot describe how serious the situation is there.  The potholes are so large that if we got a newsflash that Shergar had been found in one of them it would not surprise me.</P>

      <P>Essential repair grants, disabled persons grants and housing grants are administered by the local authorities.  We should consider having new house grants administered by them as it would expedite inspections and payments. A new house grant can only be paid when the house is lived in.  It can take some time for an inspection to be carried out particularly if an inspector has to come from another part of the country. If a file is sent back it can take many months before a second inspection is made.  If this was dealt with by the local authorities it could be done more expeditiously.</P>
      <P>Home improvement grants could be administered by local authorities.  It takes many months from the time an application is submitted to the Department of the Environment before an inspection is carried out.  Many people are frustrated by the conditions in which they live.  They decide to commence work in the belief that the Department will look at their application sympathetically and make the grant available.  If the foundations are dug these people do not qualify.  Until such time as the Minister decides to decentralise the administration of these grants he might try to expedite the inspections.</P>

      <P>We require £4.87 million for housing loans and supplementary grants this year.  To my knowledge all that has been made available is £2.8 million.  I hope the Minister will ensure that a further £2 million is made available to help those who are in debt to the bank at present and who have commenced building houses in the hope of receiving advances from the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the charge of £30 per house for planning, it could be argued that this is reasonable in view of the fact that many inspections are carried out.  The Minister should look at the cost of £1.75 per square metre in relation to buildings.  In my constituency many small business people are endeavouring to set up in business and give employment.  Prior to any sanction <Col N="421" /> from the IDA or Údarás na Gaeltachta they must obtain planning permission, which can cost between £600 and £3,000. This is penal and another form of taxation. It deters many people from going ahead.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, not in the light of what has been said on this side of the House but in the light of what has been said on the other side, if they have the numerical strength to pass the Bill, to refer it to the councils.  The Bill will relate to reserved functions rather than executive functions.  Otherwise it will be pointless having elections, because if the Bill is passed as it is now there will be absolutely no need for county councillors in the future.</P>

      <P>The Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No.2) Bill, 1983, has called into question the functions and financing of local authorities.  The kind of speeches we have had today indicate the difficulties that members of local authorities have been experiencing in recent years.  This Bill has been given very careful though within the Cabinet and within the Government as a whole.  With reference to the last speaker I should like to set the record straight in relation to the Estimates that were inherited by the present incumbent of the office of the Minister for the Environment.  Those Estimates showed clearly that there was a £96.5 million shortfall relating to that Department.  When the Coalition were returned to office they allocated an extra £31 million to the Department thus leaving a shortfall of £65 million compared with the £96.5 million that would have been involved had Fianna Fáil been returned to office.  This would have meant that the charges to be implemented under the previous Government would be of the order of 50 per cent higher than will be the case now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reservations about some provisions of the Bill but I assume the legislation will be of a temporary nature and that we are not discussing a <Col N="422" /> measure which represents the thin end of the wedge for the years ahead.  The Bill will give local authorities general discretionary power to charge for the services they provide.  That is reasonably fair on the assumption that people should expect to have to pay for services that are provided for them.</P>
      <P>For some time there has been a great need to clarify the future role, the responsibilities and the functions of local authorities.  The Chair is only too well aware of the number of council meetings which take place throughout the country and which are attended by councillors who are diligent in their work, who do the best possible within the constraints placed on them but who spend hours waffling about nothing because of their powers having been eroded down through the years.  Their diligence and their dedication to duty on behalf of the areas they represent have never been recognised.  Out of all of that has come a clear need for a clarification of their functions. Up to now local authorities have never been aware of what moneys they were allowed to raise.  They were unsure of State assistance and of the limits being fixed on the additional revenue they might raise while there were no limits to the demands that other bodies could make on them.  County councillors never had a clear picture of their role.  For some time there has been acceptance of the need for guidelines in this area.  Local authorities must have meaningful decision-making powers if they are to function properly in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The services in respect of which people are expected to be levied will be left to the local authorities in terms of the level of the charges.  I have doubts in some cases about the co-operation and the relationship between managers of various local authorities and members. There may be instances in the future where county managers overstep their authority and seek to use this discretionary power in a way that would be more relevant to dictatorships.  What I am talking about is a situation in which councillors might find that the wishes they expressed on behalf of the people they represented were not adhered to by the <Col N="423" /> county manager in introducing the charges we are talking of.</P>
    <P>There has been a general acceptance already of the proposal to impose charges in respect of planning applications.  In the past it was unfair to have a situation in which vast numbers of planning applications had to be processed by local authorities without there being any payment involved.  In many cases applications might not have been proceeded with until such time as the statutory date of validity had expired.  A matter that has been raised recently is the levying of charges in relation to planning where community centres and other buildings being provided by a local authority for the community are concerned.</P>
    <P>There should be a recognition in the Department that, despite these difficult economic times, there is within the community a very great willingness to co-operate on ventures that are of community benefit.  Where communities have to raise substantial amounts of money for such buildings it is unfair that there be levied a service charge on a square footage basis.  This might involve the community in additional thousands of pounds while the building concerned is one that should have been provided by other authorities down through the years but which was not provided because of a lack of the necessary facilities and willingness to do so.  Some leniency and concession should be shown by the Department in recognition of the efforts within communities to provide such facilities for themselves from their own resources.</P>
    <P>It is unfair that local authorities should be levied with demands in respect of which they have no input.  I speak of arterial drainage, of social welfare supplementary allowances and of various education charges and indeed the combined purchasing charges which often are levied on local authorities.  These are functions that belong rightly to the Exchequer and to the Departments under which they are headed.  There is no point in various local authorities having to fork out substantial sums of money under such headings.</P>
    <P>When the reform of local government <Col N="424" /> takes place those functions should quite rightly be transferred back to the various Departments.  This is an area that needs streamlining and must be considered within the context of the reform of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to various pieces of legislation introduced by this House but in respect of which money was not provided by the State.  The Litter Act, for instance, was one of the biggest jokes ever.  It was a piece of legal rubbish.  We still have the situation in which people can drive into our scenic areas and dump any refuse they wish.  It is impossible for local authorities to have litter wardens dispersed through the bushes taking photographs of those people or taking car numbers so that they might be apprehended and eventually fined £5.  A little foresight in the House might have helped a lot in terms of making available to local authorities the facilities to enable them to implement such legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher spoke quite rightly of matters in Donegal.  Two matters came to my notice recently although these may not be relevant to the Bill.  The first is that many young couples who build their own houses must build them as cheaply as possible.  If they avail of either a Housing Finance Agency loan or, as I would prefer, an SDA loan, they tend to build the houses by way of direct labour.  They usually have the houses designed either by an architect or by a draughtsman. Usually it is designed so as to be very close in square footage to the limit for eligibility for a new house grant but often if the foundations are not perfectly square and in accordance with the drawings, it may be found that the house is five, ten or perhaps 20 square feet over the legal limit.  Through no fault of their own the couple concerned are deprived of the benefit of the £1,000 grant.  While the additional area might be only very small, the task of bringing it within the limit by, say, moving a front door or a back door could prove very awkward.</P>
    <P>Although there is a statutory regulation in this regard I would ask the Minister to consider a system based on a penalty clause whereby, for instance, a person whose house was deemed to be 10 <Col N="425" /> square feet greater than the legal limit would qualify for the new house grant but would be penalised to the extent of, say, £10 for every excess square foot.  In other words, in the example I am giving, the grant would be £900.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill refers to charges in relation to planning permission and other things.  I know I have strayed outside the Bill but I wanted to make that particular point.  In many cases the rents charged by local authorities in relation to the houses they build are very reasonable and the waiver facility which exists for county managers is applied fairly across the board.  One aspect of that is that the repairs needed to be carried out to houses by local authorities often take a very long time to carry out.  I ask the Minister to look at the youth employment scheme or the AnCO scheme in relation to local authorities because very worthwhile training could be given to young people under supervision in carrying out repairs which are not major repairs and which could be carried out very effectively.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that local authorities have experienced a growing incapacity to maintain their services to say nothing about developing them to the limits which are necessary in this day and age. If we take 1976 as the base year for inflation, road construction costs and rates, we find that in 1979 these had increased by 138.3 per cent, 166 per cent and 136.7 per cent respectively.  In 1982 inflation had risen from 76 per cent to 241.3 per cent, road construction costs went up by 300 per cent and rates increased by 193.7 per cent.  It is very difficult for local authorities to expand their services to the level which people are now demanding in relation to the facilities they see in other local authority areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The western counties in particular, having very large expansive grounds to cover and having a lesser density of population have never had the buoyancy of currency to give them sufficient money to develop in the years gone by to the extent which more densely populated smaller <Col N="426" /> counties have been able to do.  This has discriminated against local authority areas in larger counties where the ceiling of rates has been placed by the Exchequer over the years.  The introduction of charges with discretionary powers and with waiver rights is something I welcome as far as county councillors are concerned. I have my doubts about the ability of some county managers and their relationship with members of local authorities to do this effectively.  Many councillors have been forced by the erosion of powers over the years to spend their time in county councils talking about notices of motion for which there is no money to implement, talking about section 4's which are forced on them by political pressures and other minor irrelevancies which take up the time of county councils and local authorities, which are quite expensive in relation to attending at court, as Deputies know.</P>
    <P>The road grants which are paid on national routes are paid specifically in areas selected by the Department of the Environment.  All the local authority engineers can do is adhere to the pressure of county councillors in relation to the deterioration of the roads in certain sections and hope for the best after that. Payments are made by instalments in arrears.  It could be argued that grants are payments for work done by the local authorities for the Department.  The short-term financing cost of undertaking the work in advance of payment should be recouped by the local authorities.  The grants that are made payable by way of subsidy towards the cost of loan charges incurred by local authorities in financing capital works are recoupable 100 per cent in many cases in respect of housing loans and there is 50 per cent or 60 per cent subsidy on sanitary services.  The State recoups the local authorities in relation to the excessive expenditure.  This whole area must be taken into account in relation to the reform of local government.</P>
    <P>The charges which are presently placed on local authorities in respect of unemployment assistance, arterial drainage and other areas should be referred back to the relevant Departments.  It is not fair to have local authority members presented <Col N="427" /> with a very large bill at the end of the year in relation to something they have had absolutely no input into whatever. The role of local authority members and the dedication of county councillors has never really been recognised by any Government over the years.  These men and women throughout the country do their best in very difficult circumstances to represent the people who democratically elected them.  I believe if those people were given the opportunity of discussing the levies, the size of charges or the amount of charges to be created by local authorities they would certainly do so in a responsible manner.  I have some doubts about the ability of some county managers to do this effectively.  It is essential to clarify their responsibilities and their roles in accordance with some clear-cut principles.</P>
    <P>I believe people accept the introduction of the charges.  If people are going to get a service they are prepared to pay for it.  There are many instances of small communities throughout the country raising very substantial sums of money in a short time for facilities which have not been provided by local authorities or by the State.  There is a willingness among people, so long as it is equitably spread across the board and so long as there is justice in it, to pay for their services.</P>
    <P>The refuse collection charge needs to be looked at.  If you have a person who is supposed to collect refuse charges who walks down a street and tells people that they must pay for this service and that their refuse will be collected each week those people have the right to say that they are prepared to go to the local dump with their refuse.  They also have the right to go out on the street that night and dump their refuse in the middle of the street.  The responsibility is then on the local authority to clean it up without asking for any charge.  The charge is then put on the taxpayers of the particular county.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill from the point of view that people are prepared to accept charges in respect of services provided for them.  I have some doubts about the county managers having absolute rights in relation to the amount of charges to be <Col N="428" /> introduced.  This will be seen in some cases as an erosion of powers of local authority members.  I ask the Minister to look at the overall duration of the Bill.  I hope it will be temporary only and when the Local Government Reform Bill comes before the House that a solid, progressive look will be taken at the financing and functions of local authorities and that there will be a clarification of their role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> My contribution will be brief.  As a member of Dublin Corporation I am very concerned about the implications of this Bill. Some people have said here that it is rates by the back door but to me it is rates by the front door.  We are in this Bill giving county and city managers executive powers and we are taking away any power the local representative had.  Those managers will dictate to the councillors and we are giving them the power in this Bill to do that.  It is interesting to note that all the speakers on the far side do not agree with the implications of the Bill because some of them can see what will happen. It is also interesting to note since rates were taken away by a Fianna Fáil Government that many Fine Gael speakers especially have cried out loud to have them brought back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies on the far side of the House have spoken about the waiver of the charges when cases can be made of inability to pay.  In my constituency I would say that more than half of my constituents could declare inability to pay.  Deputy Owen said earlier that up to now local councillors were only rubber stamps.  The way I see the situation now is that managers will dictate to us.  There is a list of charges mentioned in this Bill and I wonder how many people will be able to pay these charges.  For instance, many young people who have bought a house, who saved very hard in order to buy their homes and who are now paying up to £300 and £400 per month, will find that they now have to pay these additional charges which, in respect of the number of services that will be provided, could amount to another £300 or £400 per <Col N="429" /> annum.  I would be interested to know what additional services will be provided. I hazard the guess that there will be none, that rather we will be paying for the services provided already.</P>
    <P>If we look at the position in relation to planning, any local person objecting to some building being erected in their area must pay to lodge their objection and, if they are unable to pay, the building will go up.  It seems to me also that house-building will decline because of the charges builders will have to pay, referred to by the last speaker also.  In this respect the building industry will decline even further because people will be unable to buy houses on account of these additional charges.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy on the far side of the House spoke about local government reform and maintained that, when such is being done, these functions will be transferred back to central Government. There was mention also of the Litter Bill. I must say that its provisions in the Dublin Corporation area have been operating well.  There are now litter wardens who are doing a good job.</P>
    <P>I am concerned mainly about the ordinary householder who must now meet these charges.  I remember back in the sixties when there were large protests in this city on account of rates.  People at that time were charged perhaps £200, £300 or £400.  Many of them were unable to meet these charges and cases were brought before the courts.  I fear we will see the same thing happen in the very near future.  I totally object to these charges.  I know my colleagues in Dublin Corporation have already lodged their objections in the City Council.</P>

      <P>One would think, listening to a number of Opposition speakers, that local authorities and the Government had sufficient money to provide all of the services people expect to be provided, or that they could be provided on hot air.  The Opposition spokesman knows very well that when car tax was abolished and rates removed from houses in 1977 local authorities throughout the country were starved of finance to keep them going.</P>

      <P>Some of it came back to them, as the Deputy well knows, since he was Minister for the Environment.  It was money to the Exchequer, some of which at least was returned in order to provide better roads, roads which have been deteriorating rapidly ever since.</P>
      <P>When I became a member of our local authority in February 1975 our estimates for that year amounted to approximately £11 million.  Our estimates for this year amount to almost £22 million.  It takes that huge amount of money to pay for the services people require of us.  We are now collecting about 70 per cent of the refuse of the entire county.  The local authority, with the help of the Department of the Environment, provided group water schemes throughout the county.  In our county we struck a water rate four years ago to pay for the extra services we were then providing.  I might say also that in 75 per cent of the villages throughout the county we have provided not alone water supply but sewerage schemes.  Again, that was forward planning. Today, unfortunately, because of mismanagement in the long-term, we must now charge people for the service we have provided.  Take any individual or any young couple wishing to build a house for themselves in a rural area, it will cost them at least £1,000 to provide a water supply and at least £500 for a sewerage system.  Then they must pay the ESB to keep their water pump going.  A small charge to such people for the services being provided by local authorities is now only right and proper.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of the Bill with which I do not agree, that is I would hope that within a year or two the powers that the Department of the Environment are giving to local authority managers would eventually be given to members of local authorities themselves.</P>

In regard to forward planning for the provision of the services I mentioned earlier in our towns and villages, we were lucky to have the county managers we had.  If a service had to be provided we were always prepared to strike a rate which would provide that service.  I trust we will be given the requisite powers within a year or two years. We have not yet got over the implementation of the 1977 policies which took most of our powers from us.</P>

      <P>Housing grants were mentioned and we are delighted they still exist.  They were restored by our Government in 1981.  The giving of both grants should be the prerogative of the local authorities.  I would suggest that people who have received a grant within the last ten years should have the waiting time reduced to three years.  At the time they may not have had the money to do a proper reconstruction job, but now with a family growing up and more money coming in possibly they would be able to do whatever reconstruction is necessary. I suggest they should be eligible for a <Col N="432" /> reconstruction grant within three years.</P>
      <P>Every county should have an inspector based within the county.  Now inspectors have a couple of counties to look after and people have to wait perhaps two or three months if they miss the inspector on the first occasion.  I would like the Minister to look into that.  I suggest too that the block grant from the Department should be distributed by the engineers and the county manager instead of the Department deciding where and how it should be spent.</P>
      <P>People have no objection to paying for services.  We all know nothing is free. Those who would resent having to pay are few and far between.  As things stand certain sections are paying for everything that is provided, be it refuse collection, water supply or health services.  We have only one-third of the population in work and that one-third has literally to pay for all the services.  Irrespective of who forms the Government the moneys requisite to pay for the services provided must be collected.  There is no way out.  Things are very different today from what they were in the sixties and seventies.  My ambition is to provide people with all the services they require, but if we do not have the money we cannot provide the services.</P>
      <P>The roads in my county are in a dreadful state.  They have deteriorated very badly.  The Minister visited our county recently and so he knows what the problems are.  We are unique because of the amount of traffic using our roads. Remember, we are on the verge of Dublin city.  We shall need more money to repair and reconstruct our roads.  I trust it will only be a matter of time until we receive the necessary finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some speakers maintain people will not be able to pay these charges.  I do not believe that.  The charge will be minimal. There may be criticism but the local authority member who cannot stand up to criticism is not worthy of being a member of a local authority.  I never had any hesitation about voting to increase the rate if by doing so we were improving services.  I am talking now of the time when we struck our own rate.  It was a <Col N="433" /> much better day for the councils when they made such decisions themselves.</P>
    <P>In my county we have a water rate. Some years ago we suggested at a sub-committee meeting that we would use that money to help to provide other water supplies in small villages and rural areas. There was a good prospect of developing the whole county within ten or 12 years. If Fianna Fáil had remained in Government they proposed that the total amount to be raised by local authorities would be £96.5 million.  This Government provided an extra £31.5 million which reduced the burden on local authorities. Fianna Fáil did not say how they would require local authorities to collect the money but I am sure it would have been done in much the same way as we are proposing.  Fianna Fáil have criticised what this Government are proposing but I do not think their proposals would have been different.  We would be told that the manager had the authority to introduce these changes and we would also be told we would have to implement them if we were to provide services.</P>
    <P>I would be very reluctant to see county managers having this absolute power in the years to come.  I am totally against such legislation.  Many members on local authorities said at the time of the abolition of rates that it would leave them without any powers.  I agree with that. We did not abuse those powers for the sake of political gains.  I have been a member of a local authority for more than eight years and I am confident that we used our powers in order to provide the services required by the people.</P>
    <P>I should not like to think that we would continue to downgrade local authorities and their members.  Elected members of such bodies are best able to deal with local affairs.  I am chairman of the local committee of ACOT.  The establishment of the head office of that organisation recently has meant that members of local authorities and of county committees have lost the powers they had in implementing schemes.  In my county those schemes were exceptionally worthwhile. Because of the policies of the late 1970s and the 1980s local committees have money only to pay members expenses <Col N="434" /> for six months.  In 1977 local authority members were deprived of their power to strike a rate.  That meant ruination for the local authorities.  It meant they had to await a decision from central Government with regard to the striking of a rate.</P>
    <P>By giving local authorities power to implement charges for services members of such bodies will be retrieving some of the ground they lost in the past two years. All members of local authorities will agree that they have been undermined by central authority.  Ministers in all Governments have not tried to justify the position of local authorities.  Legislation from Central Government is not the best way to deal with local matters.  When local people make representations to us about services, we should be able to tell them the exact position.  At least local authorities now will have a say in what happens to the money that will be collected for the services they have to provide.</P>
    <P>Business people must pay rates.  They are the only ratepayers left and only about 600 are left in my county.  If they are paying rates we must take into consideration on their behalf whether we will clamp a large charge on them for services for which they are the only people now paying into the local authority system.  I would be against that.  On the other hand, large urban populations have not had to pay charges for water as such.  What is good for one is good for all and if everyone is involved it cannot be said that one section is paying and the other is not.  I hope that people who are paying rates at present on their business premises in urban areas will not be asked to pay again.</P>
    <P>Does anyone welcome the introduction of charges on any section of the community?  No.  For years we have been trying to improve the services but as long as people who were voting for us as politicians did not have to pay, that was all right.  We cannot run away from the fact that the money is not there.  The £65 million of which the local authorities are short must be found.  Nobody in Government and no Minister for the Environment want to see local authorities going bankrupt, but that will happen if we do <Col N="435" /> not collect moneys from the people for whom services are provided.  I agree in principle that the services should be continued and improved and the only way to achieve that is to charge for them.  However, I do not agree in principle that the county manager should have total control in coming to council meetings and telling us what he is going to charge and councillors themselves not having a say in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want it to go on record that I disagree with the managerial function whereby a manager can put charges on local authorities with his own consent.  That means that we as county councillors and elected representatives have no longer a function to play in local authority.  The powers have been taken away gradually from elected local authority members.</P>
      <P>I disagree with quite a number of the planning charges.  I do not disagree with the £30 charge for planning permission for a bungalow, but if you wish to apply to have a community centre built the local community must pay a planning charge. I do not agree with that.  Because a community centre is provided by the local people in that community they must raise money to provide that community centre and if they are to be charged from £300 to £600 for planning permission that is a crying shame because that money is so hard to raise at the moment.  This will discourage people who are thinking about going into business, perhaps providing a small factory for themselves. They will have to think twice if they have to pay a large sum of money with their planning application for that little factory. If you apply for planning permission and your application is turned down I believe that your money will not be returned.  I disapprove of that.  I hope that the Minister will change that provision. You should not have to pay for something that you did not get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> Putting charges on people who cannot afford them is a pretty tough thing to do. Quite a number of people are unemployed at the moment.  If we are trying to put extra charges on them for water, refuse collection and various other things I am afraid these people will be unable to pay because unemployed people find it hard to manage on the few pounds they are getting.  If we are putting charges on people who are living in local authority houses and who are unemployed, I ask the Minister to try to have that small charge included in their rent because they would not be able to pay £30 or £40 for water rates.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said all the damage was done in 1977.  We are sick and tired of listening to talk of damage done in that year.  The Government should decide on what steps they are going to take to remedy the damage done in 1977 and they should not be crying about the damage that was done then.  The Government were elected to govern and they should get on with the job.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this measure. It is appropriate to state at the outset we all agree that, in general, a total overhaul of the structures, functions and powers of local authorities is appropriate. Obviously, the mechanism for financing the operation of local authorities is an intrinsic part of such an overhaul.  I understand the Minister is well advanced in consideration of the general reorganisation of local government and I should like to commend him in his work thus far. It augurs well that he is applying himself so diligently to the job in hand, because for many years very little was done apart from facilitating the demoralisation, if not disintegration, of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure has a number of interesting aspects.  I followed the debate closely throughout the day and the discussion, from the point of view of the Opposition, had been somewhat negative, especially when you consider that if the dice has fallen differently some <Col N="438" /> months ago their tune would probably be very different now.  I have served on a local authority since 1974 and one of the regular refrains from all sides of the House in that council has been a demand to give more power and control to local authorities.  Unquestionably, one of the ways of doing that is to give a local authority some degree of flexibility in relation to raising their own finances.  For many years I felt strongly that the kind of power without responsibility that the local authorities exercised was a bad thing because it allowed councillors, perhaps with every good will and benevolence towards the community, to levy rates without any regard for the source of the funds.</P>
    <P>This exercise here means that all local authorities will be forced to think about where the money is coming from.  That kind of responsibility is good for us all, as citizens and public representatives, because if we have learned anything in the last number of years to which Deputy Brennan referred it is that the day of the free dinner or free anything else is gone. Every councillor who strikes a rate and every public representative who makes a political promise should be able at the same time to say precisely where that money is coming from.  There is a great degree of bellyaching about this measure and I am astonished in some aspects at the outcry which has greeted it, especially from the Opposition and also from some organisations who claim to be representative of the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>When we speak about the measure before us, what are we talking about?  Out of a total financial provision for local authorities this year of £1,350,000, this measure will facilitate the raising by local authorities of £21 million.  From the hullabaloo from the Opposition, one would think that the roof was going to fall in in terms of local authority finances.  It is only a drop in the ocean, although in a number of respects it is very welcome indeed.  For the first time it will ensure a modicum of justice <Col N="439" /> in relation to what people will pay for the services they use.  In another respect, all it does is to rid certain parts of the country of an anomaly, because there are many people paying water rates already. Speaking for an area that has not paid water rates, I am quite happy that the citizenry will pay for the service they obtain.  That is the principle I was brought up with and I believe it is good for the community in general.  We should pay for what we get rather than assuming that somewhere there is a Government, a local authority or somebody else who pays.  This Government are giving testimony to the fact that nobody else will pay our way and that the profligacy and the waste of the last four-and-a-half years have to be faced up to.</P>
      <P>The reason this measure is before us is that when we all agreed to the abolition of domestic rates, and most of us supported the abolition of car tax and other measures, none of us had the courage to speak about the alternative sources of revenue.  Now we are beginning to nibble back on what was a cowardly dereliction of responsibility by this House.  I hope the lesson we learned during those years will not be lost on us: that we should not buy temporary political popularity at the cost of future generations.  This is a small measure which will give local authorities some responsibility for the sums they will have to raise and should afford them a serious opportunity for debate and discussion on options and alternatives.  It will force a council, or a sub-committee of a council, to say, if they only have a limited amount of money for a service, that they will either have to go without or raise local charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, with specific reference to the interjection, allows for local authorities to have flexibility on how they will raise these charges.  The manager's role in all this has in most cases been to act in very close parallel, if not in unison, with the elected representatives. Pending what I hope will be significant <Col N="440" /> changes ultimately in relation to the powers and functions of elected members of local authorities, the measure before us is the appropriate one.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the day when elected representatives will be able to assume more control and responsibility, perhaps eventually extending into this area.  But this is not the day on which that should happen because the councillors are not equipped at present to assume such responsibilities.  Pending an overhaul and a fundamental reorganisation of local government, any Member of this House who suggests otherwise is being a little dishonest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth hurts, but if the Deputy listens quietly he will learn something. In specific reference to the last question, the truth is that it was the last Government which secured enactment of the legislation under which the planning charges have been introduced.  The budgetary decisions of the Deputy's Government <Col N="441" /> relating to local authority finances included a specific provision, in addition, for major increases in charges for other services and for a new water charge for domestic use of water in urban areas. That was the Deputy's Government.  The additional charges envisaged were calculated to raise £55 million.  Even then, on the previous Government's calculations and allowing for the <i>laissez faire</i> approach which they regularly adopted to such calculations, there would have been a shortfall of at least £19 million in the local authority finances for the current year.  In fact, the deficiency would have been about £40 million.  Both the record and the Opposition are silent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all hypothetical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on how this massive gap in the provision must be made good or whether, indeed, it was the intention that local authority financing should be allowed to slide into a completely disastrous condition, a condition in which there would have been a broad spread cutback in services and associated employment.  If the £40 million deficiency, which is unarguable, in the provision must be made up through local charges, I cannot imagine what the Opposition would now be saying when what we are trying to do is raise a little over half of that and we have a sustained, unremitting and obstructive opposition and hostility to the measure.  That is the position which this Government inherited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government made good the shortfall primarily by adding £31.5 million to the previous provision for rates support grants.  That, too, is undeniable, despite the well nigh impossible budgetary position and general economic difficulties which all of us will agree, even the Opposition, that this <Col N="442" /> Government inherited.  This means, obviously, that much less revenue has to be raised on this measure than would otherwise have to be raised.</P>
      <P>The previous Government's decisions and intentions &mdash; and I did not intend to go into this in such detail but I have been provoked &mdash; were entirely in line with their stated philosophy regarding local charges with which, incidentally, I am not in principle in disagreement.  All I disagree with is people who change their tune fundamentally because they change their side of the House.  We all allow for a little degree of politicking on these occasions, but a total and fundamental change of heart in four months is too much to accept, even from an Opposition which have in their time done some extraordinary somersaults.  That philosophy was set out as far back as 1972 in a White Paper on local authority finances with which Deputy Molloy is very familiar indeed.  It provided that the maximum amount of revenue should be raised by local authorities from charges for services and proposed that a general power to impose charges for services should be conferred on local authorities.  That was the Fianna Fáil Government's White Paper of 1972.</P>

More recently, a document which is called &mdash; and the Deputies will all remember this &mdash;<i>The Way Forward</i> provided for &ldquo;realistic charges&rdquo; to be imposed for use of sanitary services &ldquo;in the context of legislation to empower <Col N="443" /> local authorities to charge for services generally&rdquo;.  In other words, I ask the Opposition can they deny that they proposed to introduce legislation to empower local authorities to make local charges?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I could go on in this vein, but it is not a form of diatribe in which I freely indulge.  However, one is a little annoyed at seeing the truth stood on its head.  I hope I have indicated to Deputy Molloy, who prompted that type of response, that the known and published intentions of his Government in regard to the development of charges for local services give the lie completely to the line which has been adopted in a number of Opposition contributions &mdash; not all, but some &mdash; to the debate on this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy mentioned that one of the reasons for controlling rate poundage levels which his party have operated since 1978 was to protect the commercial and industrial ratepayers from maverick local authorities.  Apart from the fact that this does not say a great deal for the local authorities or their members whom Deputy Molloy appears to be championing, we all know that the real reason &mdash; and I can say this as somebody who suffered the discomfort of being on a local authority where this applied &mdash; for limiting the rate poundage increases under the 1978 system was the need to limit the demands on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have confidence in local authorities. They are doing a good job and need more assistance.  They are willing to accept greater responsibility, greater fiscal autonomy and greater sensitivity about the manner in which they will now be afforded the opportunity of raising some moneys, a very small percentage, of the total budget with which they will be dealing this year.  Nevertheless, it is a measure which affords them, for the first time, an opportunity of dealing realistically with the budget for which they actually have <Col N="444" /> responsibility up to now in a nominal sense.  This measure of local authority responsibility is borne out by the fact that in this year of 1983 not one of these local authorities struck a rate which any of us would accept as being in any way exorbitant.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Opposition in this respect that where they may very well have objections in matters of detail or in matters of significance in interpretation in aspects of the Bill, they should be a little more fulsome at least in expressing the truth that they, too, had they been in Government now, would be introducing a measure which they promised repeatedly since 1972 &mdash; that is, a Bill to allow local authorities to charge for local services.  If at least we would clearly acknowledge that common ground, we would be doing this House some degree of service and not implicitly putting forward the kind of untruth which has in a sense lain behind what we are discussing. It is good for the local authorities that they be given this degree of responsibility and I hope that in the measure which I assume and expect the Government will announce in due course with regard to the reorganisation of local government generally, they will be given more authority, more autonomy and more responsibility, both fiscal and otherwise.  All of us will agree on the need to decentralise, in so far as possible to give power back to the local area.  If that can be achieved, then all the communities under the control of local authorities will benefit.</P>
    <P>A number of submissions have been made on aspects of this measure.  The Confederation of Irish Industry have expressed some unease about aspects of the Bill and how it will affect them.  I assume that the Minister is conscious of their request and having read their submission, I see some strength in it.  I must also say that there is a growing distaste in what one might loosely call the body politic at all the special pleading which has got us into the mess we are all in.  Increasingly, I must admit to a certain unease about the very intense and self-centred lobbying which goes on regularly.  It is almost impossible now to attend a meeting either in this House or in a local <Col N="445" /> authority office, without a picket making a special pleading outside the gates.</P>
    <P>Allowing for a certain degree of qualification in that respect, the concerns or anxieties of any group should be taken into account as far as possible by the Minister.  I feel quite certain that he will give consideration to such requests.</P>
    <P>In general, it is very hard to reconcile what I call, in a slightly jocose way, the bellyaching of the Opposition today &mdash; an Opposition who four months ago were in Government &mdash; with what we all know would have been the case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government as a matter of urgency to draw up proposals for the development of ship building and repair at Verolme Cork Dockyard, and as an interim measure in the interest of preserving the jobs of the work force to place immediate orders for the building of a fishery protection vessel and a fishery research vessel.</P>
      <P>We have reached agreement on the division of the time between Deputies.  I hope this debate will be held in a calm, cool atmosphere with the major concern of all sides being the employment of the workers.  The motion calls on the Government as a matter of urgency to draw up proposals for the development of shipbuilding and repair at Verolme Cork Dockyard and, as an interim measure in the interest of preserving the jobs of the work force, to place immediate orders for the building of a fishery protection vessel and a fishery research vessel. The Government have seen fit to amend the motion in a way which scares me.  Their amendment states at the end:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>to provide subsidies up to the maximum <Col N="446" /> level permitted by the European Commission to enable Verolme Cork Dockyard to undertake and/or complete orders for vessels won on the open market.</P>
    <P>This strikes me as saying to Verolme that unless they win on the open market the Government will not give them orders for vessels.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that this is the second time I have been involved in such a motion in the interests of the future of Verolme when a Coalition Government was in power.  The first time was on 25 and 26 November 1975.  We moved a motion then because the Coalition placed orders for bulk carriers in Japan.  It is ironic that we should now be asking for a consideration to be given to the acute problem which exists in the shipyard in Cork Harbour. I shall quote what the Minister of the day, Deputy Keating, had to say at column 270 of the Official Report for 26 November 1975:</P>
    <P>Let us look at these three interests in order, and if I put them in order, I must put the Verolme workers first. They certainly want security of employment and I do not think there is any division anywhere in the House in regard to our commitment to safeguard that for them.  They also want the full range of shipbuilding skills to be developed in that shipyard.  They also want a shipyard which is viable, not the obligation of viability in the middle of recession but which is viable by ordinary commonsense criteria in the long term.  This is not a place where the Government should be called on to put in money decade after decade.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that we have introduced a motion this evening calling on the Government to state clearly their intentions with regard to the workers' future, the skills involved and the major contribution that the shipyard has made to the economic wellbeing of Cork and the surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>Cork Deputies opposite know well that Cork city, Passage West, Monkstown, Rochestown and Douglas on one side of the harbour and Cobh and its surrounds <Col N="447" /> on the other side have long been dependent on the weekly salaries from workers in the yard.  The skills of the workers are famous throughout the world.  The craftsmanship and workmanship can be seen in the major vessels which have been built there over the years, in the repair work which has been carried out through the decades and in the general engineering work which has been a feature of the yard's activities.</P>
    <P>The reason we saw fit to move this motion was to indicate to the Minister the acute situation which arises in Cork at present.  It is one of the areas which is really suffering from unemployment.  The present figure for the city and county is 19,600 unemployed.  That is the official figure.  One year ago it was 15,100.  In Cork city 10,400 people are unemployed whereas only 7,900 were unemployed a year ago.  Those figures reveal the reason we are so concerned about the future of the yard.  I ask the Cork Deputies opposite to vote for our motion.  They will not be defeating or bringing down the Government by so doing but will be telling them to stop before it is too late for the erosion of employment which is taking place in Cork.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment states:</P>
    <P>... in spite of ... (b) the absence of provision in the Estimates agreed on by the previous administration either for new orders or additional production subsidies...</P>
    <P>That statement is incorrect.  Even if it was correct, the responsibility lies with the Government to preserve the shipyard's work force.  I should tell the House why it is not correct.  We prepared Estimates as far back as September/October last year and they were published prior to the year to which they applied.  That was the first time that ever happened.  It was understandable that there would be contingency provision in those Estimates. We provided a figure of £120 million contingency fund for our capital programme and a further £43 million for equity in State companies.  What happened to the £120 million?  In the 1983 budget presented <Col N="448" /> by the Minister for Finance in the early months of this year he stated:</P>
    <P>In the light of this experience and having regard to the overriding constraint imposed by the need to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement, the Government have decided to reduce the Public Capital Programme, as published, by £220 million in total.  This reduction includes the deferment for this year of the global contingency provision pending the emergence of projects which would meet the necessary investment criteria. A provisional allocation of £120 million was made by the previous Government for this, but was not earmarked by it for any particular projects.</P>
    <P>What is on the Order Paper in the name of the Minister for Industry and Energy is totally inaccurate and incorrect.  If he refers to the Budget Statement he will see that the Minister for Finance said that in this House.  We are talking about a very small fraction of the £120 million, a mere pittance by comparison with the total.  Look at the trauma of the 1,100 people who are employed there.  I know that the number has been reduced because of redundancies which took place there last Friday.</P>
    <P>I referred to the dependence on the yard of so many people and families on both sides of Cork harbour and city.  I referred to the skills in the areas of shipbuilding and ship repair.  There are so many angles that one could think of but a shipbuilding industry of that type is of strategic benefit to the country.  I will not have any Minister tell me that this company are just another semi-State lame duck.  That is not the case.  Verolme is an excellent shipyard, but like all shipyards in the western world it is going through a very difficult time because of the recession. Instead of committing several hundred, if not the entire work force, of the yard to the dole queue over a period, the Government should set about establishing a firm and clearcut policy for the future of the yard while providing immediate orders.  There are between 300 and 350 workers there who are on notice of redundancy.  Some left on Friday last and <Col N="449" /> others are leaving this week.  Unless orders are forthcoming quickly there is no guarantee for the remainder of the employees.</P>
    <P>I have never supported or encouraged street protests.  I do not agree with that form of protest but I can understand the frustration that drives some people on to the streets.  There was such an occasion in Cork at the weekend.  I considered the protest to be a peaceful one and I trust that the Chair will allow me quote a handout that was given to each of us by the people concerned.  It is headed, &ldquo;V.C.D. Protest Statement&rdquo; and reads:</P>
    <P>The main reason for a protest today is to make known publicly our total dissatisfaction and dismay with the Government's attitude and apparent lack of concern for the future of the State's only shipbuilding and shiprepair yard.  In July 1980 the government announced a shipbuilding programme whereby four ships were to be built in V.C.D., namely, one bulkcarrier, two fishery protection vessels and one research vessel.  To date only the bulkcarrier, which is being handed over in June, and one protection vessel, which is 50 per cent completed, have been ordered.  The two remaining vessels still remain to be decided upon resulting in 350 to 400 people having to be made redundant.  Since May 1982 representations have been made by Trade Unions and management to all local politicians, Ministers and party leaders of the need to honour their commitment to V.C.D. in relation to the two remaining vessels to be built. Unfortunately, all to no avail, as tomorrow Friday 27th May, 1983, 94 workers will join the already very long queue of unemployed plus another 175 people being given notice of termination of their employment.</P>
    <P>The Trade Unions and workers agree with the rationalisation and inevitable loss of jobs which result, for the purpose of ensuring a viable future for V.C.D. and remaining workforce. However, we cannot accept the offer of redundancy payments being offered by the company which is approximately <Col N="450" /> 10 per cent of local and national redundancy payments.  We must emphasise that any amount of redundancy payment is in our view a poor substitute for jobs.  On April 20th a delegation from Trade Union Group were informed by John Bruton, Minister for Industry and Energy that he hoped to have an announcement for the yard before May 6th.  No announcement was made.  On Monday May 23rd the Minister promised to have a cabinet discussion on Tuesday 24th May.  No discussion took place. That meeting was representative of management and trade unions within the yard.  These unfulfilled promises have resulted in V.C.D. personnel being totally frustrated and annoyed with the present Minister and Government and we now call on the Minister and Government to state publicly their plans for V.C.D. and let us know for definite if we are going to rise or fall as an industry.</P>
    <P>The statement is signed on behalf of the work force in Verolme by Liam O'Leary. He will be known to many Members of the House.  I need not say more than that.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a mere fraction of the £120 million figure.  In case anyone on the opposite benches or anyone commenting on the debate here should say that the Fianna Fáil speakers did not suggest where the money could be raised, I can tell the House where it can be raised.  In this regard I suggest that the Minister approach his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  We all know that independent commentators have said that the budget arithmetic is underestimated on the revenue side to the extent of a net £97 million, underestimated because of the extra revenue that will come as a result of certain impositions.</P>
    <P>Last week Deputy O'Kennedy outlined clearly, in arguing for some amendments that he had tabled to the Finance Bill, how this situation will come about. No amendment of any consequence in terms of altering the situation was accepted.  All that is required is a very small percentage of that £97 million to enable Verolme to remain in operation <Col N="451" /> and to keep the workers in employment through this year.  Of course the yard will seek out orders when world trade and shipping improve, but let us realise how much we can do here to facilitate and to help retain the skills that exist in this shipyard.</P>
    <P>In 1975 we found it necessary to bring before the House a motion to deal with a situation in which an order for bulk carries for Irish Shipping had been placed outside the country.  I understand the difficulties that the then Government could have encountered with Irish Shipping. We had to put the boot into Irish Shipping to ensure that an order for a bulk carrier was given to Verolme in, I think, 1980.  That is the one that will be ready for delivery within a month or two. We have to surmount many problems and obstacles in that respect.  As a result of decisions taken by the Government, Deputy Reynolds as Minister brought legislation before the House so that the necessary subsidy could be provided to enable the vessel to be built in the Cork shipyard.  In addition, we have been endeavouring to have an order for a coal carrier for the ESB placed with Harland &amp; Wolff in Belfast.  Obviously, the facilities at Verolme were not sufficient for the building of that vessel.  In the circumstances we considered that there was much economic and political sense in giving the order to a yard in this island, a yard that was depressed and under-utilised. There would have been a spin-off from that order for Verolme to the extent of £3 million or £4 million.  The Taoiseach some months ago tried to throw the blame in connection with that order on to our side of the House.  I admit that in our dying days in Government we did not make the decision to have the order placed with the Belfast yard.  There were difficulties to be overcome and the decision, one way or the other, would have been difficult.  However, had we remained in Government I am convinced that the decision we would have taken would have prevented the ESB from placing that order in Japanese yards.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision was wrong.  It did not make economic sense, <Col N="452" /> especially when we realise what we are facing now.  To have placed the order with Belfast would have been a wonderful contribution to the political development of the two parts of this island in that the Government of the Republic would have been seen to hand over a worthwhile order to the work force in Harland &amp; Wolff, thereby helping to retain jobs there.  At the same time, a figure of the order I have mentioned would have accrued by way of spin-off to the beleagured Cork shipyard.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I in the early months of this year saw fit to place a repair order across the water.  The Minister can correct me if he wishes but I believe the figure there was £650,000.  The Cork yard were asked to tender and were given a specified time when the contract should be completed. This is a good handy ploy often used to make sure that a particular company will not be able to complete a contract.  I am not sure what the difference in price was but time was the great factor.  The British yard said they could accept the time factor but that was only in theory.  They did not deliver by the appropriate time.  The Government should instruct companies like B &amp; I not to repeat this.  B &amp; I treated Cork hard enough with their recent decision to stop sailing between Cork and Pembroke but to add insult to injury they gave the £650,000, if my figure is correct, to a British firm.  Even if the figure was somewhat less than this it would have been very useful to Verolme if that order was given to them.  It would have helped to retain the jobs there.</P>
    <P>The main reason why we have put this motion before the House is to ask the Government, before it is too late, to stop this apparent attack on the south of Ireland, particularly the Cork region.  I know my Cork colleagues on the other side of the House have as much concern for the future of that yard and those other industries as this side of the House have. I want them to express their views in the most powerful way possible by tonight saying to their Ministers by their vote in the lobbies that they are not prepared to go along with them, that they want this yard retained and they want the work force retained.  The work force are prepared <Col N="453" /> to accept that some streamlining is necessary but that must be done in a properly organised way.  I have many friends, as I have no doubt all political parties have, in the work force of this shipyard.  Some men who are in their late thirties were given the great opportunity when they left school of going to Holland, doing their training there and coming back to use that training and skill for the benefit of the Cork region.  Many of those are now married with commitments and they are now being laid off.  That is the trauma for all our supporters and this is not confined to any political party.  The Minister has a heavy obligation.  This is not the right time to see a large number of people being made jobless.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the redundancy situation.  Can we not understand the frustration of the young people I have mentioned?  We have often heard opinions offered in the House about how difficult it is to employ the 50-year-old man or the man in his late forties but those are people in their late thirties.  They maintain, because of their specialised skills, that it will be extremely difficult for them to get employment in the present economic climate.  We have only got to look at certain decisions taken by the Government. Our leader was pilloried and many things were said about him.  When we did a deal it was referred to as a dreadful thing but somehow the present Taoiseach seems to do very expensive deals.  I am sure my colleague will have more information about the cost of the deals than I have.  We heard a lot about the Talbot workers but when the present Government did a deal costing two times or three times more than the Talbot deal we heard very little about it from anybody.  We read about it in one of the inside pages of our newspapers.  I refer to the Avoca Mines in Wicklow.  I remind the Cork Deputies that the Government did a very good deal with the workers there for obvious reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They made the deal before the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I forgot that the commitment was made before the election. <Col N="454" /> If such is the case and if the State paid out redundancy at a certain figure the workers of Cork are entitled to the same concession and treatment as the workers in Wicklow in relation to that issue.  The work force accept that a reduction in numbers may be necessary but we should realise that it must be done in a normal way, that it must be achieved and we must then ensure that the bulk of the workers are retained in viable employment at a time when Cork needs jobs so badly.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Health was answering questions earlier today he made the point that he could not this year give the extra week's payment to the long-term social welfare beneficiaries. The reason he gave for not doing this was that his Estimates could not bear an overrun on that side.  We must remember that his Estimates on the unemployment side will bear a great overrun unless the Government say stop in this situation. The Minister for Health will have to face up to this.  I do not believe that the Cork Deputies on the Government side, any more than I, wish to see the present approach to Verolme continue.  I want to repeat that the £120 million contingency fund is there.  There is a £43 million provision for further equity in State companies in addition to the £120 million.  If it is not there now there is buoyancy, there is unexpected revenue.  The ESRI say there will be more revenue than was expected.  We are only looking for a small portion of that to keep those jobs going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the two vessels?  There is a fishery patrol vessel and a fishery research vessel.  I read with interest today that the <i>Aisling</i> arrested three trawlers fishing within the 200-mile limit.  I congratulate the crew of the <i>Aisling</i> for achieving that.  Does that not mean that the expenditure on the <i>Aisling</i> is making its contribution to the preservation of Irish fishing and our fishing waters? Another fishery patrol vessel is needed and this can be used particularly in our extended waters.  The Minister should place that order quickly with Verolme Cork dockyard.  The other vessel is a fishery research vessel.  We accepted the <Col N="455" /> case for this in principle.  Even now, I am informed that the <i>Lough Beltra</i>, a converted trawler, has been laid up for lack of funds.  Surely a lackadaisical attitude like this to one of our natural resources is pitiful.  There is need for that fisheries research vessel which, in itself, will pay dividends in the longer term by using what could be said to be the widespread resources off our coasts, huge resources still not being utilised to the best advantage of the country.</P>
    <P>There are so many things one could say with regard to the closure but inevitably time catches up.  Cork is looking to us in this House &mdash; not to Fianna Fáil, not to Fine Gael or to Labour but to this Dáil &mdash; to call on the Government, to ask them for assistance when it needs it so badly.  In the past there was a Fine Gael Minister in this House who referred to the frivolous industries of Cork Harbour, including the one about which we speak this evening.  At times one wonders if it is that mentality, handed down from the 1975 motion, that is behind the sort of lack of commitment there appears to be in regard to this yard.</P>
    <P>I want to quote now from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 11 February 1983, leading article, which issued a warning to the Taoiseach &mdash; and I did not write this article &mdash; which reads:</P>
    <P>Today we offer a public warning to the Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald:</P>
    <P>The policy of retrenchment pursued by your Government in the South West region of which the deferment of the deepwater berth at Ringaskiddy is the latest example, now poses a serious threat to the economic wellbeing of the area.</P>
    <P>In a time of recession, cutbacks are inevitable.  But the &ldquo;economies&rdquo; introduced by the Coalition Government in the South West are neither logical nor equitable.</P>
    <P>They will inevitably lead to greater job losses in an area of already record unemployment.  They jeopardise existing industry and services and will seriously curtail growth in a designated centre of prime industrial <Col N="456" /> development.</P>
    <P>People in the South West have watched with growing incredulity the continuing series of Government measures which seem deliberately designed to downgrade the South West region and Cork City...</P>
    <P>Millions of pounds have been invested in the Cork Harbour project, which is vital in providing the services and infrastructure for further industrial growth.  But the entire plan is now being held up for the saving of £1 million which might not even be spent even this year.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael and their Labour partners have failed to honour a £30 million project which promised upwards of 2,000 permanent jobs in Cork, and Verolme is still waiting on the Government to fulfil a commitment to give a contract for a fishery protection vessel to the yard.</P>
    <P>We have in Cork a very difficult, troublesome scene at present.  As I mentioned in Cork County there are 19,600 unemployed, a figure constantly being added to.  Deputies on all sides of the House have already met the Dunlop workers earlier this week.  In fact the Lord Mayor expressed his views openly and honestly, which view seems to have been endorsed today on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash;that Dunlop appeared to have made their decision in Cork.  Although this debate is not about Dunlops, let us hope that the efforts of this Minister&mdash; and we shall co-operate together&mdash;will ensure that the jobs in that plant are retained with whatever involvement of other parties, or State involvement, helps us to do so.  I shall not refer to it any further except to say that it was interesting today to see announcements in papers, despite the loss of £80 million by the Dunlop company, despite the laying off of 1,200 people, that the chairman of the company or somebody, saw fit to give him an increase of 21 per cent bringing his salary to £84,000 and the name makes interesting reading&mdash;Sir Campbell Fraser.</P>
    <P>We brought this motion very sincerely before the House.  I have not been emotional, <Col N="457" /> I have spoken in a calm, sincere and deliberate way.  Despite the laughs from the opposite side of the House, I think the issue is beyond laughter.  I am glad that up to now there has not been a laugh or any interruptions either.  We are here on an issue that concerns a very large number of people.  I can call it 1,100 but I think we are all prepared to say it cannot be the full 1,100.  We want to get the message across that it must be the vast majority of those 1,100, it must be a long-term programme and plan.  We want to say to the Minister also that we will be as helpful and co-operative as we possibly can on this side of the House in the interests of the future of that yard.  They need something urgently; they need the order for the bulk carrier, they need the order fo the fisheries protection vessel to retain the workforce.  The money is there, the money was there in our estimates, £120 million; a fraction is all that is needed, and I took that from the budget speech of the Minister for Finance.  But, even if it has been taken out, let us forget that too, because all that is needed is a fraction of the extra moneys that will be available to the Exchequer because of the arithmetic of this budget, the £97 million or £100 million or so, nett, that will be available to this Government, indeed as estimated by independent sources such as the ESRI.  A very small part of that can be devoted to retaining the jobs, to placing these orders and preserving workers skills.</P>
    <P>I might mention one further point to the Minister.  We welcome, we need repair work, the yard wants repair work, as much of it as it can get.  But repair work is a very small contributor to the total employment content.  In other words, what we need most are more orders.  I hope, when the Minister stands up here this evening, he will be announcing orders for the two vessels I mentioned, plus perhaps repair work&mdash;which is also welcome&mdash;also the general engineering work, and I have seen them working on the sites in Campile, where they did some excellent work.  There is also their work on the NET site in Arklow, on mechanical contracts there, which were very successful.  There was <Col N="458" /> then the work on the ESB station in Tarbert, again very successful mechanical contracting work.  The skills were there for that also.  That is very useful work but a small contributor only. Repairs, general engineering works and so on are very welcome.  However when the Minister stands up this evening Cork will be looking forward&mdash;particularly the workers in Verolme and surrounding areas, Cork city, Passage West, Monkstown, Ringaskiddy, Cobh, and the other side of the harbour&mdash;to his announcement. It had been expected over the weekend but the Minister is entitled to his hour of glory also and to his announcement.  The Minister can rest assured that, if that announcement is forthcoming this evening, he will have our full support in any measures being taken to ensure we will have a contented, secure work force, not people who are wondering from day to day what will be the outcome.  I quoted at the beginning what Justin Keating, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, said in 1975 when we had to have a motion of this nature in the House.  I sincerely hope that, when the Minister replies he will be regarded as the first Fine Gael Minister to say: I believe in Verolme Cork Dockyard; I support Verolme Cork Dockyard; I have decided&mdash;my Government are supporting me&mdash; in giving two orders to Verolme Cock Dockyard and, in the longer term, we are drawing up a plan for the future shipbuilding project in Cork Harbour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Calls on the Government, in spite of (a) the very depressed present and anticipated situation in the shipbuilding market, (b) the absence of provision in the Estimates agreed on by the previous administration either for new orders or additional production subsidies, and (c) the difficult budgetary situation, to provide subsidies up to the maximum level permitted by the European Commission to enable Verolme <Col N="459" /> Cork Dockyard to undertake and/or complete orders for vessels won on the open market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to start by dealing with some of the points contained in the amendment I am proposing, and the Minister of State will be dealing in his speech with the situation in the past of the shipbuilding market in the world at the time.  I do not think there is any necessity for me to speak about it on this occasion.</P>
    <P>As to the absence of provision in the Estimate, quite frankly if the previous Government, of which Deputy Gene Fitzgerald was a Member, were as concerned as he now says they were about this situation it is quite amazing they did not make specific provision of the placing of an order in this case.  Reference to a contingency fund is really not credible.  I am quite sure if the then Government were serious about this matter they would not have left it in abeyance in the form of a contingency fund which may be used for any purpose or no purpose at all.  If they were serious then they would clearly have made specific provision.  They had the opportunity to do so and they did not make specific provision.  This is the fact of the matter and we must accept it as such.</P>
    <P>I should like now to trace something of the history of the enterprise.  Verolme Cork Dockyard employs approximately 950 people in shipbuilding, shiprepairing and general engineering activities at Rushbrooke, near Cobh, County Cork. In 1959 Verolme United Shipyards of Rotterdam acquired Cork Dockyards Ltd. and the company was henceforth known by its present name.  The Dutch parent was subsequently taken over by Rhine Schelde Verolme, Holland, in 1971 and the latter company has since held equity of £526,300 or 53 per cent in VCD.  It is relevant to note here that the holder of the balance of the equity is the State rescue company, Fóir Teoranta, which has £473,700 in shares.  When Fóir Teoranta acquired its shareholding as far back as 1963, it also advanced a loan of £1,447,000 to VCD.  Further loans of £600,000 have been made available to the <Col N="460" /> company since then.  An interest waiver which applied to these loans has of course cost the Exchequer a considerable amount of money over the years.  Equally relevant and indeed salutory to note is the fact that the Dutch parent, a giant company in comparison to VCD, has been unable to withstand the depressed trading conditions in the world shipbuilding market and has gone into receivership.</P>
    <P>Shipbuilding is and always has been by far the most dominant of the three activities of the company.  Since 1960 it has built more than 30 ships with a total tonnage of more than 600,000 tonnes deadweight, as well as a number of small barges.  The type of ship built has varied in size and complexity from small coastal vessels to 70,000 ton bulk carriers and from small naval patrol vessels to car ferries.  Offshore construction, mainly accommodation modules, was significant only in the seventies, fluctuating considerably. Shiprepair and general engineering have been reasonably steady sources of work.  The company incurred heavy losses in its early years of operation and did not make a profit until 1972.  From 1972 to 1978 profits were made mostly due to orders received at the height of the then shipbuilding-offshore boom in 1973 and 1974, but the company has been loss-making since.  The actual size of those losses has of course been grossly understated by the fact that State orders were secured at prices substantially above what would have been paid had the orders been placed abroad.</P>
    <P>In the period from 1960 to 1975, VCD obtained the majority of its orders abroad &mdash; 16 out of 27.  The company was at that stage competitive in the international shipbuilding market, mostly due to the lower wage costs prevailing in Ireland. However, since 1975 the world shipbuilding industry has been very depressed, with the consequent substantial overcapacity leading to cut-throat competition and prices which VCD is totally incapable of matching.</P>
    <P>We might recall at this stage that at the commencement of this crisis in the shipbuilding industry, the Shipbuilding Advisory Team, which is comprised of representatives <Col N="461" /> of the Departments of Industry and Energy, Finance and Transport and of the Industrial Development Authority, Shipping Finance Corporation and Fóir Teoranta, enlisted the help of consultants A.D. Little Ltd.  On the basis of their report, in March 1975, on the prospects for VCD, the Government approved proposals for an investment and development programme at the yard estimated to cost £5.76 million.  The consultants had reported favourably on the activities of the company but, in view of the expected drop in the world market for ships, they had recommended a reduction in the yard's dependence on shipbuilding and an expansion of its ship repair and offshore/general engineering activities as far back as 1975.  An IDA grant of £1.44 million was also approved towards the cost of the investment programme which was completed in 1979. The company strategy, in acceptance of the consultants' recommendations, had been aimed at diversification, with a 35 per cent reduction in shipbuilding activity to be compensated by increases in its other activities.</P>
    <P>Lack of success in this strategy led the Dutch parent RSV, to ask the Government either to underwrite the company's losses between 1979 and 1981, or that its shares in VCD be transferred to Fóir Teoranta or another Government agency at a price reflecting the balance sheet position of the company.  This prompted further analysis of Verolme by the Shipbuilding Advisory Team and a report on the matter was completed in December 1979.  This concluded that VCD would depend for survival in the period to end 1981 on sufficient orders being obtained from Irish State bodies and Government Departments and that, while such potential orders appeared to exist, the cost to the Exchequer in those three years of having the vessels built at Verolme would be in the region of £21 million, or roughly £6,000 per man per year.</P>
    <P>The report pointed out that the company's cash position was weak and even that was masked by prepayments on a B &amp; I vessel then under construction.  It pointed out that there would be further cash deficits by the end of 1980 which <Col N="462" /> would have to be funded by the Government. In view of the then existing outlook for shipbuilding, when it was generally accepted that conditions would not improve until the mid-1980's, and the prospective very substantial cost of continuing to place State orders at Verolme, the team recommended that the State should neither underwrite the company's losses nor take over the RSV shares, even if this meant closure of the yard.  The team recommended also that, should continued State assistance be provided to maintain employment in the yard, it should be conditional on VCD drawing up survival plans and taking the necessary steps to improve productivity of the work force and management of the shipyard and otherwise reduce running costs.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the then Government took a decision in July 1980 to place further State orders at the yard, namely, it was fully aware that Verolme would continue to depend on the State for its survival in shipbuilding at least until an upturn took place in the market and in the knowledge that, even if the Exchequer could afford the continuing prohibitively high cost of building ships at Verolme as opposed to elsewhere, the prospects for securing a sufficient number of domestic orders to keep VCD fully occupied until 1985 were most discouraging.  To date, orders for one patrol vessel and one bulk carrier have been placed and these are under construction at the yard.  It must be pointed out here again that the yard only survived through receiving substantial advance payments from the Exchequer in December 1980.  Furthermore, the expected cost of the bulk carrier is in excess of £29 million, in comparison to a commercial price of £14.2 million which could have been obtained elsewhere.  Thus a subsidy of £15 million has been necessary to build a vessel which provides approximately 750 man years of work or keeps 500 people occupied for an 18-month building schedule.  It can be seen that continuation of a policy of placing State orders to maintain employment at Verolme could cost £20,000 per man per year.  No indications of the subsidy level involved in building the £25 million patrol vessel <Col N="463" /> are available but it seems reasonable to infer that this also is very substantial in the light of the bulk carrier situation outlined and the fact that a fishery research vessel would cost approximately twice what it could be built for abroad.</P>
    <P>In approving the placing of the orders at the yard, the Government also asked the Shipbuilding Advisory Team to again examine the future of VCD.  Because of the specialist knowledge required of world shipbuilding trends and because of the prospective heavy additional cost to the Exchequer of having either domestic orders placed with VCD or of subsidising foreign orders to the extent of making VCD competitive in the international market, the team asked UK shipbuilding consultants, A &amp; P Appledore, in association with the Irish firm Reynolds Cooper McCarron, to advise it on the future of the yard.  The consultants' job was, in summary, to assess the technical and financial situation in the yard, prospective markets and VCD's ability to trade successfully in those markets both without continued State support for shipbuilding and with levels of support that would be acceptable to the European Commission.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the consultants found that Verolme was basically a medium technology shipyard of the 1960s type, whose cashflow position was only healthy because of the advance payments received from the Government in December 1980.  They pointed out that VCD was caught in the worldwide shipbuilding recession which has produced intense competition for the much-reduced number of orders available, and that VCD was unable to compete both in terms of productivity and costs.  In addition, the recession problems were exacerbated by the emergence as major shipbuilders of a number of Third World countries, notably South Korea and Brazil, who can rely on cheap labour and new facilities to produce very cheap vessels.</P>
    <P>The consultants indicated that current world shipbuilding capacity is well in excess of expected demand, even with the substantial capacity reductions and reorganisations which have taken place <Col N="464" /> throughout the world.  While it was thought at the beginning of 1982 that supply and demand might begin to reach equilibrium by 1986, developments during 1982 and since have made this too optimistic and equilibrium would not now be reached possibly until 1990.  The latter proposition, however, presupposes that capacity would remain at its present level.  In practice this is unlikely since, as demand increases, there will be a tendency for countries to reintroduce some of their mothballed facilities, implying some continued level of excess capacity in the market.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, there is a very considerable number of ships lying in dry dock at present.  If any improvement comes in the shipping market which might lead to a hardening in prices and an increased demand for ships, this very substantial amount of shipping capacity in dry dock could be brought back into production, thereby forcing prices down again.  The existence of this substantial amount of unused shipping capacity is a destabilising factor in what is already a very difficult shipping market situation. This instability directly affects the shipbuilding situation also.</P>
    <P>The consultants concluded that, in the context of a shipbuilding market worse than in living memory and with no prospect of substantial improvement before the end of the decade, it was highly unlikely that VCD, which last won an order on the open market in 1975, and then through its Dutch parent, could win suitable orders in the international market over the next five years, even with Exchequer funding of between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of the cost of each vessel.</P>
    <P>I might point out here that EEC acceptance of such subsidy levels, even if the very high sums involved on an ongoing basis could be afforded by the Irish taxpayer, would be most unlikely.  I should also point out that it would, in addition, be necessary to provide subsidised credit for any contracts won, which in view of the very high cost of vessels would add significantly to the burden on the Exchequer.  An indication of this is that for a £20 million bulk carrier, on <Col N="465" /> which subsidised credit for 80 per cent would be necessary, annual subsidy costs could easily be £500,000.  Since a continuity of such orders would be needed, the interest subsidy costs alone would cumulatively reach millions of pounds in a short time.  It tends to be ignored but these costs, apart altogether from production subsidies or uncommercial prices, have cost the Exchequer almost £8 million since 1970, and this cost will continue to rise even without further orders.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that a previous Shipbuilding Advisory Team report had recommended that continued State assistance be conditional on the yard drawing up a survival plan taking the necessary steps to improve productivity. In December 1981 the company submitted such a plan to my Department which described a range of investment proposals, to be funded by the Exchequer and costing between £3.4 million and £21.2 million, intended to modernise the facilities and improve productivity.  No action was taken on this pending completion of the consultants work, and in September 1982 a revised assessment was received from VCD which indicated that developments during 1982, and in particular the need to revise downwards existing long-term forecasts, made the earlier proposals unjustifiable.  In addition, the ship repair market in which the yard operated had deteriorated significantly, with turnover falling to half its planned levels, and there was no sign of improvement in productivity at the yard.</P>
    <P>The revised operating strategy recommended in this was to reduce the scale of operations significantly, both in terms of shipbuilding and ship repairing, involving substantial lay-offs.  Marketing efforts would be directed at general cargo vessels, supply vessels and others of a similar complexity.  Government support needed to implement this would be:</P>
    <P>a special grant-in-aid to cover the company's losses for the period 1979 to 1983 estimated at £5.6 million;</P>
    <P>a separate grant-in-aid to cover the cost of extra statutory redundancy payments, and <Col N="466" /> an interest-free loan of £4 million to cover capital expenditure and maintenance dredging.</P>
    <P>This would be additional to the substantial sums required to subsidise the cost of any orders VCD managed to win, both in terms of production and interest subsidies. Finally, my Department were advised by the company in November of last year that the international shipbuilding market was even worse than in September and that export orders, if they were available at all, would only be feasible with very large Exchequer assistance.</P>
    <P>In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the Shipbuilding Advisory Team advised me that it is clear that VCD is not commercially viable at present.  The extent of this non-viability has been largely concealed by the fact that the yard's customers have been State and semi-State organisations who have been paying substantially more than market prices in order to meet the Government's wishes regarding employment at the yard.</P>
    <P>This Government policy of maintaining employment at the yard at all costs has had two effects: first, because the Government and the State bodies were willing to pay whatever it cost VCD to build ships, VCD has had no need or incentive to take account of developments in the shipbuilding industry in recent years.  As a result, not alone has VCD maintained its work force at approximately the same level over the last decade but the productivity of its work force has fallen by about 25 per cent over this period.  Thus, VCD has become increasingly uncompetitive in an industry where firms have been forced to become more competitive because of world over-capacity.  VCD has been insulated from the commercial environment with the inevitable result that it no longer appears to have the capacity to operate in such an environment.</P>
    <P>The second effect was that State-bodies were allowed to buy ships which, in retrospect, they could not afford and which proved in some cases to be surplus to requirements.  The excessive costs of <Col N="467" /> these ships, and this is a point to which Deputy Fitzgerald did not advert, have contributed to the deteriorating finances of B &amp; I in particular.  As a result of both their financial position and the present and prospective difficult market conditions, the State shipping companies will not be placing any further orders for ships in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>These two developments have reinforced VCD's dependence on the State for its survival.  However, it has now become apparent that there is little immediate prospect of orders from this source because of the Government's own serious budgetary problems.  Thus there is no possibility of VCD being able to rely, as it has done in recent years, on a regular supply of domestic orders at inflated prices in comparison with world standards.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in order to survive, VCD must seek export orders at a time when, it must be admitted, it is extremely uncompetitive and when world shipbuilding is in an extremely severe slump which appears likely to last until 1990.  While the team recommend that the Government be prepared to offer the maximum &mdash; production subsidies &mdash; permissible by the EEC Commission &mdash; to VCD to enable it to secure such orders, it must be remembered that subsidies of this order have been available to VCD for the past few years and, despite better market conditions and a less uncompetitive position than at present, the yard has failed to secure a single export order.</P>
    <P>This, then, was the background against which the Government had to assess future policy relating to Verolme.  Past practice of placing State orders with the yard to maintain employment has become excessively costly, as witnessed by the £15 million subsidy needed to build the bulk carrier, and the financial position of both the Exchequer and the State shipping companies is not such as to facilitate the placing of further orders, even were they needed.  But there is in fact no need for the level of orders which would be necessary to sustain Verolme in its present form because there is not the <Col N="468" /> demand for shipping that there has been in the past.  In addition, it is clear that past practice has been self-defeating in insulating Verolme from the real commercial world and preventing it from having to face the need for the adjustments which could make it less uncompetitive.</P>
    <P>In the light of this the Government have decided that the appropriate course to follow is to encourage Verolme to concentrate on winning orders in the open market and to take the undoubtedly difficult steps that will be necessary to enable it to do so realistically.  To this end the Government are prepared to give such assistance to VCD as will be permitted by the European Commission. They do so in the knowledge that this will involve a heavy continuing drain on the Exchequer to support the jobs of people involved in the construction of vessels that might thus be won by the yard, but hope that the management and work force will together take measures which would themselves lead to a reduction in the need for such assistance.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government will encourage the yard to place more emphasis in the future on ship repairing and general engineering.  They acknowledge that present trading conditions are hardly ideal for such a move, but consider that shipbuilding prospects make it unavoidable. The Government believe that, while the ship repairing market is depressed at the moment, there is certainly scope for improvement on Verolme's performance in this regard, and would urge management and unions to act co-operatively to achieve a situation where State shipping companies will carry out repairs in Verolme not just because it is Irish and at financial disadvantage to themselves, but because they are satisfied they are getting value for money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech is, I am afraid, the answer that was expected but not hoped for and there will be much weeping and gnashing of teeth in the Cork area again to-night.  There is not one shred of hope for the continuance of VCD as a shipbuilding yard in the future.  That is there in black and white, <Col N="469" /> plain for everybody to see.  Verolme Cork Dockyard as a shipbuilding yard will be defunct in a very short period.  I was going to start by saying that time is running out for VCD, but time has run out.  It was the only shipyard in this country, and in the Cork area it was the biggest single employer.  Six months ago 1,100 people were employed in VCD but over that time this number has fallen and 96 temporary workers have been laid off.  Last Friday 94 permanent employees were laid off and 164 more got their notice. We do not know how many more but it is quite evident that another couple of hundred are on the list now that the Minister has made his statement.</P>
      <P>When the bulk carrier <i>Panamax</i> is completed in June and when the fishery protection vessel is completed it will be the end, as far as I can see, for shipbuilding in Cork, and not only in Cork but in Ireland.  This is a step backwards for this country.  It is a natural disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From April 1982 to April 1983 the percentage increase in unemployment in the Cobh region alone was up by 30 per cent. Add on the workers and those on notice in the Cobh region and the increase in the region will be up to 80 per cent unemployment in a year or so, with no prospects of jobs in the area.  No other region in the area or the country would have a comparable increase in unemployment. It is not only the Cobh region that is and will be affected by the decisions of this Government.  The effect will be felt far beyond the town of Cobh, because workers in VCD come from Cork city and the towns of Midleton, Carrigtuohill and Youghal and as far away as Tallow in County Waterford.  All these areas will be affected by the impending closure of the shipbuilding process in VCD.  Not only will the workers in the immediate area be affected, but many small service industries and small engineering firms in the surrounding area will also be very much affected and will go to the wall because they depended on VCD for their existence.  Taking into account the numbers of people in these industries and firms who will be laid off, we will have many more people joining the ever-increasing dole queues in the east Cork, <Col N="470" /> Cork city and Waterford regions.  We will also have the spin-off effect on the local shop-keepers, butchers, publicans etc. in the towns surrounding Cobh.  Less money will be in circulation and so the closure of the VDC shipbuilding section will have a vast spin-off effect which has not been taken into account in the figures produced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>As I said, the figure for increased employment in Cobh was 30 per cent. That will jump up to about 80 per cent in Midleton, where the increase in the year was over 40 per cent.  In Youghal it was also 40 or 50 per cent.  The Government should not continue running down the industries in the East Cork and Cork city regions, as is evident by the above figures and by the rumours concerning East Cork Foods, which will definitely close.  NET are always in doubt, Irish Steel are also gravely in doubt, Whitegate is another industry which is in trouble and so are Dunlop.  I cannot see any way in which the Government's public relations office will convince the people that there is not an anti-Cork policy.</P>
    <P>An important aspect which has not been mentioned by anyone in connection with the closure of Verolme Dockyard is the tremendous service rendered by them to the community since 1963 when the apprenticeship training scheme commenced. Approximately 450 apprentices were trained in the dockyard.  Their trades included painting, decorating, cabinet making, constructional steel work, turning, joinery, fitting, gas and electrical welding.  Of this number, 80 are still serving their time and over 200 have left the firm.  These have given tremendous service to the country due to the experience they gained in the dockyard. The loss to the economy by the closure of the dockyard is something that is incalculable, because you cannot measure the value of the training given to these people.  It is a service which will not be available again.  To remedy that, we will have to increase AnCO services and, good as they are, they cannot give the type of experience gained in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have always held that it is the duty of a Government to provide <Col N="471" /> employment, and this philosophy has not changed.  In the thirties Paddy McGilligan expressed the view of the Fine Gael Party that the Government have no function in providing for Seán Citizen.  That philosophy prevails to this day.  During the period of the Coalition Government from 1973 to 1977 no orders were forthcoming for Verolme Dockyard.  This contrasts with the decisions of the Fianna Fáil administration during 1977 to 1981 when they were responsible for placing five ships on the order books of the dockyard.</P>
    <P>In 1977 Deputy Justin Keating thought it fitting to have ships built in Japan rather than building them here.  This is what is happening again today and will be continued from now on.  I am surprised that the Labour Party think it proper that cheap labour should be used for the provision of goods for this country because I did not think it fitted in with their philosophy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry was left in no doubt as to the feelings of the workers of Verolme Dockyard whom he met during the opening of Ringaskiddy on Saturday last. These workers did not need a Fianna Fáil Deputy to lead them on their protests, as happened not too long ago when a wellknown Fine Gael Deputy led a mob from the Fine Gael rooms in Oliver Plunkett Street to attack Jack Lynch.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey entered into negotiations for the construction of a bulk coal carrier by the Belfast shipyard of Harland &amp; Wolff for the conveyance of coal to the ESB generating station at Moneypoint. This initiative was of major importance for North-South economic co-operation. It was not physically possible to build this carrier in Cobh as they had not the capacity; but if it had been built in Belfast it would have meant work to the value of about £5 million for Verolme Dockyard. However, the lack of social philosophy regarding job creation was evident in the decision by the Government to allow the ESB to palce the order for this bulk carrier with a Japanese shipping firm.  So much for the Taoiseach's constitutional crusade on a practical level.</P>
    <P>There was blue murder from Fine Gael <Col N="472" /> and the press when Fianna Fáil placed the order for the bulk carrier <i>Panamax</i> and also for their fishery protection vessel in Cobh.  The people of Cobh know that if we were in Government the workers there would have jobs secured for another year or so because we would have honoured our promise and placed an order for a fishery protection vessel and also a fishery research vessel which is essential for the future development of our marine culture.  It is a sad day when a vessel of this nature cannot be built here.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Collins, at Question Time last March informed us that the Government have no function with regard to the workings of the dockyard. However, I consider that any person who has a 48 per cent shareholding in a business would have great interest in the workings and future of that business. I was very surprised at the admission made by Deputy Collins.  It is a cause of great anxiety for the employees of any company under the control of the Government.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I were mentioned by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald.  Last March they sent one of their vessels to Liverpool to be overhauled.  The cost was not relevant but the time factor was.  The Government should have forced B &amp; I to place that repair work in Verolme Dockyard.  In the end the B &amp; I did not gain anything by sending their boat to Liverpool as they could have had it repaired just as quickly in Verolme.  It is regrettable that the Government will not come to the help and support of local businesses.</P>
    <P>The Government are now allowing 500 people to go on the dole at a cost of at least £3 million.  It would be more sensible to put this money back into the yard, thus ensuring employment, the psychological welfare of those who are to be laid off and of their dependants.  It would also mean that if these people were working they would be contributing through PRSI and PAYE to the Exchequer.  If they are receiving dole it is dead money.  No one, especially the unions and the workers, will hold that much of the equipment and the practices at present in operation in Verolme Dockyard are not obsolete. <Col N="473" /> They accept that they must be updated or replaced to compete successfully in the market of shipbuilding and repair.  They also accept that there have to be redundancies. If the yard is kept for repair work only, it will have a damaging effect on those who remain on there.  They have been offered half a week redundancy money per year of work.  Avoca mines have already been mentioned, in which case the Government stepped in and increased the redundancy offer to three and a-half weeks.  I ask the Minister to do likewise in Cobh.  It is important that those who remain in the dockyard will have the incentive to work and will not wonder if they also will get a raw deal when their time comes.  There is no use in having a labour force whose heart is not in it.  In the case of people who have been given notice of leaving in a month's time, their productivity will drop enormously. This is what has happened in the dockyard in the last couple of months.</P>
    <P>Not knowing if they would have a job next week, the week after or in six months' time has had a serious effect on those still in the yard and the worry is still there.  Many of these men will know after tonight that they will not have more than a month's employment before they will also be on the dole queue.  The work force must have the spirit to keep the dockyard going, for its economic survival. Judging by the Minister's speech, the Cabinet have discussed the Verolme Dockyard, a decision has been taken and it is not a favourable one.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not take note of our request regarding redundancy payments, further harsh decisions similar to what has been announced tonight will have to be made.  We had the Alpha years ago, we now have the Omega and the end is nigh.  This is a sorrowful day for East Cork, the entire Cork region and the country, on which we have to listen to the Minister's statement that Verolme Cork Dockyard as a shipbuilding firm is no more.  It is sad that those on the Government benches have to sit back and say nothing.  They know the effect which the pronouncement of the Minister will have in Cork tonight.  I again urge the Minister to reconsider his decision <Col N="474" /> not to give more shipping orders to the dockyard.  He must not understand the effect this will have on the Cork region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to reply to a reference made by Deputy Ahern to a reply given by me to a parliamentary question last March in regard to the Verolme Dockyard, in which I stated that the Government had no responsibility for the operation of the yard.  I obviously meant &mdash; and most people would understand me to mean &mdash; that I was speaking with regard to the day-to-day management of the company.  These are matters which are always left to State bodies, to the executives involved.  It is their responsibility to run the company on a day to day basis. I want to make that quite clear, in case any other implications might be taken from the Deputy's remarks here tonight.</P>
      <P>We should understand quite clearly that we are being asked to place further State orders with the yard, presumably in the belief that this will tide the company over until conditions on the open market recover.  That is what was done in the past on the assumption that recovery was only a few years away.  It was more than a few years away then, and it is considerably more than that now.  It would be helpful at this stage to read an extract from the Report to the Council of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development from its Working Party on Shipbuilding, as recently as 22 April 1983.  This is entitled &ldquo;Trends in the Industry&rdquo;, and it is significant enough for me to quote it:</P>
      <P>In the shipping sector, the deepening of the economic recession and the continuous slowdown in oil consumption at world level brought about a record decline in the maritime transport of dry cargo and oil for the major part of 1982.  There was a gross excess of tonnage in all shipping sectors, as a result of which many ships were laid up and freight rates were brought down steeply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dry bulk trades were particularly affected by the delivery of a large <Col N="475" /> number of ships ordered during the illusory &ldquo;boom&rdquo; of late 1979 and 1980. Capacity in this sector increased by 9 per cent during 1982.  On top of this, demand for iron ore, coal and wheat &mdash; the three main commodities from the standpoint of international maritime movements &mdash; was lower than in 1981 and aggregate demand for dry cargo capacity thus fell by more than 4 per cent.  By the end of the year some 15 million tonnes dead weight in this category were laid up and freight rates had fallen to their mid-seventies level.</P>
    <P>In the oil sector, the situation gives cause for even greater concern. Although the world fleet was substantially reduced during the year by scrapping, which reached record levels particularly in the case of the very large oil carriers, demand for shipping space fell even faster, down to the 1970 level when the oil fleet was only a half what it is today.  More efficient energy conservation measures, considerably reduced voyage length, the deepening of the Suez Canal and the new pipelines that have come on stream seem to have helped bring about permanent structural changes which will call for radical alterations to the world oil fleet.</P>
    <P>The general cargo market reflects the general economic stagnation, with loading schedules down and keener competition between the shipping lines, those in the OECD countries coming under increasing pressure from operators in the USSR and the developing countries.</P>
    <P>The general outlook for world maritime transport for the next three years at least is, therefore, extremely bleak with the very substantial over-capacity and the likelihood of insolvency in many shipping lines.  There are many reasons for assuming that this situation will be increasingly reflected in very much fewer orders for new ships.</P>
    <P>Already in 1982 the situation and prospects in the shipping area have been reflected in the shipbuilding sector, at least as far as new orders and orderbooks are concerned.  As the <Col N="476" /> building of a new ship takes about two to four years, the fall in new orders will only begin to be reflected in the figures of ships completed during the next year.  In 1982, new orders for the members of working party as a whole, calculated in compensated gross tonnage, have decreased by some 35 per cent compared with last year, which is one of the steepest decreases registered since the beginning of the crisis in this industry in 1975-1976.  The fall in new orders in 1982 has hit all main world shipbuilding countries, members and non-OECD members: in some non-OECD countries long term development plans for shipbuilding have been revised downwards.</P>
    <P>The severe deterioration in the new orders situation had an immediate repercussion on the level of the world orderbook.  At the end of 1982 it had already fallen by some 17 per cent gross registered tonnes compared with the same period of 1981, and had come down to about the 1979 level, i.e. the lowest level since the oil crisis.  European countries and Japan registered a fall in orderbook levels of some 16 and 24 per cent respectively during the period.  The share of non-Member countries of OECD in the world orderbook was some 34 per cent at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The figures for ships completed in 1982 do not yet reflect the fall in new orders.  The slowdown in production has affected Japan by almost 6 per cent, as well as some European countries. It seems that this trend reflects the increasing willingness on the part of shipbuilders, given their low levels of new orders, to spread deliveries over time in order to avoid excessive disruption in their planned world load in the short term.  The shares of world production in 1982 for Japan, European countries and non-OECD countries respectively were 38.9 per cent, 31.2 per cent and 28.0 per cent, against 41.8, 33.5 and 21.4 per cent in 1981.</P>
    <P>In 1982, the Sub-Group on Supply and Demand, whose mandate is also to keep the Working Party informed of <Col N="477" /> short and long-term trends in supply and demand, considered the long-term shipbuilding forecasts recently put forward by the Association of West European Shipbuilders (AWES) and the Shipbuilders' Association of Japan (SAJ).  These forecasts form a most important and essential aid to governments in the formation of their long-term policies.  Though these recent forecasts by the AWES and the SAJ are, generally speaking, more consistent with one another than those put out in 1980, neither, unfortunately, may be called optimistic.  Some of the positive trends in the 1980 forecasts are no longer there, at least for the short and medium term.  At the general level, the two studies agree in considering that there is no hope of a recovery in output before 1986-1987.  Between now and then production levels in terms of ships completed could probably roughly hold their 1982 levels or, in other words, average about 12-13 million tons a year.  This level should be compared with the 21-22 million tons in 1976-1977.  By 1990, according to the forecasts, output could be about 20 million tons.</P>
    <P>The Working Party derived certain lessons for policy from its study of these forecasts, the main one being that, for the medium term, an appreciable surplus of capacity will persist, in spite of the considerable, difficult and courageous efforts made in practically all Member countries since 1976-1977 in the framework of the OECD General Guidelines.  The necessary restructuring of the shipbuilding industry which must continue in both qualitative and quantitative terms in Member countries is becoming all the more difficult in that big sacrifices have already been made, particularly at the social level, and that no decisive signs of recovery can be read in the general economic situation or that of maritime transport.</P>
    <P>Whilst conclusions need to be drawn from these forecasts as regards the continued adjustment of the industry, others also need to be drawn with regard to the growing part played by <Col N="478" /> non-Member countries.  The Working Party thinks it would be useful for some of these big shipbuilding countries to take part in exchanges of views in one form or another on the short and longer term outlook for the world shipbuilding industry.  As the Council has been informed, representatives of the Working Party met delegates in the shipbuilding field from a non-Member country in September 1982.  These first contacts were judged to be useful and the Working Party hopes to pursue them.</P>
    <P>The continuing restructuring and adjustment in the shipbuilding industry calls for a strong sense of international responsibility on the part of all Member and non-Member countries if the measures taken to facilitate this adjustment are not to result in a compartmentation of markets, contrary to the nature and conditions of international maritime trade, which would be extremely difficult to break out of again.</P>
    <P>I felt it was necessary to quote that in the House because of its obvious quality as an independent source of review and also because of its expert opinion on the state of the industry and the likely developments in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>It is brutally clear from this extract that a policy of providing State orders to preserve jobs at Verolme until the upturn occurred in the market could in no way be described as an interim measure.  It would in reality be not just a short-term expedient but a medium and even long-term necessity.  The Minister has already described the impracticality and unrealism of such a proposition, both in terms of the financial conditions of the Exchequer and the State shipping companies, and in terms of the absence of any demonstrable need for further vessels.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised the financial burden which has been borne by the B &amp; I because of their policy in regard to placing of orders.  There are other complex matters to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Thus the placing of orders for another patrol vessel and for a research vessel would have no justification as being a <Col N="479" /> way to secure the future of the yard.  Its only justification would be that it would keep the remaining 700 people, after the current layoffs have been completed, in employment until the end of 1984.  And let us be sure there is no confusion on this point.  It would not reduce in any significant way the number of people currently being laid off.  Both management and unions at Verolme accept that these layoffs are justified and would go ahead in any case.  I think it useful at this point also to clear up any confusion there may be as to the need for the patrol vessel &mdash; most people would accept that the placing of the order for the research vessel on its own, because of its small size, would not affect the situation at Verolme in a significant way.  In the course of 1982 the Department of Defence indicated to the European Commission that in the light of protection measures initiated since 1978, namely increased frequency of aerial surveillance missions, increased penalties and the simplification and stabilisation of Community regulations, the present mix of aircraft and ships, including the one ship on order, would provide adequate fishery protection in the medium term.  The Commission accepted this and agreed to the same level of EEC assistance being provided in respect of it. Thus, not only is there no need for the vessel, but there would be no Community assistance towards its financing, nor indeed to its substantial ongoing costs to the Navy.  We are, therefore, being asked to spend £25 million &mdash; that figure should be underlined &mdash; to provide employment to the tune of 500 man-years, that is, the estimated work content of the vessel being equivalent to keeping 500 people employed for one year.  This is more graphically illustrated if we consider that this would cost the already hard-pressed taxpayer £50,000 for each of these jobs for that year.</P>
    <P>This really is the kernel of the problem. The figure would be very high in the context of any estimate that the IDA could give in respect of creating jobs.  As I have said, to this astronomical figure would have to be added the substantial <Col N="480" /> operating costs to the Navy, since the order cannot be justified in terms of the Navy's needs nor within the context of the EEC commitment to Ireland in regard to fisheries jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Deputies who wish the Government to place this order to consider the foregoing very seriously.  It would appear to me that, unless their proposal is mere political opportunism, they would wish to withdraw it.  But should they not so wish, I would hope that they would have the political courage and honesty to explain to the nation just how they would finance the cost of these 500 jobs for one year.  It would not of course be by additional foreign borrowing, since <i>The Way Forward</i> commits them to a lower figure than that already set for this year's budget.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to enter into an argy-bargy with Deputy Reynolds.  The budget figures recommended in <i>The Way Forward</i> would have resulted in substantially more chaos economically than is the case with the Government's budgetary policies.  They would be faced then with the choice of raising taxes or cutting expenditure.  Again, I must assume from the Fianna Fáil stance on the recent debate on the Finance Bill that they would not do this by way of raising taxes.  Therefore we may deduce that the Deputies opposite would finance these expensive short-term jobs by way of expenditure cuts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There have not been interruptions from this side of the House. This whole argument must be looked at in the perspective I have outlined.  To consider it in any other context would be somewhat remote from reality, but then the Opposition have been remote from reality since they left office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a reference in that OECD report from which I quoted to the need for continuing restructuring of the shipbuilding industry in both qualitative and quantitative terms.  Two things must be said here.  First, the word &ldquo;continuing&rdquo; in that context does not apply to Ireland. Ireland is one of the few countries who, through the practice of placing State orders whenever needed, has not restructured. The layoffs currently taking place are the first signs of an acceptance of the inevitability of restructuring but only in the quantitative sense.  Management and unions at Verolme must now realise that there must be qualitative restructuring if Verolme is to have a future.  This view is shared by the European Commission in its recent report to the Council of the <Col N="483" /> European Communities where it says that future capacity adjustment in the Community should, taking into account previous reductions in capacity, be qualitative adjustment designed above all to improve competitiveness and profitability. The report goes on to say that in the present depressed state of demand better productivity will come not so much from increased production by the remaining shipyards as from cost savings and higher quality production, which are the prime conditions for renewed viability.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to another area where better productivity is vital, namely ship repair.  In the past 20 years, VCD's ship repair activity has varied between 200,000 and 350,000 manhours per year. It has been consistently profitable until 1979 and 1980 when it returned losses of £52,000 and £338,000 respectively. Developments generally in ship repair over the last five years have been very disappointing.  Manhours worked and turnover have both plummeted, while losses have continued.  I understand that the company have identified the following as causative factors for this development:</P>
    <P>the ship repair market, in parallel with the dry cargo freight market, has been very depressed since the second half of 1981;</P>
    <P>VCD's large domestic customers, B &amp; I and ICL have carried out annual overhauls of their ships abroad.  This they did because of high prices in VCD and keen competition elsewhere, but also because both companies have been frightened by labour problems in VCD which, in one or two instances, held up redelivery of a vessel;</P>
    <P>to the extent that Irish wages increased at a higher rate than those in the UK and on the Continent VCD have lost competitivity;</P>
    <P>the additional cost that overtime and shiftwork arrangements place on the cost of repairs in VCD is very high.  It was found in a recent comparison that such additional costs in VCD were three to four times higher than in Rotterdam. <Col N="484" /> On the other hand, if VCD try to avoid these high costs by not working in shifts then they are, on most contracts, no longer competitive on time.</P>
    <P>Ship repair has over the last decade or so typically accounted for 10 per cent to 15 per cent of activity in VCD, although their three repair docks have never been used to full capacity.  Historically, the yard has relied heavily on the local market, and seem not to have made serious attempts to enter the international arena in anything other than a marginal way. Over the last year or two changing trading patterns, plus diminished enthusiasm for VCD among Irish owners, has meant that even the rather moderate turnover levels achieved in the past have been difficult if not impossible to sustain.</P>
    <P>Some relief may be in sight, however, with the coming on stream of the alumina plant and the coal-fired power station in the Shannon estuary.  These projects should generate some voyage repair demand and possibly lead to an increased number of dockings.  Thus, if VCD were sufficiently competitive, they could look for 36-38 drydockings per year from the local market by 1985, when these developments are on stream.  However, at present levels of productivity it seems quite possible that even historical levels of throughput will not be sustained.</P>
    <P>In addition, we must remember that if VCD are to maintain substantial employment in ship repair, they will have to expand into the international market. VCD's catchment area for the international market could be described as all ports in Ireland, ports on the west coast of England and Wales, plus vessels traversing the English Channel en route to and from the Atlantic and Bay of Biscay. The traffic in this catchment area is very substantial, and VCD's success in capturing a share of that market depends principally on three factors &mdash; deviation, the competition and VCD's own competitiveness. With regard to deviation to VCD it is not as great as might be supposed. A vessel on a trans-atlantic route from the English Channel for instance will only have a marginal deviation, <Col N="485" /> whilst a vessel en route through the Channel to the Bay of Biscay would require a 20-hour deviation to call at Cork.  The competition which VCD face is great in terms of the large number of repair yards in the UK and on the Continent, but it is not so great in terms of efficiency.  Given the foregoing, VCD's ability to penetrate the international repair market depends very heavily on their own competitiveness. At the moment, this is poor and their market share as a result is minuscule, If, however, there was a real increase in productivity and a more competitive approach adopted by the yard, it could leapfrog the competition and gain a better market share.</P>
    <P>I do not share the long-term gloom and doom emanating from the far side of the House in this regard.  Perhaps it is a matter of self help, better management, a bit more outgoing and strong marketing rather than the handout attitude so prevalent in Fianna Fáil.  The thrust of all I have been saying is that the solution of the yard's problems does not lie in the hands of the Government, nor indeed should it.  The Government cannot guarantee employment regardless of cost; they can merely try to provide assistance which will enable a company to get through difficult periods.  In this case that assistance is a willingness to provide such production subsidies as would be permitted by the European Commission, despite the knowledge that the cost of this could be heavy to the Exchequer, the Government and the taxpayers.  But we are committed to giving that subvention.</P>
    <P>The solution to the company's problems can only be with the company itself. The management and unions in Verolme must create their own salvation by devising methods of substantially improving productivity and value in both shipbuilding and shiprepair, by sustaining their reputation for reliability, and quality and by getting out and selling that package aggressively.  I hope that this challenge will be met head-on by management and by workers in Verolme Cork Dockyard. If it is met head-on and if the challenges are grasped I have every confidence that Verolme Cork Dockyard in the immediate <Col N="486" /> and long-term will be a successful shipbuilding and shiprepair yard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, first of all, to say how disappointed I am with the contribution of the Minister of State when he tried to accuse Deputies on this side of the House of making a political argument regarding Verolme Cork Dockyard.  If that kind of attitude continues in the House, there is very little respect for those of us who stand up fighting for something we think is right on behalf of our constituents.  If the Minister of State was sitting on this side of the House I expect he would be in here battling for something which we consider is a very viable industry.  I will refrain from becoming political on this because we could very easily use whatever ammunition we have now to embarrass the Government on this issue.  This matter is too important.  Workers and their families depend on what we have to say here tonight and later depend on the action the Government are prepared to take to save 500 jobs in the Cork area.</P>
      <P>We are trying to get the Government to make some move to ensure continuity of employment in Verolme Cork Dockyard.  This can be done by investing the necessary moneys for the construction of the two vessels, the fishery patrol and the fishery research vessels.  Are the Minister and the Minister of State aware that a letter of intent and a down payment of £700,000 was made to the yard in December 1982 for the construction of the fishery research vessel?  I have not heard the Minister or the Minister of State mention this tonight.  This showed confidence in the viability of Verolme Cork Dockyard. Surely this constitutes an investment in a worthwhile activity, giving employment, protecting our fishing waters and advancing our fishing industry?  I note that the Minister is asking his officials am I correct in this?  The Minister should be fully briefed coming into the House on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it being denied?  The Minister <Col N="487" /> is aware of the mass unemployment in the Cork area at present because of lack of initiative by the Government to invest moneys in the areas which give employment.  Here is one area that gives employment.  I gather from reading both Ministers' briefs here this evening they are now going to add unnecessarily a further 500 people to the already long queues at our labour exchanges in Cork. Surely the Government must realise that many of our industries in the Cork area are vulnerable at present because of the recession.  Equally, surely it is the Government's duty to come to their rescue, to carry them over that lean period? We have viable industries there.  Not so very long ago we were here in this House, in practically an all-party effort, with Members of the opposite side of the House pleading on behalf of the development of Cork harbour.</P>
      <P>This is another blow to Cork harbour. I want to take the Minister of State up on something he said here this evening.  He said:</P>
      <P>The thrust of all I have been saying is that the solution of the yard's problems does not lie in the hands of the Government, nor indeed should it.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Government and the Minister himself: is not a fisheries protection vessel an investment?  Does it not protect our valuable fishing waters? Would the Government, or the Minister, say that we are not responsible for protecting our fishing waters?  Would the Minister say that the Government are not responsible for research in so far as our fishing industry is concerned?  Surely to heavens what we are talking about here is an investment?  We are not asking for money for the sake of money, or for the sake of two ships.  We are talking about something that is an investment with a return to the Government.  I was amazed to hear the Minister of State say it is not their responsibility.  The Minister can lecture on management procedures and things of that kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are talking about is the livelihood of 500 families in the Cork area.  That is our concern, not a lecture on procedures on management and efficiency.  That is not for us, and not for the Government to a certain extent; that is for management themselves.  We are concerned with workers, with families, with trying to ease the anxiety now existing throughout the length and breadth of the Cork area.</P>
      <P>I ask the Government, I ask my fellow Cork Deputies on the Government side &mdash; and I know they will &mdash; to co-operate fully in encouraging the Government in investing moneys in the worthwhile projects about which we are now talking. Indeed, I should like to have the views of those people employed in the fishing industry here this evening.  I should like to hear them tell us that the construction of a protection vessel is not worth a flick of one's fingers or to hear from those involved in the science of fisheries and things of that kind that a research ship is not worth that either.  I am endeavouring to avoid being political, but I say: let us not run away from investment, from something that yields money, and the two ships about which we are talking constitute an investment in the future of our fishing industry.  At the same time this will provide necessary employment over a period.  We had the Taoiseach saying only recently that we should see some signs of the end of the recession next year.  Surely, then, it is not wrong to ask in that period that some investment be made in Verolme Cork Dockyard to tide it over.</P>
      <P>Let us all co-operate.  We are listening to doom and gloom every day of the week.  It is about time somebody talked about injecting confidence into our people.  Our people always have been able to face recessions and crises.  There is now a total lack of confidence felt by our people &mdash; workers, industrialists and the farming community.  If the Government are not seen to be investing in something worthwhile why then should anybody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Government tonight to make that investment.  If they do so they <Col N="489" /> will not be investing in something that will have gone by the board tomorrow. They will be investing in a viable project in the future.  It must be remembered that we are talking about people, about the Government showing that confidence in an industry for many years.</P>
    <P>Both Ministers who spoke here this evening forgot one important thing in so far as Verolme Cork Dockyard is concerned: what about the hundreds of young people trained in their skills &mdash; cabinet-making, engineering, painting &mdash; boys who later went away and found secure jobs because they had been trained by an efficient industry.  Is that not an asset to any country?  What are we talking about?</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the two briefs of the Government Ministers here this evening. I wish there was a little more common sense, a little more understanding of the needs of our people and of those of the workers of Verolme Cork Dockyard.  I ask the Minister and his Minister of State to give this matter very serious consideration and, for God's sake, not to add another 500 people to the long queues of unemployed in the Cork region.  We demand that &mdash; we are not begging &mdash; but we have a right to demand something worthwhile for the Cork region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion we have before the House this evening is definite and explicit.  In case anybody has not heard it, I shall go to the trouble of reading it:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government as a matter of urgency to draw up proposals for the development of ship building and repair at Verolme Cork Dockyard, and as an interim measure in the interest of preserving the jobs of the workforce to place immediate orders for the building of a fishery protection vessel and a fishery research vessel.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the House that that is a clear and concise motion.  In reply to it, for the most part we have had 24 pages of absolute waffle &mdash; 12 pages from the Minister and 12 pages from the Minister of State and the one message in all that volume of waffle is that the workers of Verolme <Col N="490" /> are not good enough, not competitive enough, not well trained enough and &ldquo;We leave you to your own resources. You are not the responsibility of the Government and if you close the dockyard, that is your own business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Over the years Fianna Fáil's commitment to the dockyard was always thoroughly understood by the people of Cork and that commitment was expressed by successive Fianna Fáil Governments and maintained by its public representatives in Cork over a long number of years.  In 1965 a Member of this House &mdash; his constituency was a bit removed from the Cork scene &mdash; indicated in his election address that the dockyard should be closed, that it was a liability on the State. We in the mid-Cork constituency at the time took the initiative in reproducing that man's comments and at the bridge that the late Sean Lemass got constructed to the island we delivered them to the workers as they came off the boat in 1965. In 1975 what was the commitment again of this Coalition Government to this Cork dockyard?  The contract to be placed out in Japan or somewhere else. Now, maintaining the ten-year cycle, they have been two years too soon because this is only 1983.  Giving them the ten-year cycle, in 1985, in two years' time, they will close the bloody place altogether.  That is their commitment. That is their intention.  When we were discussing Whitegate in the summer of 1982 Deputy Barry Desmond had this to say about Cork Harbour, and I am talking about Cork Harbour including Verolme:</P>
    <P>The harbour of my native county is developing an enormous propensity to rearing white elephants.  Perhaps this elephant will be about the same size and length and in cost to the Exchequer as NET and the Irish Steel.  The three of them rank in that order.</P>
    <P>He gave figures but I have not enough time at my disposal to quote them all. The reference is column 2273 of the Official Report of 8 July 1982.</P>
    <P>This is why I used the term white elephant.  I propose to examine the <Col N="491" /> white elephant tomorrow night from the tail to the tusks and I think that I will find in it a particularly lumbering giant, admittedly by virtue of a decision of the previous Government, but concurred in by the present one, which is going to be a burden around the Exchequer's neck.</P>
    <P>I referred to that for a particular reason. The following night I was coming in after Deputy Desmond.</P>

    <P>The attitude of this Government is so obvious.  It is an attitude of kill off anything that is going in Cork.  They put their <Col N="492" /> finger in the pie and their only ambition is to downgrade the Cork area, the harbour and all that goes with it.  We had tonight 24 pages of waffle and no hope for the dockyard.  The attitude is not surprising in the light of their past history and their comments and their lack of commitment.  Both Ministers blame the dockyard workers for the closing of the B &amp; I; when that was being stated by the Minister I did not hear the Chair telling the Minister it was not relevant to the motion.  Perhaps you were not here.  My apologies.  It was apparently all right for the Government to mention the B &amp; I but I am not supposed to mention anything about Cork Harbour.  It is obvious this Government, like previous Coalition Governments want to ensure that the plans and the progress designed for the Cork area are stifled.  In the case of the dockyard they are telling them in no uncertain manner they can close it if they wish.  They blame the workers for the B &amp; I losses.  They say the solution here does not lie with the Government.  In the statement the Minister said the solution is not the responsibility of the Government. I contend the responsibility rests squarely on the shoulders of the Government. It also rests on the support to be given for or against their attitude to the dockyard by the elected members from the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  They should show their attitude by the way they turn at the top of the division steps. We have brought in a number of motions here about this Government's attitude to the Cork area.  Now I do not mind sticking to an idea and I will take the consequences. I want to be very critical of this Government's attitude to the Cork area. This Coalition Government like previous Coalition Governments have a happy knack of blaming everyone bar themselves. Was it not extraordinary that we went back to ex-Deputy Richie Ryan's Suez Canal?  Tell the workers in the dockyard tomorrow that something happening out in the Suez Canal means they are going to lose their jobs.  The Government blame everyone for their own lack of initiative and uselessness.  There is no need for me to go over again the documentation we received from the workers.</P>

      <P>Liam O'Leary.  When this matter was raised here recently we were aware of the giggling that went on on the Government benches and that giggling was repeated by a Deputy on that side when he entered the House this evening. These matters are too serious for sniggering and giggling, particularly on the Government side, whose responsibility it is.  Cork Deputies should not be giggling. They should get in there and support our motion and get this Government to do something for the Cork area.  It is about time that Deputies from the Cork area fell into line with our efforts to shock the Government into taking some action that would save jobs in the many areas in which they are threatened.  The Minister stated that the solution of the yard's problems does not lie in the hands of the Government, nor should it.  That is a very defeatist attitude to adopt.</P>
      <P>This Government must rank as the worst of all the Coalition Governments. As in previous cases, they blame everyone but themselves for what is happening. They have no leadership or commitment. They are not giving the dockyard any encouragement and certainly they are not giving it any money.  The Government took £220 million out of our capital programme that was put before the electorate. If some of that money had been left in the programme people would have remained at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opening of the car ferry should have been a joyful occasion.  What happened was that we were presented with a document from Liam O'Leary on behalf of the work force in Verolme dockyard.  This document has been referred to by my colleague already.  It is quite frightening.  However, it has not stirred the Government into taking positive action.  Instead the Minister's speech has consisted of pages of negative comments. The Government are telling the workers who have lost their jobs and those who are about to lose their jobs that they are not worth supporting and that the quality of their work does not <Col N="494" /> warrant support.  The attitude of the Government is uncaring so far as those people are concerned.  Reading between the lines of the Minister's speech one senses the hopelessness of the Government's attitude towards saving jobs in Verolme dockyard.  It is another saga in the story, showing their lack of commitment to the Cork area.</P>

      <P>I wish to give portion of my time to my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan.  I wish to compliment Deputy Fitzgerald on bringing this matter before the House this evening.  It is what any of us would do if we were in Opposition. However, having said that I am disappointed at the way the Opposition party have dealt with this subject, particularly the last speaker.  During my public life in the Cork area there has always been talk about who would keep open the Verolme dockyard.  Particularly in the past ten years the dockyard has depended almost exclusively on State orders and there always has been concern on the completion of an order.  The Opposition party have tried to create the impression that they were the only party who would keep the dockyard open.  I do not accept that. It is not fair to play politics with the livelihood of those who depend on the dockyard for their jobs.  It is lamentable that the debate has degenerated as it has done.</P>
      <P>In the past few months there has been considerable co-operation among Cork Deputies on all sides of the House with regard not only to the Verolme dockyard but also with regard to other industries that are in trouble in the Cork area. These industries would be in trouble irrespective of the party in power.  On many occasions we were led by the Lord Mayor of Cork and Deputies on all sides saw the various Ministers concerned.  Despite what Deputies opposite have said, I know there is sincere concern on the part of the Government for those whose livelihood depends on this venture continuing in the harbour area.  The Labour Party resent anyone suggesting that their interest is not at least equal, if not as great, as that of any other party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lyons suggested that the Minister <Col N="495" /> and the Minister of State in some way were casting a reflection on the workers.  He said this Government had no confidence in the work force.  That is rubbish.  Everything the Ministers have said has indicated they have faith in the workers and in the dockyard.  My experience of the workers is that they are a highly motivated and a most responsible workforce.  They have shown themselves keenly interested in the enterprise in which they work and concerned to play their role.  They have been responsible about the redundancies and the rationalisation that has taken place.  They have made it clear to us that they accept that some rationalisation must take place.</P>
    <P>With regard to the protest at the opening of the car ferry last Friday about which we read so much, I wish to say I was present and it is my belief that the reports were much exaggerated.  One got the impression that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was in danger of bodily harm but that was not so.  A large number of workers were present, many of them carrying placards.  Some of the placards could have been kinder but in the main the protest was understandable.  It was made by people under considerable pressure and frustration whose livelihood was, in their estimation, under threat. The opening of the car ferry was regarded by them as an opportunity to voice their concern and their grievance.  However, the reports one read in the press subsequently bore little relation to what happened. I want to make it clear that no one here is casting aspersions on the work force of the dockyard.</P>
    <P>So far as the rationalisation programme is concerned, there will be some redundancies.  I hope they will be the only redundancies in the harbour area.  I am very concerned to ensure that extrastatutory redundancy payments are made.  In other industries in the harbour where there were redundancies such provision was made.  For the sake of harmoney and for the continuation of work in the yard, any redundancies that have to take place should be carried out as harmoniously as possible.  Those who have been unfortunate enough to be covered <Col N="496" /> at least feel their efforts in the past have been rewarded adequately.  Extrastatutory redundancy moneys should be provided for if at all possible for these workers.  There is general agreement among the workers themselves and among Deputies of all parties, from the Cork area at least, that this would be a desirable development.  That is the first thing that I appeal for tonight.</P>
    <P>In my memory of the life of that yard, particularly over the last ten years, it has depended to a large extent on State orders.  Of course, State orders would be very welcome now.  I listened to the case made by the Minister, the Minister of State and the Opposition Deputies tonight and I see a problem.  I got the impression, listening to Opposition Deputies, that they were not in power in 1982 because in that year the Department of Defence made a submission to the European Commission that they were satisfied that the existing fleet of four control vessels and the new design vessel now being built was adequate to patrol our coasts.  Because of that submission made in 1982 &mdash; I do not know who was in power and it does not matter &mdash; one would get the impression that it was something the Coalition Government had done once again.  That decision was taken by our Department of Defence.  As a result of that the Commission accepted their report and there will be no EEC reimbursement of the £25 million needed.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an order for whatever millions are necessary going into VCD tomorrow.  I would like to hear an announcement that an order is available tonight.  I know the workers there.  Some of them are in my constituency; some are personal friends of mine and I am concerned about their jobs.  I know the effect that unemployment would have on them and their families.  I know their hopes for the future and their fears of all their skills becoming redundant, the years of builtup skills going for nought.  That for me is the most important thing and I would be very happy to hear an announcement that an order could be placed.</P>
    <P>However, I realise our limitations in Leinster House.  I realise that for an order <Col N="497" /> to be placed the Minister would have to get £25 million from the Irish taxpayer. Somebody has to pay for it.  Above all else I realise that, whoever were in Government &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Coalition or the Labour Party &mdash; we are going through a difficult time.  Money is in scarce supply and any money we provide for any project, however worthy, must be got at very great cost to the rest of the community.  That is the problem. On the admission of everybody on all sides of the House there is a lean period ahead of us in so far as shipbuilding is concerned.  There is a slump at the moment.  There is economic depression. There is no production in that area. While doing the restructuring it behoves management and the work force to try to make the rest of the yard viable and competitive.  Efforts should be made to ensure that this lean period will not put it out of business.  In supporting the Minister tonight my hope is that he does not look on this as the last word and that he will look to where help might be needed to tide them over that lean period.</P>
    <P>I was encouraged that the Minister mentioned the Appledore Report tonight because the workers, concerned with their interest in playing their part, were very anxious to know what is in that report for them and what is in it about management.  They were concerned that no message back to them or to the public generally was coming from that report. The Minister tonight has told us some not very hopeful news about what the report contained.  I would like an assurance from somebody &mdash; although I do not know if anybody can give it to me because the Opposition will be replying &mdash; that the contents of that report might be made public.  That could be a useful exercise because people would know where the faults were and I am quite sure the goodwill would be there in the yard to put those faults right.</P>
    <P>I will be supporting the Minister in this because I know that he has listened carefully and sincerely to us and has done his best, and given the impression that he was doing his best, in so far as the whole Cork harbour area is concerned.  I know the problems there; and, as we are talking <Col N="498" /> about one industry in the harbour, I can say that it is a very depressed area at the moment.  Any support that can be given short term or long term &mdash; and I appreciate the Minister's concern for the long term because ultimately that is what matters &mdash; should be given to the Cork area because depression, unemployment and hardship exist there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of the other speakers for the future of VCD. It is important not alone for the Cork area but for the nation as a whole.  I grew up when people were recruited to go abroad to learn the skills necessary to revitalise Cork Dockyard as it then was. They went to Holland, came back, worked and achieved a very high degree of efficiency.  Various speakers have mentioned this here tonight.  The skills are second to none and they are absolutely vital to this nation should we ever get out of the recession.  In VCD we have the country's only heavy engineering works. Despite all the &mdash; I say with reluctance &mdash; doom and gloom that have been preached, there is a future for the dockyard. I do not feel at all as pessimistic as people on the opposite side of the House. The work force in the dockyard realise that there is a future for the dockyard if the proper steps are taken and if there is a proper division of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Desmond said, we have the Appledore Report.  This came into the possession of the Government in September or October of 1982 and I am a little surprised that none of the speakers from the Fianna Fáil benches has alluded to this report.  Nobody mentioned it.  Blame has been hinted at and people on this side were suggesting that the workers were at fault.  There are some businessmen on the other side of the House and I would say they are a little more familiar with business practice than I am &mdash; I have had very little business experience &mdash; yet here we have an organisation which has not received an order since 1975.  I ask Deputy Reynolds, who I believe is a very successful businessman, if he would suffer this type of management.  I do not stand up to attack any individual, but we have here a rather unique situation in <Col N="499" /> that the Government have a 48 per cent stake in this company and 52 per cent is in the hands of a company which has now gone into liquidation, or at least receivership. I refer to RSV, the parent company. Now the Government are in a position that we cannot win due to the way the company is structured and we can do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Desmond, I feel that the trade unions in VCD should have the report made available to them because I think it would be rather revealing.  They are entitled to this because the jobs of the workers there are on the line.  They will acknowledge that there is a need to reduce the numbers of the staff.  They are being most responsible.  Each and every man there would say, &ldquo;OK, if the company is to remain viable it is necessary to reduce the numbers&rdquo;.  I want to ensure that they will not go down to the point where we will lose forever these very valuable skills and will not be able to put together a team that would be able to compete in the open market.  We have these skills.</P>
    <P>We will not achieve anything if we indulge in the type of activity that is being indulged in here tonight.  It seems that there is little concern.  Nobody has suggested that the management of this organisation were an irresponsible body or inactive down through the years.  I do not derive any pleasure from attacking any individual or group of individuals, but we must face facts.  There was a lack of aggression in their type of salesmanship. They did not go out to win the orders that were absolutely necessary if they were to compete in the field.  I will read a statement from Verolme Cork Dockyard, dated 10 December 1982, which is rather revealing:</P>
    <P>1983 will be an extremely difficult year for VCD.  The future of VCD depends on a large number of external and internal factors.  The most important of these are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;The International Market;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Inflation in Ireland;</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Productivity of V.C.D.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> Union members have indicated from time to time that they are prepared to discuss productivity.  They realise that if they are to enter into the ship repair business in a big way, it will be necessary for the present structures to be abolished. There is a need for co-operation and this was illustrated in recent times when a Russian vessel came into the dockyard. The workers in Verolme worked hand in hand with the crew of that ship.  In the past the practice was that when a ship came into dry dock the crew went on shore leave and were put up in private accommodation.  Shipping companies can no longer afford to keep the crew away from home in private accommodation. What now happens is that the crew on board the ship work hand in hand with the dockyard workers.  The precedent has been set, but there is room for development. The company realise they are going through a difficult period.  I quote again from the statement of Verolme Cork Dockyard of 10 December 1982:</P>
    <P>The international shipbuilding market is the worst in living memory.  Few if any shipowners are ordering ships, not even in Japan.</P>
    <P>The Third World countries Brazil and South Korea have now entered the market, which makes it even more difficult. The points of view expressed by Members of the Opposition indicated that the Government have not shown concern with regard to this matter.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We have, as Fianna Fáil did when they were in office, lobbied the Minister week after week in an effort to come up with some satisfactory solution.  The figures before us are stark and disturbing, but nonetheless there is still a willingness and a determination from people on this side of the House to ensure that this yard remains viable.  However, the leadership will have to come from within the management in that yard.  Some of the clerical workers in the yard have agreed a system of work sharing where one-third of the staff will go out for a four-month period.  This is the type of thing we are likely to see, not alone in Verolme Dockyard but right across the whole industrial area.  The <Col N="501" /> workers in Verolme have proved they are responsible, capable and willing to ensure that this industry will remain viable, but they will have to be shown leadership at local level.  The management will have to be aggressive and, if that is done, we will have nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would do what is possible under EEC regulations and I sincerely hope that that will be sufficient. We share the concern of our colleagues in Fianna Fáil, but our approach is somewhat different.  We do not share their gloom and we still feel that, even at this late hour, it is possible for Verolme Cork Dockyard to become viable.  That will have our full support.  I hate to end on a note of rancour but the motion tonight is nothing more than a political gimmick and I will not be a party to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take up the note on which Deputy O'Sullivan finished, that he will not be a party to a political gimmick.  It is a good while ago since I first met Deputy O'Sullivan when I was in Cork on my first official ministerial visit in 1981 and I was very well treated. The first request I got from Deputy O'Sullivan, who was then Lord Mayor of Cork, was to do something about Verolme Cork Dockyard.  He was very concerned about the matter as were all the other Cork Deputies and the work force. I was a new Minister with a new portfolio and I assured Deputy O'Sullivan that, within my confines as a Minister, I would look after Verolme Cork Dockyard and I am sure he is honest enough to admit that.  Subsequently, I was taken on a trip down the river and shown the problems. I will not condone bad management or restrictive practices because that day is gone, but the Deputies opposite should not point the finger at us about downgrading the work force in Verolme Dockyard. They should take away the two speeches, study them closely and they will see who downgraded the work force in Verolme Dockyard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go into it any further as I am not here to fight with anyone.  It is a very serious matter and I can see the shock on the faces of the Deputies opposite.  I know they genuinely feel for the whole <Col N="502" /> Cork region and the economic withdrawal that is taking place by the Government in the Cork region.  Not a single hope has been expressed.  Deputy Collins finished on an optimistic note by saying he did not believe in the pessimism expressed in this House tonight.  Neither do I, and I would share the optimism of Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Collins if they could show the way forward for Verolme Cork Dockyard.  All they have said is that they will provide the subsidies up to the EEC limit which, in effect, is 30 per cent if you get orders on the international market.</P>
    <P>In our motion we have only asked what any good chief executive would ask for in running any business.  We have asked the Government to draw up a five-year plan for the development of Cork Dockyard if they believe it is going to continue.  It is obvious that the Government do not believe it is going to continue.  I think this matter merits a two-hour debate in this House to go into the detail of what is being fobbed off on the people of Cork, but it will not be fobbed off by this side of the House.  I deplore the Deputies over there pretending they are the custodians of honesty, integrity and expert financial management.  They have accused us of being a party of spendthrifts.  If they check the records they will see that last year was the first time the expenditure as projected in the 1982 budget was brought and kept in line, and nobody can deny that.  In July 1982 we took many hard decisions which had to be taken and we stood over them.  The party opposite should not be trying to get cheap publicity by attempting to convince the people that they are the custodians of integrity, honesty and courage.  Those are qualities which the Government needs today.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at Deputy Bruton trying to make a very cheap political point.  As a former Minister for Finance, he should not be trying to convince the House and the public that there was no specific allocation for Verolme Cork Dockyard in the Estimates for 1982.  He talked loudly and clearly about Dáil reform and how he would love to bring the Estimates in earlier. We introduced them in October. Deputy Bruton, as a former Minister for <Col N="503" /> Finance, knows that there was a contingency fund of £120 million for capital projects.  He knows, as former Minister for Finance, that the Estimates must be prepared ahead of time.  He stated tonight that the facts about Verolme Dockyard were not known and that a full assessment was not made until November 1982.  We went into an election campaign and yet the Minister tries the cheap gimmick of telling the people that we should have known the position.  I defy the Minister or anybody else to produce the civil servants from the two Departments who would say openly and honestly that they discussed the future of Verolme Dockyard. I discussed it personally in the Department of Finance and the officials are quite open and honest about it.  They know that in the contingency plan, subject to a Government decision and a full assessment of the situation, there alone the decision would be made.  That is what happens every year.  Is there specific money for an allocation this year?  There is not.  I am not going to waste my time on that.  The Ministers talk about honesty and courage but I sat as Minister for a short period of six or seven months and I closed down Ardmore Studios because the Government and I did not believe that it had a future.  I closed Avoca Mines because we knew it was at the end of its line.</P>

      <P>Let nobody say that I lack courage or honesty.  This is the sort of financial management that this country wants.  I will give every project a fair deal, as I would give to this one.  The Government with their Taoiseach, the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Education, went electioneering in Wicklow and when they found the Avoca miners picketing with placards, what did they do? <Col N="504" /> They bought them off with a promise of £1 million.  They must now go along the same road because the people being made redundant in Verolme Dockyard demand the same treatment of three-and-a-half week's service.  The Government did that for a company which was not State but privately owned, but here is a company in which the Government try to convince us they have no say and that it is a matter for the management and the workers.  Yet the State has a 47 per cent shareholding in this company and if the Government think they can pass the buck they have another guess coming.</P>
      <P>They ran in fright when the first problems came up in Cork.  What did the Taoiseach say in Cork about unemployment there which has risen by 50 per cent since this time last year?  He said that the Government were going to give Cork more IDA people.  The Minister knows that that decision was taken by me last October.  On decentralisation of small industrial developments into the region, the Minister made an announcement in Cork about the Sherling Drug Company of Bandon details of which had been long before published in the <i>Cork Examiner,</i> and the North Star Electronic Company was announced again, also.</P>
      <P>When the problems concerning B &amp; I arose in Cork, the Minister for Transport did not get the same reception in Cork as I got from Deputy O'Sullivan.  All he could say to the staff of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> was that he attracted people to west Cork for holidays.  The people of Cork are entitled to better direction and leadership than that and if the Government are not prepared to give it to them, they should pick up their bags and go and give the job to those who have the courage to do the job which has to be done, take the decisions and not pass the buck.  I never have run away from a courageous decision which had to be taken and never will.  If I had done so, I would not be here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points of view in relation to Verolme Dockyard.  Nobody can say that shipbuilding is an economic proposition in any part of the world today.  The Minister tried to direct attention to the world market price for a ship and pointed <Col N="505" /> out that Verolme Dockyard cannot compete. He had not the courage to mention the hidden subsidies in Korea, Japan and elsewhere and the cheap labour.  He should compare like with like.  When looking at any business proposition that is what one has to do.  The philosophy of the Government is dictated by bookkeepers but a point of view should be considered other than that of accountants and consultants.  I am a businessman and if I let an accountant run my business entirely, I would be out of business.  Consultants are brought in to do many jobs, but the interpretation of the consultants' report is important.  At the end of the day, the man in authority makes the decision and on his head is the success or otherwise of the enterprise.  The Minister has not done that in this case.  It is a one-way traffic.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the Minister's statement that the problems of B &amp; I were part of the problems created by Verolme Dockyard.  I was Minister when the B &amp; I venture was finished.  I asked B &amp; I where the fixed price contract was and they had none.  I dare anybody to try to pass the blame to somebody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I also resent the Minister talking about the heavy subsidy on the Panamax carrier.  It is very important that the facts of this case be known.  A Panamax coal carried was recently ordered in Japan for the second time by the ESB under the Coalition Government. I heard the Taoiseach, the man of integrity, putting all the blame on Fianna Fáil.  Unfortunately, I was in my room listening and was not in the Chamber.  As Minister, I bluntly had to tell the ESB on three different occasions that that ship was not going to be placed on order in the Far East until a full assessment was made into all the circumstances and until the Government had an opportunity to decide the facts of the case.  Let the senior civil servant involved confirm the truth of what I am saying.  Late at night he had to contact me to tell me that the ESB had directed their chief executive on two occasions to place that order.  I will stand <Col N="506" /> over it in public that I informed him that the Government were the Government and that decisions in the national interest should be taken by the Government and not by a semi-State body or anybody else. I make no apology for that.  The Government must take the overall point of view &mdash; not the bookkeepers' or the consultants' point of view but the overall national economic view.</P>
      <P>Another view was expressed by Deputy Justin Keating in 1975, the view of 1,100 people who have spent their lives building up crafts in what Deputy O'Sullivan confirms as our major engineering works.  The Government do not care about building up engineering skills. They would close the gates because the book-keeper says that that is the right answer today.  There must be confidence that this country's situation will pick up and that there will be enough business coming from Moneypoint in County Clare.  The management and work force have now seen the light and know that over-costs should be reduced.  I would be the first to say that if there are over-costs and overmanning, they should be reduced.  Do the Government believe that Ireland should have a fine engineering works like Verolme and a fine shipbuilding yard or do they believe that we have not the capacity to do it?  The ships produced in Verolme Dockyard are a credit to Irish craftsmanship.  These skills are visible on the &lsquo;Leinster&rsquo;, at the launching of which I was happy to be present.  They are to be seen in the Panamax carrier.  The Government should not try to gloss over all the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A difficult decision must be made. Confidence must be shown in the Verolme Cork Dockyard but the Government have not shown that confidence tonight.  I hope that on reflection they will decide that Ireland is to have a shipbuilding industry.  The Government must decide whether we are to have a large engineering works in which young people can be trained for the future to do the jobs which have to be done.  That is important.

      <P>The Government should have confidence that this enterprise can be made to work, but it is quite obvious that they have decided it will not. When I raised this question in Cork a few months ago, nobody heard anything about it.  I knew the philosophy and thinking of this Government and they are not the philosophy and thinking of the Labour Ministers in the previous Coalition. But the present Labour Members take a different view.  I go a long way with Deputy O'Sullivan and say that the work force are prepared to play their part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have the responsibility of producing a plan for the development of the enterprise if they believe in it, which I doubt after the speeches here tonight.  They have to give that plan <Col N="508" /> a vote of confidence by placing the two orders that it is within their capacity to place.  Let them not talk about subsidies being put into Estimates last October.  If the State places the orders no subsidy will be involved because they will be paid for by the Department of Defence.  The Government should produce the plan and give them the two orders if they have the courage and honesty to say they believe in this enterprise.  If they do not it will go for naught.  That is what will happen with the industrial base here.  The Government do not believe in the philosophy nor will they have a reasearch vessel.  They will not give £16,000 a month for research into the richness which abounds in the seas of Ireland. They have no belief in the future, no philosophy and no confidence in the ability of the country to solve our problems. They should do the honourable thing: get out and we will put in the right plan and the orders for the Verolme Cork Dockyard.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Picketing at Leinster House.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for your co-operation today in giving immediate attention to what I regard as a matter of vital importance to this House in the conducting of its affairs and also as an integral part of our democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say at the outset that in raising this matter I would not wish it to be interpreted in any way as meaning that I have anything against the democratic <Col N="511" /> right of individuals to protest, to picket or to demonstrate.  Having said that, I should like to bring to the Minister's attention the fact that the law regarding protesting of this kind is being contravened on what would appear to be almost a daily basis.  Subsection (1) of section 28 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, relates to the prohibition of meetings in the vicinity of the Oireachtas and reads:</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful for any public meeting to be held in, or any procession to pass along or through, any public street or unenclosed place which or any part of which is situate within one-half of a mile from any building in which both Houses or either House of the Oireachtas are or is sitting or about to sit....</P>
    <P>We realise that this law is being brought into disrepute.  I am not casting blame in any direction in that respect.  I am merely calling on the Minister as the chief custodian of the law-and-order situation to take action immediately to ensure that the law is either upheld or if in the opinion of the Minister, it cannot be enforced, modified.</P>
    <P>It is a Garda function to protect entrance to the House and to protect the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Clear instructions must be given to the Garda in that matter.  To give a recent example of what I am talking of, I would cite the deplorable situation we witnessed on Tuesday of last week outside this House.  I was one of a number of Deputies who was advised not to enter Leinster House because of the picketing that was taking place.  When I insisted on my democratic right to enter, my car was thumped and I was abused verbally as were other Deputies.</P>
    <P>In respect of all the Members of the House and also of members of the staff as well as of our constituents who come in and out of here to see us, something must be done about this situation.  Action must be taken now before a situation of this scale can magnify and quite easily get out of hand.  I realise the difficulty with which these situations present the Garda. The Minister may state that up to 1,000 <Col N="512" /> gardaí would be required to enforce the law in this case.  So be it.  We must address ourselves to that problem.  We could be faced with the situation where a picket or a protest outside Leinster House could get out of hand and could not be controlled. The public look to this House. Everything in relation to the maintenance of law and order comes from the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I feel that, in order to do the best for this House, a revision of section 28 of the Offences Against the State Act will have to be made immediately.  That Act imposed a £50 fine in 1939.  If that figure was updated we could be talking in terms of a fine of £1,000 on each person who defies the law.  What kind of situation would we have if everybody protesting outside Leinster House was arrested and fined that some of money?  Under the provision a prison sentence of up to three months can be imposed for a breach of that rule.</P>
    <P>The power under this Act has been steadily eroded.  There is general acceptance that you can go to Leinster House and protest, picket and do whatever you like, without taking any cognisance of a very firm law on the Statute Book.  I do not want to be dramatic about this.  I do not want to provoke a situation that would cause embarrassment to those trying to enforce the law.  Ten years ago people would not get involved in unruly demonstrations.  There has been a gradual erosion of public confidence in the maintenance of law and order.</P>
    <P>A start should be made in this House. If the Minister took a firm line in protecting the Houses of the Oireachtas this would be appreciated by every person in the Parliament building and would be looked up to by the general public.  I am not depriving anyone of his or her democratic right to protest.  I do not see anything wrong with inviting members of a protest group into Dáil Éireann.  That can very often help a situation on the boil.  But it should not be on the boil outside the gates of Leinster House, either Kildare Street or Merrion Square side.  Protests and pickets should be a distance from the gates of Leinster House.  Some assurance should be given <Col N="513" /> to the House this evening.  I appeal to the Minister to take immediate action to enforce the law.  Or, if he says it cannot be enforced, let us change the law, but let us not make a mockery of it as is the case at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am very glad of the opportunity to come in here on the Adjournment and to clarify the situation. I share the concern of Deputies on all sides of the House that public represetatives should be free to enter the House without fear of being molested.</P>
      <P>I would, first of all, like to make it clear that the holding of meetings or demonstrations within the precincts of this House is not unlawful as a matter of course.  The Offences Against the State Act, 1939, provides that any such meeting or demonstration shall not be lawful where a Garda officer not below the rank of chief superintendent has, by notice given to a person concerned in the holding or organising of any such meeting or demonstration, probibited the holding of the particular meeting or demonstration, or where a member of the Garda Síochána calls on the persons taking part in such a gathering to disperse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent demonstration which has given rise to concern was not unlawful. The Garda Síochána had no information that there would by any attempt to interfere with Members of the House.  I consider it only fair to say that only a small number of those involved in the demonstration went beyond the bounds of what is permissible in exercising the right to protest.  There have been many marches and demonstrations in the vicinity of Leinster House in recent years.  Responsibility for ensuring that such events do not interfere excessively with the rights of others is a matter for the Garda.  They deserve credit for the manner in which <Col N="514" /> they carry out their duties in this regard. I wish it to be known, however, that interference with Members of the Oireachtas of the kind engaged in by a few of those involved in recent demonstrations will not be countenanced and the Garda will take appropriate action to ensure that the rule of law is maintained.</P>
    <P>I take the point Deputy Brady made when he said that he and other Deputies were advised not to enter Leinster House.  I do not know who advised the Deputy but I assure the House that access to Leinster House will be provided for Deputies and anybody seeking to block or hinder Deputies from entering Leinster House will be dealt with by the Garda Síochána.  Nobody requires to go outside the law to register a protest.  I hope we will not see a recurrence of the type of activity which occurred.</P>
    <P>There was a time in the past when notices prohibiting meetings in the vicinity of Leinster House were made as a matter of course.  That policy was discontinued towards the end of the sixties, as far as is known in my Department at the moment.  I have not been able to establish the precise time when the practice was changed.  It was assumed then that there would be widespread recognition by those organising protests of the need to ensure that there would be no interference with the rights of Members of the House and that protests would be conducted strictly on that basis.  Generally speaking, that assumption has proved to be well-founded and I do not think the policy should be changed just because of a couple of regrettable occurrences.  Naturally, if further experience shows that a more restrictive policy is necessary in the interest of the preservation of the rights of Members of the Oireachtas, the policy will be reviewed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 June 1983.</P>

I will, however, consider the application as sympathetically as possible, in conjunction with similar applications for other regional airport projects, in the light of evolving policy in this area and in the context of the Estimates of expenditure for 1984.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of concern among local government employees, that since county managers started sitting on interview boards for vacancies for senior posts in their own counties, a disproportionate number of vacancies have been filled from within the counties concerned to the extent that officials are now reluctant to apply for vacancies outside of their own counties; if he will consider reviewing the practice of county managers sitting on interview boards for senior vacancies in their own counties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question refers to vacancies filled on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners. The constitution of interview boards in connection with such appointments is a matter within the competence of the commissioners and it would not be proper for me to interfere with their discretion in this matter.  However, I understand that the commission are at present engaged in a review of their practice of representing the employing authorities on interview boards and they have assured me that the views of all interested parties will be very carefully weighed in connection with that review.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the average cost per house of supplying electricity to the islanders from a central generator would be approximately 13 times the cost of providing individual generators to each house.  Because of these cost considerations the ESB, in a letter dated 19 February 1982, informed the islanders that supply could be made available from individual generators only.  I understand that the ESB have received no further communication from the islanders since February 1982.</P>

      <P>I assume that the service to which the Deputy refers is the shuttle service proposed by a British firm for the London-Westport route.</P>
      <P>The EEC regulations which provide for such services define shuttle services as &ldquo;services whereby, by means of repeated outward and return journeys, previously formed groups of passengers are carried from a single place of departure to a single destination.  Each group of passengers who have made the outward journey together shall subsequently be carried back to the place of departure.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The regulations provide also for up to three stopping places, in addition to the place of departure, to pick up passengers on the outward journey in the country of origin of the service.  In the country of destination, the service is entitled to set down passengers at up to three stopping places in addition to the place of destination. Corresponding stops are provided for on return journeys.</P>

      <P>If, however, the person concerned now considers that she did not make fully available at the oral hearing facts or evidence in support of her claim, it is open to her to make a fresh submission setting out the new facts or evidence and the matter will be re-submitted to the appeals officer to enable him to review the case.</P>
      <P>A person who is dissatisfied with the decision of an appeals officer has the right of appeal to the High Court on a question of law.</P>

      <P>The person concerned recently applied for a review of his means on the grounds that he changed his address and no longer enjoyed board and lodging in his parents' home.  His case has been referred to a social welfare officer for investigation and in the light of his report the person's means will be reviewed and the rate of unemployment assistance payable to him will be determined accordingly.  In the meantime payment of unemployment assistance at £13.45 weekly being the maximum rate payable to him £26.25 less £12.80 means is continuing.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance during intermittent periods between 13 October 1982 and 14 April 1983.  He was originally assessed with means at £35.00 weekly but following an appeal his means were reduced to nil.  He was entitled to unemployment assistance at £25.45 weekly and all arrears of unemployment assistance from 13 October 1982 to 9 April 1983 were paid to him on 12 April 1983.  He is still due two days of unemployment assistance in respect of 11 and 12 April 1983 and the amount due will be paid to him when he gets in touch with his local office in Kilkenny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for unemployment assistance an applicant must be the holder of a qualification certificate which is a statement of his means.  For the purposes of the question sample surveys were made in a number of employment exchanges and it was found that the average length of time taken to process an application for unemployment assistance where the applicant was not already the holder of a qualification certificate was the same in both May 1983 and May 1982, viz. six to seven weeks.  This is the period involved from the time an application is received in a local office, means are investigated by an outdoor officer of the Department, a decision is given on the assessment of means and first payment is made.  In order to prevent hardship in cases of need applicants are advised that they may apply for supplementary welfare allowance pending a decision on their unemployment assistance entitlements.</P>
      <P>Where an applicant for unemployment assistance is already the holder of a qualification certificate there is no delay in receiving payment.</P>
