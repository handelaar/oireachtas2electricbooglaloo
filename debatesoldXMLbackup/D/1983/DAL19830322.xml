    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if AnCo are involved in any cross-Border training courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>: AnCO are currently involved in a cross-Border training project financed jointly by the Department of Manpower Services of Northern Ireland and AnCO.  The project is an experiment in North-South co-operation in the field of youth employment. It brings together 12 young unemployed people from disadvantaged backgrounds, six from Dublin and six from Omagh, to better equip them to search for employment and to further their understanding of, and relationship with, those from a different political, social and cultural background.  During the project the young people spend half their time in Omagh and half in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present project started in January and followed the completion of an initial project at the end of 1981 when a training workshop was organised in conjunction with two voluntary organisations, namely the Omagh Community Development <Col N="324" /> Association and the Hope Organisation of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is it proposed to continue with this programme with particular reference to Donegal which is geographically north and politically South? It is more important that the Minister refers to Donegal so as to help cross-Border relations as well as cross-Border training programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The details of the operation of AnCO are a matter for the council of that body but the results of this initial project are very encouraging.  I have no doubt that the remarks made by the Deputy will be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>: Will the Minister give a commitment to look at Donegal in particular and at the other Border counties for further cross-Border programmes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: As I indicated, this was the first such project and the results were most encouraging.  That is so particularly if one takes into account the background of the people involved.  The situation was that some 75 per cent of the young people involved in that project went on to secure employment or further training opportunities and that was regarded as most satisfactory particularly having regard to the difficult background from which they came.  The fact that that first project was so successful certainly points the way to further co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>: If I bring to the attention of the Minister courses or training programmes suitable for Donegal will he investigate them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will be delighted to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour AnCO's policy in relation to the Gweedore training centre in view of the new training centre at Letterkenny, County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The AnCO training <Col N="325" /> centre at Gweedore is a permanent centre and AnCO intend to retain it as such.  When the new centre in Letterkenny is completed, the Gweedore centre will cater for Gaeltacht areas on a national basis as well as, of course, people from non-Gaeltacht areas who express a preference to take courses through Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the number of trainees and apprenticeships catered for in Gweedore training centre, County Donegal during 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: During 1982 AnCO trained 39 off-the-job apprentices and one redundant apprentice from their Gweedore centre.  AnCO also catered for 170 trainees on courses in the centre and organised training for 381 trainees on &ldquo;Introduction to Industry&rdquo; courses mainly from a mobile training unit and on projects under the Community Youth Training Programme.</P>
      <P>These numbers cover the trainees and apprentices who completed training during 1982.  In addition, at the end of 1982, 37 apprentices and 81 trainees were on courses in the Gweedore centre and 59 trainees were on projects under the Community Youth Training Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to ask the Minister if the fact that the new centre at Letterkenny will open later this year will affect the number of trainees and apprentices to be catered for at the Gweedore centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The intention is that when Letterkenny is fully operative Gweedore will cater for the Gaeltacht areas on a national basis as well as for those from any place else who wish to pursue a course through the Irish language. That means that there will be some extra spaces available to be taken up by people outside the immediate area of Gweedore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>: May I take it that the Gweedore centre will not be exclusively <Col N="326" /> Irish and that there will be places there for trainees who wish to pursue courses through English, particularly those who come from the Rosses, Cloughaneely, Gweedore and west Donegal in general?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The intention is that the Letterkenny centre will cater for the English speaking people of Donegal while the Gweedore centre will cater for the needs of the Gaeltacht throughout the country and those whose choice it is to pursue a course through Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>: Am I correct in thinking that Gweedore will be exclusively Irish and Letterkenny will be exclusively English?  Does it follow that students from Gweedore, the Rosses and west Donegal generally who want to pursue a course in English must go to Letterkenny, while people in Letterkenny who wish to do a course in Irish must go to Gweedore?  It would cost the Department much more money to bring the young people out of their own areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The project for Gweedore has been pursued in close co-operation with Údarás na Gaeltachta and it responds to a perceived need for a training centre catering not just for the needs of the Gweedore Gaeltacht but for the Gaeltacht nationally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his Department have any plans to open additional national manpower offices in County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The need for offices of the National Manpower Service is kept under regular review.  In County Donegal the NMS has offices in Ballybofey, Dungloe and Letterkenny and clinics are operated in other towns.  I am satisfied that there is no need to open additional offices in the county at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="327" />
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>: Can I take it that none of the offices or clinics in Donegal will close?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is no such intention.  A number of additional placement officers are being recruited to the National Manpower Service and the Deputy will be glad to hear that two of them will be assigned to County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister at liberty to indicate how many officers will be appointed to County Donegal, when the appointments will be made and the Manpower offices to which they will be assigned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: As I have indicated, two officers will be assigned to the county.  I do not have information as to the centres to which they will be assigned but if the Deputy requires this information I will be glad to obtain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister consider opening a Manpower office in Buncrana in view of the fact that the people of the Inishowen Peninsula must travel a considerable distance to Letterkenny or Ballybofey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The need for offices is kept under regular review but it is not felt that there is a need to open additional offices in the county at present. The needs of the Buncrana area are served by regular clinics.  That will be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware that there is grave concern in that area about the service provided by Manpower due to the fact that they do not operate an office there?  Would he agree to review the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am quite prepared to listen to any representations which Deputy Conaghan or any other Deputy from the county may wish to make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will give the following details in respect of each personal assistant, adviser, consultant, secretary, typist, or any other category employed from outside the civil service in a temporary, part-time, permanent or contractual capacity from 18 December to date: name, rank, remuneration, terms and conditions of employment, if seconded and, if so, from where.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: A similar question by the Deputy answered on 26 January 1983 covered the situation up to that date.  Since then there have been two further appointments.</P>
      <P>Mr. Roy Dooney has been appointed as personal assistant to the Minister of State at a salary of £10,533 per annum. Mr. Dooney is employed in a temporary capacity and his appointment will terminate not later than the date on which the Government cease to hold office.  He had been employed by the National Federation of Youth Clubs and the question of his secondment from that body is being considered.</P>
      <P>Information concerning the pending appointment of Dr. Fergus O'Ferrall is being given in reply to a separate question today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister agree that the total cost of appointments in his Department is in the region of £60,000?  Would he indicate how this expenditure is justified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The question tabled related to appointments subsequent to 26 January and has been answered on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am taking the combined totals, including appointments prior to 26 January.  The figure is now in excess of £60,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have not the salaries about which the Deputy was informed on 26 January but if the Deputy <Col N="329" /> tells me that this is the figure, I will not dispute it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Does the Minister feel the expenditure is justified for people outside the civil service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am quite satisfied that all the appointments made will increase the efficiency with which the Minister for Labour and myself will carry out our tasks.  I note that when the Deputy opposite was in this Department he found it helpful to make an appointment outside the civil service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is it the Minister's policy that one of the advisers named by him today should make public statements on his behalf?  On whose behalf does he make such statements? When he gives press interviews, such as on last Sunday, on whose behalf&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: No, it arises from the Minister's reply.  This person is a paid adviser.  Do the views expressed by him in last Sunday's newspaper interview represent the views of the Minister or are they his own personal views?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is another question related to the appointment of Dr. Fergus O'Ferrall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will state the following details in respect of the recently announced appointment of a person (details supplied) as an adviser in his Department (a) salary and any other remuneration; (b) terms and conditions of employment; (c) the capacity in which he has been employed; (d) the functions allocated to him; (e) the method of selection for the appointment; (f) his qualifications for the post; (g) if he is on secondment and, if so, from where; and (h) his previous occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The intention to <Col N="330" /> appoint Dr. Fergus O'Ferrall, President of the National Youth Council was announced on 28 February 1983.</P>
      <P>Dr. O'Ferrall has not yet taken up a position in my Department and will not do so until a contract of employment has been concluded and signed.  Such a contract will, of course, be only for the duration of the lifetime of the Government.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances it is not possible for me to give the Deputy the details sought at (a) and (b) of his question but when agreement is concluded I will be pleased to let Deputy Fitzgerald have the information sought.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other parts of the question Dr. O'Ferrall will be employed as special adviser on youth affairs.  His appointment, which has been welcomed by the National Youth Council, is in the context of the major policy initiative in the youth area recently announced by me.  Dr. O'Ferrall was selected for appointment on the basis of his wide ranging experience on matters relating to youth affairs.  That experience includes serving at present as President of the National Youth Council of Ireland, membership of the board of the Youth Employment Agency, membership of the Adult Education Commission, membership of the Manpower Consultative Committee's sub-committee on youth employment, membership of the Employment Action Team, membership of the executive committee of Aontas, and membership of the Institute of Training and Development.</P>
      <P>Dr. O'Ferrall is at present employed as training manager with Macra Na Feirme and when he takes up appointment he will be on secondment from there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is he not a member of Fine Gael as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: After that brainstorming exercise naming all sorts of organisations, some important and others not so important, would the Minister indicate what other applicants were considered for this appointment and what particular qualities Dr. O'Ferrall has, other than his membership of Fine Gael?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="331" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: Fair play to the Minister. He is blushing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: When is it expected that the contractual documents will be completed and when will Dr. O'Ferrall take up duty?  Do the views expressed in last Sunday's article represent his own personal viewpoint, that of the Minister of State or that of the Minister for Labour, a member of the Government, who should be the person taking these type of decisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy will recall from his own experience when appointing an adviser that there are procedures to be gone through and these procedures are now in train.  This involves Departments other than the Department of Labour.  The Department of the Public Service, to name just one, are also involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: He is the sixth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The precedents established are of course helpful in expediting these matters.  We naturally look at all the existing precedents.  In selecting Dr. O'Ferrall regard was had to his preeminence in the area as indicated by his very wide range of experience.  It was felt that his qualities and experience would be of substantial benefit to me in my work in the area of youth affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister said he would let me have the information when the contract was completed. Obviously this would be of some benefit to all Members of the House.  Would he let the House have this information or let me have it in the House rather than privately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not sure what procedures exist which would enable me to do that.  If the Deputy puts down another question I can give him the information.  Alternatively I will make it available to him privately and he can do what he wishes in terms of circularising it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware of reports that trade union officials have been barred from entering construction sites in County Mayo; the steps he proposes to take to protect the rights of workers to organise into trade unions and to have access to trade union officials; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am aware that the Federation of Western Trade Union Councils is critical of the fact that, as the federation sees it, union officials are being denied the oportunity of organising workers at Knock Airport.  On the other hand the chairman of the development company states that trade union officials have not been banned from the site.</P>
      <P>The question of trade union representation is a matter for resolution between the employer and the trade unions involved.  In the event of a dispute arising the Labour Court and their industrial relations services are available, on request, to assist the parties to reach a settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: In view of the fact that the State has provided all the funds to date for the building of Knock Airport, would the Minister not agree that the Government should have an interest in whether or not trade unions are allowed to organise on the site?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The contracts that exist are contracts between promoters of the project, Connacht Airport Development Company Limited, and the individual contractor.  My information is that those contracts contain a clause that the contractor shall recognise the freedom of his work people to be members of trade unions.  I understand the contractor <Col N="333" /> does recognise that, though obviously there is a dispute on the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: In view of the fact that the State has provided all the funds for this project and that it is normal practice, as the Minister indicated, for contracts to allow workers to organise in trade unions, then, if the contractors are not allowing this organisation to take place and are refusing admittance to trade union officials to the site, will the Minister not get in touch with the contractors concerned and insist that they allow the trade union movement to organise on the site?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: That might arise if there was any agreement about the facts, but there is no agreement about the facts.  The contractor maintains that the workers are free to join a union and the unions are obviously unhappy about the situation.  Until there is some clarity about the facts I do not think I can do anything further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>

Would he not, as a matter of urgency, have an investigation carried out by officials of his Department who are competent to do so and let the House know what the position is without relying on comments from one side or the other?</P>

      <P>: This is the same as in any other dispute.  The question of trade union representation is a matter for resolution in the first instance between the parties to that dispute &mdash; in this instance between the contractor and the unions who would seek to be involved.  In the event of a dispute arising, then the Labour Court and its industrial relations services are available on request to assist each of the parties to the settlement.  As at this moment it has not been established that any individual workers have wanted to join a union and are being inhibited. If any such suggestion arises then the agencies are available to assist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will consider making the youth development officer scheme permanent and raising the funding of the scheme to 90 per cent in view of the excellent work these officers were involved in among young people throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The development officer scheme was introduced in 1979 as a temporary employment measure with a four year commitment to Exchequer assistance on a declining scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1983 Budget I secured additional <Col N="335" /> finance to raise the level of support for each development officer from a maximum of £5,000 a year, a figure which obtained from 1979, to £7,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I am at present considering the future of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister is covering this scheme for 1983.  Do I take it that he is giving a commitment to continue the scheme for a four year period?</P>

      <P>: I take it the Minister has covered the scheme for 1983.  Will he give a four year commitment the same as on the previous occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: No.  The situation is that this scheme was introduced in 1979 arising from the recommendation of the employment action team.  At that stage it contemplated the employment of 100 young people as development officers through voluntary organisations, their employment to be supported on a sliding scale.  The level of support remained static from 1979 but in this years' budget that level of support was substantially increased in each instance from £5,000 to £7,000.  The question of the long-term future of the scheme is under consideration and I have already had discussions with almost all the youth organisations involved as employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister of State indicating that this scheme will not continue after 1983?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have already indicated that when this scheme was first introduced in 1979 it was intended to have a four year life span.  During that four year life span it gave rise to considerable problems for many of the organisations who were employing development officers because the original figure set of £5,000 proved to be inadequate and presented a burden on their limited resources.  In those circumstances, I was happy to secure additional funding in this <Col N="336" /> year's budget to carry them over their immediate difficulties.  The question of the long-term future of the scheme is now under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: No, the Deputy should not take anything of the sort.  The situation is that the Estimates published in December of last year by the outgoing Administration made available an increase of only 1 per cent on last year's expenditure.  That sum was recognised by this Government as being wholly inadequate to meet our commitment to treat the funding of youth services as a priority. As a result of that, the Government made available an extra £550,000.  That sum will now be spent during the course of the year.  In order to meet the immediate needs of the various organisations who are grant beneficiaries a sum of 70 per cent of last year's grant was made over to them in the first instance to carry them over their immediate difficulties.</P>

    <P>On 31 January some 870 unemployed apprentices included in the figures above were being catered for on AnCO Programmes.</P>
    <P>2.  Although the bulk of out of work apprentices notify AnCO there are a number of apprentices who are not notified and consequently are not on the register.</P>
    <P>3.  Some apprentices who were notified to AnCO as being out of work omit to inform AnCO that they have secured re-employment and their names still appear in the register.</P>
    <P>4.  Surveys by AnCO in 1982 of apprentices unemployed according to AnCO's records, indicated that 40 per cent of the respondents were actually unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the reason the 1 per cent Youth Employment Levy is deducted at source and from the staff of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; and the action he will take in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: Under the Youth Employment Levy Regulations, 1982 (S.I.No. 84 of 1982), the 1 per cent youth <Col N="343" /> employment levy is payable by an individual coming within the PAYE/PRSI system on his gross income as reduced by his superannuation payments.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question relates to the position of a branch manager of an employment office.  I understand the Revenue Commissioners have ruled that branch managers are employees of the Department of Social Welfare, and they have been fully insurable under the social welfare code since 1968.  They have come within the PAYE scheme since 1976 when the scope of the scheme was extended to the public service under the Finance Act of that year.  The youth employment levy, therefore, is payable on the income of a branch manager on the same basis as that of any other employee coming within the PAYE/PRSI system.  That position would obtain also as regards persons whom a branch manager might decide to employ.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: What steps have the Government taken since 10 March to set a pay policy or to commence negotiations with the public service?  What intentions do the Government have in the whole matter of pay at a time when there appears to be a completely vague attitude in the background of the devaluation of the weekend which will further affect pay packets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is nothing at all vague about this.  The Government issued a paper on 10 March last in which they formally stated their position on pay policy for 1983.  That paper, having noted the views of the ICTU and the FUE, briefly described the background to the pay negotiations.  Respecting the right of all parties to enter pay negotiations, the Government expressed the view that there should be a pay pause until the autumn and that increases in low single figures should follow.  The Government also considered that pay agreements negotiated should be for not less than 15 months.  I understand the Deputy has <Col N="344" /> tabled a broadly similar question to the Minister for the Public Service in relation to his role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am trying to get some information but it is not easy to get it.  Is the Minister saying that the statement of 10 March is a Government decision on pay policy?  Is he saying he is no longer giving the employer or trade union representatives any play, that the Government have decided there will be a long pay pause at the end of which there will be a very low percentage increase?  If that is so, what steps have the Government taken, on the other hand, to ensure stability of prices during the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: Any reading of the Government statement will indicate that the Government's position is quite the opposite to what the Deputy has suggested. There is no question of the Government seeking to dictate in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Has the Minister any views on whether negotiations should take place quickly especially, for example, where agreements have expired?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: Negotiations in the public sector are a matter for the Minister for the Public Service.  Later on the Order Paper the Minister will be answering questions.  In the case of the private sector the Government have indicated what their wishes would be.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will state in view of the serious employment difficulties being encountered in the hotel and catering industry the steps he intends to take to assist the industry during 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: My Department and its agencies assist the hotel and catering industry in a number of ways.  In 1982 CERT was allocated £1.22 million from the Exchequer towards the training of some 5,800 workers in the industry and approximately 1,500 unemployed persons seeking to enter employment in the sector.  The allocation for 1983 is £1.706 million.  This funding, along with a matching ESF grant, is expected to enable CERT to maintain its training activity in the industry at its 1982 level and also to train approximately 1,900 unemployed persons seeking entry to the industry.</P>
      <P>Young people were assisted by work experience programmes in the hotel and catering industry in 1982 and they will continue to be placed on programmes in the industry in 1983.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in replies to parliamentary questions on 15 March, the Youth Employment Agency have been asked to finance a scheme of employment incentives for the hotel and catering industry in 1983 and their response is expected this week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I note that the <Col N="350" /> Minister's reply refers to training only.

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour (a) the amount of money spent to date in 1983 on the Employment Incentive Scheme, 1983, and (b) the projected number of persons who will be assisted by the scheme in 1983 in (i) manufacturing industry and (ii) agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Employment Incentive Scheme, 1983, came into operation on 14 January 1983.  Expenditure relating to the scheme to date is negligible. This arises because payments are submitted for four week periods and for the 1983 scheme the first such period would have ended on 29 January 1983. There is a period of grace of 60 days for employers to submit their claims; and there is a time lag in processing claims and payments in the Department.</P>
      <P>The projected number of persons likely to be recruited under the scheme in 1983 is put at 3,360, of whom it is estimated (i) 3,120 will be in manufacturing industry and (ii) 240 in agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy's question relates to the amount of money spent to date in 1983 on the Employment Incentive Scheme, 1983.  The first operative period runs from 3 January 1983 to 29 January 1983, and the closing date for receipt of applications is 30 March 1983. Those statistics would not be available yet.  There is always a time lag after applications are received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Surely the Minister must have some indication of the type of response in that period.  I am not asking about the money but the numbers within the 3,000 odd to whom he referred.  What is his estimate of the number who will be assisted by that scheme in the first period of this year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: Liquified petroleum gas has been declared a dangerous substance under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972.  It is covered, therefore, by sections 25 and 62 (1) of the Act. Section 25 provides that a person engaged in the storage, labelling, packing or conveyance of a dangerous substance shall take all practicable steps to prevent risk of injury to person or property.  Section 62 (1) provides that all practicable steps to prevent risk of injury to person or property shall be taken in the conveying, loading and unloading of a dangerous substance.</P>
      <P>Regulations have been made under the Act which cover the conveyance by road of LPG.  Regulations under the Act relating to the storage of petroleum also prohibit delivery, storage and retaining of LPG in petroleum stores unless specificially authorised.  I propose to make further regulations prescribing protective measures against risk of injury to person or property in the loading, unloading and storage of LPG.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: As I have indicated, the situation is covered by the Dangerous Substances Act and the regulations made under it.

      <P>(<i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): I assume the Deputy is referring to applicants for enlistment as recruits in the Permanent Defence Force.  The detailed procedure for such enlistment is prescribed in Defence Force Regulations A. 10, a copy of which is available in the Dáil Library. Briefly, the procedure is that the applicant fills out a form giving basic information about background and circumstances. The application is then processed in accordance with the regulations and, if the applicant is considered generally suitable for enlistment by the military authorities, he is called to an interview. If the result of the interview is favourable, the applicant is required to undergo a medical examination to determine medical suitability for service in the force.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1983: Second Stage (Resumed) .</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>: Events have come on apace since I reported progress on this Bill and what I describe as an unsocial Social Welfare Bill has had its repercussions, particularly on the members of the Labour Party.  I am sure that before the evening is out we will see more difficulties for them.  They have shown their displeasure at the contents of the Bill much more than any words of mine can convey and they have described it as a savage attack on those least able to help themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time I reported progress I was speaking of the effect of section 13 of the Bill particularly on the very many smallholders on the western coast.  I find it incomprehensible that the Minister talks about adding £5 million for low income families when he and his Government are making a dual attack on smallholders <Col N="451" /> many of whom would qualify for any assistance that would be going out of this £5 million.  Again I would like to ask the Minister &mdash; I stress this, and you, Sir represent a constituency where many people will be affected &mdash; about the necessity for setting down guidelines so that people will have at least an idea as to how much they will be assessed.  My experience and that of every Deputy in this House who lives along the western seaboard is that now there is no continuity, no general guideline in relation to assessments which are being made at the moment for widows' pensions.  If this system is adopted you will have anomalies right along the western seaboard where different inspectors will be assessing different values on each farm.</P>
    <P>Also I find it a little hard to believe that the Minister is throwing the whole question of notional assessment out the door because of what he says is the High Court judgment of 30 July 1982.  My understanding is that that judgment had been appealed and one would have expected that at least he would have waited until next year before going ahead with this section.  It seems somewhat ludicrous that, on the one hand, these people will be assessed for income tax and, on the other, another set of people will come out investigating their means. We are talking about some of the poorest people in the country and many hundreds of families who but for unemployment would not be able to continue living in this country.  I and many Deputies along the western seaboard have memories of inspectors going in and counting chickens. Are we to go back to those fine old days again when we will go in and count the chickens on the farm and make an assessment of the value of each chicken and egg?  It would be an interesting exercise, but I would have felt that these social welfare inspectors should have many more things to do rather than being involved in this kind of activity.  To say that it has been done in the name of ridding the country of abuse is not factual. Of course there are some abuses, but the vast majority of social welfare inspectors know where the abuses are <Col N="452" /> and they would be well able, without any assistance like this, to root out those abuses given certain other powers.</P>
    <P>This will have a very detrimental effect on the agricultural sector along the western seaboard.  People will be discouraged under this system from putting the unemployment assistance they are getting &mdash; as many of them do now &mdash; back into their farms therefore helping themselves to get a slightly higher standard of living, when they know that in many cases they will never be able to become viable farmers and if they help themselves in any way the social welfare officer will be out even at the request of a neighbour to check and count the number of animals, chickens etc. that they have around the place.  I know, and you, Sir, know of very many people who but for unemployment assistance would not now be living in Ireland.  The insertion of this section in the Bill is detrimental and will mean that very many people will move out of the west.  It is somewhat foolish for the Minister to assess them for tax and at the same time to send people out to check whether they should, because they have an extra cow or bullock, be docked unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The abolition of factual assessment by the then Minister, now Deputy Haughey who is leader of my party, was most enlightened legislation in that it gave people the chance to improve themselves. It gave them a pride in themselves without the sword of inspectors hanging over their heads.  If this Bill goes through &mdash; at this stage there must be doubt as to whether it will &mdash; we will have got back to that.</P>
    <P>I could say many more things on the Bill.  However, many of the things I could say have been said very strongly by members of the Labour Party who find that the Thatcherism of Fine Gael is a little hard for them to take and who have now said openly that they will not and could not support this legislation.  In my time in this House we have never seen a Social Welfare Bill as savage as this Bill which purports to give assistance to very many people who are unable to assist themselves and which in fact is doing the very opposite.  It has been, as members of your <Col N="453" /> party, Sir, have said, a most savage attack on those least able to help themselves.</P>

      <P>: By agreement with the Whips it has been decided to have a rota of speakers who will each have half an hour to speak from now until 7 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. F. O'Brien) Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. F. O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the proposals in the budget relating to social welfare.  It also includes a number of provisions for the purpose of streamlining and improving the procedures dealing with the legal proceedings under the Social Welfare Acts.  It is customary at budget time to review the social welfare position with a view to ensuring that those in need of social insurance and assistance will be adequately provided for.  There has been a steadily increasing demand for these services because of the deterioration in economic activity.  This has resulted in a steep rise in the cost of the services administered by my Department and financing these services is now a serious problem.</P>
      <P>In 1982, overall expenditure by the Department of Social Welfare amounted to £1,635 million, of which the Exchequer contributed £942 million.  In 1983, it is estimated that the overall expenditure will be about £1,870 million, of which the Exchequer will contribute £1,034 million after allowing for the budgetary provisions. A number of speakers have complained of savage cuts in social welfare benefits.  As one can see, the substantial increase in this year's expenditure will nail those complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unemployment situation has deteriorated alarmingly.  This time three years ago the live register showed 92,300 unemployed. The live register published recently showed 188,300, an increase of 104 per cent in three years.  As a result, in 1983 it is estimated that £473 million will be spent in unemployment benefits. This represents about 25 per cent of the total expenditure on social welfare benefits. Obviously, this has limited the extent to which benefits could be increased.  Nevertheless, the Government <Col N="454" /> have faced up to the situation and have provided for a quite significant level of increase, having regard to the difficult financial position.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for increases of 12 per cent in long-term payments and 10 per cent in short-term, with effect from the end of June next.  These increases will apply to dependant spouses and children, as well as to the claimants.  Speakers have complained of inadequate increases, but one must take into account the inadequate resources available.  Last year's increase of 25 per cent compensated over and above the cost of living.  This year, because of rising unemployment, we had to find the most equitable and fair means of providing social welfare payments. The increases of 12 per cent and 10 per cent constituted the fairest and most just method.  I have not heard any of the speakers who complained proffering ways of financing additional increases.</P>
    <P>The Estimates of the Opposition indicated that the deficit would be as low as £750 million and our budget deficit is something of the order of £890 million. One must ask where that additional money was to come from.  When in Opposition, it is easy to indulge in the luxury of making wild and emotive statements but when one is in Government, facing serious economic problems contributed to by rising unemployment, one must identify and tackle the underlying causes.  For some years back, we have let our financial and economic policy get out of hand and must now take remedial action.  In taking this action we intend to protect the less well-off in our society.  Most of the cries of condemnation do not relate to the adequacy or inadequacy of welfare benefits to the elderly, but to another area in which we have been, and are in the process of, redressing imbalances.  These have been the subject of many editorials and newspaper articles and complaints by politicans.</P>
    <P>As a result of the increases, the contributory old age pension for those under the age of 80 will include an additional £4.85p, which brings the personal rate to £45.10p.  If married with a wife under 60, the pensioner will get an additional <Col N="455" /> £7.95p, bringing his pension to £73.90p. The contributory widow's pension and the pension for a deserted wife with two children will amount to £63.45p per week, an increase of £6.80p.  The maximum personal rate for the non-contributory old age pensioners under 80 years is being increased from £34.45p to £38.60p &mdash; an increase of £4.15p.  Further increases are being given to married pensioners and pensioners over 80 years of age or living alone.  In the case of short-term benefits, disability and unemployment benefit will be on a new personal rate of £34.80p, an increase of £3.15p. There is a commitment to giving a just and equitable increase, given the overall circumstances.</P>
    <P>On the question of smallholders and of doing away with the notional system, assessment on a factual basis is a fair system which will in time work out satisfactorily. There is no question of hounding people or taking money from them. In any welfare system there must be obvious fairness.  The administration of any welfare system has to be seen as fair. It must also show that people in need will not be cast aside.  Whatever money we have &mdash; and vast sums are being expended &mdash; it must be spent where there is hardship and necessity.  That is what we intend to do and that is what we will do.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, there has been a great deal of public criticism of the benefits paid to short-term workers.  Concern has been expressed that the system is being manipulated and that short-time workers are better off working short-time than full-time.  A critical examination was made of the benefits due to these workers and that examination showed that there was a valid basis for the fears so widely expressed.</P>
    <P>The most common arrangement for short-time work was where workers normally engaged in a five day week were put on three days and laid off for two. Such workers received three-fifths of their basic pay while after the statutory waiting period at present they receive three days flat-rate unemployment benefit, <Col N="456" /> plus pay-related benefit.  Many short-time workers also qualify for income tax refunds because of their reduced earnings.  The result is that the take home income of such workers would exceed the net take home pay they would get if they were working full time.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves is that what social welfare is about.  It is not, and one cannot stand over that.  A social welfare system should ensure that people have adequate means to live, whether they have suffered illness or, unfortunately, have been put on a three-day week.  In those circumstances it cannot be seen that these people get more money than if in full-time employment, and it is in that light that these changes are being made. If one examines fairly what has been done one can only come to the conclusion that it was right and equitable.</P>
    <P>I will give some examples of a man earning £145 gross per week on short-time. If he is single his net income would amount to 103 per cent of his earnings. A married man earning the same amount would get 108 per cent of his net full time earnings; with two children he would get 114 per cent of his net full-time earnings, and with six children it would be 122 per cent of his net full-time earnings.  In one's wildest imagination one could not stand over that.  The social welfare code was not set up to ensure that in some cases people got 14 and 15 per cent above their take home pay if they were in full-time employment, and that is not taking into account the income tax rebate.</P>
    <P>In an economic climate of scarce resources and finances it behoves us to ensure that our resources are distributed fairly and equitably.  I am at a loss to understand &mdash; and I say this sincerely &mdash; why there is such concern about this area of the social welfare system.  There seems to be more concern about this area than many others.  I would hope that was not the type of society we want.  What we want is to ensure that whatever system we apply it helps those who need it most and looks after them.  It is known that the present system is wide open to abuse.  At particular times of the year people can go sick and by so doing get more money than if they were working.  That does not <Col N="457" /> encourage industry.  I am not saying everybody does this but such an avenue or temptation should not exist.  When we look at this part of the Bill I believe the reasons for its inclusion will be seen to be sound and good.</P>
    <P>Pay-related benefit is payable as a supplement, with the flat-rate of unemployment and disability benefits.  A great deal of criticism has been expressed about the levels of benefit which are payable during sickness or full unemployment.  Concern has also been expressed at the amounts of benefit which have been granted to workers when compared with their take home pay, including tax refunds.  This, too, is something we should look at. These matters have to be put right.  If we are serious about tackling the whole area of unemployment, economic growth and development, every area of our economy will have to be examined to ensure that we get value for money and that we are getting the type of service for which we are paying.</P>
    <P>So far I have dealt with what I consider to be the main provisions of the Bill but there are many others which I will mention briefly.  There has been criticism of section 11 which deals with maternity grants for confinements occurring on and after 4 April 1983.  This grant has remained at £8 since 1978 and, in my view, it is relatively insignificant.  The scheme of weekly maternity allowances has been improved considerably in the meantime, particularly with the introduction of the special scheme for women in employment.  Under the general scheme the average amount is £500, including pay-related benefit, and under the scheme for working women the average amount is about £900.  The grant of £8 when compared with those figures is totally insignificant.</P>
    <P>Under section 12, children's allowances will no longer be paid for apprentices between 16 and 18 years.  I have heard severe criticism of this.  Originally there was a tendency to pay apprentices very poorly but now they receive considerable sums by way of weekly income.  It is no longer the case that young people work without receiving remuneration.  In the case of a young person doing menial <Col N="458" /> work which offers no improvement in training and for which he is receiving only a menial wage, children's allowances are not paid even if somebody in the home is not working.  One must question the equity of that situation.  We seem to adopt the attitude that once we establish something we must not rescind it, but any system requires to be reviewed from time to time.  If such review discloses that the system concerned has outlived its usefulness or is no longer as necessary as it was in the past, it should be discontinued and the moneys saved as a consequence diverted to where they are needed most.</P>
    <P>The Bill from section 17 onwards contains certain amendments relating to prosecutions.  Broadly speaking, these measures are intended to strengthen and streamline the procedure on the legal side.  They deal also with some defects in the legislation which have come to light. These measures were included after consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The rapidly increasing live register necessitates the provision of very substantial sums of money apart from making any allowance for improving the services.  Some people seem to forget that our unemployment figures are increasing. We must make provision accordingly and ensure adequate provision in the budget to look after those who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs.  This is one of the reasons for our trying to ensure in relation to any strategy on the part of the Government that the figure we strike will not be one off the top of our heads but instead will be a factual figure.  We believe that the amount that will be required to meet the cost of additional unemployment will be in excess of £31 million.  A provision of that magnitude prevents us from granting increases in other areas.  We must ensure that we have the resources to meet the increases that are being granted so that we do not end up in a vast borrowing situation.  Those people who criticise the 10 and 12 per cent increases and also the cuts in the area of pay-related benefits might tell us where they think the money might come from to enable us to give greater increases.  Our options are very limited in <Col N="459" /> terms of where we can raise money at the moment.  The great problem is that the PAYE worker is already being taxed substantially. We have had to cut back our spending programme.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I should like to be able to give bigger payments.  That would be the sentiment of the majority of us here but unfortunately sentiment will not control expenditure or manage the affairs of State.  When one examines the overall economic picture one realises that we must be prudent across the board in our approach to tackling our problems. Where there are anomalies we must try to eliminate them.  Those who use extravagant language in relation to this Bill must not have thought out the situation very much.  Unemployment is one of the great cancers of our society.  We must take whatever steps are necessary to deal with the economic situation and in that way endeavour to bring some normality into the employment area as well as into the whole economic sphere.  If we succeed to that extent we can talk about greater increases for the less well-off and particularly for those who are dependent on social welfare.  This year we are spending almost £2,000 million on social welfare. That is a substantial amount in any economy but especially in a small economy such as ours.  However, as legislators we have a duty to ensure that the weakest sections are provided for.  That is our primary objective.  In the next few years we should be able to put our house in order but in the present climate the increases this year are generous.  One could say they were in line with the overall economic package.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at some of the utterances about this Bill.  It must be viewed within the overall economic context.  Everybody admits that something must be done.  But when one impinges on their area of operation it is felt then that that is the area in which no action should be taken.  I suppose that is a human weakness.  If one looks at this Bill <i>in toto</i> it will be seen to be fair and just given the economic plight we inherited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: My colleague, Deputy <Col N="460" /> O'Hanlon, dealt fairly comprehensively with the detailed aspects of this Bill.  Consequently I shall confine my remarks at present to some fairly general comments.</P>
      <P>I was asked to speak immediately after the Budget Statement in this House.  My initial reaction was &mdash; and the words I used at the time were &mdash; that it was a savage budget especially in relation to the poor and social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>Having looked specifically at this Social Welfare Bill I feel that the comments of some Labour Deputies in relation to it &mdash; Deputy Bell in particular &mdash; only echo the reality that is part of this Bill.  The Minister was quoted as suggesting that this was a Bill to deal with spongers in our society.  Those were the headlines in the papers the evening it was introduced, that this Bill would deal with spongers.  It is important to make quite clear that this Bill deals principally with the withdrawal of benefits from people at present enjoying them, with a reduction in the real value of their benefits and also in their present nominal values.  This Bill has nothing to do with spongers directly. One small section has some relationship to spongers in so far as it contains amendments relating to prosecutions.  It is in that respect only that the Bill deals with spongers.  Of course spongers were being dealt with separately in other critical studies carried out last year and from which fairly good results emerged during the year which I trust will continue.  It is important therefore that we recognise that that aspect is currently being and will continue to be dealt with separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a question for written reply, number 811, on 26 January last, seeking the number of social welfare claimants reported as being capable of work following examination by a medical referee. The numbers concerned were given in the form of a table for the four quarters of last year.  In so far as the assessments of medical referees are correct, these refer to people who are sponging on the social welfare system.  For the first quarter the number was 2,178, the next quarter 2,393, the third quarter, 2,544 and the last quarter 2,811.  These constitute effective administrative measures such as the appointment of additional <Col N="461" /> medical referees and other administrative steps taken to deal specifically with those kinds of cases.</P>
    <P>There were other measures taken also. I am sure the present Minister is continuing to deal administratively with those aspects.  If one were to accept that definition of a sponger, then a man who pays insurance becomes a sponger when he draws it in his hour of need.  That is something that has been suggested by various people both inside and outside the House in the course of this debate. That is a totally false definition of a sponger under our social welfare code.</P>
    <P>This Bill does deal with disincentives and anomalies not the fault of the basic contributor.  Rather are they the fault of changing times, the fault of the Government in taking more PRSI contributions from the working man and more tax from him so that his net take-home pay is considerably reduced.  Certainly there was a need for adjustment here.  That is also why the critical studies, to which the Minister of State referred, were undertaken last year.  Those studies having been undertaken it is our view that the present Government have over-reacted to them, have not dealt with them in the way they should.  The reason we oppose this Bill is that there is a very significant difference between it and our Bill.  The measures we were taking were designed to meet the requirement of eliminating a disincentive to work but certainly not to over-react in this regard.  If one examines some of the provisions of this Bill in comparison with those we were proposing one finds there are in fact substantial differences.  The media have grasped the fact that there are differences but not their full significance.  They are inclined to maintain that &mdash; yes there were differences but not of any great magnitude.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one or two of these differences.  First, this Bill must be viewed in the overall context of what the Government are attempting to do.  What we were endeavouring to do was in a specific context.  Therefore the Bill must be viewed in that context.  The increase for old age pensioners and widows is less than we had planned.  Here the increase is 12 per cent, its implementation delayed <Col N="462" /> until later in the year, which effectively represents approximately an 8 per cent increase and consequently considerably less than the 15 per cent we would have considered necessary.</P>
    <P>Secondly disincentives and anomalies are being removed but removed excessively. The present Government have gone much further in this regard.  In addition some new measures were taken which did not form part of those critical studies or were not necessary to eliminate this disincentive to work.  For instance, there is the extension from 12 to 18 days waiting period for pay-related benefit for every single worker paying PRSI.  I am surprised that people have not recognised the evil involved in this change, a scandalous change with regard to the working man.  Is the Minister suggesting that this man, genuinely sick and out of work, is a sponger, that he needs some other special incentive?  In effect what the Minister is saying is that such person will have to wait until the fourth week of illness before receiving pay-related benefit.  I cannot see what reason the Minister can have for that provision and, if he has good reason, I shall be interested to hear so.  I can see no reason for the Minister introducing this adverse change for the ordinary bona fide working man who is paying his full pay-related contributions, not alone now but has probably done so for many years past.</P>
    <P>One may well ask why is the Minister changing his circumstances so adversely. It must be remembered that the members of the public service will receive their benefit from the first day of sickness.  We are all aware that the first three days of sickness for a full rate PRSI payer are not covered.  We are all aware also that at present one must wait 12 days for the pay-related benefit.  The Minister is now pushing that back a further week, saying that a beneficiary must wait 18 days.  It must be remembered that that worker must meet his mortgage payments, he must look after his wife and children, he must cater for the family shopping, pay value-added tax and so on.  This is a scandalous measure introduced for the sole reason of taking money from the social welfare recipient.  It is not part of any <Col N="463" /> scheme to do away with anomalies or disincentives.</P>
    <P>Putting the implementation date for these increases back to July is another way of saving some money.  Of course this means that the real rate of increase is reduced considerably.  I asked a parliamentary question in this respect and discovered that the amount of money saved by the Minister for Finance &mdash; or if you like taken by the Minister from beneficiaries through this delaying tactic &mdash; amounts to £39.3 million.  In that figure he is taking from the old age pensioner £15.5 million.  That is the sort of money the Minister is saving by delaying that implementation date.  That was not any part of our plan and I am anxious to make that clear.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that it is not intended to provide any improvement in children's allowances.  There are some marvellous economists on the Government side of the House who can make great statements about every economic issue that arises but surely they realise that the decision not to grant an increase in those allowances effectively means a reduction in the value of them to the families concerned. It is a clawing back of money from those families.  It has also been decided not to give a double week payment in September or December, a scheme which was introduced by Fianna Fáil and which proved of great help to those in receipt of unemployment or long-term benefits.  The payment helped at the beginning of the school year and over the Christmas period.  It did not cost much &mdash; about £5 million this year &mdash; and it was not part of our plans to do away with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Calleary referred to the dole for farmers living on small holdings. Effectively that could be described as a subsidy for those living in disadvantaged areas.  It proved of great benefit to many farmers but it is being hit also by the Minister.  I notice that the Minister has not increased the domiciliary care allowance. That allowance has to be treated separately or it will not be included automatically in the provisions covered globally by the Minister.  At this late stage the <Col N="464" /> Minister should reconsider this and provide for an increase, like last year, for those who look after handicapped children and others at home.  They deserve an increase notwithstanding all the difficulties we are told the country is facing. Surely the Government can find it in their hearts to grant an increase to those people.  There is not much money involved.  It should be remembered that when we took office last year those people were not in line for an increase but we altered that situation.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about all the money that will be spent on social welfare this year and one could be led into thinking that those in receipt of those benefits will do very well.  It is worth referring to the rates that will be paid this year.  An old age contributory pensioner, under 80, receives £40.25 and there will be an increase of £4.85.  The widow's contributory pension is only £36.25 per week despite the fact that for the last three years we gave a 25 per cent annual increase.  The basic level of unemployment benefit is £31.65 for a single person and that is to be increased by £3.15. Unemployment assistance for a single person is only £26.25 per week and that person will get the glorious increase of £2.65 to manage in the coming year.  It is important that we keep those increases in mind.  Percentages can be misleading. It is easy for a person on £20,000 per year to talk about percentages because one is dealing with a huge sum of money.  When one refers to percentage increases for those in receipt of social welfare benefits they can be misleading in regard to what will happen to those beneficiaries.  They are in the unfortunate situation that the Government do not have any solution to their problem.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that the Government have difficult problems to deal with but their policies have led to an exacerbation of them.  The Minister told the House that an extra £31 million will be allocated for the unemployed.  It is important to understand what the Minister for Finance was planning in his budget.  He was planning to have more unemployed and there is no doubt that the Government's approach to the economy will result in <Col N="465" /> more unemployment.  That is why the extra £31 million has been provided for. It is part of the Government's plan.  If it is the intention of the Government to plan for unemployment I am sure that in present circumstances they will not have any difficulty getting it.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned that critical studies were being done in regard to short-time working.  That was one of the areas of disincentive which, with the passage of time, had to be dealt with. The question is how far do we go in dealing with it.  Since the Minister is reducing the pay-related benefit to 25 per cent, the three days, plus two days plus the 25 per cent would be a reasonable compromise leaving a reasonable incentive to work.  Fianna Fáil were dealing with those measures in principle but the Bill contains the specific provisions of the Government and that Bill was prepared by the Government.  The Minister should reconsider his decision in regard to those on short-time working.</P>
    <P>By deciding to step back from 12 to 18 days for sickness or unemployment benefit the Minister will save £6 million.  The critical studies in regard to the reduction in pay-related benefit indicated that a reduction from 40 to 30 per cent was appropriate but the Government have reduced it further to 25 per cent.  That is another example of an excessive step being taken by the Government.  That decision will save the Minister £9.4 million. The decision by the Minister to put the date back to 1 July will also result in a saving of £39.3 million.  The Minister has not provided for the double week in September or December and that will mean a saving of £5 million.  Leaving out that saving because it may be introduced later in the year, the Minister will save a total of £60 million.  That amounts to saying that the Government will be harsher than Fianna Fáil had proposed to be to the tune of £60 million.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told the country that the Government have had great success in getting devaluation but the one person who will suffer as a result of such a move without any way of cutting back is the social welfare recipient.  The Minister has told the House that social welfare <Col N="466" /> benefits will cost £1,780 million but that figure is now worth 4 per cent less to the recipients as a result of devaluation. In effect, a total of £70 million has been wiped off the value of that sum overnight. The Taoiseach may express great glee about his achievements in Brussels but the social welfare beneficiaries will not be very happy about them.  Even if the Taoiseach states that the impact on CPI will be about 2 per cent, that, in effect, will mean the wiping off of £35 million in terms of the purchasing power of those people.  That is a severe blow to the old age pensioners, the widows and those who the Minister said may benefit later when the books are checked if things are right.  If the Minister was maintaining the position of those people it would not be too bad but he is reducing their position; he is subjecting them to poverty.  That is a positive move by the Government and we will have clear indications of that later when the reality of the situation is brought home to people.  These are difficult times when difficult things must be done but, notwithstanding that fact, we must ensure that the real value of pensions is maintained and protected against the worst effects of the economic recession.</P>
    <P>Then we have the gross obscenity of a £10 charge per job application in the public service.  The Government may be about to do a U-Turn on this ill-conceived measure which will cause hardship to many people.  Some families have, perhaps, five people unemployed and it could cost them hundreds of pounds to apply for vacancies.  It would be quite impossible for many of them to apply for civil service jobs.  The Government are now trying to blame civil servants, saying that this was a mistake made by them.  I listened to the RTE programme <i>This Week</i> during which the Minister for the Public Service explained all the good reasons for this measure.  As far as the poor, the unemployed and social welfare recipients are concerned, this is a bad measure which can only help to keep them in that state.</P>
    <P>We had a statement from the Minister to the effect that £5 million would be provided for family income supplement. <Col N="467" /> We know they are doing away with the double week and the effect is that those on the lowest level of social welfare are losing £5 million while those on the lowest income levels are to benefit to the extent of £5 million when a system has been worked out.  That problem has yet to be resolved and we must wait to hear what will be done.  It is a bit like the £9.60 which was to come out of one pocket and go into another.</P>
    <P>Another proposal concerns the establishment of a poverty agency.  The Government have done away with the National Community Development Agency for which we had allocated £2.25 million.  The Act establishing this body was passed by the Oireachtas last year and enables the Government to effect any changes they may wish to make in this body.  It is difficult to understand why the Government do not get on with the job of tackling poverty when the measures already exist.  Existing legislation would enable the Government to appoint people to a broadly-based committee.  It is a sad reflection on the Government that they should choose to set this aside. The measures exist in legislation to enable the Government to adjust and adapt the agency as they require and to appoint people who they believe could make a special contribution.  Instead they have decided to establish a poverty agency. The Taoiseach will probably try to get something done in a hurry but the Bill will have to go through both Houses.  If he is genuinely interested in tackling poverty, all the necessary instruments already exist.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the statement of the Minister for Finance that budget improvements in social welfare payments will amount to £80.6 million.  When one examines the budget figures one sees that the allocation published in the 1983 Estimates was £920.826 million and the revised allocation is £941.326 million, the difference being £20.5 million.  In addition we know that £31 million has been taken for unemployment so the net situation is a reduction of £10 million.  This is a case of money going from one pocket to the other.  It is being taken from the <Col N="468" /> pockets of the PRSI subscribers, above what was proposed by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the budget in the context of the economic strategy generally, one sees that this Bill will result in the systematic deprivation of the aged, the handicapped and the unemployed. The rate of VAT is being increased by 5 per cent, fuel is being increased by 5 per cent, inflation will rise by at least 5 per cent, PRSI is increased by 1 per cent and then there is a devaluation of 4 per cent. There is no investment in jobs and no maintenance of tax allowances.  The impact will be much more severe than people realise.</P>
    <P>Then we have the verbal socialists. This is part of the PR lie.  They have captured the poverty propaganda and the poverty lobby.  They say &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;.  They are copying their good friend Margaret Thatcher in her policy in that respect.  Before the election they sold a lie to the nation and misled the electorate.  That is why I readily recognise Deputy Bell's dilemma.  He is a decent man.  He believed the propaganda of Fine Gael and the smoked salmon element of the Labour Party.  He told the electorate that Garret was more compassionate, as the Taoiseach himself said.  He said that Labour in Coalition would ensure that social welfare payments would be maintained.  The stark reality of the Coalition was, however, more than he could stomach.</P>
    <P>The once-proud Labour Party have been led astray by a succession of these pseudo-intellectuals.  I would appeal to the decent members of Labour to allow the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Social Welfare to join Fine Gael and I urge them to get back to protecting the workers and the unprotected. I tell the Labour Party that this will not work.  They should get out now before it is too late.  The Fianna Fáil Party stood their ground and fought the challenge of the media and the manipulations of the multi-nationals and they emerged stronger for it.  The Labour Party should remember their proud heritage and not give in to the temptations of Fine Gael just because they do not happen to like us.  They should not renege on the <Col N="469" /> workers whom they and we in Fianna Fáil represent or truly their party's anthem will become one which is often echoed around the country: &ldquo;The working class can kiss my ass, I've got the foreman's job at last&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>: I hope to say what I wish to say in relation to this Bill within the 30 minutes.  It is very noticeable when a Bill like this comes before the Dáil the vast majority of people look to the Labour Party for protection if the Bill takes away something from them and for support if <Col N="470" /> the Bill gives something to them.  People who never support the Labour Party all look to the Labour Party on a measure such as this for the party's support in ensuring that anything which is aggressive in such a Bill is opposed.  That does not come as a surprise to us because by tradition social policy has been the foremost aspect of our policy.</P>
      <P>People who lose work because of sickness or unemployment should have guaranteed to them an income from the State which will give them the same standard of living they would have if they were at work.  That principle has guided us down through the years.  It has guided us in promoting and implementing improvements in pay-related policy, in instituting and promoting the idea of a pension policy that has pay-related aspects to it.  Our policy has succeeded to a large extent over the years.</P>
      <P>We want to get away from the idea that because people are unfortunate to be out of work in a recession, or to be out of work through no fault of their own, they should have to suffer for it.  There is a mood about, because we have got away from that aspect of the matter over the years, that people who are unemployed are unemployed because of their own fault and they should not find any enjoyment in their unemployment and should be made suffer for it.  There are very few people who find enjoyment in being ill or in being unemployed.  They would swop any pay-related benefit if they had their health back and if they had their jobs back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on the Bill has been simplified by many commentators into those who support a situation where people have more money for being out of work than they would have if they were at work.  This is a complete distortion of the debate on this Bill as far as I am concerned. None of us can stand over such a situation particularly in the extremely difficult times we have at the moment when the very foundation of the social welfare system is under threat because of the reckless policies of the previous Government, their complete mismanagement of the economy and because of the notion that some people have that fair <Col N="471" /> and just social benefits given to people are not right and, according to them, are a disincentive to go out to work.  My full sympathy goes to those who are ill and unable to work as well as those who are thrown out of work because there is no work available for them.  It all goes to the aged, the infirm and those sections in society who have no organisation to protect them and very few to speak for them.</P>
    <P>Many people direct their words to the Labour Party at a time like this but when it comes to the ballot box over 90 per cent of those people do not support Labour Party policies.  We had the example in the last Coalition Government, in which the Labour Party played a major part, when our former leader, Brendan Corish, was Minister for Social Welfare and the present Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Frank Cluskey, was Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare and a great advance was made in the social welfare system during those years.  Schemes were introduced to provide for sections of the community who had nothing to rely on before then.  The increases of 25 per cent mentioned by the previous speaker were first introduced then.  Up to then the increases were paid from a date in July and during that period they were brought back to 1 April by Deputy Frank Cluskey. He got very poor recognition for that work.  He subsequently lost his seat.</P>
    <P>This debate must make people more politically aware of the consequences of the way they vote.  If they want to protect a social welfare system and policy they must vote for people who advocate it and stand for it.  It is a scandal that the economic and financial situation has been brought to the level that people in receipt of social welfare benefit must be asked to pay a contribution towards putting that situation right.  This is a reflection on the previous Government, particularly the policies they pursued over the last few years, when they left the country in such a state that the weaker sections must now carry some of the burden in order to put things right.  If some of the measures contained in this Bill were not taken there possibly would not be any benefits for <Col N="472" /> anybody before the end of this year.  That is a scandalous, shameful situation.  The previous Government must be forever condemned for their recklessness in that regard, for leaving the weaker sections so exposed to this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>I do not like this Bill but I am aware of one of the possible consequences of voting against it.  One of them is that it might allow back the Government responsible for this situation and I would not have it on my conscience that I would do anything in the House that would expose the weaker sections to such danger because of having to introduce a Bill that would take money from some of them that they can ill afford to lose.</P>
    <P>I do not support the present system which allows some people who are unemployed to draw more money than when they would be working.  But this Bill goes further than that.  It takes money from people who have much less than when they were working.  The figures given this evening by the Minister of State, though correct, are selective.  They are based on the most recent pay-related benefit year, but some of the people now on short-time work &mdash; I have proved this in my constituency &mdash; have their benefits calculated on a P60 for the year 1978-79.  There are hundreds of anomalies that have to be tackled, and that is one of them.  If you want to relate benefits to earnings they must be related to up-to-date earnings and not to earnings of four years ago, but unfortunately that is what is happening. Because of the kind of recession we have had in the past number of years many workers who contribute heavily by way of PRSI are never fortunate enough to get any benefits because their benefit year never seems to fall into line with their contribution year: in other words, when they are made unemployed it happens to be either too soon or too late to get real benefit from their PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out other anomalies to the Minister and the Department.  There is a disincentive to work when a person who becomes unemployed has to claim immediately for unemployment benefit. Many workers whom I know are reluctant to claim immediately they become <Col N="473" /> unemployed because they want to try to do something else and they go off to do a little work for themselves for a number of weeks, or months in some cases.  They fail in their efforts and when they make a claim they are caught on their average earnings in the preceding weeks or months.  Such people are heavily penalised, on the one hand because of their attempts to find work and on the other because they did not immediately claim benefit.  That is a built-in disincentive. Workers pay heavily into the PRSI fund and not all of them benefit from it.</P>
    <P>This Bill, which must have been hastily got together, copies in the main the proposals contained in the Fianna Fáil document <i>The Way Forward</i>, with some minor differences.  The major difference is that Fianna Fáil proposed to bring in these changes on 1 January and this Government are making it 1 April. Between now and Committee Stage, and before the Bill has been passed, I will be calling for some changes to be made to ensure that people who are already receiving benefits below their normal wages will not be further penalised by the Bill.  That is my particular plea, the one I want to highlight.  Commentators have been making observations about people who have more benefits unemployed or on short time than when they are working. My concern is for the people who have less benefit than they had when working but who will have to suffer losses of £10 or more per week because of this Bill.  I want something to be done about those people.</P>
    <P>Of course the root cause of this problem, in addition to the recklessness and mismanagement of the previous Government, is that we have not got a fair and just tax system.  There cannot be a proper social welfare system without a proper tax system, and the failure of successive Governments to tackle the tax system must be corrected by the present Government because only then can we achieve a fair social welfare system which cannot be allowed to fluctuate with recessions, good times and bad times.  There must be forward planning to ensure that no matter how bad times become there will be sufficient funds to protect the aged, the <Col N="474" /> sick and the unemployed.  Any further delays in tackling the inequities and injustices in our tax system, and the resulting injustices in the social welfare system, cannot be tolerated.</P>
    <P>If the debate on this Bill does anything it gives us an opportunity to emphasise the urgency about doing something about these two matters.  There is a limit to the patience of our people in this regard, particularly of people who carry a heavy burden.  Those people are prepared to carry the burden if they see it as being just and equitable.  I have not met anybody who is not prepared to carry a fair share of the sacrifices, but when they see themselves carrying a bigger share than others, and in some cases carrying their share and others not carrying any share at all, that gives rise to difficulties.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have a look at the details in the Bill and to consider adjustments that could be made to ensure that benefits will not unduly or unnecessarily be taken from people.  Those who have spoken against this Bill favour the continuance of a system which would give more money to people for not working. I do not want that.  I am speaking against the Bill to point out the inequities in a rushed Bill of this kind, which I admit was forced upon the Government by what the previous Government had done.  It is urgent because, if something is not done, there is a risk that people might be left without their social welfare benefits before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I hope we will get better definitions, and particularly a definition of short-time working.  I know people who are well into their third year on a two-day working week.  They have had smaller incomes over that period.  They did not get national wage increases because they were on a two-day week.  The flat rate for married men with families was near the ceiling of 85 per cent and, when the increases of 25 per cent were given last year and the year before, they did not receive those increases because they lost the pay-related benefit to compensate for the 25 per cent.  It is not good enough that people who have been working a two-day week for two and a half years should suffer a further reduction.  Short-time <Col N="475" /> working is not initiated by workers; it is imposed on them.  Nobody wants it. People prefer to work full time.  I promised I would give ten minutes of my time to my colleague Deputy Bell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>: A Cheann Comhairle, I should like to thank you and Deputy Pattison for affording me this opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is not possible for me to do justice to my attitude to this Bill in the couple of minutes I have.  A number of things should be put on record.  I want to say this to the media. The Irish Transport and General Workers' Union are not responsible for the policy statements I have made on the Social Welfare Bill.  They did not consult with me.  They did not put any pressure on me.  No colleague in the unions is responsible for my position on this Bill.</P>
      <P>I consulted with my constituents, with the branches in County Louth and with the constituency council of the Labour Party.  They and they alone have influenced me, if influencing was necessary. I adopted this position on my own and I am responsible for it.  I have pursued the policies enunciated by the ICTU who represent almost the total workforce.  I make no apology for that.  I have been a trade unionist since I was 16 years of age. I would feel very much ashamed if I came into this House and did not reflect the views of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who represent the organised workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objections to this Bill have been stated publicly.  I have taken exception to it mainly on the basis that I went with my colleagues to Limerick where a document was put before us.  We spent several hours in a hotel outside the conference going through the document item by item and clause by clause.  Our constituency organisations <Col N="476" /> did not tie us on what way we should vote until we had seen and studied that document.  Having studied it in great detail, we decided to vote in favour of it on the recommendation of the party leader.  That agreement was drawn up between our party leader and the Fine Gael Party leader.  I am saying quite clearly in this House that that document is not being honoured.  We have reneged on our colleagues in the Labour Party, the delegates who went to that conference representing the various branches, and the trade unions affiliated to the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I have not got time to go into the details of the agreement and, if necessary, I will do so at a later stage.  It is clear and positive that this Bill is contrary not alone to the letter but also the spirit of the agreement.  It is also contrary to Labour Party policy <i>in toto</i>.  We did not go to any door in County Louth and say we would reduce the level of social welfare benefits. Politicians would be dishonest if they told their constituents they would do certain things and then, within a period of three months, did a U-turn.  In effect that is what this Bill is doing.</P>
    <P>If this Bill goes through, the people of Ireland will not believe any politician.  I am not setting myself up as the saviour of this parliament, but politicians will be doubted for ever and a day if this Bill goes through, as was the case when another Government interfered with social welfare payments many years ago, perhaps even before I was born.  The ghost of that decision is still in Leinster House and the ghost of this Social Welfare Bill will be here years after we have gone.</P>
    <P>Let us take a look at it.  What does it do?  It does more than interfere with short-time working.  The waiting period is extended for 12 days to 18 days.  That will cause a loss.  The rates will be cut from 40 per cent and 30 per cent to 25 per cent and 20 per cent.  The floor for calculating benefit will be raised from £32 to £36 per week.  The ceiling for calculating benefits will go up from £9,500 to £11,000.  The ceiling for contributions will go up from £9,500 to £13,000.  There will be no pay-related benefit at all for <Col N="477" /> short-time workers.  The overall benefit ceiling for disability benefit will go down from 100 per cent to 80 per cent of previous pay.</P>
    <P>The combined effects will mean that from the time this Bill comes into operation a single person will lose £24.21 per week and a married couple with two children will lose £29.07 per week.  I could not be a party to that even if it meant I would never come back to Dáil Éireann, even if it meant I would have no further input into politics, even if it meant I had to go back on the dole myself.  I am speaking as a person who worked a three-day week and queued up for the dole.  Very few Members of this House can say the same.  I know what it is like to be in a dole queue and I know what the people in my constituency feel about it.  I came here to represent their views and that is what I am doing.</P>

      <P>: This Social Welfare Bill will interfere with payments to 9,000 men and over 4,000 women and, in the case of full-time unemployment, 67,000 males and 28,000 females.  At the same time PAYE payers are to be milked for further PRSI and they will get a smaller return.</P>
      <P>I suggest that it should be written into the record of this House that I have grave doubts as to whether this Bill will be legally constituted.  I suggest the House should ask the President to test its constitutionality in the Supreme Court.  You cannot promise people something and take it away from them when they have paid for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>: When the Coalition came together and when the Labour Party took responsibility for certain portfolios many people wondered why they did that.  It was generally expected that in difficult times the portfolios of Health, Social Welfare, Environment, Labour, and Trade, Commerce and Tourism would give the Labour Party an opportunity of doing three things, namely, maintaining the living standards of the people, providing <Col N="478" /> a framework for employment opportunities for young people and the protection of the less well-off through the social welfare system.  The supporters of the Labour Party generally believed that was the reason that party selected the portfolios in question.  However, it has not worked out like that under any of the three headings.</P>
      <P>One has to go through the three headings to realise how the Labour Party have not carried out the promises they gave to the small percentage of people who supported them.  Deputy Pattison said that over 90 per cent of the people do not support the Labour Party at the polls.  I think the Deputy realises now how the small percentage who support the party will be affected by the actions of the party.  The Labour Party have sold the soul of their party in supporting and, which is even more serious, promoting this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Pattison has accepted that the weaker sections should be asked to pay a big share of what is necessary and this is a major step for any Labour Deputy to take.  The Deputy has said that he does not like the Bill and that he wants to bring forward amendments.  However, he is not being consistent when he tells us he feels obliged to support the Bill.  There has been much double talk by the Labour Party on this matter but they are nailing their colours to the mast on this occasion. They can no longer promote themselves as the supporters of socialist policy.  They are accepting the monetarist attitude dictated to them by the major party in Coalition and they are following slavishly every measure promoted by that majority party.  It is rather unedifying for the people, and particularly for those who regarded the Labour Party as in some way supporting socialist policy, to see a senior Labour representative in Government as the person singled out to bring to this House the most difficult and serious imposition ever perpetrated against the working classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as maintaining living standards is concerned, since the Government came to office all their actions have brought down the living standards of our people.  We have higher inflation and <Col N="479" /> higher interest rates, uncontrolled prices, tax hikes and levies introduced on a scale never before contemplated by any Government.  There are also service charges pending.  There has been a whole litany of increases.  This is what the people are getting from the Labour section in Coalition.</P>
    <P>With regard to providing a framework for creating job opportunities, they have failed miserably also.  They have virtually destroyed the competitiveness of Irish exports.  In the budget there has not been one single incentive for manufacturing industry that would give an opportunity to the young people seeking employment. In the budget strategy there is nothing about creating the 300,000 jobs necessary in the next ten years.  Every day there are closures in manufacturing industry and an increasing number of redundancies.  In one area that might have provided an opportunity for job promotion, the capital expenditure programme, there has been a drastic cut of the order of £220 million.  That is the response from a Government in which the Labour Party are participating.  That is what the young people see happening so far as job creation is concerned.</P>
    <P>The only answer the Minister for Social Welfare could give on Second Stage of this Bill was that he would provide an extra £31 million in respect of unemployment benefit for the rest of this year.  This was an acceptance by him that there will be more than 200,000 people unemployed by the end of the year.  An average of 193,000 people unemployed must mean that we will have nearly 250,000 unemployed before the end of the year. That was the only item the Minister could offer in an effort to appease those who will not be able to find work before the end of the year.  It is almost inconceivable that the Labour Party could tolerate such an attitude and that they could allow such a strategy, if there was such a thing, to be put forward in the budget.  It is inconceivable that they did not insist on a plan that might create the necessary employment, in support of the package agreed between the parties in Government at the meeting held last year in Limerick. <Col N="480" /> Why are the Labour Party agreeing with the notion that there is no other answer? Of course there is and many people have put forward positive suggestions, but all we have received with regard to this Bill and the budget has been a negative attitude towards the economy and towards the wishes of the vast majority of the people.  They have failed also to protect the less well-off and those on social welfare.</P>
    <P>One would think that in times of hardship the need was even greater to provide extra assistance for the weaker sections. We must understand that the old age pensioners are not organised.  They are not people who find it possible to march in the streets in support of claims.  They have not the strongest lobby here.  However, they believed there was one small party who were supposed to represent the views of the hard-pressed section of the community whose purchasing power has been seriously eroded by the effects of the budget in addition to the provisions in this Bill.  It makes a nonsense of the claim that the Coalition Government are anti-poverty.  The document agreed by the parties in Government in Limerick stated that an anti-poverty plan would be drawn up.  Certainly there is need for that because the Government, by their actions with regard to this Bill, will create poverty that will become endemic before too long.</P>
    <P>The Government ask us where would we find the money to accommodate the necessary increases which we say should be given to social welfare beneficiaries. I say there was one way they could have found at least £38½ million and that was to relieve the burden that will be placed on consumers of electricity because of the increase in the price of the therm of natural gas from 16.9p to 24p from 1 April.  That money, which is being surreptitiously brought into the Exchequer coffers, should be applied to relieve this area of hardship.  The money that will be sucked into the coffers of the Exchequer will be in excess of £100 million because of the latest measures adopted by this Government.  If there had been a genuine care by certain elements in the Government to apply the benefits of that natural <Col N="481" /> resource to the less well off, that could have been done.  It would be appropriate in the present hard times to use a natural resource for their benefit.</P>
    <P>Other strategies could have been adopted by the Coalition if they had the will and the interest to protect those whom they continually preach they are committed to support and help.  We will have to take due note of precisely what was agreed in Limerick.  Deputy Bell has castigated his own colleagues in the Labour Party because of the stand they have taken and he has virtually called it a dishonest stand.  He says the arrangement entered into in Limerick is not being honoured.  One has only to glance casually at the section dealing with social welfare to understand what he means.  It says, amongst other things, that the establishment of a commission on social welfare must not be a barrier to immediate, necessary changes in the social welfare system.  How can this Bill be reconciled to that simple statement as agreed between the two Coalition partners?</P>
    <P>It also said that unemployment and disability benefit would be kept in line with take home wages and salaries.  That was a bald statement saying that the workers would not be seriously disadvantaged if the Coalition came to power.  The provisions as set out in the agreement in Limerick are in direct conflict to what is stated in the Bill.  Nobody who is a genuine supporter of that agreement can say it is being honoured either in the letter or the spirit.  It also says that expenditure will be maintained in the light of inflation. That has not been honoured either, because the Government accept that inflation will rise by a few more percentage points and because of the events of the last few days.  Consequently, the measures in this Bill do not meet even the cost of living in so far as inflation is concerned under the new arrangements. It also says the living standards of the sections of the community dependent on social welfare payments will be maintained. How can any signatory to that agreement say that the living standards of the weaker sections of the community are being protected by any of the measures contemplated in this Bill?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> I take issue with the date of payments of the new increases.  While it is going to be 10 per cent for short-term and 12 per cent for long-term beneficiaries, we should realise that these percentages are not strictly accurate because they apply from the last week in June and the first week in July.  By doing simple arithmetic, it is clear that the 10 per cent becomes about 7½ per cent and the 12 per cent becomes 9 per cent.  These figures are, in effect, much lower than the inflation rate which has been accepted and agreed by the leaders of the Coalition parties, at around 12 per cent for the rest of this year.  They are running directly contrary to the section of the Limerick agreement which stated that they would be maintained as far as inflation was concerned for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>We must also add to that the question of devaluation which is mentioned as being 2 per cent.  We all know that devaluation, which it is claimed will work well for the Irish economy, will have grave disadvantages.  The Government were forced into the position which they took in the past few days because the official attitude was against devaluation.  I am concerned about the infiltration and penetration it will have on the price structure and the further hardship which will be inflicted on the less well-off members of the community.  We are getting the worst of both worlds because it is obvious from today's movement in the monetary system that our pound is rising against sterling which is weakening further in the international market.  Consequently in a few short weeks we could be in a very bad position once more.  Who are the sufferers in all these matters?  They are those who do not have the lobby to protect themselves, the weaker members of society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison said he could not understand how any Deputy would support unemployed workers being paid in excess of their normal take home pay. This side of the House are in total agreement that that should not be so.  However, we also made it clear that we were not going to so depress the incomes of those receiving unemployment benefits that they would be seriously affected by <Col N="483" /> the reduction of their PAYE and pay-related. That was never intended.  We would not condemn those who were sick to being unable to meet their normal expenditure.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that you get no pay-related if you are unfortunate enough to be ill for four weeks, apart from benefit for two days.  How does one meet the normal costs of a household for three-and-a-half weeks while one suffers the minimum rates?  Go into debt?  Then, when one is fortunate enough to be able to return to work, are the next 12 months to be spent trying to recover the loss of the month when payments were not made?  That was never intended by the Fianna Fáil administration.  We support the idea that people should not carry home more when they are ill than if they were working but I can tell the Minister that the wage packets in the first and second week of April will be open sesame as far as the workers are concerned and to the evil, as a Deputy said, that is being perpetrated against them in this Bill.  They will then see the full impact of the measures contemplated against them. When they see all the deductions, PRSI, income tax, levies, indirect tax, motoring costs and the whole price structure that has gone out of control in the last couple of months, they will see how little take home pay they have.  It will then be evident what the Government had in mind when they brought in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>This is a three way split as far as the Coalition are concerned.  It started with the budget and its provisions, was followed by the Social Welfare Bill and, before very long, the next piece in the jig-saw, the Finance Bill will show that it was intended to take asunder the living standards of our people.  When the lack of price control is added to the movement against the workers then you will realise what is in the minds of the Government.</P>
    <P>I want to pay some attention to a section of the Bill which has a very big bearing on the farming community which I am happy to represent.  It has to be taken in conjunction with the Budget Statement and the provisions of the Finance <Col N="484" /> Bill which will be introduced shortly.  The intention with regard to farmers' taxation is mischievous because it is trying to get the general public to believe that the farming community can afford to play a much bigger role as far as taxation is concerned than they are capable of doing.  The administrative costs of collecting any extra tax will far outweigh the return they will get.  They are forcing large numbers of small farmers to take their places in the queues in accountancy offices.  These farmers have not got the resources to generate the wealth which would require them to pay income tax. That legislation will act as a disincentive to production, especially in the west.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the question of small farmers' dole.  An attempt has been made to sell the idea that there is wholesale abuse of that system.  Let me be the first to say that that is not so.  Of the small farmers gaining that assistance the vast majority are doing it in accordance with the regulations.  If the regulations need to be changed, that is one thing; but to suggest that the smallholders, particularly in the disadvantaged areas in the west, are somehow abusing this scheme wholesale is totally incorrect.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Social Welfare have difficulty in so far as land valuations are concerned in allowing the notional system to continue, they have put nothing in its place.  It was not proper to use this device to withdraw support from the smallholders in the west.  I see no difficulty at all in using the land valuation system as a measurement for giving out benefits.  If there is difficulty in collecting tax, that is another matter; but there is nothing wrong in using it as a system in so far as qualification for benefit is concerned.</P>
    <P>Small farmers' dole is misnamed and misunderstood.  It should have been called &ldquo;smallholders' income supplement in disadvantaged areas&rdquo; because that is what it is.  It is applied to areas that are seriously disadvantaged and recognised both nationally and internationally to be so, not just so far as geography and inaccessibility are concerned but also in regard to population and the services.  It would be much better if the Labour Party <Col N="485" /> were discriminating positively in favour of the disadvantaged areas.  These disadvantaged areas are recognised by the EEC as in need of special support as we have seen in the western package, western development of all kinds, headage grant payments and so on.  People seem to recognise that there is a disadvantage in certain farming areas and they have given wholeheartedly to alleviate that disadvantage.  This Government now say that that is not so and they are putting in jeopardy the whole principle regarding the disadvantaged farming areas.

      <P>: I suggest to Deputy Flynn that to give the leader of his party and the Minister a full half hour, as was anticipated, he might consider concluding at 5.45 p.m.  If he does that, Deputy Haughey will have half an hour and there will be half an hour for the Minister.  If he does not, there will be some sort of hassle.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of that assistance is misunderstood.  It was introduced originally at a time of total depression in the smallholding situation in the west of Ireland.  The whole farm structure of the west needed reorganisation.  Emigration was endemic to the area.  We had poor housing throughout the whole disadvantaged area.  No jobs were available there and living standards were at a very low ebb.  The farming resource in the area was incapable of development and increased productivity without the financial support that would give those living in that disadvantaged area as reasonable a chance of a decent living as those in other parts of the country.  That was the reason this was brought in under the notional system.  The factual system has always acted as a disincentive to development and has penalised the efforts of <Col N="486" /> those willing to put their best foot forward and get the best development they could from very sparse resources.</P>
    <P>Unemployment assistance in those areas stabilised the population, as is evident from the last census.  For the first time in a century the population has been established in those disadvantaged areas. That assistance helped the people living in those areas enormously to educate their children and to get a better opportunity of a decent way of living.  It increased the productivity from that disadvantaged part of the country.  It encouraged farmers who were not afraid through a means test to utilise the full resources made available to them, either through their own endeavours or through the miserable assistance given by way of unemployment benefit, to get the best out of their meagre homes.  Now we are getting back to the age of the gauger. That gauger in the past dealt with pennies. Nothing runs more contrary to the Irish people than the means test and here it is being brought back.  Neighbours will be asked to inform on their friends, to give details to the gauger so that he can establish precisely what one has as against the other and thereby reduce or keep entirely from people the assistance to which they are entitled.  We do not want the stigma of the means test brought back to the disadvantaged areas in the west.</P>
    <P>This Bill lacks any humanity in dealing with those living in those areas.  It shows no initiative whatsoever in proper planning or a proper strategy of dealing with the less fortunate.  One would think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is no universal approach in paying unemployment assistance to young people.  We all know that the maximum rate in the urban areas is £26.25, but I have yet to meet an individual who gets the full amount.  When you consider the kind of arithmetic that is done regarding board and lodging estimates you can run into a situation such as I have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He seems to have some kind of strategy for depopulating the disadvantaged areas in the west.  If the policy is to keep people on the land and give them an opportunity to develop, the policy document laid out in this Social Welfare Bill is not the way to do it.  The Minister's attitude towards the west, not just in this Social Welfare Bill but in many other <Col N="489" /> instances also, shows that he is not attuned to the needs of the disadvantaged either in this part of the country or any other part.

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The first thing that should be remembered about this Bill is that it comes at the most difficult time economically in the history of this State.  Many Opposition speakers have chided the Government for the manner in which they have gone about rectifying the problems of the country.  Every Member of the House should be honest and accept that at some stage along the road it was necessary to take stock of the situation and be honest with the public in letting them know the true facts.  That was done by the Minister in this Bill and by the Minister for Finance in the budget.</P>
      <P>The difficulties are numerous but the problems have not arisen in the recent past &mdash; they have been with us for some time.  They have now reached such astronomic proportions as to make it difficult for our economy to survive in the foreseeable future.  The Minister for Social Welfare has a very difficult task.  As a public representative and a member of a health board I am only too well aware of the problems facing the lower paid sectors of our community &mdash; the poor, the sick, the invalids and so forth.  It behoves us all to ensure that their needs are catered for as far as possible, particularly in times of economic stringency.  We all agree that every possible step should be taken to ensure that those sectors of the community are not asked to bear unnecessarily the burdens facing the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Opposition Members have <Col N="490" /> described the budget as savage and the Bill as uncaring.  I ask them to desist from those emotive expressions in these difficult times.  Such expressions only tend to mislead the people even further and I contend that they have been sufficiently misled up to now.  Any further progression along that road can only further complicate the issues.  While, on the one hand, the Bill does not provide everything that we would all have liked in this financial year, it goes some way towards assisting those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>References have been made to areas in which there would appear to be a reduction in the amount being made available to those on short-term unemployment.  I ask the Minister to ensure that in genuine cases the supplementary benefits section of the various health boards be instructed to examine these cases individually and that care be taken that they do not suffer unnecessarily as a result of measures which must be taken in order to protect the economy.  Some Opposition speakers have suggested that the Bill in itself is an acceptance of certain failures in the economy and that the Ministers were anticipating higher unemployment. However, this was a positive way to go about it, given the current situation.  The Minister has provided an extra £30 million plus in anticipation &mdash; according to Opposition Members&mdash;of further unemployment. What should he have done? Should he have provided nothing and allowed an increased deficit at the end of the year for which no provision was made, as has been the practice in the past?  It was far more positive to make the provision now and accept that the trends which have prevailed for the past two or three years, if allowed to continue in the next 12 months, would only lead to an increase in the number of unemployed.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention by workers on numerous occasions that those who work a full five-day week are unfairly discriminated against by virtue of the fact that those on short-time working are able to take home more at the weekends than they.  They said there was little incentive for people to work and certainly little incentive with regard to <Col N="491" /> work which included overtime if those on short time received more in take-home pay.  Other speakers could suggest that in harsh times such as these it was unfortunate that cuts should be introduced in that area, and I would accept that it is unfortunate. I also must point out that in order to be honest with ourselves all parties should ask themselves whether it is good for the country to have a situation in which a person on short time can receive more in payment than one employed on a full five-day week.  In our current economic position nothing could justify that situation.  As I have said, I would hope that in genuine cases where it might appear that hardship could be caused to people on unemployment assistance for some considerable time, particularly those with families, the Minister might instruct the health boards to take particular account of their situation to ensure that the hardship did not bear too heavily on that sector.  Any Government must be concerned in such situations, and I certainly would be most concerned, that this line of action be taken and that the Minister issue those instructions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn spoke at length on the ills of coalition.  He expressed on numerous occasions the belief that we on this side of the House would not fulfil our election promises.  Other speakers said that perhaps the public would condemn politicians of all colours and creeds for failing to deliver on election promises. One thing must be remembered: When this Government came into office they assumed a particular state of affairs.  Certain information was available to them. The budget and the Social Welfare Bill now presented are the best possible under the circumstances.  The Government could have embarked on a policy of further foreign borrowing to provide for services such as social welfare and many others, but all that money would have to be paid back.  They could have embarked on a policy over the next four or five years where there would be no hardship to anybody.  Such policies were pursued over the last five years.  The people were told that we could borrow money for investment purposes while, in fact, we <Col N="492" /> were forced to divert our borrowings to meet current expenditure.  We could continue to tell the people these things.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that our unemployment figures are heading towards 200,000 and taking into account the policies pursued over the past number of years, could we expect the present Government to continue along that road, following the same trends and at the end of four or five years have an unemployment figure of 400,000?  I do not think anybody could expect the Government to do that because while it might be good to pursue that line in the short term, at the end of the day somebody would have to pay and the price then would be much higher than it is now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn suggested that the Government were responsible for higher inflation.  I have to take issue with him on that, particularly having regard to the inflation rates over the past few years.  If the people who elect us to this House think carefully they must arrive at the conclusion that their elected representatives will stand up and take decisions in the interests of the country, and particularly in the long-term interests of the country.  Nobody will thank any Deputy who suggests that the people can live free and easy for a little longer, that we can borrow more, that we will not have to repay it and that at the end of the day everything will be all right.  The public have copped on; they have had enough. They are looking for realism and that is why they voted a Coalition Government into office.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the number of young people unemployed.  The Minister allocated a sum of £31 million for the contingency that there might be an increase in unemployment.  It is soul destroying that young, highly qualified people leaving school do not have jobs.  The longer this situation continues the more contempt young people will have for politicians.  It is imperative that we address ourselves to our young people and tell them nothing is free, that the country is facing an economic crisis and that all these services which we said were provided free, were not free, but had to be paid for by the <Col N="493" /> taxpayers, by either direct or indirect taxation. Money borrowed abroad for capital investment purposes or for current expenditure also has to be paid for, ultimately by those who are employed and, unfortunately, by the unemployed because there will be less money accruing from the tax paying public as there are fewer people at work.</P>
    <P>Some Opposition Deputies referred to the Minister's negative attitude to this Bill and accused him of being uncaring. The increases may not be as high as they might have been and they will not be paid in April, as was usual but there was a very good reason for that: there was not sufficient money.  Those who say that should have been done might tell us what taxes might be levied to ensure that the money needed would be available.  They might suggest that VAT could have been increased from an earlier date, but there are many areas where Opposition Deputies might have suggested we raise further revenue, or further borrowing, to provide the services we all strive to provide but which we cannot afford at this time.</P>
    <P>The people, employed and unemployed, asked to be told the truth and be given the full facts.  Whatever needs to be done I believe they are prepared to do it. They are prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to make the country competitive and back to work.  Having regard to the very serious state of the economy every politician should use his influence to ensure that the public do not get the impression that there is an easy way out. There is no easy way out except to postpone for a little while longer making difficult decisions.</P>
    <P>Some Opposition Deputies suggested that they would have done things differently, that they would have shown more feeling.  They should remember that they introduced cuts in the health services during the summer of 1982.  Not a great deal of feeling was shown by them then. As a member of a health board I was astounded at that time to think that a party who had earlier that year indicated that the policies pursued by a previous Coalition Government were not feasible and were too harsh, could have done things differently.  It was proved that they <Col N="494" /> could not even do it as well.  To illustrate that point one had only to compare the deficit at the end of the year with that projected at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>As politicians we have a serious responsibility to the public who elected us to tell them the truth.  They should know that if we are to provide services they must be paid for, because if they are not paid for out of taxpayers' money, we will have to borrow, and all borrowing has to be repaid sooner or later.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not go as far as one would wish but there are extenuating circumstances. These are that the time has been reached when everyone must examine his conscience and ask himself whether the country can afford the extent of the services that are provided and whether we can continue to expand those services without increasing taxation or without increasing our borrowing.  I suggest that the answer is in the negative.  I should be surprised if in four or five years time the people were not thanking this Coalition for at least having charted the course that will get us out of our difficulties and for having set out the realities instead of leading the people along a blind path.  The people must be told that we cannot postpone our difficulties any further.  As politicians we would be less than honest if we were to conceal the facts.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have suggested that an additional £200 million might have been provided in the interest of reducing considerably the unemployment level and of improving the economy generally.  That would be all right if the money were provided for investment purposes. All of us welcome any attempt to reduce unemployment but one must realise that all attempts in this area in the past couple of years seem to have failed. Consequently, one must conclude that the policies pursued in the past number of years were very wrong because otherwise we would not be in the stark situation in which we are now, in a situation in which we are bringing in a social welfare Bill that does not meet out requirements. However, at least some attempt is being made to cushion the lower-paid <Col N="495" /> sections against the harsh and difficult times in which we live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I spoke earlier of the responsibility of all of us here.  A few weeks ago we talked in the House about Dáil reform.  I realise that it would not be appropriate at this point to go back on that debate but I wish merely to say that reform of the Dáil will never become a reality unless all of us, whether in Government or in Opposition, accept that at all times we should address ourselves to the public, tell them the facts and allow them to judge the situation for themselves. Having listened to some of the speakers to this debate in recent days one can only conclude that the general impression the public would get is that if the people on the other side of the House were in Government everything would be very different and that the increases in social welfare would be much higher regardless of the country's ability to foot the bill.  The Opposition have given the impression also that if they were in office the situation in relation to short-time working would have remained as it was and that generally the public would not have to face up to the unfortunate realities. That is a dangerous attitude to adopt because we are faced with a situation in which almost 200,000 people are unemployed of whom a large number are young people and who can see at this stage that there is no prospect of gainful employment for them in the foreseeable future.  That has been the position for the <Col N="496" /> past couple of years but there would be a grave danger in any political party telling those people that the situation is other than that presented by this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The greatest disservice we could do to our unemployed and especially to our unemployed young people would be to con them into believing that there would be a dramatic change in the situation if another party were in office.  It is of the utmost importance that everyone in our community should recognise the reality of the situation and understand that whichever party happen to be in power must pursue the type of financial policies that are being pursued now.  This seems to be the only way out of our present difficulties.</P>
      <P>I trust that at the end of the year the measures taken by the Minister will prove to have been sufficient to meet the needs of the lower paid and the under-privileged and that the general thrust of our financial policies will have gone a long way towards resolving the difficulties that were not faced up to in the past number of years.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: This Social Welfare Bill confronts every Deputy in this House <Col N="497" /> with a far-reaching decision, a clear-cut policy decision which will directly affect the weekly household budgets and the standard of living of thousands of lower income families.  It is neither emotional nor an exaggeration to say that the standard of the meals, clothing, heating and other comforts provided in thousands of homes will be actually lowered if this Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>The vote we are about to take is not about accepting or not accepting the realities of our present economic situation or acknowledging that the country faces economic and financial difficulties.  There is no argument about the existence of these difficulties.  Instead the decision we are about to take is concerned with the manner in which those difficulties should be tackled, where the savings and cutbacks are going to be made and, above all, who will be affected by them.  Basically what we will decide shortly is whether a disproportionate share of the burden will be placed on the shoulders of the poorest and weakest sections of our community.</P>
      <P>We in Fianna Fáil are putting it clearly to the House, and particularly to the Labour Party, that this Bill should be rejected because it breaches a principle to which all parties in this House have until this day fully subscribed.  That principle is to the effect that there is an obligation on the State to protect the poorer and weaker sections of our community and not in any way deliberately to disimprove their position.  This Bill directly and deliberately flouts that basic principle, not inadvertently, unintentionally or as a side effect, but clearly and directly. It proposes, in a calculated manner &mdash; by specific percentages and definite amounts of money &mdash; to reduce the living standards of pensioners, widows, the unemployed and people on a three-day week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe this Bill must be rejected on seven separate and distinct but related grounds.  I shall spell them out concisely so that not alone will every Deputy know what he is voting for if he votes for this Bill but, equally important, so that the public will know and that in particular the constituents of Deputies Toddy <Col N="498" /> O'Sullivan, Eileen Desmond, Séamus Pattison, Seán Tracey, Frank McLoughlin and yourself, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, will know exactly how their Deputies voted in Dáil Éireann this evening on these specific issues I am about to enumerate. By the way, it is interesting that none of the Deputies to whom I am addressing myself are at present in the House but perhaps they are listening on the monitors and will take note of what I say.</P>
    <P>There are seven reasons for rejecting this Bill.  Those seven reasons are: first, because the increase in the general social welfare rates provided in the Bill are completely inadequate in present circumstances; secondly, because those increases will come into operation only from July and not, as heretofore, from April; thirdly, the Bill will reduce the amount of pay-related benefit payable to an unemployed man or woman by 15 per cent; fourthly, the waiting period of an unemployed man or woman before becoming entitled to receive pay-related benefit is being extended from two weeks to three weeks; fifthly, those who are compelled, through no fault of their own, to work a three-day week will have pay-related benefit removed completely while they are on a three-day week; sixthly, because it is proposed that PAYE employees will now pay PRSI on incomes up to £13,000 while benefits will be restricted to incomes of up to £11,000; seventhly, because this Bill will abolish the notional system of assessment for small western farmers for social welfare purposes, a system which has enormously benefited the whole community structure of life in the west.  Those are seven good reasons for rejecting this Bill.  Taken together they amount to a penal imposition that no amount of waffling in this House can conceal on the lower income section of our community, the section least able to bear that imposition.</P>
    <P>Let me say a word about those general increases in social welfare rates.  There is absolutely no doubt, it is a mathematical certainty that the rates now proposed will actually reduce the income and standard of living of every single person in receipt of social welfare benefit.  They are stated <Col N="499" /> to be 10 per cent and 12 per cent.  In fact they amount to only 7½ per cent and 9 per cent because, by a mean little device, they are not going to be paid until the end of June or beginning of July next. Therefore, if one spreads them over the whole of the year, from April 1983 to December 1983, they work out at 7½ per cent and 9 per cent, and that against a rate of inflation which will certainly be 12 per cent and probably more.  Therefore it is an inescapable mathematical certainty that everybody in receipt of social welfare benefits, and relying on them, in 1983 will have his standard of living positively reduced by the provisions of this Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>When we were preparing the Estimates and working towards the budget we had in mind always somewhere in the region of 15 per cent as an increase appropriate to social welfare recipients this year. Instead of that these increased rates work out at 7½ per cent and 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I should like to point out to this House about these rates.  The Government's devaluation of the punt will add 2 per cent to the rate of inflation. The Taoiseach has tried to claim that the Government had planned that devaluation for many months.  Does that mean, therefore, that at the time of the budget the Government were planning devaluation, which would add 2 per cent to our rate of inflation, and concealed that fact from this House and from the general public when putting the budget through the House, in fact ignored that 2 per cent and clearly set down inadequate rates of increases for social welfare recipients because of that 2 per cent, apart from any other consideration?  The Taoiseach and the Government cannot have it both ways.  Either they knew at the time of the budget that there was going to be devaluation and ignored the 2 per cent inflation rise that that would cause or, alternatively, at the time of the budget they had no idea &mdash; which I think is the true position &mdash; they were going to devalue.</P>
    <P>For instance, let me ask Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan directly if he is going to stand for this sort of treatment being meted out to the people in his constituency, the <Col N="500" /> pensioners, the unemployed and all those other categories?  Is he going to come into this House this evening and positively vote to lower the living standards of those people in Gurranebraher, Knocknaheeny, Farranree and the people he represents in Cork?  Or is Deputy Eileen Desmond, a former Minister for Health and Social Welfare, going to come in here &mdash; knowing exactly what is involved &mdash; and vote for this positive, specific lowering of the standards of living of that vulnerable section of our community?  Might I ask you &mdash; I am sorry, I see the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is no longer in the Chair &mdash; I would like to ask Deputy John Ryan because when I started to speak he was in the Chair, is he going to vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: He is not in the Chair now so we are not involving him.  But I want to ask him &mdash; he is probably listening to me on the monitor &mdash; is he, representing a constituency which includes Thurles and Nenagh in particular, going to vote to take a full 15 per cent from pay-related benefit for the unemployed men and women who have to try to live on the amount of those benefits when they are unfortunate enough to become unemployed?</P>
      <P>I should like to ask Deputy Pattison if he is going to vote deliberately to increase the period an unemployed man or woman has to wait for pay-related benefit from two weeks to three weeks.  Is my old friend and colleague, Deputy Treacy, going to vote to take pay-related benefit away altogether from those who happen to be unfortunate enough to work for a firm that must put workers on a three-day week through no fault of their own? Is that what Deputy Treacy of the Labour Party is going to do this evening by voting for this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to specifically put those questions to the Members of the Labour Party who are free to decide, other than the two Members who have already taken an honourable decision in this regard.  I know it is no good appealing to the Members <Col N="501" /> of the Labour Party who are in Government because they will stay in Government no matter what happens to the old age pensioners, the unemployed, the widows and those who must rely on social welfare benefits for their standard of living.  There is no way that the Labour Ministers in the Government are going to do anything to help those people in this Bill.  Those decisions face the Labour Members I have referred to.  I should like to tell those Members that they are the key people in the House this evening. From time to time in the affairs of the House the spotlight focuses on one individual or group of individuals.  From time to time people hold the key to a situation in their hands and it is those Labour Members I have mentioned &mdash; Deputies Seamus Pattison, John Ryan, Sean Treacy, Toddy O'Sullivan, Eileen Desmond and Frank MacLoughlin &mdash; who hold the key to the situation this evening.  I do not have to remind them of the promises they made to their electorate and the social concern they have displayed so often in the House.  Their constituents will remember the promises they made and the things they said and they will be asking them questions when they go back.  Their constituents will ask them: Did you really vote to take 15 per cent off pay-related benefit?  Did you vote to take pay-related benefit away from a man or woman who is on a three-day week?  Did you really vote to extend the waiting period as far as pay-related benefits for an unemployed man or woman is concerned from two weeks to three weeks?</P>
    <P>The constituents of those Members will put such questions to them.  It is their decision.  On this side of the House we cannot compel those Members to stand by their principles.  We can only appeal to them to do so.  I want them to know exactly what they are doing by voting for the Bill, if they are going to vote for it. There is no room for a misunderstanding or a fudging of the issue or talking about economic or financial policies.  This is a clear-cut issue and for them this is the moment of truth.  The seven reasons I have given for them for voting against the Bill are clearly identifiable.  This is a savage <Col N="502" /> measure that will bring hardship and deprivation to a big number of Irish families. Those Labour Deputies either vote for that hardship and deprivation or they reject the Bill.  The choice is theirs, and the country is watching.  I want them to know and understand that the country is watching and their own supporters and party activitists in their constituencies are watching them to see what they are going to do on this measure.  I want to tell them finally that they can still stand by those who in all good faith elected them as Labour Deputies or they can walk away from them this evening and vote for this repressive measure brought in by this Fine Gael dominated Coalition Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: On a personal note I should like to thank Deputy O'Hanlon, and the other Deputies, for their good wishes for my success in this portfolio.  I should like to congratulate Deputy O'Hanlon on his appointment to his party's Front Bench and I look forward to mutual co-operation during our term of office.  With regard to the contribution by Deputy Haughey, my personal and official comment must commence at this stage. Frankly, this is yet again a classical example of cynical political opportunism which, with respect, the Leader of the Opposition has epitomised in his role in Irish politics in the last decade.  I say that because there is no reduction in the Bill in relation to old age pensions, contributory or non-contributory.  There is no reduction, as implied by Deputy Haughey, in retirement pensions, invalidity pensions, disability pensions, widows' pensions or in the ordinary rates of unemployment or disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supplement to disability benefit this year will cost £17 million and the supplement to maternity benefit will be £7 million while the supplement to unemployment benefit will be £37 million, making a total of £61 million of supplements on top of our flat rate benefits.  As Deputy Haughey is aware, such benefits were abolished in Britain in July 1981. They are still here and will be retained. All that has happened is that we have <Col N="503" /> said, in accordance with <i>The Way Forward</i>, that disability benefit payment should not exceed a ceiling of 80 per cent as against 100 per cent at present.  Deputy Haughey is well aware of that.  In relation to unemployment benefit we are saying that the ceiling should not exceed the current rate of 85 per cent, which is there and remains.  In relation to short-time workers we are saying that the replacement of earnings ratio should not exceed 94:93 per cent whereas it is currently around 120:114 per cent.</P>
    <P>The reality is that on the social insurance side no less than 371,000 people will receive increases of 10 to 12 per cent as and from the last week of June and 285,000 dependants of such recipients will also receive benefits.  Under the social insurance system no less than £50 million of increased benefits will be paid out as and from the last week of June to 655,000 persons.  On the social assistance side, which is wholly paid for by the Exchequer, 251,000 people on social assistance plus another 248,000 dependants will receive a distribution of Exchequer resources of £31 million.  The total payment from the Exchequer this year of increases in social welfare will amount to £80.6 million.  Deputy Haughey would wish it to be much more and he glibly spoke of 15 per cent from 1 April, but he made no comment whatever about the total failure on his part to provide in his Estimates last year for any provision for such increases, increases which would have required additional expenditure of £70 million of social welfare in 1983 if we were to accede to his request.  This would have meant borrowing abroad or cutting expenditure.  For example, £70 million is the total expenditure this year alone on food subsidies and I am sure Deputy Haughey would not wish Labour Deputies to suggest that we should withdraw food subsidies.</P>
    <P>Some of the hypocrisy I have listened to tonight is indicative of the decline of Fianna Fáil in relation to social policy. Deputy Woods, my immediate predecessor, went one further and stated that whereas the budget improvements in social welfare were stated to cost £80.6 <Col N="504" /> million in 1983, the allocation for social welfare was increased by only about £24.5 million, from £920 million to £940 million.  Deputy Woods is under a classic Deputy Woods misapprehension.  The amount of £941 million is the pre-budget allocation, not the current budget allocation. Deputy Woods has forgotten his budget arithmetic after only six or seven weeks out of office.  The original allocation was £920 million and on top of that I had to provide and obtain from the Government an extra £31 million for social welfare unemployment benefits because Deputy Woods and the Fianna Fáil Party provided in their budget deficit for an average this year of 177,000 people out of work.</P>
    <P>We came into office in December and when we looked at this matter in January it was manifestly evident that the provision in the original Book of Estimates was wholly inadequate and that we would have to provide for an annual monthly average of no less than 193,000 unemployed. This meant that without any question of seeking social welfare increases we needed an extra £31 million to pay for ordinary basic social welfare rates at the rate of April 1982.  There was no provision made for this in a Fianna Fáil budget because Deputy Haughey was otherwise engaged at Cabinet level, as was Deputy Woods.  We incorporated this £31 million in the Estimate.  We had to reduce pay-related benefit by about £7 million and the overall revised Estimate worked out at £941 million.  On top of that figure we added £80.6 million for social welfare incrases, bringing the revised budget estimate this year to £1,026,926.  Deputy Woods is somewhat dated in his criticism.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Haughey's suggestion that the people of the Republic of Ireland will suffer massively in terms of our social welfare system and his implication that we are in the process of dismantling social welfare after a couple of months in office, I would point out to him &mdash; and I am sure he takes a great deal of pride in it &mdash; that this year as and from the end of June a married couple on disability benefit with no pay-related benefits will receive £57.35.  I accept that this <Col N="505" /> is not a princely sum but over the Border in the area with which Deputy Haughey would have us join, and in the UK, such persons would receive £47.67 as and from next November.  I am poud to say that our rates of benefit are substantially better than those in the UK.  A married couple on sick benefit are at least 20 per cent better off here than in Northern Ireland or the UK enjoying at least £10 extra, devaluation or no devaluation.  A married couple on unemployment benefit are about £8 better off or roughly 15 per cent.  As of next June a pensioner here will receive £45.10 per week while in the UK a single pensioner will get £38 and will be worse off by about 17 per cent or £6.35.  My colleague, Deputy Eileen Desmond, convinced the Cabinet to give a 25 per cent increase last year.  We fought for it in the budget and in so doing lost office and Fianna Fáil had the mere job of implementing it.  In the process they made the Exchequer position unreal because they made no provision for it in the budget which followed.</P>

      <P>: To suggest that our social welfare system is somewhat primitive or inadequate or is about to be dismantled is selling our country short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the policy measures in the Bill.  The document entitled <i>The Way Forward</i> published by the previous Government in October 1982 included a commitment to certain changes in the social welfare system.  Three specific measures included in the document were confirmed by Government decision and I would take the rare privilege of saying that the decision is S19936C/22978 dated 22 October 1982 in relation to the 1983 Estimates.  They were to have effect as and from January 1983 and I have the Government memorandum should Deputy Haughey wish to hear it.  These measures were to reduce the level of pay-related benefit to 30 per cent for the first six months and 20 per cent for the remaining nine months, with an estimated saving in 1983 of £18 million.  Secondly, to remove the present disincentive <Col N="506" /> to work &mdash; their language, not mine &mdash; flat rate unemployment benefit for short-time workers was to be related to a five-day working week and pay-related benefit for those workers was to be withheld, with an estimated saving of £7.2 million in 1983.  For disability benefit purposes the overall benefit ceiling was to be reduced from 100 per cent to 80 per cent of reckonable weekly earnings, with an estimated saving in 1983 of £2 million.</P>
    <P>Apart from these measures which were specifically outlined in the document and were estimated to yield a saving of £27 million in 1983, it appears that further measures were also under consideration. The document states:</P>
    <P>The Government will rectify the anomaly whereby employees through a combination of tax refunds and social welfare benefits can receive more than when they were whole-time at work.</P>
    <P>That was intended for implementation in the budget.  The measures were never spelled out in detail but there was a clear-cut Government decision.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures included in <i>The Way Forward</i> the previous Government in preparing the Estimates for 1983 provided for additional measures to increase income and reduce expenditure. This brings me to the arrant hypocrisy of Deputy Haughey.  Their decision on 22 October 1982 included provision for raising the earnings ceiling for social insurance contributions from £9,500 to £13,000 with effect from April 1983, while the ceiling for pay-related benefit and health eligibility purposes was to be raised from £9,500 to £11,000 in line with wage movements.  The raising of the ceiling from £9,500 to £13,000 was estimated to bring in an extra £16 million from the workers for whom now Deputy Haughey is shedding crocodile tears.  The measures which were incorporated in the Estimates I took over are on record in Government decisions and Deputy Haughey is welcome to a copy of those decisions after the division on this Bill.</P>
    <P>The previous Government also took a decision to disqualify apprentices from children's allowances with effect from July 1983.  They undertook to abolish the <Col N="507" /> maternity grant with effect from April 1983 and there was a consequential Government decision that the savings would be included in the arithmetic of a proposed Fianna Fáil budget in January or February 1983.  These savings were to be included within the budget package. I took a clear-cut decision when I saw this measure.  I did not particularly like those Estimate decisions.  I thought in some respects they were regressive.</P>
    <P>I wanted to examine them and I asked the Cabinet not to implement them from 1 January 1983 but to implement them from at least 5 April 1983 when we would have tax changes and when they should be properly incorporated.  The Cabinet agreed.  The cost was £6.8 million and I had to find that sum of money in the context of further changes in the arrangements. I found it by minimal changes, changes from £32 to £36 on the floor, which brought in £2 million, by extending the waiting period from 12 to 18 days, which brought in about £4 million and in the maternity grant, which was a miscalculation on the part of the previous Government, where we saved another £250,000.  That produced £6.7 million by the delay in implementing the Fianna Fáil decision from 1 January to 1 April 1983.</P>
    <P>That is the reality and no amount of selective going through Cork city areas, be they Gurranabraher or any place like that, can obliterate the reality of the decisions which the Fianna Fáil Party took in this regard.  I have ten minutes and I want to come to my colleague, Deputy Bell, who finds this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: I gather that 7 o'clock is the moment of truth for all of us.  I believe that the adjustments which have been made in relation to pay-related benefit in terms of short-term working are quite legitimate.  I cannot, as a socialist and as a Labour Party member, stand over a situation &mdash; I make no apology for making that statement &mdash; whereby a worker working a three day week has three days earnings, half a week's social <Col N="508" /> welfare, which is tax free, pay-related benefit, which is tax free and a degree of income tax refund, which the worker is entitled to, and as a consequence has a take home pay of 114 per cent replacement of his earnings.  That is not socialism, it is not social welfare, it is an abuse of the system particularly by employees and by some trade unions and employers who have entered into that kind of agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: All I am saying, quite simply, is that the replacement should be, and will be now, about 94 per cent of earnings in that regard.  I regret that my colleague, Deputy Bell, a trade unionist and a fellow member of my union, should have alleged that this Bill in that context or any other context is either evil or savage. It is far too easy to make that kind of allegation and it is unfortunate that it was ill-considered in that regard.  I find it particularly difficult to understand the trenchant opposition which has arisen, particularly in relation to short-time workers.</P>
      <P>I believe the situation is widely understood. I regret a good deal of the misunderstanding particularly among some trade unions.  About 300 trade union circulars have been issued saying that short-time workers include casual dockers, part-time workers, people working for a couple of days at a mart and even people working in a supermarket for a few hours a week.  They are not because, as Deputy Haughey well knows and as every trade union official knows, they are not short-time workers, they are casual workers.  It is workers who are on a systematic five-day week who work a three-day week who come under the category of short-time workers.  I am glad the matter has been cleared up and I am glad in particular that the Congress of Trade Unions have in the consultations with me clarified the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make this point regarding the ICTU.  Since my appointment as Minister for Social Welfare I have had three lengthy, very constructive meetings with the officers of congress on the question <Col N="509" /> of social welfare, on the system as a whole and on the question of health services.  At all times I have found the congress officers extremely constructive and most concerned about developing those services and bringing greater equity within the system of social welfare.  We must ensure the £1,025 million we are spending this year is spread more equitably. I believe that I, earning nearly £30,000 a year, am not entitled to children's allowances for my two youngest children, which I receive and which is tax free.  I want to reform that kind of system. There are many others in the country who would like to see that kind of fundamental reform.</P>
    <P>I have agreed to meet the ICTU to discuss the question of a national pensions plan which I intend to bring in initially by way of a White Paper.  I intend to discuss the question of social insurance for self-employed people; I intend to discuss the implementation of the family income supplement, for which we have a minimum provision of £5 million in this year's budget.  I intend to discuss the difficulties in the appeal system, and the ending of discrimination on a sex basis within the social welfare system which exists and which must be eliminated. Above all, I want to discuss with congress the provision of special assistance for the long-term unemployed.  It is the long-term unemployed, those who are on unemployment assistance of about £50 a week for a husband, wife and two children, for more than 15 months who are our special concern, not those who are fortunate enough to have jobs and who have to forego some bit of pay-related benefit in this regard.  The increase has been minimal in the Bill.  We have been caught in an Exchequer situation whereby the most we could provide this year was an increase of £80,500,000 on social welfare.  I accept that the increases barely keep pace with inflation.  That is the reality and it is about time we faced up to it.</P>
    <P>I intend to go ahead and establish the commission for social welfare.  I intend in the next few weeks to set up this commission. People of outstanding expertise in the social policy area will be appointed <Col N="510" /> to this commission.  For the first time since 1949 we will have a commission to examine and report on our whole system of social welfare and to make recommendations to the Government on the effectiveness of our system.</P>

      <P>: I have no doubt that the commission will succeed in bringing about a much greater effectiveness within our present system, in eliminating poverty in our society and, above all, in examining the method of financing social welfare.  The Workers' Party have put down an amendment which talks about self-financing by workers.  I want to point out to my colleagues that 52 per cent of all pay-related social insurance is paid by employers, 22 per cent is paid by workers and the balance by the general taxpayers. This is the reality in terms of irrelevancy of The Workers' Party amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): Their policies are negative.  Looking at the amendment which they have put down to our motion, one questions which section of the Government is bringing in these measures.  When one considers the policy of the previous Government and our approach to the development of agriculture the contrast is obvious.  The budget introduced by the Minister for Finance has destroyed any prospect of recovery in the agricultural sector.  That Minister was previously Minister for Agriculture in the National Coalition and he was at one time economic adviser to the IFA. The budget has cost Irish farmers in the region of £146 million but the Government have given out only £16 million. There is no doubt that the Minister for Finance has turned his back on Irish farmers and the Minister for Agriculture has not defended them.  The budget has sounded the death knell for Irish agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1982 farmers had a good year and the slide in their incomes was halted with <Col N="515" /> a modest increase in real terms.  This was due to the excellent price negotiated in Brussels by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Lenihan, and the favourable economic conditions created by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Inflation dropped from 23 per cent to 12 per cent, thereby reducing farming costs by £150 million in a full year.  There was a drop of 4¼ per cent in interest rates and this reduced cost to farmers by an amount of £60 million in a full year.  At the time of the general election there were definite signs that the recession in agriculture was on the way out and the prospects for farmers in 1983 were good.</P>
    <P>Disaster struck with the coming to office of the National Coalition.  They have shown a complete lack of interest in farming and this was clearly demonstrated by the omission of the Minister for Agriculture in the economic task force.  What has happened since the beginning of this year has been a recipe for economic disaster for agriculture. Inflation has risen by 4 per cent because of the provisions in the budget and farming costs have risen by £60 million.  Interest rates have increased by 2½ per cent, thereby increasing farming costs by another £35 million.  The 1983 budget has cost Irish farmers a very considerable amount.</P>
    <P>In addition to this there have been the disastrous EEC price proposals and the long delay in implementing this year's price package without a word of protest from our Minister for Agriculture.  The Government have withdrawn their objection to the fact that there are 90,000 tonnes of New Zealand butter in the declining UK market.  No protest was made by our Minister for Agriculture in the EEC negotiations.  The dairy market has been left in a very unsatisfactory situation and Bord Bainne have dropped the price of milk by 1p per gallon to the Irish farmer.  The New Zealand deal with the UK is costing the EEC £80 million per year.  It is destroying our dairy exports.  Meat factories are closing at a rapid rate because of the failure of the Government to deal with the UK variable premium.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> The suspension of the farm modernisation scheme has ended development work on Irish farms.  What the Government have done is contrary to the Treaty of Rome.  By their actions the Government have undermined the confidence of farmers in the future of the industry and this will delay national economic recovery. Under Directive 159 the suspension of the farm modernisation scheme is contrary to the terms of the Treaty of Rome and I understand the Commission have written to the Government asking for reasons why the scheme was suspended. I hope that the scheme will be restored as soon as possible and I should like the Minister to clarify the position when he is replying.  The action of the Minister for Finance in suspending the farm modernisation scheme will put the Minister for Agriculture at a disadvantage when he is negotiating prices, when it will be seen that our Government have not the political will to provide the necessary capital to invest in agriculture.  Because of the action of the Government, the Minister for Agriculture will be at a complete disadvantage when negotiations take place on the price review.</P>
    <P>The Minister has adopted a very lukewarm approach to agriculture and has shown a complete lack of understanding for the farming community.  No budget in the past 20 years devoted so little attention to agriculture which is our primary productive industry with low import requirements and a high export content. We all appreciate the unique and important role of agriculture in our economy. That has been stated over and over again. It needs to be emphasised now because there is so little incentive by the Minister or the Government to improve farming conditions.</P>
    <P>Agriculture affects everyone not only those living on the land.  When it is on an upward trend so is the whole economy. Approximately 40 per cent of the total labour force are employed in agriculture, directly or indirectly.  This sector accounted for 14 per cent of gross national output in 1982.  The figure for Great Britain was 2 per cent and for the EEC as a whole the average was 2 per cent.  Agricultural based products represented <Col N="517" /> one-third of all our exports last year.  Farm exports are four times as beneficial to the economy as industrial exports in terms of the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>This industry, which is the very bed rock of the economy, was safely nursed through the appalling world recession of 1979 and 1980 by a caring Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture and Government. Our concern and attention at that time, coupled with the well known resilience of the farming community, ensured that no permanent damage was done by the adverse provisions that prevailed. At the end of 1982 there were definite signs that farming was emerging from the depths of the recession which had plagued it during the previous three years.  For the first time since 1975 there was a real increase in farming.  The Brussels price settlement won by the Minister for Agriculture in 1982, Deputy Lenihan, contributed materially to that improvement. That price package was the single largest increase we achieved since we joined the EEC in 1973.</P>
    <P>The growth of agriculture is vitally important to the growth of the economy as a whole.  There must be a continuous policy of achieving the highest possible contribution from agriculture to economic growth.  A number of schemes have operated to help farm development and improve efficiency.  We had the land drainage scheme, farm buildings under the farm organisation scheme, the western drainage scheme, the group fodder scheme and the scheme for machinery purchased in the west.  Many of these have now been suspended by the Government. Why are this uncaring Government belittling agriculture?  Why are they prepared to see agriculture reeling back from the stage of development it had reached over the past 20 years?</P>
    <P>Through the years the State accepted the need for investment in the promotion of better farming and the adoption of better farm practices.  Every effort was made to bring home to farmers and farm organisations the need for education, training and participation in advisory work and the need to adopt good farming practices and techniques which have been <Col N="518" /> proved by research.</P>
    <P>Contrast that with what is happening now.  Contributions to agriculture have been decreased, grant aid to farmers has been reduced and there are reductions in the State grant to ACOT.  They were directed to phase out the service provided in relation to poultry keeping, farm home management and the horticultural advisory service.  Expenditure on these services was very small.  They were necessary services particularly for small farmers in isolated areas.  Fine Gael during the last election campaign gave a commitment that these services would be fully restored.  The Fine Gael document and their plan for agriculture makes sorry reading now when one contrasts their proposals for the development of agriculture with the budget which belittles the contributions farmers could make to the development of the economy.</P>
    <P>The agricultural advisory services operated by ACOT, and heretofore operated by the county committees of agriculture, were badly needed for the development of agriculture.  They helped to develop agriculture and encouraged self-reliance among the people of rural Ireland.  After the setback in farming since 1979, the stimulation of self-reliance was never more important than it is today.  The services of the advisory section of ACOT have seen great changes.  In the early days, personnel were thin on the ground but they expanded during the fifties and sixties.  During that period, farmers moved from a subsistence level to a more business-like approach.  Many rural organisations were formed and there was great demand for various services, such as classes and farm visits. They were readily given at all hours of the day and, often, late at night.</P>
    <P>It is important to note how the development of these services has benefited agriculture and farmers down through the years.  During the seventies, the advisory service operated the EEC schemes such as the farm modernisation scheme and the scheme of vocational training in the 100-hour courses.  Unfortunately, in recent years, there has been a tendency to belittle agriculture and, since 1979, agricultural income has not <Col N="519" /> kept pace with inflation or the cost of living.  This has been due to reasons outside farmers' control.  In 1982 farm income per labour unit on full-time farms was only 50 per cent of the wage of the average industrial worker.  There is a great need for farmers' incomes to be readjusted.  To do this the advisory services, as operated under ACOT, have an important role to play.  In the present economic climate, the farmer must be convinced that he will benefit if he succeeds in increasing productivity and improving the quality of his output.  For that reason, the agricultural advisory service is not merely concerned with a technical problem but also with economic and social aspects as well as farm economics for individual farmers.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown, over the past 40 or 50 years, that advisory and agricultural work go hand in hand.  Advisory work must rest on a proper foundation to ensure that farmers understand technical and economic advice given to them, hence the need for class work and the various courses operated throughout the country.  Advisory work has a close link with research.  The relationship between advisers and the Agricultural Institute has always been good and any new information is brought quickly to the farmer.  I emphasise that this advisory service must have the confidence of farmers. This can be brought about by giving the aids and supporting the service which is so necessary in the present economic climate.  Confidence can only be instilled by improving the service of the advisory section of ACOT.  They have a very important role to play in the developing of agriculture, and, ultimately, in improving the economic services.  These services proved their worth in meeting the various challenges which arose over the past few decades.  In the present economic climate it is even more important that these services ensure that agriculture moves again.  When agriculture develops, the whole economy develops.  Therefore, it is regrettable that the grant to ACOT should be cut at a time when advisory services were never needed more, especially since it was emphasised by Fine <Col N="520" /> Gael prior to the election that they would restore the services and would actually increase them.  I leave it to the farmers to judge for themselves the contribution by the Government to the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The potential for a significant and sustained increase in agricultural output, exports and incomes, is very real and agricultural development is the basis for that.  The support of Fianna Fáil for this industry over the years had created that important potential.  Those policies provided the investment needed to build up the infrastructure of agriculture to a level where its full potential could be realised. Fianna Fáil Governments, over the years, gave hope to the people on the land and especially to those employed in our food processing industries and many of the farm input industries, which are now closing down daily.  My colleagues, Deputy Byrne and Deputy Kitt, will emphasise how we have implemented our policies to support and substantiate the food processing and farm input industries.</P>
    <P>The policy of this Government and their attitude to agriculture stand out in striking contrast to our approach to the development of agriculture.  There is widespread depression among farmers today because the withdrawing of the farm modernisation scheme has put a halt to the development of the greatest single productive source of the nation.  In this denial not only to the farmers but to the national coffers of the funds that flow from the EEC under this scheme the approach of the Government is unforgiveable, particularly at this time.  The farmers are outraged at this approach.  I appeal that the Minister for Agriculture, if he has the interests of the farming community and of agriculture at heart, will restore immediately the farm modernisation scheme not alone for its benefit to agriculture but more particularly for its benefit to the country as a whole because of the funds that will flow to the Exchequer from EEC resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): As if this was not enough, further disincentives to increasing output and incomes are being introduced the most penal of which is the imposition of charges on farmers for ACOT and Department of Agriculture services which have always been available to them free of charge.  Contrast that with the Department of the Environment where local government inspectors will come out and examine and inspect houses for house improvement grants or new house grants.  Is there a charge in that case?  No.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): Why must agriculture bear the brunt of these charges?  Why should the farm modernisation scheme bear the brunt of them? I am putting those questions to the Minister for Agriculture and I hope he will answer them in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The withdrawing of £2 million from the national interest subsidy scheme for non-development farmers, the restriction of the scheme to those in severe financial difficulties and also the reduction in the moneys being provided for the disease eradication scheme, not to speak of the impact on inflation of the overall budget strategy, all constitute a savage attack on agriculture which is not really surprising when on takes into account the history or, to be more explicit, the composition of this Government.  A stop-go situation such as we have now is the death knell of farming initiative.  The danger is that these severe blows will be at least as damaging to farming confidence as they will be to farming income.  This Government are two parties cobbled together and they have manifested their weakness and self-contradiction in the disastrous budget introduced by the Minister for Finance who was formerly fearlessly on the farmers' side.  Contrast that with our approach.  We have never had any backtracking or stop-go policies for agriculture. We believed in sound, well-thought-out policy measures in close consultation with the grassroots and we pursued those measures vigorously and <Col N="522" /> steadfastly not alone at home but also in Europe.  We never suppressed any positive proposals from the agricultural sector and we were proud to present our policies to the public in our document <i>The Way Forward</i>.  I suggest that the Minister and his Ministers of State read our policies with regard to the development of agriculture in <i>The Way Forward</i>. A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I take it I have another minute.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): Finally, I ask the Minister what has happened to the working party set up by the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Lenihan, to consider the four-year development for agriculture.  What is to be the outcome of their deliberations?  How soon will their proposals be implemented? Their proposals would mean so much for the development of agriculture and for the whole economy.  Again are we to have the approach of belittling agriculture by this Government who cannot make up their minds as to what their approach to agriculture should be?</P>
      <P>I re-emphasise the importance of the role that agriculture will play.  I put to the Minister that his approach should be positive.  I hope that after this motion which will be put to the House tomorrow the Minister and the Government will see the light of day with regard to agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;supports the measures being taken by the Government within the limits imposed by budgetary constraints, to provide the economic conditions in which the agricultural industry can increase output and farmers' incomes will be raised.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would first of all like to outline very briefly the background against which certain modifications were introduced to the schemes, particularly the farm modernisation <Col N="523" /> scheme, which implemented the EEC structural directives.  The Government, in framing their budgetary policy were faced with an opening Exchequer requirement of some IR£2,232 million, made up of an opening current deficit of IR£1,209 million and a capital borrowing requirement of IR£1,023 million.  Given the magnitude of this figure, particularly in relation to the country's gross national product, the Government's room for manoeuvre in framing their budgetary strategy for 1983 was extremely limited. Since a major reduction in Exchequer borrowing was necessary in order to bring our total borrowing requirement back to a more acceptable level, taxation increases and major cuts in expenditure were unavoidable.  Deputies will be aware that cuts in expenditure were made in both current spending and capital expenditure and, given the size of the gap to be filled, it would be unrealistic to think that spending in agriculture could escape untouched.</P>
    <P>The difference between a politician and a hurler on the ditch is that a politician must face reality whereas a hurler on the ditch is living in a world of fantasy, and that appears to be Deputy Noonan's world.  We must face up to reality, especially in Government.  The figures which I have just quoted tell their own tale.  I would like to point out to Members of the House that our current budget deficit is estimated to be in the region of £850 million and Fianna Fáil's proposed budget deficit as illustrated some months ago would have been in the region of £750 million which would have meant that had they remained in office their budgetary proposals would have been far more austere than ours.  Maybe they would like to tell us what they would have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister has a chance to tell us now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Perhaps they would like to tell us what they would have done considering they would have had £100 million less to spend.  Deputy Byrne has seen what we intend doing.  We have put <Col N="524" /> it down in black and white, we have spelt it out.  There is no problem there.  Nevertheless, I must point out that on the non-capital side the total amount made available for expenditure on agriculture by the Government in 1983 represented an increase over expenditure in 1982.  I should also point out that the reductions in ACOT staff servicing farm home management, poultry advisory and amenity horticulture which were envisaged by the previous administration have been substantially eased and reduced by the Government.  Deputy Noonan made great play of the fact that there was a cutback in advisory services.  Does he know that in the original Fianna Fáil proposals as outlined in their Book of Estimates for 1982 it was proposed to lay off 141 of these instructors and instructresses? We have reduced the number of redundancies in those services to 57.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): None of those was let go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: We have reduced that number to 57.  The Fianna Fáil proposal was for 141.  We are all aware that there is a crisis of morale within our agricultural advisory services.  It is not too easy to define the reasons for this.  It has been represented to me on several occasions that there should be a complete revision of the form of farm advisory services and this is a matter to which I am giving considerable consideration.  It may be that Mr. Mark Clinton's original proposal to amalgamate the agricultural institute, An Foras Talúntais, with the ACOT advisory services would have been the best and most useful remedy as regards our advisory services.  However, when Fianna Fáil took over office in 1977 they disbanded the National Agricultural Council which Mr. Clinton had set up. One of the people who opposed that National Agricultural Council, a very eminent agriculturalist, was Dr. Tom Walsh who recently retired as Director of ACOT.  He admitted that a mistake had been made and that the original national council should have been retained in its entirety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if it is too late to redress <Col N="525" /> that situation, but it is worthy of consideration and I am certainly considering it. We must do something definite to rectify the situation of the crisis in morale within the advisory services.  It is not a happy position and is not doing farming any good.  To rectify the situation might not cost money at all, perhaps it is a matter of reorganisation.  That is something which I shall consider.</P>
    <P>I know where Fianna Fáil would have found the other £100 million.  Deputy Noonan has stated that the budgetary proposal is costing agriculture £146 million. This was not quantified.  I would like to see it quantified.  My estimation would be a tiny fraction of that suggested figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): It will be quantified for the Minister next week. We will leave that matter until next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy Noonan is the person who mentioned it and he did not quantify it.  Previously, Fianna Fáil in order to get money put levies on farm produce or farming commodities, such as the infamous 2 per cent levy introduced several years ago, which had to be abandoned, such was the odium it generated in agricultural circles.  On this occasion we desisted from imposing any such penal levies and have gained the eternal gratitude of the farming community for doing just that.  People knew that cuts had to be made.  They were made in education, in health, in social welfare, in industry and also in agriculture.  Agriculture has fared reasonably well, considering the magnitude of the overall cuts.</P>
      <P>None of us is happy to have to make cuts in our Departments, but I endeavoured to do what I considered was the most palatable thing possible and I will take any blame which may be and which has been apportioned.  I took the decision to cut back on grants on the basis that people who are doing their job reasonably well could get by.  Levies would have been a form of taxation which would not depend on a person's income.  They would not at all be helpful to people who were increasing production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This then was the background to the modification to the structural measures. <Col N="526" /> The basic objective of the changes was to save money.  However, the Government were also mindful of the need to review the operation of the farm modernisation scheme which has been in operation for some eight years and which has been the principal means of channelling aid for farm development.</P>
    <P>Might I say that when schemes are brought in they are not brought in to last for ever.  They are brought in to satisfy a certain need.  We have become used to having schemes which we think will last from here to eternity and that should not be the concept.  A scheme should be brought in for whatever length of time it can prove useful.  On this occasion, we feel that we have derived a lot of productivity from the farm modernisation scheme.  We have suspended a portion of it and a percentage of that portion we intend to bring back in the autumn.  However, the part which we will bring back will be strictly geared to productivity, not just to any activity.  In these eight years, over £230 million has been paid in aid under the scheme, representing a total investment of about £700 million.  Buildings and fixed assets accounted for £165 million in aid, representing an investment of £550 million.  These are very large sums of money and it is appropriate at this stage to look at the operation of the scheme and to ask a number of questions, such as whether we have got the best value for the money spent, or whether better results might not have been obtained in another way and perhaps at somewhat less cost, and whether the capital expenditure made was adequately justified by the current stage of the development of agriculture and by the increases in output achieved.  These are questions which require careful study and the recent changes in the farm modernisation scheme give an opportunity to carry out a fundamental review of the scheme to see if we can come up with some answers to these questions and devise a scheme which will give the best possible value for money.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to refer to some of the points made by Deputy Noonan.  He berates me for not stopping the importation of New Zealand butter. <Col N="527" /> The agreement in the current year is for the importation of 87,000 tonnes of New Zealand butter into Britain.  Why berate me?  Deputy Lenihan, who was then Minister, made that agreement.  When I was on the Opposition benches I suggested to him on numerous occasions that he should not be so generous and that was even before he made the agreement.  He made the agreement that the Deputy is complaining about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): But you are now Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not break agreements, even if they are made by another Government. Our standing, internationally and nationally, would be zero and that is why I said originally that politicians have to deal with reality, not fantasy.  One must stick to an agreement.  We allowed the agreement to go through piecemeal in Brussels until such time as the British and the Germans relented regarding the sale of butter from the EEC third countries. Last week, when they finally accepted our terms, we let the agreement go ahead as had been promised.  I do not think anybody, even the Opposition, would like us to do otherwise.  This year we will be fighting for a new agreement and, hopefully, the terms will be better.</P>
      <P>When the terms of accession were agreed in 1952, Fianna Fáil were in power.  They agreed to allow the importation of butter from New Zealand, the only country which got that concession, and our dairy farmers have paid very dearly for that agreement ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan mentioned the variable premium which has given rise to problems in our meat factories.  He wanted to know why we did not abolish it.  I want to know why Fianna Fáil did not abolish it.  This premium has been in existence for many years.  It will not be a great advantage to Irish farmers if the variable premium is abolished because we get generous concessions on exporting meat and live cattle to Britain.  Deputy Noonan apparently is confused.  What we want is a clawback on the exports of beef from Britain to other countries, including <Col N="528" /> EEC countries and third countries.  At present the British have an unfair advantage on the export markets <i>vis-á-vis</i> their Irish counterparts and many of our meat factories are in trouble.  We are well aware of this and have been fighting most assiduously in Brussels for the past five or six weeks.</P>
    <P>This is one of the few concessions Britain is looking for at the talks going on in Brussels at present, although we are looking for a number of concessions, including a general price increase.  The higher the better.  The British do not want an increase; they want a reduction in prices.  We want a series of special measures but this is the only one they want. We will fight them to the bitter end and will take the matter up at the Council of Ministers and do our best to see equity is restored in the meat export business.</P>
    <P>We have been in Government three months and the people expect us to work wonders.  That variable premium has been there for years and I might ask why did the Fianna Fáil Government not get rid of it.  They had more opportunities than I had.</P>
    <P>One aspect we shall be looking at as regards the farm modernisation scheme is whether there might be something to be gained from aiding farm investment by way of interest subsidies.  Traditionally we have provided farm capital aids as grants.  Most of our European partners adopt the approach of providing the equivalent capital grant in the form of an interest subsidy over 15 or 20 years.  I would like to hear the considered views of the farming organisations and others concerned on the merits of the interest subsidy scheme.</P>
    <P>We now have some experience of interest subsidy schemes in this country as a result of the national and EEC supported 5 per cent interest subsidy schemes and also the reduced interest schemes for farmers in severe financial difficulty, better known as the rescue package.  It appears that these are working fairly well and the experience of them suggests that we should examine critically the possibility of their wider adoption as a substitute for the more traditional system of grant aid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> The Irish and the British are the only two countries which operate grant and subsidy schemes directly aiding farmers. The other EEC countries adopt the interest subsidy method.  It is a bone of contention as to whether we should transfer to that kind of system rather than direct grant aid.  With the interest subsidy it would mean a person would be interested in recouping the money over a number of years, and it would cost the Exchequer less if this were spread over many years and might give us more room to manoeuvre. This is an idea worth investigating. I am not asking only the farming organisations for their comments; if the Opposition have any views I would like to hear them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan alleged that we were being severely censured by the EEC for having suspended portion of the farm modernisation scheme.  I do not know where he got that information.  He may have seen it in a newspaper, but we all know you cannot believe everything you read in a newspaper.  We have heard no objection from the EEC regarding the suspension of portion of the farm modernisation scheme.  In fact, we informed them of what we had done and there was no reaction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like now to turn to details of the modifications to the farm modernisation scheme.  The single most important change was the suspension of aids for investment in farm buildings and fixed assets.  First, let me emphasise that what is at issue here is a temporary cessation of these aids.  We have not determined <Col N="530" /> exactly how long the suspension will last but the intention is that a revised investment scheme would be reintroduced at the earliest possible date, probably in the late autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>: Will it be later than that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: As Deputy Brian Lenihan might say, we would like to introduce it in the very near immediate future, but when we say late autumn we hope to stick to that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is only a hope?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes, it is a hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister giving a definite commitment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I never give a definite commitment in politics because it is a very dangerous thing to do.</P>
      <P>The interval is being used to carry out the review, which I mentioned earlier, of the whole area of farm investment aids with a view to devising measures which will be cost effective and will operate in the most productive and efficient manner. This review is already under way and I shall see to it that it is concluded as quickly as possible so that no delay will take place in bringing in the revised scheme of aids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, as I have said, the suspension applies only to buildings and fixed assets under the farm modernisation scheme.  Investment aids in land improvement will continue under the farm modernisation scheme and also under the western measures, that is the western drainage scheme and the programme for western development.  In addition, aids will continue to be made available under the latter programme for investment in farm buildings by farmers who follow an improvement plan geared towards expanding production of beef and sheep. An interest subsidy will also be available to those farmers who enter a calf-to-beef system.  These aids for western farmers following improvement plans have not received the response they deserve and I would urge any farmer in the western <Col N="531" /> region to check with ACOT if he can avail of this scheme.  I would be concerned that the grants when reviewed fully in respect of those areas that are to be reviewed would apply to the housing of livestock, an area that is in need of much greater investment whereby the production of better quality animals can be assisted.</P>
    <P>In implementing the suspension of building aids, we will honour approvals issued by the farm development service up to 9 February of this year.  It has been suggested to me that we should also make an exception for those farmers who had submitted applications which had not progressed to the stage of having approvals issued.  It is a point of view with which I have some sympathy but the hard facts are that, if we adopted this approach we would not achieve the savings of £10.3 million we wish to achieve as quickly and the suspension of the scheme would be substantially prolonged.  In these circumstances, I feel that it is better to bring back the building aids as soon as possible even if that means that the suspension while it lasts is that much more severe.</P>
    <P>I should like to be able to sanction all those applications that were received before 9 February but to do so would result in the cutbacks not having the desired effect.  To have sanctioned all these applications would have involved an additional cost of £8,500,000.  I should like the people opposite to realise that the situation is not as easy as it is often represented to be by people who did apply.  If this additional £8,500,000 were to be sanctioned, £5,500,000 of it would have to be paid out in the present year. In other words, approximately half the targeted savings would not be effected. I have the greatest sympathy for people who applied prior to 9 February but whose applications have not been approved.  I refer especially to those who had applied some months earlier.  I have asked my Department to investigate the possibility of allowing some of those people to qualify but I am told that if I were to apply the deadline as and from 1 January 1983 we would still have to pay out about £3 million extra in the current <Col N="532" /> year.  However, if any Deputy knows of a case which represents a real neglect on the part of the farm development services, he should bring it to my notice. I would be prepared in such circumstances to consider some exceptional treatment because if the situation is due to neglect on the part of someone along the line, there must be grounds for sympathetic consideration.  Any application that was in in excess of six months but was not approved should be given definite consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: To turn now to the other modifications.  Grant aid for keeping farm accounts has been terminated.  We feel that aid from public funds for this purpose is no longer required to the same degree because farmers are by now well aware of the benefits to good farm management of keeping accounts.  The termination of aids will affect only new entrants to the accounts system.  Commitments to farmers who are already in the system will be honoured in full.</P>
      <P>The system of guidance premiums for development farmers, which has been terminated has not been a great success &mdash; only about 1,000 farmers have availed of it in the past eight years.  Only new entrants to the development category will be affected.  Commitments to existing development farmers will be honoured in full.</P>
      <P>Grants for mobile equipment, which have been terminated, were available only to development farmers.  These grants were of doubtful benefit to most development farmers.  The rate of grant was low, only 10 per cent, and can scarcely have been a significant factor in a farmer's decision to invest in equipment.</P>
      <P>The group fodder scheme has been in operation for six years and has by and large achieved its aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> On the non-capital side we have introduced a system of charges for farm visits by FDS and ACOT staff and we have modified the national interest subsidy scheme.  The charge for farm visits will apply only to visits in connection with the farm modernisation scheme.  There was a lot of confusion about this system when introduced.  Many people thought the charges applied to any visit, even in an advisory capacity, but they apply only in connection with the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>: Six or seven visits per project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: That would be a matter for the farmer but on average we are thinking in terms of two visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>: In other words, get the approval and then drain the land and everything will be all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: It will not apply to normal advisory visits, nor will it apply to visits in connection with the western drainage scheme or the western package.  The rate will be £20 per visit and it will be implemented by way of deduction from capital grants due under the scheme.  The objective is to effect savings in the administration of the scheme.  The charge of £20 does not fully reflect the actual cost involved in a farm visit and taking account of the valuable service which both FDS staff and ACOT personnel give to farmers, it represents value for money.</P>
      <P>On the national interest subsidy scheme, interest rates have declined sharply in the recent past, apart from the fluctuations of recent days, and the need for the scheme is not so great.  Accordingly the Government decided that the subsidy would be limited to one year only.  However, we have recognised that farmers in severe financial difficulty are a special case and we have arranged that those who benefit from the rescue package will be entitled to aid under the national interest subsidy scheme for up to two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These then are the changes we have <Col N="534" /> made in aids for farm development.  I accept that in the short term these changes may be painful but farmers cannot expect to escape from expenditure cuts when all other major sectors have suffered some pruning.  We might spare a thought for the Minister for Education, for instance.  In the longer term, however, it would be my hope that the revised scheme, when introduced, will make better use of the limited resources available and thus make a contribution to the development of agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>: I rise to support the motion calling on the Government to restore the funds recently withdrawn in respect of aids and services for farm development and to lift the suspension of the farm modernisation scheme.  The Government must recognise the role of farming in the economy but so far there is no evidence of any such recognition on their part.  Fine Gael particularly have massive support from the farming community but they fail to realise that agriculture is the backbone of our economy and will continue to be so for a long time to come.  On each occasion on which a Coalition have been in power we have had evidence of a lack of recognition of this fact.  There was a big downturn in agriculture during their term in office from 1973 on, and on the last occasion when they were in Government for only six months they decreased the grants by 5 per cent and showed a general disinterest in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made great play of having been in office for only three months but in that short time he has done a lot of harm to agriculture.  Regarding the amendment that has been put forward by the Government to this motion, I do not know of any measure brought forward by them in the past three months that would help agriculture and neither is there evidence of any such measure in the Minister's speech this evening.  I should be anxious to hear from one of the junior Ministers perhaps as to what those measures are.  Unfortunately, though, we all know that the Government have not taken any measures in this area.  In Wexford we have three Deputies <Col N="535" /> who claim to be farmers.  I have attended public meetings with them before and since the election.  Their attitude is that the proposals now being put forward by the Government are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome this opportunity to seek clarification of the formal statement of the Minister for the reasons for the devaluation of the Irish pound and particularly the effects that will have on the size of our foreign debt, on living standards generally, on the expected rate of inflation which will be aggravated seriously by this decision and, perhaps most important of all, on the future stability of our currency and the general stability of our economy.</P>
      <P>There are a number of basic reasons clarification is necessary.  Within the very recent past the Minister &mdash; I just want to put it on the record, and I am quoting here from an article by John Cooney in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 December 1982 &mdash; after a first meeting of Finance Ministers when, apparently, already this matter was the subject of rumours at a press conference after that meeting clearly indicated that he was opposed to devaluation. This article commenced by saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sizeable drop in Ireland's inflation rate in recent months was used in Brussels yesterday by the Minister for Finance, Mr. Dukes, as an argument <Col N="536" /> against a devaluation of the pound within the European Monetary System.</P>
    <P>The sizeable drop in Ireland's inflation rate over the previous 12 months was the main reason the Minister gave at that time for his opposition to devaluation. He went on to say that he pledged himself to bringing inflation down even further. Finally, according to this report:</P>
    <P>..... he poured cold water over rumours of an imminent realignment of EMS currencies.</P>
    <P>At that press conference the Minister instanced specifically the drop in the inflation rate from 23.3 per cent the previous year to 12.3 per cent as being a very good reason &mdash; with which I would agree &mdash; for avoiding any devaluation at that time.</P>
    <P>Soon afterwards his predecessor, Deputy John Bruton, said in a radio interview in January that this would only fuel inflation.  In fact he said that the benefit from lowering the pound's value would be temporary only &mdash; this was in an RTE interview on 12 January &mdash; and would set in train a wave of inflation.  I suppose both of them could be consistent in making statements of that sort because, in their Joint Programme for Government in June 1981, they said that devaluation of the currency would mean more inflation.  Apparently at least there was agreement then &mdash; I presume agreement that would be confirmed by them now &mdash; that to say the least of it it would have a significant inflationary impact, as has been the experience of any country that has devalued its currency.</P>
    <P>Other reasons have been adduced recently, more particularly by the Taoiseach in his extraordinary comments in Dublin while negotiations were going on in Brussels.  Basically the Taoiseach said that he wanted to restore the relationship that existed with sterling generally during 1981 and 1982, that this was necessary in view of the fact that we had become less competitive as a consequence of the appreciation of our currency against sterling in recent months.  This was significant for two reasons.  First of all, it is quite <Col N="537" /> clear that this devaluation would go no way to restoring that relationship that had existed over that period.  In fact, today our pound is being quoted at over 89p against sterling whereas during the period in question it was of the order of 80 pence to 81 pence.  If that was the reason being adduced by the Taoiseach, self-evidently it was a specious one.  In my view it was specious for a different reason because, apart from the fact that the facts do not bear it out, if we are concerned about the relationship of our currency with sterling then a realignment within the EMS in which Britain does not participate at least as an active as distinct from an associate member &mdash; and they have an extraordinary kind of associate membership &mdash; cannot, of course affect the relationship of our currency with sterling. For that reason I have said in public statements since this news was being mooted and announced prematurely by the Taoiseach last Sunday that there are, of course, grounds for concern about the relationship between our currency and sterling.  The fluctuations, having regard to the level of trade existing between us, can have a distorting effect on that trade and our economy generally.  Mind you, this is something now being recognised not just here but even in Britain, and not just <i>vis-à-vis</i> Ireland but in Britain's role trying to bring about currency stability in Europe generally.  Here I might quote the last paragraph of the leader article in the <i>Times</i> this morning which says:</P>
    <P>Britain's attitude is discouraging. Alternately, proponents of sound money or full employment policies simply see active membership of the EMS as a device to promote or obstruct their domestic policies.  The notion that currency stability might itself be a more vital aid to the economy is scarcely entertained.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that this significant fact is of considerably more concern to us in view of the Taoiseach's statement, and the Minister's also, than the EMS realignment in which we took part recently. These trends were clearly there in December when the Minister made his <Col N="538" /> statement and have been there all the time.  Undoubtedly until such time as we can get full participation of Britain in the EMS then, with Britain floating outside the system, the Minister and everybody else knows there is no way in which we can guarantee the impact of that fluctuation on our currency in so far as it is affected by our trade with Britain.  The by-election in Darlington this week may have an impact one way or the other; we know that as a political reality.  A general election in Britain this year may have an impact one way or the other; we know that also as a political reality.  Apparently the Minister forgot in December that a German election could have an impact, as it in fact did have.  It is political developments of that kind against which one must guard.</P>
    <P>I just want to say for the record here that that being so, this Government, in the light of these rumours and perhaps speculation which was well based, were tardy to say the least in not pursuing this matter, particularly in view of the fact that they knew then that the British Government would be represented &mdash; as they always have been &mdash; at the Finance Ministers' meeting yesterday.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget Statement &mdash; and we might just look at it in the terms of the targets the Minister has set for himself &mdash; set certain priorities.  One of the priorities was to reduce the budget deficit.  In any event that target had been set beforehand.  It is quite clear that the effect of this devaluation will be to increase that deficit by at least £50 million as an immediate consequence of the increased interest we shall have to bear on foreign debt.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his Budget Statement &mdash; I just want to raise this point at this stage because we may see the chickens come home to roost later &mdash; that if there was any question of increased pressure on the Exchequer because of public service pay agreements which were not quantified, the Minister would come back to the House with a supplementary budget.</P>

      <P>: I want an assurance from the Minister that if he finds our deficit is to grow by £40 million or £45 million we will not find any such extra taxation provisions being proposed to maintain the Exchequer provisions as outlined in the budget.  The Minister also told us that he was determined to reduce our foreign debt and that was a considerable element in his budget statement. With the alignments that took place yesterday, and Ireland being the only country that has devalued against all other countries in the EMS there were effective devaluations of about 5.3 per cent against the US dollar, 9 per cent against the Swiss franc, 4.1 per cent against sterling and 4.9 per cent against the Japanese yen. As most of our borrowing, about 93 per cent, is in hard currency from the US, Japan, the Netherlands and other countries, excluding sterling and some other small loans we raised elsewhere, the effect of this devaluation will be an increase on our borrowing of the order of about £366 million to £400 million.  On that basis it seems that the second of the Minister's priorities in his budget has been undermined directly by this action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his budget speech, addressed the country at large about the need for restraint to ensure our competitiveness abroad. Devaluation may benefit us in the short term but in the final analysis our competitiveness will suffer a severe blow because of the extra inflation that will follow from the Minister's action.  The Minister asked workers, and those concerned, to show <Col N="540" /> restraint so as to ensure that we trade profitably and effectively with our partners. Having regard to the fact that the inflation trend in the countries we trade with mostly has been, fortunately for them, decreasing at a regular pattern of decrease while since the Minister took over it has been going the other way here, I do not think that will hold out much for us in terms of competitiveness.  Our workers, apart from the budget provisions, will have to face an increase in the cost of living of about 2 per cent and for that reason the Minister should consider the consistency of his words and actions, or the lack of it.  We must also consider the effect this will have on a community that should expect something from the Minister, those in receipt of social welfare payments.  Those payments were already below what was required for the year and will be at a norm of about 7 to 9 per cent from June-July to April 1984 with inflation running much higher.  We have a fundamental responsibility for those people and this devaluation will hit them.  It will also affect those who look to Government to bring about an order in our society that we could better respect and follow.</P>
    <P>Over a period business people were encouraged to borrow with impunity when we joined the EMS, the EMS having the basic purpose of introducing stability in our system.  What is to be said now of the blow to their confidence in borrowing?  In the short term the advantage may be of considerable benefit but the fact that we will be continuing to buy our oil in dollars will mean that the benefit of falling oil prices &mdash; the Government have a significant advantage in that regard &mdash; will now be taken from the economy.  We must wait to see if the Minister proposes any corrective action to ensure that the clawback to the Exchequer will be maintained at the level he envisaged when he prepared his budget.  I hope we do not see any trend which will mean that Exchequer protection is the Minister's only concern in this.</P>
    <P>The need to strengthen the EMS has been obvious.  One reason was to include Britain and the second was to introduce the ECU as a parallel currency, something <Col N="541" /> that has been under consideration for some time.  Until that is done the EMS will not be an effective system of monetary stability.  I know that that matter might not have been under consideration on the last day but I would press the Minister to ensure, in the interest of the stability with which we are concerned, that it would now be first on the agenda so that we do not have fluctuations of this type.  I should like to ask the Minister, if devaluation was such a panacea, even in the short term, how it was that the French, who seem to have achieved what they set out to do &mdash; perhaps they forced positions on the Minister and others &mdash; and knowing from their experience what devaluation can give rise to in an economy, resisted to the end pressures to devalue further as between themselves and the Germans with whom they have a strong trading relationship.  All the general arguments are against the Minister and I hope that the consequences of the decision we will have to live with, unfortunately, will not be as damaging as I anticipate they will be.</P>

      <P>: I am disappointed, if the House will pardon the use of the word, that Deputy O'Kennedy's remarks on this important topic have been couched so much in terms of reproach, secondhand newspaper comments, allegations and suppositions as to what went on during the meeting over the weekend and that they have had so little bearing on what the real effects, causes and issues are in this case. I will get around to that in a moment.  At first I should like to examine what was done over the weekend and clarify for Deputy O'Kennedy, and on a more general basis, what the objectives were and to what extent we are likely to be able to achieve those objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The realignment of exchange rates in the European Monetary System which was concluded on yesterday had been expected for some time and, in anticipation of it, there was a massive build-up of pressures in European foreign exchange markets in recent weeks.  This gave rise to the adoption by a number of countries of measures to protect their currencies. <Col N="542" /> As Deputy O'Kennedy is aware, the pressures in the Dublin markets were an important factor in the increase in interest rates announced last week.  A realignment of exchange rates in the EMS was essential, therefore, to remove the uncertainties and to ease the pressures in the markets.  This view was widely shared among our EMS partners and the meeting was called by my Federal German colleague in recognition of this fact.</P>
    <P>The discussions over the weekend were more protracted than had been expected, mainly because of the difficulty of settling the change in exchange rates between the Deutschemark and French franc.  For this reason it was necessary effectively to close foreign exchange markets on Monday morning because the meeting had not concluded at that stage.  The markets reopened, however, early in the afternoon following the agreement reached in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The agreed changes in the central rates of the EMS currencies are as follows:</P>

    <P>The Government welcomed the opportunity provided by the realignment to make an adjustment in the exchange rate of the Irish pound.  An adjustment had become desirable because of the rapid rise since late 1982, for reasons outside of our control, in the overall value of our currency.  The appreciation of the Irish pound was not justified by our economic circumstances but arose, rather, from the sharp fall in sterling on the foreign exchange markets.</P>
    <P>Our objective going into this realignment was to secure a correction of the unwarranted appreciation of the exchange rate.  This was agreed without difficulty with our EMS partners.  It has resulted, following the realignment, in an immediate fall of 4 per cent in the Irish pound's exchange rate.  The evolution of the overall value of our currency will, of <Col N="543" /> course, depend on fluctuations within the EMS band and on movements of sterling and the dollar <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EMS currencies.</P>
    <P>I want to underline the fact that the downward adjustment in the central rates of the Irish pound against our EMS partner currencies is a technical one designed, as I have already explained, to correct the unsought appreciation that had occurred.</P>
    <P>In the Government's view it was desirable to avail of the opportunity to get the adjustment we have secured, so as to limit the reduction in competitiveness as a result of exchange rate changes.  Not to have done so would have accentuated the competitiveness problems of Irish goods on the home and export markets, with serious consequences for employment.  I am very surprised that Deputy O'Kennedy made not a single reference to this factor in the course of his remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I was following the precedent in the Minister's budget statement when he did not once mention unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>: I can see that Deputy O'Kennedy wants to be provocative.  I will read him one passage from the budget speech to remind him of a point but I have a feeling I could read it all again because he seems to have forgotten most of it.</P>
      <P>I should stress that the pulling back of the exchange rate to a more realistic level merely alleviates the deterioration in the competitive position of our producers brought about by exchange rate changes outside our control.  It does not solve the fundamental problem of declining competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the Government do not see devaluation as providing any solution to that problem. A lasting improvement in competitiveness can be achieved only through wage moderation as envisaged by the Government, combined with unrelenting attention to all the other cost and non-cost factors &mdash; management efficiency, product design, quality, delivery performance <Col N="544" /> and so on &mdash; that are crucial to the ability of industry to compete and survive.  The exchange rate adjustment that we have now made provides a new opportunity for all concerned to focus more closely on these fundamental determinants of competitiveness with which we must come to grips if we are to stabilise, let alone reduce, the level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The prospective inflation rate for 1983 as a whole should be no higher following the realignment than appeared likely at the beginning of the year.  Because the overall exchange rate had been appreciating steadily since the start of the year our inflation prospects were improving more quickly than earlier expected but, as I mentioned previously, this was at the expense of a deterioration in our competitive position.  For the year as a whole a rise in consumer prices of the order of 12 per cent is still likely on the basis of present exchange rates.  The beneficial effects on our inflation of sterling's depreciation since late last year will continue to work their way through the economy for some months ahead.  In addition, the beneficial impact of the change in our effective exchange rate on our competitive capacity will begin immediately.  On the other hand, the effect on our inflation of increases in import prices will not begin to take effect until later in the year, against a background of a deceleration in the underlying rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Taking all these factors together, the likely effect of the adjustment on our inflation rate for the year as a whole is likely to be very small, if noticeable at all, in direct contradiction of the Deputy's claimed figure of something like 2 per cent, for which he has not given any basis or explanation as to how he would calculate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have just said what the factors are.  If the Deputy wishes to have a longer discussion this can take place on another occasion but it will be on the basis of an analysis of the effects of <Col N="545" /> exchange rate changes on inflation and prices generally, not on the basis of figures plucked out of the air.</P>

      <P>: The fall of about 4 per cent in the market value of the Irish pound that has taken place following the realignment will increase debt service costs for public sector borrowing abroad.  In the case of the Exchequer the realignment will add approximately £17 million, not £50 million, to the cost of interest payments on foreign debt in the current year but the increase will be offset in part at least if the interest-rate reduction announced last week in Germany is followed in other centres.  The Exchequer foreign debt expressed in Irish pound terms, will increase by about 5 per cent. The Government are determined that any increase in debt servicing costs this year will not be allowed to affect the overall budgetary arithmetic and it will closely monitor the trends in the public finances as a whole with a view to taking any necessary action to achieve the budget targets.</P>
      <P>As a result of the exchange rate changes, there are monetary implications for the Common Agricultural Policy.  As the Dáil is aware, these matters were not dealt with over the weekend but will be on the agenda for the next meeting of the EEC Council of Agricultural Ministers. The effects in that area are potentially positive in terms of returns to agriculture and the food processing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to keep the adjustment that we have made in perspective.  Periodic realignments have been a feature of the EMS.  We are participants in the exchange rate system and we must decide <Col N="546" /> in each realignment what stance is in our best interests.  The stance adopted on this occasion is basically little different from the one followed in previous similar realignments.  In each previous realignment more distance was put between our central rate and that of the DM.  On this occasion due to the depreciation in sterling since the latter part of last year there has been a new factor outside the terms of the EMS but one which was capable of influence by our action within the realignment.  We have moved to deal with that in a positive manner which will be of benefit to our economy.  To have failed to do so would have been to put our productive and exporting sectors in a progressively more difficult situation.</P>
    <P>Had we followed a middle course in this realignment as on previous occasions, the central rate of the Deutschemark would have been revalued by 5½ per cent against the Irish pound.  The only difference on this occasion from the middle course is that, in an effort to deal with the distortion caused by the weakening of sterling, we have taken an initiative to make some downward adjustment in our own bilateral central rates against the other EMS currencies.  Given the importance of sterling in our trade we can hardly ignore its movements.  This is the very point made by the Deputy but he seemed to be determined to ignore it in the rest of his statements.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be much more satisfactory from our point of view if sterling participated in the exchange rate system but this is essentially a matter for the UK.  Member countries, including Ireland, have made clear that they would welcome participation by the UK. Deputy O'Kennedy knows as well as I do that the matter is not as simple as that.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the realignment would help to stabilise both the foreign exchange markets and the money markets. This in turn should facilitate international efforts to lower interest rates. Our own Central Bank have already stated publicly that they expect to see a lower trend in interest rates this year and the recent increase in Associated Bank interest rates was, as I have said, an unavoidable reaction to exchange rate <Col N="547" /> pressures.  The Central Bank will closely monitor the markets in order to exploit any opportunity that emerges to bring down interest rates.</P>
    <P>I should like to take up a couple of points made by Deputy O'Kennedy.  He ventured the opinion that a fall in oil prices will be taken back from this economy.  In simple arithmetic, the Deputy must know, if he reflects for a moment, that that is not necessarily the case.  A reduction from $35 a barrel to $29 a barrel in my arithmetic is a reduction of about 16 per cent in prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>: If we have a charge of 4 per cent, as we have so far, in our effective rate against the dollar, it still leaves a large margin for the effect of reductions in dollar denominated prices to work their way back into our economy.  I say &ldquo;into our economy&rdquo; because I have made no secret of our approach to oil prices.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy meant when he said we should take care to guard against political developments. There is no exchange rate system in the world, there never has been any exchange rate system that can guard against political developments.  I will make the point that the very fact that we use these realignments in order to bring about the kind of results I have been making represents a proper approach to guarding not against political developments but to steer the kind of course which we can most profitably steer through the very difficult circumstances of world money and exchange markets today.</P>
      <P>I hope that will clarify the situation for the Deputy.  I hope, in the interests of all of us who are most directly concerned with making this work, those who are now producing commodities, that the Deputy will actually address himself to the issues rather than make the kind of statements he has concentrated on this evening.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>: Tá mé buíoch gur thug tú deis dom labhairt ar an ghné tábhachtach seo.  For the past half hour we have heard a discussion on what no doubt is a very important matter.  I venture to suggest that what appears on the Adjournment is no less important.  I hope that in presenting my thoughts I will get a response from the spokesman on sport and physical education which might be different from what the last speaker on this side received in respect of what he presented, from the other side of the House.</P>
      <P>I ask you to bear with me while I discuss the word &ldquo;education&rdquo;.  For centuries there has been a concept of what we call education.  I must admit, as one who could aspire to the title of educationist, that for many years I have been putting a very big question mark behind what is our approach to education.  I have serious doubts about all the academic qualified people who presume to speak to me in connection with education.  I see in relation to the vast sums we provide for education nothing more than the replacement of the old capital system where we encourage young and older people to pursue a certain study at the cost of the taxpayer and at the end those students embark on a life which is insular, secular and has very little regard for those who made it possible for them.</P>
      <P>There is no longer the approach to education we had in the past when we talked of real education, education for education's sake, which we were prepared to share with our neighbours in the hope they might be improved by it.  The new concept is: you get it at the expense of your neighbour and, having got it, you make your neighbour pay dearly for it. That aspect of education refers to the healthy mind concept that we talked about but which I believe has been abused very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> The concept I want to talk about on the Adjournment refers to the healthy body.  I see there an acceptance of the concept which in this country is as idealistic as it was centuries ago because we have people who are prepared to apply themselves to this very serious aspect of education without any payment, to give their time and efforts so that their neighbours may be better.  That aspect of education does not get importance in the word given to it because we use the simple word &ldquo;sport&rdquo;.  There is no high-falutin' term, no honours degrees, no PhD, no plaque outside your office entitling you to charge, but it is nevertheless as beneficial and as necessary to man in the age of technology as the mental pursuits in which he engages for his own enlightenment and education so that he may charge dearly for them.</P>
    <P>In this country we still retain the voluntary type of approach.  Unlike Russia, Italy, Germany and France, we have not any paid full-time athletes.  We have very few paid full-time administrators.  We have people prepared to do this for the sake of its art.  We have in sport something akin to the higher branch of physical education.  For many decades we have at four years intervals the great competition of the Olympic Games, dating back to ancient Greece when such pursuits were more common than the sports at four yearly intervals we have now.</P>
    <P>Every nation sends its representatives to that international competition.  You know as well as I the interest and excitement engendered when we see an Eamon Coughlan or a Ronnie Delaney, whom some of us remember seeing in 1956.  This applies to any athlete, whether he be in the boxing ring or in a field event &mdash; he is there representing us.</P>
    <P>While he is participating we are all very happy to be associated with him, and if by any chance he is victorious we would all claim association with him and indeed be so presumptuous as to think we were party to his success.  If, as happens more often than not in respect of our Olympic athletes, they do not figure in the finals, we are critical and say they should not have been sent.  We ask why did they go. We say they let us down and we ask had <Col N="550" /> we not better to represent us.  I suppose that is a fair enough reaction of disappointment, however unreasonable.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned about in respect of those young men and women who will carry the responsibility of representing Ireland in next year's Olympics is that even at this late stage we, whose responsibility they are, will be prepared to cooperate with the many volunteers and voluntary agencies who in spite of adversity and the lack of encouragement that exists, are still soldiering on so that we may have a team in the Olympics next year.</P>
    <P>I will return to education, and the cost. In the Estimates which we have before us these days there is a total provision of £900 million for education.  I have looked at the Estimates and I see that the amount that will go to what I regard as an equal and vitally important part of education &mdash; physical education &mdash; will be a mere £600,000.  That is to cater for all the voluntary dedicated people who look after all our athletes.  They are to get among them £600,000 from a budget of £900 million for the unselfish and magnificent work they are doing so that the image of the Irish athlete may be maintained, so that the image of the Irish scholar in physical education may be maintained.</P>
    <P>In all the years when I had responsibility for sport I boasted that I never once introduced party politics into consideration. Now I am saddened to have to do so.  In respect of the inadequate sum which my Government had provided for those sporting organisations in 1983 there has been a reduction by this Government of 11 per cent.  How in the name of heaven can we hope that the people will believe us when we say we have an interest in the physical well being of our young people at a time when it can be argued that the employment of their spare time is more important than ever before?</P>
    <P>People may say to me that it is characteristic of this side of the House to appear to have available all the money in the world when in Opposition but when in Government not to have it in the same supply.  I must express happiness in defending the position that existed when I had the responsibility which Minister of <Col N="551" /> State Creed now enjoys.  In 1979 on the eve of the last Olympics I said to my Government what I am saying here tonight.  I told them I would not take the responsibility of asking young men and women to represent Ireland unless we made some attempt towards preparing them so that they might acquit themselves better than had been the position heretofore.  My Government made available to me the money to allow for a 50 per cent increase to the Irish Olympic Council.  It allowed me to provide for weekend training; it allowed me to establish in Ballinteer and in Thomond College an opportunity for our boxers and athletes to come together, to socialise, to get some guidance in the matter of diet, to get some help to prepare them to have the necessary stamina, durability and expertise to compete so that they would do justice to themselves and the country.</P>
    <P>They may not have done as well as we had hoped but at least I was happy in my mind that their preparation was an improvement on what existed before that.  It should be remembered that those were better times economically than exist now.  We had some excellent companies like Cement Roadstone and other commercial firms who were prepared to assist.  In the present climate I do not think such assistance will be forthcoming. Therefore, the responsibility will be on Deputy Creed, as Minister of State, to provide the money.  It is no use doing it in a month or two months time.  It must be done immediately, and even at that it will be too late.</P>
    <P>I was in Moscow after the last Olympic Games.  Within a month I saw their athletes being selected for the Los Angeles Olympics.  The following year I was in Italy to visit sporting centres and they also had already selected their athletes for Los Angeles.  We have not selected our athletes yet and we have a Government hoping that out of £600,000 for all of the sporting organisations provision can also be made for the IOC.  I would hope too that as far as the special olympics for the handicapped are concerned there would be some generosity.  However, <Col N="552" /> I know that I am permitted to refer to next year's Olympic Games only. I appeal to the Minister of State to ask his Minister to go to the Government and tell them that it must be possible to make a few hundred thousand pounds available for the Irish Olympic Council. Surely it is not outside the imagination or the capacity of his senior civil servants to extract that amount from the £900 million made available to that Department.</P>
    <P>Here I would give the Minister of State a blank cheque.  Having looked at all the Estimates I will say I do not mind from which subhead he takes it &mdash; I should like to see him taking it from higher education, because I am advocating on behalf of a branch of education which is as vital as exists in the rooms of Trinity or UCD or UCG or any other university in Ireland, or any third level college.  I know the Minister of State cannot operate on licence from somebody on this side, and maybe it would be poor companionship for him, but I am saying in his presence that as far as I am concerned he should take a few hundred thousand out of the total amount of money provided for third level education and give it to the IOC and I will support him, whether it is for Brigid Corrigan, the high jumper, Eamon Coghlan, who is blessed in so far as he is not dependent on us, Taylor or Treacy.</P>
    <P>I hope, too, boxers and others who will be going to Los Angeles will have an opportunity to prepare themselves properly. When we are looking at our television sets in 1984, DV, I hope we will not be asking ourselves and our neighbours: &ldquo;Why was such an athlete sent?&rdquo; but rather saying: &ldquo;During the year before the Olympic Games we were happy with the Government who assigned a certain amount of money for them to prepare themselves and if they were not good enough, then so be it.  It was not our fault.  We were mindful of the responsibility they carried and we helped in their preparations.&rdquo;</P>

I took it that the question on the Adjournment tonight dealt with Ireland's participation in the Olympic Games.  Education covers a very broad area, but I will be replying to the points raised in the context of the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>The Olympic Games, which are held every four years, achieve a communication between the nations of the world which represent a vast range of differing political, social, cultural and economic attitudes.  They are also the most important demonstration of sports performance in the world, in which top-class athletes are united in competition.  It must be remembered however, that the games are not an end in themselves &mdash; rather they are seen by the Olympic movement as a means of stimulating a broad programme of physical education and competitive sport for all youth.  For every athlete who is selected to take part in the games there are thousands who train for the very same honour.</P>
      <P>The aims of the Olympic Games are not to offer participants the opportunity to win gold medals but rather to draw the world's attention to the fact that physical training and competitive sport not only develop the health and strength of young people but also exert a highly desirable and beneficial influence on their personality. It is important to remember this point if we are not to detract from the gallant efforts of the countless young people who dedicate themselves to rigorous preparation and training of mind and body in pursuit of excellence, and in the urge to be recognised as the best.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind, however, that the Olympic Games are for individuals, the attention and prestige attributed to high achievement cannot fail to be a source of national pride to the country of the participant, and medals at the Olympic Games are the ultimate achievement for the dedicated sportsman or sportswoman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland the responsibility for the development of the Olympic Movement and for ensuring the representation of Irish athletes at the Olympic Games is allocated to the Olympic Council of <Col N="554" /> Ireland by the International Olympic Committee.  Since 1924 the Olympic Council of Ireland have discharged this duty with dedication and efficiency, coupled with wisdom and integrity in their approach to the many complex problems and undesirable developments which have occurred in sport over the years and which have tended to tarnish the high-minded ideals of the Olympic philosophy.</P>
    <P>Apart from ensuring the representation of Irish athletes at the Olympic Games the role of the Olympic Council is to assist the sports organisations to identify talent of Olympic potential and to assist in the development of this talent in the field of coaching, competition and assessment of progress.</P>
    <P>We have already a small group of highly talented athletes whose potential for high achievement, given the right preparation, training and back-up services, is in no doubt.  One need only recall the recent new world record for the indoor mile achieved by Eamon Coghlan and the fact that Ray Flynn came second in that marvellous race; John Treacy of whom we have consistently high expectations; Carey May, whose achievement in winning the Osaka Women's Marathon earlier this year in two hours 29 minutes and 23 seconds places her seventh in the ranking of women marathon runners; our boxers and yachtsmen who brought honour to themselves and to their country in winning medals at the 1980 Olympic Games; and Hazel Greene who has attained world class standard in target archery.</P>
    <P>These are but examples of people whose talents we applaud, whose dedication we admire, and in whom we place our hopes for success in the international field, and in particular at the Olympic Games.  For success at the Olympic Games not only brings prestige to a country, but also serves as a source of national pride which reaps beneficial results throughout society and has repercussions far beyond the radius of the winner's immediate environment.  The impact of victory has an invigorating effect, not alone on our own self-pride and esteem but on our standing abroad.  The winner <Col N="555" /> also serves as a model for our young people and brings home the value of the basic principles of the Olympic movement as a motivation instrument, as I have already outlined.</P>
    <P>Success is not easily won, however. Otherwise it would not merit the respect and exhaltation which surround it. It will be noted that the majority of the athletes whom I mentioned as examples of the talent which there is in this country, have received their athletic training in the United States or in Britain.  They have had opportunities which are not available to the majority of young people in this country and it can be reasonably assumed that, given the right conditions, there is a wealth of athletic talent waiting to be nurtured and developed.  The right conditions to which I refer embrace the whole spectrum of sport in our society, ranging from the provision of facilities from club through national level, the existence of proper coaching structures, the availability of top-class coaches, the right approach to training and competition, attention to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of sports injuries, and so on.</P>
    <P>In early 1982, the Olympic Council of Ireland submitted a development plan for Olympic sport to the then Minister of State with responsibility for sport.  This development plan was subsequently examined in depth by COSPOIR, the National Sports Council and a report of COSPOIR's findings has been submitted to me.  It is clear from the report which I have received that progress towards high achievement at the Olympic Games requires the adoption of measures which in the first place will enable athletes of potential to be identified, and secondly, will provide those athletes with the necessary back-up services in regard to coaching, training facilities, international competition, medical surveillance, nutrition and diet, and so on, which in the long-term will enable them to compete in the Olympic Games on equal terms with competitors from other countries.</P>
    <P>In its report to me, COSPOIR has identified short-term and long-term measures which are required to give our <Col N="556" /> athletes an equal chance on the international sports scene.  In the short term, the 1984 Olympic Games are the target, and it is my intention to provide all possible assistance and support for athletes who are now being prepared as potential competitors for those games within the limitations imposed by the current budgetary situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney referred to my belated approach to the important question of the Olympic Games, and the importance of giving grant aids or support to the Olympic Council of Ireland.  Deputy Tunney occupied my position a few years ago.  I am sure he had regular contacts with sporting organisations.  I had a long and very fruitful meeting with the officers of this council.  It was a most interesting discussion.  I have given them the date on which I will communicate with them and give them a decision on what the allocation will be for this year, this preparatory year which is the important year in relation to the Olympic Games.  They are quite satisfied with the date I have given them.  They thanked me for it.</P>
    <P>At present it is difficult to give as much as one would like to give, and to give an amount which would justify our performance and enable our athletes to do the preparatory work necessary to compete in the Olympic Games.  Certain constraints were mentioned by the Deputy. Deputy Tunney said I could take the money from any vote covered by the £900 million allocated to education this year. On the Estimate for the Department of Education I have had to answer to the Opposition on two occasions for suggested cuts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy said he was not being political.  There are some points on which I disagree with him and I disagree with that particularly.  The Deputy said that when he was Minister of State with responsibility for sport he got an increase of 50 per cent but it is very easy to get that increase when one is talking about a low base.  I hope to be in a position <Col N="557" /> to have a decision very shortly and I will communicate with the Olympic Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy spoke about the allocation of £619,000 for sport this year.  I should like to inform him that the youth and sports grants to the VECs will be approximately £700,000 this year.  In the short time I have been in the Department I have met more sporting organisations than anyone else.  I have not turned my back on sport.  I realise its importance <Col N="558" /> and I acknowledge the valuable work being done by the Olympic Council.  They have an enormous task ahead of them and I hope to be in a position to give them a decision in the very near future.</P>

      <P>A grant under the Department's former scheme of house improvement grants was approved on 8 December 1979 for the person named.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The general question of replacing traffic lights with a roundabout where land is available at a major traffic intersection within a 30 mile speed limit is dependent on several factors, including vehicular traffic flows, numbers of turning movements and the extent of passenger traffic.</P>
      <P>Decisions regarding the provision of roundabouts at Moneenageesha and Cemetery Cross roads are matters, in the first instance, for Galway Corporation as road authority.  Proposals in this regard have not yet been received in my Department. I understand, however, that proposals are being developed at local level to provide roundabouts at those junctions. The proposals have been the subject of consultations between my Department's engineering advisers and local authority officials.</P>

For those who cannot appropriately be housed, places on serviced sites should be made available.</P>
      <P>Capital is allocated for every approved proposal of a local authority for special accommodation schemes and for serviced sites; 100 per cent subsidy on annual loan charges is also made available.  Accommodation provided under the regular housing programme is financed in the normal way under that programme.  I have asked each manager to give me detailed information as to the extent of their need for capital for special accommodation up to 31 December next. Adequate funding is available to support the programme.</P>
      <P>Recently I wrote to each city and county manager asking for intensification of effort in providing accommodation, particularly in those areas where progress has been slow.  Full implementation by local authorities of their responsibilities would result in much more progress being made in providing suitable accommodation for families living on the roadside.</P>
      <P>The Travelling People Review Group, which was set up in January 1981 to review current policies and programmes, recently concluded its meetings and its report is expected shortly.  Their recommendations will receive my close attention as regards the future of the settlement programme.</P>

A very rough estimate of the amount of staff time involved in compiling the information is something of the order of 60-70 working days.  The diversion of staff to compile the information would add significantly to the time taken for processing payment of claims for redundancy lump sums and rebates.

He subsequently received a lump sum payment for the same injury, in settlement of a civil claim.  The Army Pensions Acts provide that where compensation is received after the award of any such pension, the award may be reviewed and, having regard to the amount of such compensation, the pension may be either terminated or reduced.  As the annual value of the compensation in this case, assessed on an actuarial basis, exceeded the appropriate rate of pension under the Army Pension Acts, payment of pension has been withheld.  The question of resumption of payment will be considered if and when the annual rate of pension, appropriate to the degree of disablement, exceeds the annual value of the compensation awarded.</P>

      <P>A survey last year indicated that there were approximately 620 retained as at 1 July 1982.  As Departments have delegated authority within specified guidelines to retain officers it would be necessary to circularise all Departments to ascertain the current position.  The number retained has been declining, however, with the adoption of more stringent standards for retention and it is estimated that currently the number would be of the order of 500.</P>

      <P>: I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a cheque for £596.54, in settlement of a claim to repayment of tax deducted on arrears of superannuation contributions, was issued to the taxpayer on 28 May 1982.  It has now come to light that that cheque does not appear to have reached him and arrangements are being made to enable a duplicate cheque to be issued to the taxpayer as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxpayer ceased employment on 27 November 1981 and lodged a claim to <Col N="396" /> repayment of tax on 15 January 1982. The inspector of taxes wrote to the taxpayer for certain details of other income which were necessary to enable his tax position to be brought up to date.  The full details required were not supplied initially by the taxpayer and further correspondence was necessary before the inspector was in a position, in November 1982 to review the liabilities for 1980-81 and 1981-82.</P>
    <P>The reviews revealed an underpayment of £43.86 for 1980-81 and an over-payment of £10.61 for 1981-82.  This leaves a net underpayment of £33.25, which will be collected by reducing the individual's tax-free allowances for 1983-84.</P>

The scheme provides for the demolition of the old Garda station.  The Commissioners of Public Works have been advised that the building, which is not structurally sound, could not be adapted to meet the Department's requirements.  It is the intention that the archway and wall of the old monastery adjoining the building will be preserved.</P>

As this card was issued in October 1982 it would now be due for review and a review form has been issued to the card holder for completion.  Unless a significant improvement has occurred in this card holder's circumstances, leading to his income exceeding the guidelines for determining eligibility, the health board anticipate that the medical card will be retained in this case.</P>

      <P>: The social welfare officer who investigated the old age pension claim of the person concerned recommended payment at the weekly rate of £4.45 plus £2.70 living alone allowance with effect from 25 October 1982.  This was the rate of pension appropriate to his assessment of her means, consisting of income from the letting of a holding.  Pension books were issued on 1 October 1982 covering payment at this rate on a provisional basis pending the local pension committee's decision on her claim.</P>
      <P>The committee, however, awarded her a weekly pension of £24.45 plus £2.70 living alone allowance and the social welfare officer appealed against the committee's decision.</P>
      <P>The appeals officer, having regard to all the evidence available including a submission made by the person concerned as to expenses incurred in letting her holding, determined that she is entitled to a weekly pension of £6.45 plus £2.70 living alone allowance from 25 October 1982. An additional pension book covering payment of the extra pension due as a result of that decision was issued to her on 7 December 1982.

      <P>: The person concerned has been paid disability benefit from 21 October 1981 to 26 March 1983.  However, his claim was due for review on 3 January 1983 to establish if he had a continuing title to benefit from that date.  Unfortunately his case was not reviewed until 14 February 1983 when it was discovered that he had a total of only 37 credited contributions in 1981-82, the contribution year governing his claim from 3 January 1983.  Accordingly he was entitled to disability benefit at the reduced <Col N="432" /> rate of £49.80 for a married couple from 3 January to 14 February 1983 but was paid at the maximum rate of £52.15 for this period resulting in an overpayment of £14.10.  Arrangements have been made to recover this over-payment by weekly deductions of £2 per week from his current claim with effect from 28 March 1983.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities report that they consider that the area in question is receiving as much Garda attention as practicable at present from both foot and mobile patrols.  They also report that the high incidence of burglaries in the area has been receiving special attention from the Detective Branch personnel and that this has resulted in a significant improvement in the detection rate in respect of such crimes.  They state that the area will continue to receive as much attention as possible and that every effort is being made to deploy the available Garda resources to best advantage in dealing with the crime situation there.</P>
